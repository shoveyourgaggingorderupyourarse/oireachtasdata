I am joined today by Mr. Peadar &Oacute; Scanaill, president of the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  We welcome the opportunity to appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for the second time, to discuss the important issue of corporate ownership of veterinary practices.  We look forward to continuing this discussion on an area of great relevance and importance to the veterinary sector.</p> <p>  The Veterinary Council of Ireland is the statutory body responsible for the regulation and management of the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing.  The principal function of the veterinary council is to regulate the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in the Republic of Ireland, in the interest of animal health and welfare and in the interest of veterinary public health.  The functions of the veterinary council include protection of the public through the supervision of veterinary education, the maintenance of the register of veterinary practitioners and nurses, the registration of veterinary premises, and through disciplinary action in cases of professional misconduct.  In order to legally practice veterinary medicine in the Republic of Ireland, a veterinary practitioner or veterinary nurse must be registered with the council.  The practitioner or nurse must also carry out the practice of veterinary medicine at and from a premises registered with the veterinary council.  There are currently 2,933 veterinary practitioners and 966 veterinary nurses registered with the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  We also have 752 veterinary premises registered under the council&rsquo;s statutory premises accreditation scheme, at and from which veterinary services are provided to the public.  These include veterinary clinics, veterinary practices and veterinary hospitals.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the topic of corporate ownership of veterinary practices is a challenging one and has been the subject of much debate.  Further to our appearance before the committee in May of this year, the veterinary council has since clarified the position with regards to ownership and the provision of veterinary services to the public, having benefited from a period of extensive consultation on the matter.  It remains the role and remit of the council to continue to ensure the highest standards of veterinary medicine in the regulation and management of the professions.</p> <p>  I will briefly recap the history and experience of the veterinary council as it relates to this issue.  Historically, section 54(2) of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 was interpreted to prevent a body corporate from owning a veterinary practice, and this understanding was reflected in the veterinary council&rsquo;s code of professional conduct.  However, legal advice received by the veterinary council advised that the legislation does not speak to the ownership of practices, and thus the council has no legal authority in determining such issues.  The parameters of our powers as established under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 involve the regulation of veterinary services to the public and the practice of veterinary medicine within that service.  They do not extend to the area of ownership of practices.  In light of this, the veterinary council initially amended its code of professional conduct in December 2017, explicitly stating that there was no prohibition on a non-registered person or body corporate owning a veterinary practice, provided that the practice of veterinary medicine was carried out by a veterinary professional registered with the council.  This amendment was then put on hold in January 2018 to allow for a period of comprehensive consultation with the public, stakeholders and members of the veterinary professions.  The results of this consultation have been compiled in a report by Grant Thornton offering an analysis of the VCI consultation on corporate ownership of veterinary practices, which was shared with members of this committee along with the clerk of the committee in July of this year.</p> <p>  The council commenced the public consultation in early 2018 which concluded in summer of this year, culminating in the report by Grant Thornton.  The consultations conducted, which are reflected in the report, included a survey of the general public conducted by market research company Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes; a consultation process whereby any interested parties could submit their views; a survey of the veterinary professions conducted by market research company Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes; research and analysis of other veterinary regulators internationally; and research and analysis of other regulated professions in Ireland.  The veterinary council has also benefited from legal advice on the matter and all of these inputs, together with the results of a consultation process and survey of the public, have been consolidated into this report.  Overall, the responses to the introduction of corporate ownership of veterinary practices in Ireland were divided.  Some were opposed, while some were in favour of the idea.  Industry perspectives on corporate ownership can sway dependent on the circumstance.</p> <p>  Analysis of other professions in Ireland, in addition to veterinary professions in other jurisdictions is also reflected in the report.  Consultations were held with different jurisdictions globally to understand the issue of corporate ownership.  It was apparent from the consultations that corporate ownership is prevalent internationally, but how it is regulated varies across the jurisdictions.  The majority of other professions examined allow corporate ownership to exist with the exception of the legal profession.  The council sought independent legal advice on the issue of corporate ownership with regards to the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.  This advice highlighted that the governing legislation does not provide for a role for the veterinary council in the ownership of veterinary practices.  The council&rsquo;s role lies in the regulation of the practice of veterinary medicine in the public interest.  Our focus therefore is on the regulation of veterinary services to the public, the licensing of the veterinary premises and the registrants who provide that service, at and from those premises.</p> <p>  Following the period of consultation with stakeholders, the Veterinary Council of Ireland updated its code of professional conduct in respect of the matter of the provision of veterinary services to the public and the ownership of veterinary practices.  The council provides guidance to veterinary registrants on matters relating to conduct and ethics through their code of professional conduct for registered veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses.  The code of professional conduct consists of the rules and principles which govern veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses in the exercise of their profession.</p><p>The Veterinary Council also regulates and licenses veterinary premises at and from which veterinary services to the public are provided.  Registrants are bound by the code and the regulations relating to the veterinary premises where the practice of veterinary medicine occurs.</p><p> The council continues, as always, to use its statutory powers to ensure the highest standards of clinical governance are employed in veterinary medicine within the State.  Those standards are to be found in the council's code of professional conduct and the regulations which underpin certificates of suitability.  A certificate of suitability is the licence issued by the council to persons registered with it who wish to provide veterinary services at and from the premises to which the certificate relates.  A certificate of suitability for the veterinary premises is required before any veterinary service to the public may begin from that premises, and the certificate is renewed on a four-year-cycle.  Only individuals registered with the council may apply for and be granted a certificate to provide veterinary services to the public at and from a veterinary premises.  For example, a veterinary practitioner cannot provide veterinary services from a premises without such a certificate in place.</p><p> The regulations relating to that certificate are one of the means by which the council regulates veterinary services to the public.  The certificate of suitability for veterinary services involving the practice of veterinary medicine may only be held in the name of a registered person.  The code of professional conduct is another means by which the Veterinary Council regulates the practice of veterinary medicine and nursing in the State.  The code of professional conduct and the council regulations underpin veterinary services to the public.  The Veterinary Council issues the code and regulations, and determines the issuing of the certificates required to enable veterinary services to be delivered at and from a veterinary premises.</p><p> The update by the council to the code on 11 July 2019 reaffirms that veterinary services to the public, the performance of which forms part of the practice of veterinary medicine, must at all times be provided by the veterinary practitioners who usually practice veterinary medicine at and from the registered veterinary premises.  The clinical discretion of the veterinary practitioner is paramount, acting at all times in the interest of animal health, welfare and public health.  This decision brings clarity to the matter.</p><p> The council's words updating the code clearly state that the veterinary practitioner provides the veterinary medicine service to the public at and from a premises, certified and licensed by the council.  The code of professional conduct and the regulations relating to the veterinary premises are the means by which the Veterinary Council regulates that service in the public interest.  Ownership bears no influence on the provision of veterinary services.</p><p> The Veterinary Council's updating of the code of conduct of veterinary practitioners clarifies that only veterinary practitioners may provide veterinary services, the performance of which constitute the practice of veterinary medicine, to the public and also strengthens the clinical discretion and autonomy of registered veterinary professionals in discharging clinical duties.</p><p> The Veterinary Council recently began its period of public consultation for its strategy for 2019 to 2023, which is to be published later this year.  The strategy will seek to work with partner bodies to shape the professional lives of veterinary registrants and to ensure the development and oversight of the veterinary profession continues to foster best professional practice, in the best interest of animal welfare and the public.</p><p> Its proposed strategic objectives are leading animal health and welfare in line with one health, one welfare initiatives; maintaining the confidence of the public and veterinary professions in the Veterinary Council of Ireland processes; enabling good professional practice and professionalism through education; supporting the health and well-being of registrants; supporting and developing the role of the veterinary nurse; and enhancing and influencing and informing policy through insightful research and meaningful engagement.</p><p> While a number of different challenges face veterinary practitioners and nurses in Ireland today, the council will continue to work to ensure that registrants continue to provide best in class services, and that registrants are supported in their provision of veterinary medicine services, in their development as professionals and in their own personal well-being.  We will continue to work to ensure the high standards expected in the veterinary industry are upheld, and that quality of veterinary care enjoyed in this country continuously improves.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to address them today.  The president of the Veterinary Council, Mr. &Oacute; Scanaill, and I are happy to address any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

This is a most serious issue for the sector and many questions must be asked.  There is a lot of unease.  I received phone calls from eight vets over the weekend who were unanimous in their view this is not good progress for the sector and that it is a retrograde step.  My Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and I met the vets' union, which put forward a number of questions.  With the Chairman's permission we will ask them.  We all have copies of them as they met all of the parliamentary parties represented here.  If we will get answers to the questions we can see where the debate goes.</p></speech>

At our meeting on 21 May, the Veterinary Council assured the committee that it received specific legal advice prior to announcing in December 2017 the amendments to the code of professional conduct relating to the ownership of veterinary practice.  This is not substantiated by the findings of the Grant Thornton report.  Will the witnesses clarify this discrepancy?</p></speech>

They are all cited.  Some advice was received in 2014 and further advice was received in 2018 and 2019.  In 2014, advice was received from McDowell Purcell Solicitors in association with Mr. Tom Hogan.  Two senior counsel opinions were received in 2018 and March 2019 and a junior counsel opinion was received in 2018.</p></speech>

In fairness to our registrar, she was not around at the time.  She could have prepared for such questions but she was not there.  Mr. Hogan's advice was given initially in my presence and that of two other council members in his room.  It was followed by written advice.  It was the subject of continued discussion from then until 2017.  It was always referred to as the advice we had.  I do not know whether this clarifies it.</p></speech>

The employer may make decisions that are not in the interest of the veterinary profession or, indeed, of animal health.  These decisions may concern drugs, medicines or other veterinary practices.  There are reports from other jurisdictions of companies putting time limits on vets making calls.  I do not know how this would work in rural areas here.  When the council changed the code of conduct, did it have regard to this issue?  I have been an employee, as I am sure many in this room have been, and whether in the case of a factory, workshop or office floor it is always the owners who make the decision.  The decision would be binding and if a person did not like it, he or she could make his or her way out.  It is a case of "My way or the highway".</p> <p>  I have received various items of feedback but I have never received or heard of a complaint from farmers about the overall veterinary profession.  We have a network of veterinary practitioners who have served the country, and the agricultural community in particular, very well.  If the profession is corporatised, the nature, culture and practices will change and the relationship between the farming community and the vets, such as those who serve Laois-Offaly and other areas, will break down.  The quality of the service will diminish because vets will not be their own masters - that will be the owner of the corporate body.  That is what we have a concern over.  Their professional qualifications and years of experience, built over generations and handed down from father to son or father to daughter, will be lost.  The council should have looked into this before changing the code of conduct to facilitate it.</p></speech>

To be able to practice veterinary medicine a person has to be on the register of practitioners and apply for a certificate or a licence for that practice from the Veterinary Council.  In part, it is through that licence that we can be absolutely confident will have no influence on the provision of those services.  The standards enjoyed by our agricultural sector across the country will be maintained and it is the role of the council to make sure standards are upheld.  We are fortunate to have the quality and standards we enjoy.  The Veterinary Council will not allow any diminution of them.</p></speech>

The position of the council is that it does not have, and never has had, the legal remit to make a comment on ownership.  It does not collect data and does not ask any veterinary practitioner or nurse around the country who owns the practice in which they work.  The focus of the council is on the effective regulation of the service and on ensuring that standards are high.  Our vets and nurses are educated to a high degree and they get continuous professional development throughout their careers.  We also deal with disciplinary matters.</p></speech>

There is a lot of concern regarding the impact of the decision to open up ownership to laypersons.  In my county, practices have closed down having moved into lay ownership.  Many concerns were raised about this in advance by both vets and Veterinary Ireland, which is the representative body for the vast majority of practice vets and which represents 1,200 out of 2,000 practitioners.  It is the only such representative body.  The council flagged concerns it had, having done a lot of research, and it has outstanding questions on behalf of vets that it would like to be answered.  They presented members of the committee with these questions and we feel the best way to get answers is to go through those questions.  This is important in order to understand the rationale for this decision and the impact it is going to have if it is not addressed, whether that is by the Veterinary Council or through legislative change.</p> <p>  In a submission to this committee of 24 January 2018, the then registrar stated that legal advice was obtained on the issue.  Does the Veterinary Council have documentary evidence to substantiate this statement?  Was the legal advice in writing?  Did it deal with the issue of lay ownership or did it just deal with incorporating veterinary practices?  Incorporating veterinary practices could be done by vets, while lay ownership is a different issue.</p><p>Was that advice in writing and did it concern the issue of lay ownership specifically?</p></speech>

He will see in the Grant Thornton report that the council received four sets of legal advices in writing.  In December 2014, the council received legal advice on whether a non-registered veterinary practitioner could have an interest in a veterinary practice.  That probably answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

All aspects of the practice of veterinary medicine come under the remit of the Veterinary Council.  We are the regulator.  There is no aspect that we cannot get to.  Ownership is not within our legal remit or our focus, but the practice of veterinary medicine is.  There is, therefore, no question that a non-registered person would practise veterinary medicine.  One must be on our registers and be a qualified vet or veterinary nurse to be able to practise.  Equally, to be able to practise in this country one operates from a premises.  That premises is licensed by us so we know its size, all the details of the premises and all the individuals linked and working with it.  There is, therefore, no question but that all aspects of veterinary practice are within our control and we are the oversight body.  There will be no diminution in standards.  We are absolutely confident that the council is in a position to regulate effectively, and it is important that this committee has confidence in the council.</p></speech>

Ms Muldoon stated previously that that legal advice indicated that the council did not have any specific role in legal ownership, but the legislation is silent on the matter.  What did the legal advice say to the council about its capacity, given the fact that the Act was silent, to continue with the code it had previously as it related to prohibiting lay ownership?  That option was open to the council.  Can Ms Muldoon elaborate on the nature of the legal advice the council got that indicated that it did not have that capacity to continue as before?</p></speech>

In December 2014, the legal advice received concerned whether a non-registered veterinary practitioner could have an interest in a veterinary practice.  Further advices, specifically on ownership, were received subsequently, in 2018 and 2019.</p></speech>

What was so solid about the advice that the council could not continue with its previous code, which prohibited lay ownership?  The Act is silent on the matter.  Did that legal advice not then leave it open and give the council discretion to continue to prohibit lay ownership on the basis that it could have an impact on the operation of practices?</p></speech>

It did not concern ownership specifically or whether the council had a role in that regard.  The advices were more focused on that matter in 2018 and 2019.  As I noted, a decision was taken in December 2017 in the absence of a period of consultation, so those amendments were stayed in the code to allow for further advices and a period of consultation.  It was that 18-month period of consultation which culminated in the Grant Thornton report and the decision of the council in July of this year.</p></speech>

However, in advance of the initial decision to change the code to allow for lay ownership in the future, as I hear it here, the advice on the specifics of the legality of allowing lay ownership was not very comprehensive.  Can Ms Muldoon elaborate on that?  The advice seemed to concern the opportunity for somebody to have an interest.  I am not sure what having an interest might mean and what the difference is between that and ownership.</p></speech>

That is the nature of the advices received in December 2014.</p></speech>

A corporatisation was occurring in other jurisdictions worldwide, as mentioned earlier, so the pressure was on at all times for the council to come up with an answer, and we kept saying, "No, get your own legal advice."  It became clear, however, that we would have to come up with some answer on the matter, and it came from those legal advices we were using in December 2017.</p></speech>

It does not specifically require the council to change its code of conduct either in that it does not say there is a legal impediment.  It states that lay ownership should be allowed, so it strikes me that it left it very much in the Veterinary Council's court as to how it might proceed.</p></speech>

I do not have the former code with me, but there were things taken out of it in 2017 and then that statement went in in 2017, when almost immediately we realised we really needed to have done an awful lot more consultation and to have widened this, which we did.  That is what we are presenting before the committee today.</p></speech>

The spouse of any married vet owned 50%.  In fairness, a retired vet whose son is continuing with the practice may still actually own the premises.  We were aware of the existence of many such cases.  They were not creating the issue though.  What was creating the issue was registered and non-registered people asking us what our view of section 54(2)(<i>c</i>) was, which states a body corporate cannot offer the service.  It hinged really on how a corporate body could offer the service.  A corporate body is not a person but a vet who carries out the Act.  It was quite unclear, and even on the legal side one could ask a range of barristers and solicitors and get a range of answers.</p></speech>

I thank the council for its presentation, which was very informative.  I wish to ask about when the council made the decision and about conflict of interest and how that was determined by the council.  What protocols were in place for conflict of interest and are they in line with the 2005 Act, taking into consideration that a conflict of interest at local authority level or in our kind of work would require us to declare it and have it minuted and then to leave the meeting?  Does that apply to the council, taking into consideration the 2005 Act?</p></speech>

As with any regulatory body, we have lots of procedures around conflicts and standing orders concerning the conduct of council and committee meetings.  Any member who has a conflict is requested to declare it in advance of the relevant agenda item to either the chair of the committee, the chair of the council or the registrar.

Again, I would be very reluctant to go down the avenue the Senator wishes to bring us down.  We will look at the report tomorrow as there is a council meeting tomorrow.  There may be something we will erase from it but, in fairness, we will always check that what was recorded as having been said was correct.  If there is any conflict of interest or even the perception of a conflict of interest, one is always asked to declare it and remove oneself from the room.  Looking back, and going back to any past presidents, these issues are minuted and there were some very short removals from the room in 2017 and 2018.  In fairness, with regard to December 2017 and digging into the specifics, we will deal with it tomorrow and perhaps at future meetings down the line.</p> <p>  This particular corporate issue we brought to the committee today was described by me as coming from a council member sucking the oxygen out of the room.  From the time of December 2017 and January 2018, a huge amount of effort by the 19 council members has gone into all of that stakeholder work.  In fairness, looking back is something we may have a privilege to do now but we would not have had that privilege then.  We had a change in registrar, the second registrar was hardly in a handful of weeks when some issue arose and we had to have another registrar, and that registrar could only attend for one day a week but we were not aware of that at the time.  That rolled on for a while and then we had another registrar.  We then recruited and we now have a full-time registrar.  In fairness, the privilege of looking back is something we will be doing in the future. </p></speech>

In regard to the certificate of suitability and the fact there has to be a registered vet who manages the company on behalf of the other bodies, from the point of view of the Veterinary Council, if the company goes against the views of the registered person, is that desirable or is it something the council would agree with?  To answer my own question, the company would have its own set of rules and it is a question of whether the individual complies with this or not.  Would the council look at the set of rules the company has to see if it is compatible with veterinary practice?  I am thinking of the recent case in Donegal where the person responsible - the vet - wanted to do evening cases, but the company did not want that and the company ended up closing and relocating, and cherry-picking customers and so on.  Is that something the council would take a role in or responsibility for?</p></speech>

As was referenced, any veterinary practice has to hold a particular licence granted by the council and one has to be a registrant to apply for that licence.  The form of words approved by the council in July of this year references the clinical discretion of the registrant being paramount.  That is where we see the role of the certificate holder or the licence holder.  We would see that the role of the licence holder includes having full power and control over all matters relating to the practice of veterinary medicine and all clinical matters.  We will not be getting into the devil of the detail in terms of company structures and it is not our concern how any business is structured.  Our concern is how the practice operates, how veterinary medicine is delivered and how that service is provided.  As a regulator, we have a very strong focus on making sure the service provided to the public and to the benefit of society is of a particular standard and a safe standard.</p></speech>

Arguably, it might send in an authorised officer to conduct an inspection of that premises or practice and the authorised officer might sample the medical records of all the various clients or look to make sure that all of the controlled drugs are validly scheduled, documented and secured.  Equally, if there were particular findings, the council would take action based on those findings.</p></speech>

For example, the provision of 24-hour care is linked to the licence to each veterinary premises licensed by the council around the country, all 752 of them.  The provision of 24-hour care is linked to that licence, as other matters can be.  It is absolutely the case that the standard of the service delivered is something we would be interested in.</p></speech>

This Act is one to envy.  This particular certificate of suitability, which is the certificate for the premises, is not in many other Acts or in any other professions across many other jurisdictions, as we found when we went looking.  If we pull back a little, before ever we talk about an owner or a corporate body laying down rules and regulations, there is no service to the public until a registrant applies to us to open a service to the public at and from a certain premises.  That is the first step.  That is the hands on the wheel.  As we said when we were here last, it would be very important for us that there would only be three parties on the playing field.  The hands on the wheel would be the vet's hands only - the registrant's hands only - and that is on the certificate.</p> <p>  In fairness, there will be contracts between the registrants and the owners but that contract can never come across the provision of the service, which is in the hands of the veterinary practitioners, who apply to us for that certificate.  The certificate is only for four years.  If any issue arises during those four years, and he or she applies for the next four years, we can refuse it, revoke it, re-grant it or grant it with conditions.  This is all in the primary legislation.  It is a very strong Act and it gives us fantastic control over the provision of service, which is a huge step forward.  It means that, as we said in our opening statement, while the Deputy has referred to the owner or the employer saying one thing or the other, the first person to speak is the certificate of suitability holder.</p><p>The power is in the hands of the registrant who opens that service, provides it to the public and four years later applies to renew and continue that service.  If an issue arises that concerns that registrant enough, he or she can move next door, apply for a certificate there and continue the service. </p></speech>

One of them stipulates that a registrant must not enter any contract, partnership or arrangement of any type that in any way affects his or her ability to uphold the code, the regulations related to suitability, the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 or any regulations laid down by the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  The provisions that went into the code following the stakeholder consultation are very powerful.  For these purposes, the service is the veterinary practitioner providing the service,  the user is the public and we are the regulator.  There is nobody else on the pitch.</p></speech>

The potential owner, who may not be the veterinary practitioner, can determine the hours of work or the prices of the different procedures undertaken by the veterinary practitioner.  Those prices could be substantially higher than the normal prices.  How will that be regulated?  There is effectively a fourth party on the pitch who was not there previously.  Am I interpreting that correctly?</p></speech>

We included that requirement in the code, which they must uphold.  If the certificate holder has some difficulty, he or she must draw the attention of the other party to their requirements as guaranteed in their contract.  If the licenceholder finds he or she does not have the power to do so, he or she can alert us.  We would immediately have concerns about the certificate applying to that premises as somebody, a fourth party, would be coming onto the pitch.  We would strongly advise that either they sort it out, or the registrant, who applied for the certificate, applies to another premises and continues with the service.</p></speech>

I cannot believe what I am hearing.  What I have been hearing for the last ten minutes is akin to a bouncer outside a nightclub who watches a 16 year old get an ID from an 18 year old, says that is fine and tells them to go on in, it will be all right on the night.  I have worked in companies as both a manager and an employee.  I have never been asked to sign on behalf of management or on behalf of the owner.  If I was, I do not think my signature could have been accepted.  I was always answerable to the manager or owner.  The witnesses are basically saying that I can buy a veterinary practice in the morning and ask any qualified vet who is prepared to put his or her letters behind it to sign my application for me.  There are not even checks and balances to find out if the vet is an employee of the person who owns the practice or the building.</p> <p>  Suppose the vet is an employee.  If that vet decides to live by what he or she has signed and provide a 24-hour service, and if I as the employer decide it is not economically viable to send him or her out at 4 a.m. to deliver lambs, we might part company by the end of the week.  Do I still have certification for the next four years?  The witnesses have given me no indication, in their report or anywhere else, that the VCI checks what the vet's role in the company is, apart from verifying that he or she is a qualified vet and signed the application.  The VCI has been ignoring the fact that there is a fourth party in the relationship.  Is it not the case that in the context of the TB eradication scheme, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine recently stated that the service provider cannot be an employee of the practice?  If that is correct, and I am led to believe it is, can the witnesses provide an answer?  The VCI has allowed this relationship to develop by totally ignoring the fourth party because it suits the VCI to do so.  It undermines its own role in policing this code by turning its back on the fact that it will accept a signature from anybody, on anybody else's behalf, once the signatory has gone to UCD or wherever to get the right letters after his or her name.  The VCI is not even interested in what the vet's role within that organisation is, other than to note that he or she has the qualification.  A week later he or she might not be working under the licence the VCI grants or in the building for which it has granted a licence. </p></speech>

The registrants are members of a profession.  No member of any profession will sell his or her signature for cheap use by another.  Society expects higher standards of all professions.  Practitioners of veterinary nursing are no different.  I do not foresee the circumstances Senator Paul Daly outlines as being problematic.  That said, if individual nuances within the area of veterinary practice prove to be problematic, the VCI will not be found wanting in playing its role.  Our job is to make sure that there is effective regulation.</p><p>Our concern is for society and the public interest.  It is not the case that we are going to turn a blind eye to substandard or poor practice.  It simply will not be allowed.</p></speech>

It is a changing environment so change, updates and reform will be required by the council in different areas.  All of that is in train and is being developed.  We are absolutely confident that we can effectively regulate the practice of veterinary medicine.  We would not be appearing before this committee today if that was not the case; we would be beating down the door seeking legislative change and amendments.  We would not be discharging our statutory duties under the Act if we were not effectively regulating the sector.  We confidently believe we can do that but if that position changes and if, over the passage of time, we discover that there are gaps or difficulties with which we cannot deal effectively, we will not be found wanting in terms of coming forward.  The standards will remain high and we are absolutely confident of that.</p></speech>

It goes further and outlines reasons for restricting or revoking the certificate, one of which is that the veterinary practitioner is no longer practising veterinary medicine at the premises.  What the Senator described, in terms of someone signing a form and then being gone two days later, means that automatically, the certificate is gone.  The entire control of the practice is in the hands of the veterinary practitioners.  That is very important for us because we cannot regulate non-veterinary practitioners.  We can only regulate veterinary practitioners or veterinary nurses who are members of the profession and registered with us.  It was very important for us, in terms of the code, that it meant the veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses, that is, the registrants, had full and ultimate control over the provision of the service to the public.  If there was any issue from the public's perspective, they could come to the council.  If there was any issue from the perspective of the providers of the service, they could also come to the council or sort it out among themselves on the ground.  Obviously there are certain contractual issues in the context of the practices to which the Senator refers and we would need to have all of the relevant information on that before we could comment.</p></speech>

The issue related to payment and withholding tax.  Heretofore, the Department was paying anyone who was an employee of the practice carrying out the TB test, whereas it was the practice that was asked to conduct the TB test.  The Revenue Commissioners clarified the matter for the Department and the Department then clarified it for us.  It asked veterinary practitioners to sign a document saying whether they were employees or employers.  It said that to be the service provider that was to be paid the money for the TB test, a practitioner had to be the employer and not the employee.</p></speech>

It is something that may develop further in the context of the certificate.  If we felt it was required, we could ask on our certificate of suitability application, which comes in every four years, or on the application for registration, which is filled and signed every year.  If this was something that we thought we needed to delve into more, we could do so.  The Department made it very clear that the service provider who was to receive the money had to be the employer.

They have the money to do so.  If we allow this to happen, the farmer will pay the price.  Sadly, animals will pay the price as well because these services will not be as widely available.  Can something be done through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Government, this committee or the Veterinary Council of Ireland to block the type of loophole that is in the system and ensure the system that has worked for so long is protected?</p></speech>

It is not the case for medics, pharmacists or dentists.  It would not be sustainable or wise to make such a provision in the case of the veterinary profession.  I am not sure that the esteemed Houses of the Oireachtas would be enabled to pass legislation to that effect.  I am not sure any member of the High Court would approve of such legislation.  Ultimately, the passage of legislation is a matter for this committee and for the Houses.  Oireachtas Members are charged with that honour.  There is a role for the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  I accept that the potential exists for vet shortages in certain parts of the country.  This is something that the council has on its radar.  It is an area in which we want to take action and be involved.  The council has access to a significant quantity of data.  No great analysis of that data has been carried out to date.  One of the strategic objectives that have been identified by the council involves seeking to influence and inform partner bodies and to engage with them.  It is open to the council to carry out some research on all the information it has.  The council is currently sitting on data for all registrants relating to what age they are, where they are physically or geographically in practice and what area of practice they are in.  In theory, it is open to the council to foresee potential shortages around the country ten, 15 or 20 years down the tracks.  The council is looking at the potential to carry out some research.  I hope we can work with the Department to influence policies in these kinds of areas.  The Deputy is correct that the potential exists for practice in remote areas to come under threat.  All of society needs to be concerned about this.  I believe there is a role for the council in this regard.  However, I do not believe there is a legislative basis for getting involved in that.</p></speech>

Can we not make sure the person who is paid is either an employee of a vet, or a vet who owns a practice?  If we do not provide for such a requirement, we will place much of the country in danger.  Big business is big business, whether we like it or not.  We are going to see people in some areas of this country having to travel 50 miles to access a vet.</p></speech>

As a registrar has pointed out, it is nothing to do with ownership.  For ten years or more, it has been quite difficult to get vets to work in large animal practices, which is the tougher end of the game with longer hours and tougher work.</p><p>Often, the remuneration does not match expectations.  The money is simply not in it.  We need only look at what the beef industry is saying about the cost of beef being below the cost of production.  If the person who is involved in that has to pay for a veterinary service, members can see how the pressure is always be on to keep those costs down.  It is very hard to get vets to work in rural parts, even on the east coast, the north-east coast and in the centre of the country.</p></speech>

I am from the west, which is generally the poor relation, and we have a very good veterinary service in many areas.  Youngsters who want to go into veterinary medicine generally have to have 570 or 580 leaving certificate points.  Many a person who might have 520 or 530 points and would never get in will head off to some other country to become a vet through another door.  I advise the council to look at that situation as well.  Many a person might be damn glad to handle those bigger animals, although I know there is a lot going for the smaller ones.  We have a great service in my own neck of the woods.  If we keep going down the road of conglomerates coming in, we will probably have one vet in the west.</p></speech>

I agree with him completely; the provision of the education is something we are looking at.  In fairness, there are many more now going abroad than are going to our own college when we look at the numbers.  Perhaps it is time that we had a second college.  That is definitely the case.  We are extraordinarily proud of the veterinary service that is in every parish.  However, any employer of vets will tell us that when they advertise for a vet to perform those sort of duties, it is very hard to get them.</p></speech>

I am disappointed.  We have a model in this country that has worked well.  The welfare of the animal has to be paramount.  I have noted a few statements from the presentation.  For example, &quot;Ownership bears no influence on the provision of veterinary services.&quot;  I am not going to swallow that pill.  Unfortunately, we have an example where a corporate buying a practice has had an influence on the provision of veterinary services and an area has been left without it.  That has been blown out of the water already.  Ms Muldoon stated:</p><blockquote>The clinical discretion of the veterinary practitioner is paramount, acting at all times in the interest of animal health, welfare and public health.  This decision brings clarity to the matter. </blockquote> <p>In my mind it does, because the welfare of the animal often involves an uneconomical call, perhaps going to a call where the vet knows there is not an earthly hope of getting paid.  Vets do that on a regular basis.  This corporate structure has gained ground in other countries and the service provided to farmers is not like the service we have grown accustomed to in this country.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, if a farmer picks up the phone and rings for a vet, he will be in the farmer's yard within half an hour no matter what hour of the day it is.  That is a tremendous service.  I take issue with the veterinary council's statement that it has no remit in regard to ownership.  Unless there is a remit and strong ethics, the welfare of the animal is going to be put at risk.  I do not question the ethics of vets because they have the track record to show that they put animal welfare at the top of the list.  A corporate ownership will not put it at the top of the list.  They may say they will ensure there is a 24-hour service.  There might be a 24-hour service but in other jurisdictions a call-out can attract such an exorbitant fee that it is just not economically viable to bring a vet to an animal.  That would result in animal welfare issues.</p><p>The question of testing has not arisen yet because the corporates are only cherry-picking the specialised practices or the lucrative small animal practices in large urban centres.  However, they will go into the diary areas where there are large herds and cherry-pick the large practices and form a massive practice in that area.  We have seen this model in the UK.  Farmers will have the vet come to their yard once a year and engage in a programme for preventative medicine rather than provide a service to them.</p><p>I am disappointed that the veterinary council is abdicating its role in regard to ownership.  It can say that the legislation says so but for 13 or 14 years the legislation said different.  I just cannot understand how the interpretation of the legislation can change after 12 or 13 years.  We will discuss this as a committee after the witnesses leave.  If the legislation does not allow ownership of a practice to stay in veterinary hands, the legislation has to be amended.  We have a veterinary practice system that is working well.  There are no welfare issues in veterinary practice in this country.  Now we are going to go down a road where corporates are going to have their say.  We have seen it already where a practice has been closed for whatever reason and the vets who were working in that practice arrived to a locked door.  The service we have known in rural Ireland could not be provided by corporate structures going forward.  I had a lot of vets talking to me over the weekend.  For many of them economically, it would be a good decision if corporates could buy them out because they would in a position to sell their practice and retire, but to a man and woman they were opposed to this.  They feel that the service they pride themselves on will not remain and that the fabric and structure of veterinary practice that we have in Ireland will be seriously undermined.  </p><p>To regulate all the aspects of delivering a veterinary service to the public, would it beneficial to the veterinary council if there was an amendment to the Veterinary Practice Act 2015 confining ownership of practices to veterinary practitioners only?</p></speech>

He or she would have to undertake to provide a 24-hour service or whatever the council would request in time.  Therefore, it is not as easy as taking one vet in the door and pushing another out.  That is not the case.  The council will always have oversight because the clinical discretion sits with the licence holder.  The licence holder will be asked to be responsible for all matters relating to the practice of veterinary medicine within the practice.

We have seen it come into play already that lay ownership has an influence.  That goes against the grain of what the council is trying to achieve and oversee.  Only vets should have control.  With the change that has been made, allowing lay ownership to come into play, there is now a level of lay control over veterinary practice.</p><p>I know the law was silent on the matter, but it would have been appropriate to bear in mind the VCI's rules of conduct specifying that only veterinary practitioners should own practices because only veterinary practitioners should have control and influence over the provision of veterinary medicine.  Whenever lay ownership is allowed, those owners interfere and take on a level of control.  These lay owners do not have responsibilities for animal welfare under the code of conduct for veterinary medicine practitioners.  Allowing lay owners in the industry allows non-veterinary influence on the conduct of medicine in Ireland.  That is why we see veterinary practitioners throughout the country being so opposed to this.  A Veterinary Ireland survey showed that 86% of practitioners opposed such ownership.  There is widespread concern about it and a lack of support for it.</p><p> The other point I will make relates to cost.  There is some evidence of cherry-picking.  Practices are sold and the company taking over only wants to keep the big clients and small animal practice.  They want to keep the profitable parts and cut the rest adrift.  The primary motive of a lay owner is not to look after the animals or to follow the veterinary code of conduct, but to make a profit.  That is their driver when they come in.  That is at loggerheads with the veterinary practitioners' obligation to keep their code of care for animals at the centre of what they do.  These two things are in conflict.  If the lay ownership had no control and no influence, there could be a way forward.  The concern is always that such owners would have influence.  Only a very small number of practices have been sold, but we have already seen that, in practice, such owners do have control, get on top of things, and interfere with the vets' operation and ability to conform to their code of conduct.</p><p> Another thing that comes into play is pricing.  A vet is supposed to care for animals, respond to emergencies, and keep caring at the centre of what they do.  Big clients, however, can be cherry-picked and smaller clients let go.  There is a sense that they can fend for themselves however they like.  It is not the practice's responsibility.  A charge of &euro;500 can be put on unprofitable calls the practice does not want, which is far more than the actual cost of responding to such calls.  These calls will never pass the vets' desk.  They will not get the call if it costs &euro;500.  That does not interfere with the code of ethics in care in theory, because the call will not come as a result of the &euro;500 fee.  Where is the animal in this?  What happens to the sheep or the animal that is worth less than &euro;500?  They will not be looked after.  They are left to their own devices and can die on their own accord.  There certainly will not be a vet looking after them.  Despite this, vets throughout the country want to ensure that all of this is looked after in the carrying out of their duties, even in unprofitable cases.</p><p> Where lay ownership occurs, we are now seeing evidence of profit beginning to rule the roost and of farmers, especially those who are not profitable customers for vets, not getting service.  Vets are very disturbed by this interference in their ability to carry out their job, to which they are all very committed.  That is why the decision that has been made needs to be revisited.  If it is not possible for the Veterinary Council of Ireland to overturn this decision, the legislation needs to be revisited by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Oireachtas.  It is clear, and there is no doubt, that lay ownership means lay control, lay interference, and profit ruling the roost rather the duty of care.  We have seen it internationally.  It is going to happen here very rapidly if this is not addressed.  We need to address it.</p></speech>

He has given us many points to return to.  There has been a lot of debate about corporate ownership.  It has been challenging for the profession and for the council.  The council did not take this decision lightly.  In the consultation, just shy of 60% of those surveyed were against corporate ownership, with 40% in favour.  It is entirely contextual.  One sees vets being more open to corporate ownership at certain stages in their careers.  For example, veterinary nurses tend to be in favour.  It varies depending on the context.  This committee will take its own legal advice as to what is sustainable.  The council acknowledges that it is a changing environment.  There will be challenges and the nuances of these decisions will be played out throughout the country over the coming years.  The council will keep an eye on all of this.  It is not going to undermine its own function by allowing something to come in that it cannot regulate.  The council is confident that it can regulate the practice of veterinary medicine.  It will be revisiting, reforming and revising certain aspects of the procedures over the coming months.  All of this will be kept under review.  The council will not be found wanting in playing its role in all of this.  The council is not requesting legislative change or amendment at this time.  It is, of course, open to this great House to introduce whatever laws it deems appropriate, but the council has not arrived at the conclusion that any such legislative amendment is required.</p> <p>  With regard to pricing, this is just outside the role of a regulator.  It is just not within our gift.  Life might be a lot easier if it were.  The Medical Council cannot set the fees for doctors and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland cannot set the fees and charges that pharmacists levy.  It is the same for the Dental Council.  We are a regulator.  We have a public interest focus on the regulation of the practice but we cannot control every facet.  We acknowledge that there will be many challenges in the years to come, but the council will not be found wanting and will rise to meet those challenges to ensure effective regulation in the public interest.</p></speech>

I have seen it in my own county.  The fees for out-of-hours calls increase to &euro;500.  Vets cannot feasibly be available to carry out their duties in that situation.  The council does not have control over ensuring veterinary services are available whenever they are needed.  It does not have control over that particular aspect.</p> <p>  I will make one final point with regard to the cherry-picking of customers and letting non-profitable customers go.  What obligations fall on individual practices?  In my own county I am well aware of a situation in which a large practice was closed after being bought by lay owners.  This removed a very significant veterinary service for large parts of the county.  There is real difficulty and challenges as to how these areas will now be served.  Will the witnesses comment on that particular issue?  How can it be ensured, from the Veterinary Council of Ireland's point of view, that there will be service in that area, in which there is no practice?  That is important.  On cherry-picking customers and leaving small customers adrift, what obligations fall on vets in scenarios where a person is no longer a customer of the practice?  What obligations are on a vet to provide service to such a person, particularly where it may not be profitable to do so?</p></speech>

Every one of his concerns formed part of our debate, discussion and thought on this issue.  We are quite confident, and I stand firmly with my registrar on this, about putting provision of the service into the hands of the vet only and about specifying only the registrant on the certificate of suitability provided for in primary legislation.  If the registrant wishes to close a practice, open one, move it or change it, it will be the registrant's decision to do so.  If there are issues of control with which the registrant is unhappy or which in any way affect his or her ability to provide service, the registrant has the ability to move next door.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about after-hours service.  The council does oblige veterinary practitioners not to turn away animals that are in need of succour or emergency treatment, but in fairness, the vet would usually try to come to an arrangement with somebody who is close enough to provide that service.  It is not the case that somebody in County Kildare must answer a phone call at any hour from someone in Donegal and then go to the farmer's assistance.  If an animal is in need of veterinary attention, we would be asked to go.  I do not know if that answers the Deputy's question.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland would not, however, say that a given vet must provide a service for Mr. Riordan, a farmer who has only ten animals, if he or she is providing it for Mr. Jones next door, who has 100.  We do not get involved in that way.</p></speech>

In such cases, the VCI would not insist that the practice provide X, Y or Z service.  It is a concern that small farmers might have difficulties accessing a service but larger farmers would not.  However, the market usually finds its own level.  If people are being left behind, someone will have to provide a service.  Where a large practice is dealing with larger clients, it may be able to offer better prices and it might be in its interest to take the smaller clients as well as the larger ones.  That is the way the market works.</p></speech>

In that scenario, only the unprofitable clients are available to a new practice.  In a situation where there is not an oversupply of vets, we will not see vets setting up in areas where the pickings are slim.  The movement towards lay ownership is creating a problem in that regard and it should not be allowed to continue.</p></speech>

Dublin Chamber of Commerce is the largest chamber of commerce in Ireland, representing over 1,300 businesses across the greater Dublin area.  Our diverse membership base gives us a strong insight into the needs of both businesses and their employees, informing a holistic view of the commercial environment.  Our vision is that Dublin will be globally renowned for its economic competitiveness and quality of life.  We have a duty to our members to highlight issues of concern and the public policy changes that are needed to improve the business environment.  As a civic actor, the chamber strives to do this in a way that supports the needs of the community at large.  We are acutely aware of the challenges facing the business community and the Government in the face of a no-deal Brexit.  The decision to base budget 2020 on a no-deal scenario is a prudent one in light of current uncertainty.</p> <p>  Deputies will notice that while some of the goals in our submission are ambitious, we have also outlined several targeted measures that could be more easily accommodated within the fiscal constraints of a single year, even a year such as 2020.  The Government has a package of circa &euro;600 million remaining unallocated in budget 2020.  Dublin Chamber recommends the use of these resources to prepare for the challenges ahead by strengthening the fundamentals of the economy.  This should involve supporting Irish enterprise, ensuring sustainable infrastructure and housing investment, and improving labour market access.  Ahead of Brexit, the chamber has compared the environment for enterprise in Ireland with that of the UK.  As outlined in our submission, Ireland now lags behind the UK on a range of metrics.  Foreign direct investment is vital to the Irish economy but as the global environment changes, so too must our business model adapt, remaining attractive to foreign investors while avoiding excessive reliance on a small number of highly mobile firms.  We need to foster an entrepreneurial environment and strengthen Ireland's indigenous base.  This will require a step change in the level of investment by SMEs.  Ireland's capital gains tax rate is now the third highest in Europe.  The flat 33% rate still applies irrespective of the contribution of the investment to the economy.  The same tax is paid on passive investments in large blue-chip multinationals as is paid on high-risk Irish start-ups.  This effectively incentivises investment in large foreign firms over investment in Irish SMEs.  We embrace the ambition of moving towards a 20% rate of capital gains tax for all unlisted trading firms.  Conscious that this may have significant Exchequer implications in the short term, we have also outlined a number of targeted measures that could be adopted more quickly.  These should be considered both as steps to improve competitiveness and as possible tax expenditure, as in a post-Brexit stimulus package.  First among them is our proposal to outmatch the UK on capital gains tax entrepreneur relief by raising the lifetime cap on qualifying gains to &euro;15 million.  We have also proposed changes to the research and development tax credit, the taxation of entrepreneur dividends and the key employee engagement programme.  While progress on all fronts is not possible in one fiscal year, there is scope within the budgetary parameters to send a strong signal that Ireland intends to sharpen its competitive edge in the face of Brexit.  </p> <p>  Infrastructure and housing consistently rank as the most important challenges facing Dublin.</p><p>Joined-up thinking between housing and infrastructure development will be key to addressing Dublin's deficits in these areas.  Projects such as metro north, the DART expansion programme and the eastern and midlands water supply are essential to ensuring a sustainable future for the greater Dublin area.  The announcement of the national development plan was welcomed by the business community but it is critical that the Government follows through.</p><p> There is serious concern that in the event of a downturn, capital investment will be cut as has often been the case.  Steps must be taken to guarantee delivery of the infrastructure improvements that the economy so badly needs.  There are three practical steps the Government could take to ensure that, next time, it will be different.  If economic growth dips below the level required to fund the national development plan, drawdown from the rainy day fund should be permitted to ensure steady delivery.  This would meet the fund's short-term aim of economic stabilisation through stimulus while also building future capacity.  All parties should commit to reasonable use of excess revenues.  Last year, the corporation tax take was approximately &euro;1.4 billion ahead of target.  Raising current spending on the basis of unexpected receipts is a recipe for instability.  Such revenues should be used to accelerate priority projects or to bolster the rainy day fund.  The revenue from future carbon tax increases should be ring-fenced for green infrastructure investment.  Dublin Chamber of Commerce fully accepts the need for the carbon tax while calling for a clear schedule of planned increases to ensure that businesses can plan and adapt in good time.  Securing public buy-in will be difficult if the Government punishes carbon use without providing alternatives.  Improving public transport is the place to start.</p><p> The final concern I will bring to the committee's attention is the tightening labour market.  While this reflects a good news story in some respects, we must remain cognisant of the immediate challenges it poses to scaling businesses and the potential risk to Dublin&rsquo;s competitiveness.  There is still considerable scope to raise female labour market participation.  The cost of childcare and the combined effects of the tax and social welfare system appear to have a depressing effect on the female labour participation rate.  Addressing this would improve the situation considerably.  Dublin Chamber of Commerce calls on the Government to focus on improving the universal component of the national childcare scheme in 2020 and to carefully assess the scheme&rsquo;s incentive effects on labour market participation.  We have also proposed for future consideration a returning to work credit to reduce the marginal tax benefit rate for second earners in a family who are returning to work.</p><p> We are conscious that budget 2020 comes at a delicate time.  As the last budget before the UK's exit from the EU, it offers an opportunity for Ireland to demonstrate serious intent about business competitiveness versus the UK, as well as its commitment to long-term planning for sustainable infrastructure investment and improved quality of life.  I thank members for listening and I look forward to exchanging views with them.</p></speech>

I will share my time with Mr. Aidan Doyle, chief executive of Sligo Chamber of Commerce, who will add a regional dimension to the discussion.  As many of the members of the committee will know, Chambers Ireland is Ireland&rsquo;s largest business network with a geographic footprint that extends across the country, with 41 chambers, of which Dublin Chamber of Commerce is our largest.  We were delighted to launch a new Laois Chamber of Commerce this morning, with approximately 350 people in the room.  It is a vibrant network.  Every member of the committee has a chamber of commerce in his or her constituency and will no doubt be glad to see their representatives at our network's event tomorrow morning, to which they have all been invited.</p> <p>  We welcome the Brexit-driven approach which the Government is taking to budget 2020 as a necessity and believe it would be foolhardy to take a business as usual approach.  The first order effects of Brexit will hit certain exposed sectors of the economy such as agrifood and tourism where we know issues will arise as a direct consequence.  The second order effects will likely have a broader impact, potentially depressing consumer spending in regional areas significantly.  We think it is wise to assume the worst, to seek to leave the national balance sheet in as robust a position as possible and to be ready to respond.</p> <p>  Those in the business community who are most likely to be affected by Brexit have taken actions necessary to minimise its effects on their businesses, such as rerouting logistics in a way which is unlikely to change regardless of what happens next with Brexit.  This has imposed additional costs on Irish businesses, which will continue, and assuming Brexit occurs, there will be further hits to the economy.  This kind of external shock is likely to have a strong, immediate impact on our economic growth at the national level, the duration of which is unclear, but we have no doubt that we will all be collaborating to address the regional impacts of Brexit for a considerable time to come.</p> <p>  While Brexit consumes so much of our policy discourse, we must not lose sight of the longer-term challenges that Ireland will meet.</p><p>It was with this longer-term perspective in mind that Chambers Ireland formed its pre-budget submission, which is centred on the decarbonisation of our society and the necessary mitigation and adaptation strategies which follow from that.</p><p> While there is broad acceptance in the business community of the need for carbon taxes, it is vital that the proceeds of such taxes do not flow into the general fund.  Over &euro;400 million is already collected through carbon tax each year.  We welcome the early indications from the Taoiseach that ring-fencing will be the Government's chosen approach.  It is crucial that the current revenues and any future increased revenues are ring-fenced and channelled into schemes and infrastructure which will allow people to access lower-carbon alternatives.  Increased carbon taxes which are not complemented with investment in grid infrastructure, public transport and retrofitting will have a disproportionate impact on poorer people and the more remote parts of the country.  We believe that a schedule for carbon tax increases should be set out because this would help businesses to plan and budget for such increases and would bring greater predictability to the present value of energy-efficiency measures, thereby encouraging viable investment.</p><p> At an infrastructural level, our energy networks need to transition towards meeting the challenges posed by the growth in renewable energy sources while maintaining energy security and continuity of service.  If our grid is to cope with the added demands that Government policy relating to e-vehicles and the full electrification of home heating will place on our electricity network, its generation and transmission capacity will need to be expanded.  This will require considerable investment and needs to be a priority.  Unless we can achieve this, we will not be able to meet our emissions targets and the related fines will continue to grow.  We need to ensure investments which are in line with the principles of the national development plan are continued.  Such investments, particularly in public transport, are necessary for a long-term reduction in our society's carbon intensity.  As these investments will act as a countercyclical ballast against the economic headwinds that are before us, they will allow our economy to maintain momentum during difficult times.</p></speech>

The economies of regional cities and towns have been undermined by a lack of planning and by underinvestment.  This has contributed to the doughnut-type development that is continuing to happen in larger cities like Dublin and is leading to long commutes and suburban sprawl.  We want to see this process reversed.  The best kind of economic stimulus for towns and cities like Sligo is to have people working and living in the heart of them.  The Living City initiative in places such as Cork, Dublin and Limerick aims to protect the Georgian parts of those towns by bringing life back to them.  The initiative is a tax incentive scheme for special regeneration areas in Ireland's major cities through which tax relief can be claimed for expenditure on converting residential or commercial properties.  We believe that the expansion of the initiative to Sligo and other regional towns and cities, with the extension of the initiative beyond the current May 2020 deadline, will enhance the regeneration of our regional towns and cities and will attract people back to live above shops and restaurants in buildings that are hundreds of years old.  According to what we have heard from our members, that is the kind of living people want.  The planning problems which make above-the-shop conversions almost impossible need to be fixed.  Good local transport services, protected bicycle lanes, decent transport links and proper broadband are also needed.  It is much easier to provide such services in town centres than to service mile after mile of new housing and once-off builds.  It makes more sense for people to make their homes where we already have schools, water infrastructure, doctors and other government services then to have people driving 50 miles in and out to work each day and trying to serve the spread-out population at the same level.</p> <p>  Businesses in regions like the north west have higher energy costs and a larger carbon footprint.  This makes the region less attractive to people who are seeking to set up business.  One of the reasons for this is that Sligo is not linked into the gas grid.  If we are to enable balanced regional development, attract new industries and allow industries that are already established to be competitive nationally and globally, Sligo and the north west need to have a similar quality of infrastructure to that available to more successful regions.  In Sligo, we are working closely with the local authority, the agencies and industry on a compressed natural gas project, transported from the national gas transmission network.  This will facilitate the move away from other more polluting fossil fuels, especially oil and diesel.</p><p>Without this facility, the region is essentially denied the associated cost savings, CO2 reductions and air quality improvements that CNG transport options provide by replacing diesel fuel for heavy road transport and aiding the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p><p> These are just some of the things that local businesses in Ireland are looking make happen, but our planning systems, including our marine planning system, and how we invest in national infrastructure will need to recognise this to facilitate of the kind of progress that we need.  Life is for living, and our State organisations should be assisting regional cities and towns across the country, including Sligo, to develop and attract new investment as places where people want to work and live. </p></speech>

I welcome the emphasis on transport but Dublin city is facing a crisis in which its very character is under siege, from financial and money people who are literally gouging the heart out of the city and making it as unaffordable for families as Manhattan.  They are turning Dublin into a city that relies extensively on tourism for a huge number of jobs and, if it keeps going in this way, it will not be recognisable as a living city for families and other people, at least between the canals.  We will kill the goose that lays the golden egg.</p> <p>  Co-living developments are being encouraged under the strategic housing initiative and we are seeing, every week and in different parts of the city, including Blanchardstown, co-living proposals for up to 210 bedrooms.  The business spokespeople need to wake up about this type of development, which is imposing living spaces on people in their 20s and 30s, and perhaps in their 40s, 50s and 60s, for which the rent will be so expensive that they will never be in a position to save to buy their own home.  We will have an end to the home-owning democracy in our cities and that is what Fine Gael will have delivered in government.  If the presentation on Sligo applied to Dublin, we would recognise the need for a vibrant urban space with good transport systems and opportunities to walk and cycle and where attractive family living was possible.  All these things are being driven out of Dublin by a superfinancialised model which is leading to the emptying out of the city.</p> <p>  Is the Dublin Chamber of Commerce concerned about the future of Dublin?  Many venues, from theatres to pubs, are disappearing from Dublin, falling before globalised finance which wants to invest in Dublin because the rental returns here are bigger than the returns in a place like California.  The chambers represent businesses and they probably know what this is like.</p><p>If Dublin Chamber of Commerce is seeking workers, in terms of being able to afford rents, people will not be able to live near where they are likely to work.  A crisis is developing in Dublin.  Has Dublin Chamber of Commerce a sense of that?  I agree with much of the presentation, but to be honest, it is as if we are in the run-in again to the previous crash.  We are now overdeveloping at a point where we risk bringing the whole thing down on everybody&rsquo;s head.</p></speech>

We did a recent survey of our members and the cost and availability of housing is an issue for two thirds of businesses.  Businesses are very cognisant of the impact of this on their employees.  It creates great difficulties in filling open positions when businesses cannot find people to fill roles.  The average national salary is &euro;45,000 and the average Dublin rent is more than &euro;2,000.  Therefore, the asking price is out of reach for anybody on that type of salary.</p> <p>  We have put much thought into some of the solutions we can put forward on that.  We know lack of residential capability in the city is putting a drag on the economy and will into the future.  We know we need greater density.  I agree with the Deputy, particularly in terms of within the canal cordon.  Dublin Chamber of Commerce is always focused on both the economic and social well-being of the city and, therefore, the first element of a liveable city is about Dublin being an active walking and cycling city.  It is then about a reliance on public transport once we get outside the walking and cycling distances.  We know that even just adding one storey onto a one-acre site gives us 20 new housing units.  We need densification in all ways, not just in height.  We need greater densification and infill on brownfield sites.</p> <p>  In our submission we have identified quite a number of available sites that should be focused on such as the Jamestown Business Park in Finglas, the Dublin Industrial Estate in Glasnevin, sites near the Malahide Road in Coolock and a large tranche along the Naas Road.  Those should be a priority if we are focused on areas along public transport routes.  I agree housing is a critical issue for the economy and our individual businesses.  The number one and number two issues are infrastructure and transport, and housing, which are raised constantly.  They should not be business issues but they are.  We have identified many proposals in that respect.  On the issue of social housing, while the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and other such elements are useful, social housing provision needs to be accelerated by Government to increase the overall supply side with respect to the number of houses.</p></speech>

I have always found it a go-to organisation during my time in public life.  Equally, their contribution to the strategic policy committees and the overall development of my region is excellent and their help in response to public representation is superb.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  Will the delegates from Chambers Ireland and Dublin Chamber of Commerce set out for the committee the cost of the proposed budget measures they have put forward in their pre-budget submissions?  They have dealt in their submissions with the issue of sustainable and affordable housing.  What budget measures would they propose to implement to address that issue?  Will the witnesses suggest any other budgetary measures that would be worth pursuing to help increase labour support?</p> <p>  I commend the living city initiative.</p><p>Is there a combined strategy among the chambers of commerce to ensure the various locations seeking the living city initiative, such as my own region of Dundalk and Drogheda, get it, and how is the work progressing?</p><p> I wish to briefly raise three personal issues.  As you know, Chairman, I do not take the full five minutes allocated to me and I will not be coming back in.  As a relatively new D&aacute;il Deputy since 2016, I am also relatively new to travelling into a gridlocked Dublin.  Are the witnesses looking at solutions to solve the gridlock on the M1?  It is blatantly obvious to me from 6 a.m.  I am anxious to hear what debates are going on about the movement of lorries and the gridlock not just on the M1 but on many other access roads.  It strikes me that much of the traffic is heading to the port to coincide with ferry travel times.  Have the witnesses considered what incentives could be used to get the lorries into the port at an earlier time that would help people who are trying to commute into the city?</p><p> My final two points relate to Brexit.  Do the witnesses have a view on the need for an all-Ireland economic zone on the island to solve many of the issues relating to the Single Market and the difficulties with trade?  Have the witnesses considered the impact of the proposed tariff regime that will be introduced in the context of no deal, and what impact it will have on their businesses?  That would have a significant impact on the Border region.  The type of goods we are talking about will impact on the business community in Dublin and the wider region.</p></speech>

First, the thrust of our proposed budget measures is to keep the capital investment going.  The capital investment has been clearly outlined.  While we could debate which project should be in the capital plan, we are desperately crying out for investment around the country to make up for the ten-year gap we had during the recession and financial crisis.  Our strong message is that no matter what happens we must keep the investment going and not have a lull.  From that perspective, we feel there is very little financial implication of our budgetary thrust.  We want to ensure we spend the money.  In terms of what Deputy Breathnach said at the end of his contribution, that is a vitally important aspect of the Brexit debate as well, that we continue to ensure Ireland's ports, roads and airports, among other infrastructure, continue to facilitate the more complex trade that will arise.</p> <p>  We have a strong set of recommendations on sustainable and affordable housing.  At a Chambers Ireland level we are seeking to come up with an overlay of the challenges facing the big cities and the growing cities under Project Ireland 2040, as well as towns such as Sligo, Athlone, Dundalk and Drogheda, which were allocated special status in the strategy.  Deputy Breathnach will be very familiar with the work of colleagues such as Mr. Paddy Malone, Mr. Eddie Phelan and Ms Shona McManus in Chambers Ireland groups along the M1 corridor.  We very much leave it to those local groups.  Mr. Paddy Malone, for example, presented at previous discussions to the committee on the fantastic work his group is doing in those areas to grow the Drogheda-Dundalk corridor.</p> <p>  In terms of labour supply, Chambers Ireland has a very strong set of recommendations on an inclusive and future-focused workforce, including access to quality childcare and how we can encourage greater female participation in the workforce.  That is one opportunity for us.  We are very conscious that the shortage of housing creates difficulties in terms of people moving to jobs and also the opportunity to bring resources into the country to help us deal with the labour shortages.</p> <p>  I hesitate to come up with a view on an all-island economic zone.  It is still developing.  We are talking very closely to our counterparts in Border counties.  It is great to have Mr. Doyle from Sligo and we speak regularly to our colleagues in Letterkenny, Dundalk, Drogheda, Cavan and Cootehill, among others, about the issues they face.</p><p>That is very challenging, so we are always as focused as we can be on the issues that may arise.</p><p> We have not looked at the detail of the impact of the proposed reintroduction of duty-free shopping from a national perspective.  However, I would like to think that if we compare the level of trade activity Ireland undertakes with both the UK and the rest of the world in 2019 versus the level of economic activity and exporting it undertook in 1994, there are two very different numbers.  I would hope it will not have as significant an impact as it might have had in 1993-1994, when I recall concern in the media that the loss of duty-free shopping would have a big impact.</p></speech>

Our focus on infrastructure is not so much on outlining new spending plans as suggesting fiscal measures that could be put in place to ensure that spending plans in the capital envelope will be delivered consistently as planned in the coming years.  The lead feature in our submission has been in the enterprise space.  For any proposal we have in that regard, to the extent that we have been able to cost it, a cost is included.</p> <p>  Our headline ask relates to cutting capital gains tax, CGT, for unlisted trading firms to 20%.  That would start to compete with the UK, which has introduced a similar scheme called investor relief, specifically with a view to encouraging equity investment in its small and medium enterprise, SME, base.  Thanks to a parliamentary question Deputy Quinlivan's colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, submitted for us last year, we were able to get an idea of the thinking of the Department of Finance on this and how much work it had done on it with a view to seeing where Ireland was in comparison with the UK on investor relief.  We were informed that the Department is unable to calculate the cost of introducing the same scheme as the UK because tax returns do not identify the amount of the chargeable gains that are associated specifically with unlisted firms.  Cuts in CGT and the cost for, say, every 5% or less are outlined in the Tax Strategy Group papers but those are static costings.  It is worth bearing in mind that the whole point of this proposal is to have an effect on changing the pattern of investment towards unquoted firms rather than listed firms.  One would need a dynamic costing rather than a static one.</p> <p>  We appreciate that it would probably have significant Exchequer implications in the short term, which is the reason, as Ms Burke outlined, we have suggested this as a goal to move to in the medium term while outlining a couple of more targeted measures that could be adopted in budget 2020 and in the coming years.  We have led with entrepreneur relief.  Our request to raise the lifetime cap on qualifying gains to &euro;15 million, in the case of entrepreneur relief, would cost &euro;84 million.  Again, that is a static costing from the Department of Finance.  The proposal relating to the research and development tax credit would cost &euro;30 million.  In terms of a reduction in the rate of income tax relating to dividends for entrepreneurs to 30%, we would be looking at a figure less than &euro;95 million.  I say less because we estimate that &euro;95 million is what it would cost to reduce the rate of income tax on income from shared dividends in Irish resident companies universally to 30%.  Limiting that to shares received by entrepreneurs or dividends from shares sold by entrepreneurs would limit it to a fraction of that figure.  Further details are contained in our submission.</p></speech>

It is worth pointing out also that it has a measurable cost to the economy.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has estimated the annual cost to the economy of gridlock and traffic congestion in the greater Dublin area at approximately &euro;350 million.  That is due to rise to &euro;2 billion per annum by 2031.  When we take into consideration the impact of future carbon fines, the amount will be even higher.  We have a range of proposals regarding the infrastructure projects we believe should be prioritised.  Those are outlined in the infrastructure section of our submission.</p><p>We are also working with local authorities to try to promote investment in cycling as a means of addressing that.</p></speech>

I want to mention the chamber in Limerick in particular.  It has been very successful and professional.  It had a great impact on the revitalisation of the city.</p><p>Ms Burke stated that foreign direct investment is critical to the Irish economy.  I agree 100%.  She indicted that there needs to be a step change regarding SME investment.  This may result in a more stable economy.  Deputy Munster and I recently launched a policy on an Irish enterprise agency that would be similar to IDA Ireland but with a focus on SMEs.  The idea was to examine the role of local enterprise offices and determine why some work really well while others do not.  It is to have a more co-ordinated system.  Would our guests have an opinion on such an idea?</p><p>I was interested in Mr. Doyle's comments on the Living City initiative.  What pitfalls does he envisage?  It has been in Limerick for a number of years.  It has not been very successful.  We would like to know what could be done to make it better, not just for Limerick but also for other regional cities and towns, such as Sligo.</p><p>Gridlock is a massive problem, as other Deputies stated.  I do not drive to Dublin because it is quicker to use public transport.  I can walk to the local train station in Limerick and get the Luas when I get off in Dublin.  I drove to the D&aacute;il from Limerick once or twice and noted it takes much longer than public transport.  Therefore, we should consider enhancing public transport.</p><p>The main topics we are talking about, namely, Brexit and climate change, have been identified clearly in the submissions.  They are probably the biggest generational challenges we will face in the coming years.  How do the delegates square their comments with their call for a reduction in capital gains tax and their comments on dividends and tax cuts?  We do need investment.</p><p>A detailed submission shows that only 10% of the members of Cork Chamber of Commerce believe tax cuts should be the emphasis in the budget, whereas 40% indicated that there should be an improvement in public services.  How can one improve public services if taxes are to be cut?  Dublin Chamber of Commerce has called for the extension of the <font color="#2F2F2F">special assignee relief programme</font>, SARP, regime to SMEs.  It is a terribly discredited regime.  It gave people who earned over &euro;100 million in 2016 the benefit of the tax break.  Tax breaks worth &euro;18 million were given to very high earners.  How do the delegates envisage the extension of the scheme to SMEs benefiting a country facing a hard Brexit and a serious climate change crisis?</p></speech>

Foreign direct investment has been industrial policy since the late 1950s and into the 1960s and it has been very successful.  Our foreign direct investment is probably responsible for half of our economic output and approximately one third of the jobs.  While over 99% of the enterprises in the country are SMEs, they employ in the region of two thirds of the people.  The Future Jobs Ireland report has identified a number of areas that need to be addressed, and we are working with businesses to identify them in respect of the use of technology, particularly, and productivity.  The aim is ultimately to make the businesses grow.  There are, however, institutional barriers.  We need to identify those SMEs that need support to grow, not the SMEs that do not wish to grow.  There is a certain cohort that we need to identify in order to support its ambition to grow.  We have a number of proposals in place to deal with it.  Mr. Quigley will talk us through those.</p> <p>  In the longer term, we need to broaden the economic base in terms of jobs and economic output while not dialling down on foreign direct investment.  It is more about increasing the productivity of our SME sector.  I will ask Mr. Quigley to talk about some of the specific initiatives we have described in the proposal.</p></speech>

Deputy Quinlivan referred to the comments of members of Cork Chamber of Commerce on tax cuts.  We had similar comments from our members, who would prefer investment in infrastructure and housing to tax cuts.  There are different forms of taxation.  Our income tax regime is broadly based and highly progressive.  When it comes to corporate taxes, our key ask is to apply a lower tax rate, of 20%, to certain types of gains.</p><p>We have sought to target those in areas that will help to broaden the economy.  Irish entrepreneurs are subject to a tax of 33% on all gains. The UK, our closest neighbour, has a 10% tax rate applying to gains of up to &euro;10 million.  We feel that is a disadvantageous net position.  Increasing our entrepreneur relief up to, say, &euro;15 million, is based on a static costing model.  It has been found before in the past that when capital gains tax rates were reduced by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government and the then Minister, Charlie McCreevy, the capital gains tax take actually doubled.</p><p> Reducing capital gains tax brings it back into being subject to tax.  When entrepreneurs sell their businesses and structure it in a way that capital gains tax arises or does not, they can choose to stay in Ireland, reinvest and be serial entrepreneurs or go abroad and not pay tax here at all.  When we talk about tax reductions, we are talking about targeted tax reductions to help stimulate and support a small constituency that is contributing to the broadening of our base.  What we have done brilliantly in this country over the past 60 years is to embrace foreign direct investment, FDI.  There are many headwinds in that space.  We are trying to focus on being proactive in supporting our indigenous entrepreneurial bases.  With the headwinds coming in with international tax changes that will run against Ireland, we will have to embrace what we can control.  We cannot control international tax policy changes but we can control how we treat our domestic entrepreneurs.  The targeted measures we are looking at are improving entrepreneur relief and as, Ms Mary Rose Burke said in her opening statement, applying a lower rate to investment in small and medium-sized companies.  That is designed to focus activity in active companies that are contributing to employment and the robustness of our economy.  While they are reductions, we feel they are productive and focused which, based on experience, would yield more tax than net costings.</p><p> Ms Mary Rose Burke referred to the potential phasing in of some of these measures.  Since there is some fiscal space in the current environment and the experience of capital gains tax reduction yielding more tax, we suggest there is merit in embracing these changes and seeing what impact they have on the economy.</p><p> There are other certain measures on which we have focused such as research and development tax credits, along with an upfront cash refund to small and medium-sized enterprises that are always in a desperate need of cash.  That latter proposal is costed at &euro;30 million but would be stimulative.</p><p> Particular aspects of the special assignee relief programme, SARP, have been referred to and have been widely covered in the media, with uses of it to deal with high wages.  Our submission proposes applying SARP to small and medium-sized enterprises that are seeking to compete with the multinational sector.  The latter are exciting and brilliant companies that can offer their employees share options, large remuneration packages and job security.  Jobs in the SME sector cannot advertise in the same way.</p><p>Sorry, I am jumping around slightly.  We have referred to some measures to improve the KEEP regime to make it more applicable in helping to attract employees into those SME areas, but on the SARP side there is a war for talent in our city.  We are in very good economic condition but, again, the multinationals have the ability to pull in foreign talent, which helps develop and embed their businesses in Ireland.  What we are asking for is a level playing field for our SMEs to bring in talent to help our SMEs get established.  The number of people who have availed of SARP at the &euro;1 million level referred to would be relatively small.  SARP is a very valuable relief for many businesses.  In looking to apply it to SMEs, I would say very few if any SMEs would look to pay people in excess of &euro;1 million.  SMEs are looking to bring in key talent, and in getting that level playing field there is a question of fairness and what it can do for the economy in embedding the SMEs and supporting them.  That is well worth considering.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Quinlivan for his comments about Limerick.  It is a very good example.  Limerick County Council under Mr. Conn Murray and the local chamber are working together, which has certainly helped, and Limerick is looking great these days, so well done to all concerned there.</p> <p>  Regarding the concept of help for our SMEs, yes, there is a gap where the IDA is helping FDI, Enterprise Ireland is helping a limited number of high-potential start-ups, and the LEOs are down at the county enterprise board-plus level.  The one thing I will say is that what we are working very closely at, as an organisation, is trying to make sure that our chambers come forward with a single message in every county.  The message is one of looking for investment and engagement with the local authority and the LEO in the chamber's area.  We see that there is real potential for LEOs and the chambers working together with local authorities.  I would potentially have a concern just about a new organisation with new funding actually pushing chambers out.  As a chamber network, we are called a not-for-profit.  It is a frustrating description because we have to go out and encourage members to join and pay us money to do the work we do.  We do not like to see ourselves frozen out by additional State investment in an area where we think we can really help.  Yes, there is room for it, but we would like to think that the structures are potentially already there if we give the right signals to the committee's network of State organisations and our network of chambers to work together to invest in those areas.</p> <p>  Going back to the M1 issues and so on, this is why in our submission we have really focused on the need to continue to invest in public transport.  I was delighted to see that this week Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has been able to invest in capital stock for the first time in ten years.  In response to Deputy Breathnach, I live in Malahide, so I see the Dundalk trains coming in and how jammed they are and I see people leaving Malahide and driving into town every morning and I wonder why they do not get the DART.  To some extent, however, they do not because at key times there are not enough trains or they are very full.  Therefore, that critical investment to make the most of infrastructure we already have and the need to keep putting in new structures, such as the new metro project, are vital for us in ensuring we learn as we build out growing cities under the national planning framework, Project Ireland 2040, and ensuring we learn from what Dublin did right and what we could have done better.</p> <p>  Regarding Brexit and climate change, tomorrow Chambers Ireland will bring out an announcement that all our chambers around the country have signed up to a pledge on the sustainable development goals.  As a network going back to our community base, we are very focused on the need to drive business forward on climate change.  I ask the committee to consider, for example, the necessary changes we will need to make in our grid, the types of fuels we use and the potential to retool people around the country to work on climate change projects rather than traditional power generation projects.  Tying in to that, we need to encourage entrepreneurs and increased enterpreneurial activity.  We need to encourage people to go out with new ideas, start up new businesses and so on.</p><p>We have been very focused on infrastructure this year, but we will always, in the background, have things that we need to encourage our entrepreneurs.  We encourage people to become entrepreneurs and have a go, thus generating more employment and some additional wealth that we can push into the economy.  My colleague, Mr. Doyle, may wish to talk about the living city initiative, LCI.</p></speech>

We would like to broaden the remit so the initiative covers not just old buildings but also long-term vacant commercial and residential properties.  I know from working in the Atlantic economic corridor, AEC, on the west coast that a lot of the urban towns and cities on the AEC regularly appear high up on the vacant property statistics.  That is one of the reasons we believe that the initiative not only should be extended past May 2020 but also should be rolled out in other urban towns and include the long-term vacant commercial properties.</p></speech>

It is not to displace the chambers but to strengthen LEOs, which I believe do very good work in some areas but not in other areas.  Some business people I have met have told me that they struggle with LEOs in some parts.  I have also met some business people who told me that they approached LEOs but did not get any help.  A more co-ordinated approach is needed to strengthen the economy so that we are not totally reliant on FDI, although I know it is crucial  I thank the witnesses for their responses.</p></speech>

We have been having Brexit debates here virtually every week, if not every day, and last week the key issue arose of what the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, did last year with his &euro;300 million and what may have to happen if we still get a massive hit to our revenues of maybe &euro;6 billion in the following year, today's encouraging news notwithstanding.  Should we be thinking along these terms at all of introducing tax relief?  The witnesses mentioned capital gains and the Charlie McCreevy era, but that was a fundamentally different era and the world has moved on very seriously since then.  To echo the Minister in some respects, is it not time to be prudent on taxation?</p> <p>  On wages and the demand side, what does the chambers do to encourage members to pay a living wage or to move towards that level of wages in, say, the vast area of service firms on the high street that we are familiar with?  Has the chambers a policy of encouraging companies that are doing quite well to pay workers a premium and therefore stimulate demand?  Obviously if people are better paid, they have more money to spend in the economy.  Is that something the chambers has given any consideration to?</p> <p>  On decarbonisation, I am sure chambers has members around the country who are in the car industry.  Do the witnesses think that they have done enough, or have they done anything whatsoever in many cases, to encourage people to move towards buying electric vehicles, hybrids or whatever?  We have heard from the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, one of chambers's sister organisations and a motor industry body, that the 2030 targets are simply impossible and that we could not be like Norway and roll out 90,000 chargers, or whatever it is that the Norwegians have, or that kind of encouragement in that regard.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned indigenous business.</p><p>Obviously indigenous business can be very heavily impacted by a reliance on the British market, North-South trade and so on.   There is a link with FDI because many companies have flourished due to being contractors and provided cleaning and all kinds of services to Google up the road and so on.  The organisations have echoed the Taoiseach by calling for hypothecated taxes.  We have not had such taxes before.  Most economists would now say that there is a strong case for doing so.  A lot of us are concerned about poorer households.  It is great for us to move towards the 2025 or 2030 targets.  However, the levels of fuel poverty that we have seen in the past, which affected between 15% and 20% of the population, are so profound that we cannot afford to leave poorer households behind. </p><p> Lastly, we should strive for the cities of Sligo and Limerick, and all of our great cities around the country, to become vibrant regional centres and that Dublin becomes a world-class capital.  Recently I was struck by the fact that a certain European capital that is only one third the size of Dublin has, unlike us, a tram service to an airport.  The tram line was built in the last couple of years without hysterical debate.  Much of Dublin city does not have a fixed line.  We still wait for a Luas to be built in Cork city and Galway city.  </p></speech>

Infrastructure is the building block for a competitive city in the future.  We work under the umbrella of Dublin 2050.  I mean we try to envisage what a competitive city in 2050 will look like and what type of city people will choose to live in, work in, invest in and visit.  The elements that make a competitive city are very multi-layered and touch on areas of place and so on, as mentioned by Mr. Talbot.  It is very much seeing where the competitive cities are and what is it that they do well.  When we identify competitive cities they, typically, have a very good public transport system plus affordable and accessible housing.  It is no surprise that the business community has identified these aspects as the biggest challenges.</p> <p>  In terms of the tax issues that have been mentioned and whether this is the budget in which to do so, we are very much in the space that it is important to have a prudent budget but, equally, we must be careful not to wear Brexit goggles.  Come what may with Brexit or changes in America or the East that influence global investment, there will always be challenges.  For a small globalised country we have to very much consider what is within our control and what we can do about our competitiveness and attractiveness as a place in which to live, work, invest in and create jobs.  Mr. Quigley went into some details about some of the tax measures, particularly to support entrepreneurship that would very much help competitiveness, create jobs and help sustainable businesses here in Ireland.  It really goes contrary to the national interest that we incentivise people to invest in bluechip companies yet not invest in indigenous Irish companies that need investment.  </p> <p>  The ESRI has identified in a report that about &euro;1 billion has been missed in terms of investment in SMEs if they were to operate at the same level of productivity and innovation.  We know SMEs want to invest in research and innovation but they cannot do so because cash is tight and, therefore, we have brought forward measures to stimulate that type of activity.  We need that level of job creation, research and development, and innovation to build out a sustainable indigenous business base that will protect us regardless of the challenges.  There is a risk of a very competitive UK and it is already more attractive than us to entrepreneurs.  Whether the UK stays or leaves we need to look at what is within our control.  Perhaps Mr. Quigley wishes to build on the specifics of that.          </p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned that prudence is required.  I think everyone will agree with him on that but this is also a time to be proactive.</p> <p>  In terms of Brexit, the UK has a wonderful regime that supports entrepreneurs but it also has a more favourable personal tax regime for Irish entrepreneurs who might want to set up a location in the UK.</p><p>In preparing for Brexit, who knows what way it will go?  We are exposed in this area, however, because the UK authorities have moved to make the UK much more attractive from a taxation perspective in recent years.  Its corporation tax rate is 17%.  The UK economy is much larger than our economy and its corporation tax rate is getting closer to our 12.5% rate.  To a certain extent we have to mark our closest neighbour in preparing for Brexit because if the UK gets clear of the European Union, as many politicians in the UK wish, it will be free from many of the state aid restrictions that apply to us.  We can introduce certain broad based targeted measures to apply to SMEs.  In one sense, I would use the term "proactive" rather than "prudent".  They are not imprudent and when one gets away from static costings, I have a strong belief, with which most economists would agree, that these targeted capital gains tax measures we are suggesting will yield more tax that they would cost us.</p></speech>

We all become frustrated by those who do not join organisations.  Our collective membership across networks is about 10,000, which means that 190,000 companies or trading enterprises are not members of Chambers Ireland.  We possibly appeal to certain types of companies.  Different policies work at different times.</p> <p>  Tomorrow, we are bringing out a pledge that Chambers Ireland will adopt the sustainable development goals.  Issues such as quality of work are key components of that.  We are focused on that area.</p> <p>  On the car industry, we are all looking at the numbers for 2030 and the very substantial change we need to make.  A key point is that alternatives exist to which people can migrate, but there is a very serious concern that there are not enough charging points for electric vehicles and there are issues around hogging of charging points and so on.  In the past 12 months, I have been to Norway and Finland where I looked at the relative performance of those countries.  In Norway, every second car is an electric car.  This is based on a combination of factors.  First, a wide range of incentives is available to encourage people to buy electric cars, including free parking and significantly reduced taxation.  In addition, most houses already have a charging point because people plug in their cars during the winter to keep the battery protected.  Norway already had an infrastructure that coincidentally enables it to roll out a significant number of charging points very rapidly.  That is something we do not have, which presents an extra challenge for us.  We need alternatives and we need some sort of carrot and stick incentives.  We need more carrots.  There is the question of expense.  Electric cars for the mass market still look very expensive and until more people globally start buying electric cars and the production lines get more efficient in bringing the prices down, we are facing a challenge.  While it is a major challenge, we cannot ignore it and we must continue to make progress.  We must make tough decisions on this.</p> <p>  Fuel poverty is a concern and we need the grid to protect the poorest in society who will be disproportionately affected by the imposition of a carbon tax on a bag of coal.  We need to invest in the grid infrastructure and alternative technologies to bring forward the opportunity to ensure we can either subsidise people who are challenged or provide viable alternatives.</p> <p>  A major bugbear for Chambers Ireland as a network is that we are constantly calling for capital projects to be delivered as there are constant challenges around finding the investment and with the planning process with projects being deferred.  For example, Cork Chamber was very vociferous when the Dunkettle interchange project, which is vital infrastructure for Cork, was deferred for a year.  When we explored this issue, we found that an argument can be made that the procurement system is working because the system was saying that we needed to re-evaluate this project to ensure we are getting value for money and do not end up with a big cost overrun.  The clock is ticking on all these projects.</p><p>Infrastructure projects, such as those relating to more tram lines, DART underground and so on, are not happening quickly enough in Dublin and other cities.  Our population is growing and people's quality of life is being impacted upon.  This is an enormous issue for us and, to be honest, I think we are all on the same page in respect of it.</p></speech>

The research and development tax credit has absolutely ballooned to approximately &euro;700 million and, overwhelmingly, this money is going to a handful of multinational corporations, the names of which names we are all familiar with.  In the interests of developing a sustainable economy, should that money not be redirected towards SMEs and public universities rather than being extended to another group of people?  I am of the view that it should be redirected.  I do not see why Apple should get a research and development tax credit for coming up with the latest upgrade to its iPhone 11 Pro.  Directing money towards such an upgrade should not be a priority.  Why do we not invest the money in projects that will benefit the domestic economy?</p> <p>  To follow up on what Deputy Broughan stated, would our guests agree that any consideration the Minister for Finance might be giving to holding back on social welfare increases or introducing measures that might reduce the spending power of ordinary working people is completely wrong in the face of Brexit or a possible international recession?  Should we not be boosting the purchasing power of ordinary people because that would benefit Chambers Ireland members and also prevent suffering and hardship being visited on ordinary working people as a result of economic turbulence or difficulty?</p> <p>  I welcome the comments on public transport, childcare, infrastructure and so on.  Will our guests elaborate on those?  What do we mean when we refer to investing more in public transport in order to tackle climate change, alleviate congestion, etc.?  We should move to free public transport because that would really encourage people to abandon their cars.  There must be far greater frequency on public transport routes, greater reliability and public transport routes that are run on a not-for-profit basis.  The latter could be operated in areas where they are not commercially viable, in the narrow sense, in order to get people to use public transport.  Do our guests agree that we need to heavily subsidise public transport systems?  One could make the same argument about childcare.  What do they have to say about the blight of vacant shop units and vacant accommodation units above shops?  What should be done to prevent such units becoming vacant?  There are units on the main street in D&uacute;n Laoghaire that have been empty for years.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Quigley will elaborate on that.  The Minister for Finance has choices to make in the context of social welfare.  During these proceedings, we have prioritised Chambers Ireland's perspective on the need to invest in infrastructure.  We wrote our submission several weeks ago.  As matters in the UK have continued to evolve, we have become increasingly aware of the need for a Brexit-focused budget and to retain HAP investment as a core principle.  We have not formed any views on whether social welfare payments should be increased.</p><p>We just focus on what business is looking for in order to maintain a strong business environment and ensure that businesses employ people, generate revenue and pay taxes, VAT, PAYE, PRSI, etc.</p><p> Across our network, we have significant and consistent asks in respect of investment in public transport.  We have consistently gone out and done things such as the DART underground and metro north, which has evolved into the metro project.</p><p> On the need to service particular areas, I will stray into Dublin's expertise because we can learn from its experience in developing other cities.  I refer, for example, to BusConnects and how that will evolve.  Much of this comes back to the need to continue to secure investment in order to continue to invest money in these projects, which Chambers Ireland will continue to support.</p><p> We need to ensure that the planning system is capable of ensuring we can deliver these programmes in good time and at a reasonable expense.  The committee will be familiar with the DART infrastructure.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann still has plans, including that which would involve moving the northern line to the docklands.  We need to go ahead with these things and explain to people what they will mean.  People might be slightly discommoded in the context of making the journeys they are used to, but we need to explain that because we are going to live in a sustainable fashion into the future, we need to detach ourselves from cars and have the right public transport infrastructure in place.  It is for this that Chambers Ireland has consistently called.</p><p> We have some recommendations on vacant shop units.  We are equally concerned about them.

There is great variety on that street now.  Large stores are being left vacant in other areas and this is causing concern for some chambers.  It is very much an issue, and it goes back to our desire to see town centres grow and thrive and communities created.  We are very much in favour of measures to ensure that many of these matters will be progressed.</p></speech>

In terms of the unallocated budgetary package available, there is room to adopt targeted measures in a couple of different areas.  We proposed several for consideration in the area of enterprise.  In terms of the cost of living, which is the broader issue for the committee, the main aspect does not relate to wage costs.  The labour market is quite buoyant, but there is a focus on it because of the high cost of living due to issues such as housing and public transport.</p> <p>  On the specifics relating to public transport, there are other cities in which free public transport services can and have worked.  I am not sure whether Dublin can adopt that on a large scale just yet.  The main problem for Dublin is that the necessary infrastructure is not in place rather than it being a case that there is a price issue for the average commuter.  That is why we have detailed a lot of projects that we think need to be prioritised.  I refer to what is now called the DART expansion programme, which relates to a number of improvements to the system over several years.  The underground element, the DART interconnector, has been talked about in one form or another since 1971.  There has been virtually no progress half a century later and it has been subject to multiple plans, revisions and postponements.  It is now being looked at again for some sort of lower-cost technical solution.  In the absence of any progress on that, we would like to see progress on other elements of the expansion programme.  We want to ensure that we do not do the same thing with MetroLink and that, at the least, the northern element of that project will be delivered.</p> <p>  In terms of the research and development tax credit, our short answer would be that it is not an either-or.  There certainly is an SME need for it.</p><p>I will defer to Mr. Quigley for the specifics on research and development tax credits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-24a.315" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoghan Quigley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019092400002#U00200"><p>The question was broadly on retaining the credit and the Deputy mentioned costings of &euro;700 million.  He asked why we should incentivise Apple in its creation of the iPhone 11.  The overall contribution of foreign internationals to our economy has been quite spectacular.  We are a small peripheral economy on the edge of Europe and the multinationals located here and spending money here have been the bedrock of our economy.  In the past number of years, the focus has been on having real substance in countries.  Given that we want to be a knowledge-based economy, in order for us to attract that substance we need to attract the development of intellectual property, IP, because it is with IP that jobs come.  The &euro;700 million cost in tax is exceptionally good value in terms of the jobs it brings into the economy.  The credit is for qualifying expenditure, which is typically expenditure on high-paid, skilled workers.  Multinationals typically have a cluster of people and will bring further projects, or the skills will already be here and available for the SME sector and the broader economy.  The sum of &euro;700 million for the research and development credit is extremely good value in helping to embed multinationals and it should be protected.</p> <p>  Our submission focuses on making research and development tax credit more attractive for SMEs.  For early stage companies, the most important thing is cash.  The tax credit offsets against corporate tax for the larger multinationals but SMEs often do not pay tax.  They typically get a staggered payout, over three years, of the tax credit against PAYE but we suggest bringing this forward.  We also suggest lifting the 25% credit to 30% for SMEs to support the sector.  Instead of its cost, we should consider the stimulative impact of research and development tax credits on the economy.</p></speech>

To put it even more dramatically, I could talk about the social cleansing of areas like the inner city, as well as some suburbs such as my area.  This is because of the punitive and exorbitant cost of rent and home purchases and the lack of social housing delivery from the Government, leading to the crowding out of sites by cuckoo funds who go on to rent properties out at exorbitant prices.  Do the witnesses accept that this is a problem that needs to be addressed?</p></speech>

We need a multifaceted response.  A vibrant city, and global capital, needs a mosaic of different types of housing for the variety of people who live in the city.  I was a student in the 1980s in Dublin and I compare those days with the vibrancy of now.  Nobody wants to go back to those days but this is what happens when the population jumps from 3.3 million to 4.7 million.  We have a massive demand for housing without the associated public policy that provided a house for everybody.  At the sharp end, we see homelessness and the reliance on social housing and measures such as the housing assistance payment.  We do not think that is the long-term solution and believe the Government should build houses for social purposes across the country, particularly in Dublin.</p></speech>

I will not go over areas that have been discussed already.  Brexit is the key issue dominating all of our days, and sometimes our nights, and today has been a particularly incredible day and one we will study in the coming years.  Ms Burke is correct in that we can only control the things that we can control.  We have to look at our own preparations and how best we can, with the limited resources we have, buffer our own businesses and protect our citizens as best we can because even in the event of a deal, we will still face considerable challenges due to a change to the trading environment.  While there might be some bumps for Dublin in terms of, say, financial services, for the rest of the country it will be a challenge for us.  I am very glad to see Mr. Aidan Doyle here, representing the west, which is where I am from.  I am in a very rural constituency in Mayo, so I am a neighbour of Mr. Doyle.  There is a particular concern around the regions in the event of Brexit but even more generally, as Dublin continues to grow and struggle with the challenges of a fast-growing city, the regions are finding it difficult to compete.</p> <p>  I was in Sligo over the weekend, which has come on a good deal in recent years.  The development around the Garavogue is very good.  There is a good theatre and a lot is happening there.  A good technology industry is being built up there also, which is really exciting.  Chambers Ireland mentioned in its opening statement Ireland 2040.  It is the hope of the entire western region that Sligo will grow and that we will all grow together as one region.  I am sure the delegates from Chambers Ireland will recall the final draft of Ireland 2040 did not include Sligo.  It is meant to be the final draft and there was not supposed to be a great deal of tweaking at that point.  It was compiled after a long process of consultation and all Ministers having their say.  I was gobsmacked when I looked at the map in the final draft and saw there was nothing in it for the north west.  There was nothing in it north of a line one could draw from Galway to Dublin.  We fought very hard to get a regional growth centre and it was a good win for the north west to get Sligo on that map.  I hope it will pay dividends not only for Sligo but for Donegal, Mayo and Leitrim and that we might grow together.</p> <p>  In terms of the infrastructural demands for the north west, there are complaints in Dublin that the DART is overcrowded and the Luas is too slow but we do not really have public transport so that is our biggest complaint.  We do not have motorways.  We have the odd dual carriageway and even our national routes are of poor standing.  From Chambers Ireland's perspective, what are the priority infrastructural developments for the north west to assist it to grow?  </p> <p>  Chambers Ireland referred to the problems in the planning process.  Could the delegates give more detail as to what those issues are?  To take the example of the proposed Apple data centre in Athenry, it has thrown open some challenges.  Much of that related to the court system in that the appeal process and even moving through the court system are quite slow.  Are there other issues in the planning process that could be addressed in the short term to make it a bit easier to move the planning process along?</p> <p>  I met IBEC West yesterday in Medtronic in Galway and a large number of multinationals were represented at that meeting.  The key message from all of them was they are struggling to attract and retain talent.  Housing is a factor.  They are finding it difficult to house people.  They are also are finding it difficult to attract and retain people with engineering, science and mathematics qualifications.  From Chambers Ireland's perspective what could we do in budget 2020 to address the talent issue?</p></speech>

We do not know what will happen but we envisage there will be much more traffic coming down through the west coast, especially in the north west rather than going through the North when, for instance, the destination is Dublin Port.</p><p>There is an opportunity for the north west in terms of opening up and expanding the ports, for example, in Killybegs and down as far as Foynes.  The biggest challenge with Brexit is connectivity on the west coast.</p><p> The planning process is another issue.  It has taken a while for development to be established again in places in the north west and the west.  Nothing really happened from 2006 on.  However, things are now starting to happen.  The word "vibrant" was used a few.  It is very important that towns such as Castlebar in Mayo and towns in Sligo and other counties are seen as vibrant when companies are looking to invest in them.  The first thing companies look for is that the town is vibrant and that people are living there.  The planning process must be relaxed a little in that regard.  Reference was made to people living above shops.  It is very important that it is easy to get planning to allow that to happen and that there are incentives, such as the Living City initiative, in place.</p></speech>

The schemes cannot be restrictive.  I am aware that are properties that have been vacant for some time.  It is important that we push the agenda.</p> <p>  From looking at our members, we are aware of the demographics of the people who are looking to move to the west and north west and that they want to live in the cities.  The talent is there.  In that context, it is very important that people have access to education.  IT Sligo, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, and Letterkenny IT have come together and will be applying for technical university status next year.  That is key to it, not only so that we will attract more talent but also in order that we will have talent available for the next five to ten years.  It is very important that the issue is addressed and that education is available to access.</p></speech>

We share her concern in that regard.  Mr. Doyle dealt comprehensively with the specific issues relating to the north west.  In terms of planning, there is a danger that when one comes up with a good idea that is to be implemented, that when one puts planning down as a concern and one is asked what could be done to change it, it is clear that it is very complicated.  The situation in Athenry was ultimately about the length of time it was taking-----</p></speech>

The project was ultimately approved following a ruling of the Supreme Court ruling but by that stage the investor had moved on due to being weary of the process, which is understandable.

There were constitutional issues concerning limiting who could object.  That was a challenge as well.  We accept that it is very difficult, but we have some recommendations on how the Land Development Agency, for example, might be given more powers to compulsorily acquire land.  This would deal with specific challenges we face in respect of vacant sites.  Unfortunately, it seems that there is no quick or easy solution.  It is clear that planning is a bit like Brexit, in that if the ideal solution was there, somebody would have thought of it by now.  It is a big worry for business given the amount of time, effort and energy that is invested in the planning process, the risk one is taking and the money one is spending, and the weariness of people who have an idea and who want to get on with it.</p></speech>

I am conscious that the Deputy's question was very much rooted in matters relating to the north-west region.  One of one of the initiatives we undertook in 2018 was a national conversation whereby Dublin Chamber of Commerce was involved in sending a roadshow to the other cities listed in the national development plan.</p><p>The roadshow went to Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway asking what did they want for and from their capital city.  The upshot was a shared understanding between the cities that the issues facing cities as centres of economic growth were similar.  Housing and transport were issues for everybody.  So too was attractiveness as a place to bring talent.  In a knowledge economy, the jobs follow the talent.</p><p> We also look at the position internationally.  We understand that the cities and urban areas that do well are those that have academic, business and political leadership that come together with a vision for the area, and take the long-term view.</p><p> I certainly understand the frustration.  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned empty shops.  By the time one's main street has empty shops on it, that is merely an outcome from previous policy decisions.  Typically, when one examines towns where that has happened, one will see that the cinema, swimming pool, schools or supermarkets all moved out to the edges.  Retail is a footfall feeder, not a footfall driver.  By the time one's main street has empty shops, the issues have happened 30 years beforehand.  We need to learn from where measures have worked well and how we plan our urban centres.</p><p> We also need to have a grown-up conversation about the future being urban in Ireland.  The international and global trend is towards urbanisation.  City regions will be the economic hubs for their areas and how we support them properly.</p><p> We are clear that Dublin does not compete with Galway, the mid-west or any other area.  Rather we are competing with other international economic centres.  If something is lost to Dublin, it is lost to the country.  It is not available for disbursement around the city.  We need to pull together.</p><p> We are finalising a big piece of work that we will be sharing with various Deputies on countries where the capital city is successful and where the reputation of the city internally is strong.  There is a number of issues around city regions, urbanisation and that leadership, but also decrying a current problem without understanding the root cause that, typically, has happened 20 years ago.</p></speech>

My name is Elaine Geraghty.  I am CEO of Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, and I am accompanied by two member producers, Ms Siobh&aacute;n Ward of Crossing the Line Films who produced such content as "The Game", "The Farthest" and "A Wild Irish Winter"; and Mr. Stephen Rooke of Tile Films, who produced "Aerial Ireland", "Sacred Sites" and "A Terrible Beauty".</p> <p>  Before commenting on section 481 and its importance to the Irish screen industry, I want to provide an overview of Screen Producers Ireland and our members work.  SPI is the national representative organisation of over 100 independent film, television and animation production companies.  The Irish independent production sector comprises a diverse range of companies of different sizes, spread across the country, producing content for television, cinema release and online distribution.  These companies, most of which are in the SME bracket, produce high-quality content in English and Irish, which is culturally relevant and loved by Irish and global audiences.  Irish independent productions have been lauded worldwide, including this year when SPI member, Element Pictures produced "The Favourite", a multi-nominated Oscar winning film.  Other film and TV drama productions made by our members include, Fastnet Films, "Black 47", Samson Films, "Float above the Butterfly", Ripple World Pictures,  "Never Grow Old", Abu Media, "Finky" and Metropolitan Films, "Vikings".  Television productions made by our members include Indie Pics, "Ear to the Ground&rsquo;, Coco Content, "First Dates Ireland", Crossing the Line Films, "The Game", Sea Fever, "Ireland&rsquo;s Deep Atlantic" and Tile Films, "Sacred Sites".</p> <p>  In terms of what we do and the role of a producer, the Irish film and TV sector is a vibrant industry with a sophisticated infrastructure of production companies, studios, service companies and expertise, all of which provide valuable employment in the Irish economy.  Irish producers within that infrastructure are entrepreneurs who contribute significantly to the enterprise economy and bridge the divide between commerce and culture.  Producers are responsible for the creative, financial and statutory management of the individual projects in which they are involved.  They are engaged in all elements of production from the earliest stages of commissioning of concept, rights acquisition, development, sourcing of finance, pre-production, production, post-production to delivery, marketing, distribution and compliance.</p><p>Financing production is challenging, and funding opportunities can be limited.  Available funding for producing content includes a mixture of the TV licence fee, Broadcasting Authority of Ireland Sound &amp;amp; Vision funding, Creative Europe MEDIA funding, the Irish Language Broadcast Fund, section 481 tax relief and private financing.  The importance of section 481 in this funding mix cannot be overestimated.</p><p> Ireland has a long history of supporting the Irish TV and film industry through fiscal incentives, the most important of which was originally introduced in 1987, namely section 481.  While having experienced a number of iterations over the years, section 481 remains a crucial component to the sustainability and growth of the Irish independent production sector.  It is absolutely necessary if Ireland's film and TV industry is to continue to develop and thrive because those countries with which Ireland competes have similar or comparable incentives, a point also made by the Irish Tax Institute when it appeared before this committee a couple of weeks ago.  The Government commissioned Olsberg-SPI with the Nordicity company to conduct an economic analysis of the Irish audiovisual industry.  The analysis defined the importance of section 481 as "underpin[ning] the Irish film and TV industry".  The analysis stated, "It provides vital finance to enable Irish producers to make local projects with local content in Ireland, ensures Irish producers remain attractive international co-production partners, and makes Ireland a globally competitive location for co-productions and high-budget inward investment productions."  The analysis recommended the extension of section 481 to 2024, as one of many recommendations to support the growth and sustainability of the Irish screen industry.  The last available full-year total committed figures, for 2017, show a spend of &euro;292 million in the Irish economy as a direct result of section 481-certified projects.  This was spent on goods, services and labour across TV drama, documentary, film and animation.  There were 85 certified projects in that year comprising 11 from animation, 17 from TV drama, 17 from film and 32 from documentary.  Over the past four years there have been some significant big-budget TV drama projects.  I am sure members are familiar with them.  They include "Ripper Street", "Nightflyers", which was made in Troy Studios, "Vikings" and "Into the Badlands".  However, it is also interesting to note that the majority of productions in Ireland are in the budget range of &euro;1 million and under.  Over the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, for example, the percentage of productions whose section 481-eligible expenditure budgets were &euro;1 million or less are 79%, 85% and 83%, respectively.  This reflects the fact that the majority of Irish production companies are in the SME bracket.</p><p> In the run-up to budget 2019, we engaged with the Department of Finance and Revenue on the possibility of extending section 481 beyond 2020.  This engagement has led to better understanding between all stakeholders on the operation of the incentive and to ongoing engagement, which has been very helpful.  In October of last year, the Minster for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, announced the extension of section 481 until December 2024, advising that the extension of the incentive was "to support the continued growth of the film industry in Ireland".  The Minister also announced a new time-limited regional uplift of up to an additional 5%, which will taper out over four years.  The uplift will support the development of new local pools of talent in areas outside the current main production hubs, which tend to be Dublin and Wicklow.  This will help to increase the geographic spread of the screen sector in Ireland and support the overall cultural objective of having an established and sustainable screen industry.  Significantly, the tax incentive moved to a self-assessment model, which came into effect in March of this year.  We believe that this move will make the application process more efficient in the long term.  In the meantime we look forward to the publication of a new set of guidelines by Revenue related to eligible expenditure.  The announcement of the extension was welcome and very important as the lead-in time for film, TV and animation projects from initiation and development to financing and production can span several years.  Certainty around the long-term availability of section 481 is crucial to providing confidence and security to the indigenous industry and to ensuring we can continue to attract direct inward investment from international studios and producers.  Speaking about section 481 last May, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, said: "Section 481 is a key and central component to the Irish screen sector."</p><p>We support this statement by the Minister, which shows the Government's commitment to supporting a strong, vibrant Irish indigenous film industry.</p><p> Delivering quality employment is an obligation of section 481.  The Irish producer company itself employs a core full-time staff who work in the areas of production, development, administration, sales and marketing.  These core staff are involved at all stages of delivering a production, in a process that often takes, as I said, three to four years.  Crew are then hired when a project moves to the production stage and for the duration of that project.  Crew comprise a mix of PAYE and self-employed individuals.  The independent production industry provides significant employment opportunities for crew.  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht commissioned the Olsberg report into economic activity in the audiovisual sector for 2016.  The report stated that there are more than 7,070 full-time equivalents, FTEs, employed in the live action, film, TV and animation sectors.  These sectors of the industry contribute &euro;692 million in gross value added, GVA, and generate &euro;184 million in export earnings.</p><p> Our crew are some of the best in the industry and act as a strong attractor for projects.  This is in part because skills development has always been core to the production industry in Ireland but also because Ireland has been able to attract a diverse range of projects, enabled by section 481.  The introduction of new skills development requirements as part of the section 481 application criteria means we can continue to build on this while it allows us to capture data and information on skills development.  We can track career pathways in the industry as well as identifying and addressing skills gaps.</p><p> Section 481 has a positive impact on the creation of indigenously produced content.  It attracts incoming production and has a positive impact on the creation of quality employment.  It contributes to Ireland's reputation as a global hub for high-tech digital and creative content and has a direct impact on attracting tourism to our country.  The result is that Ireland has become a very attractive location for incoming film and TV production but is able to support indigenous production at the same time.  Expenditure in the Irish economy as a result of section 481 clearly illustrates the need for Ireland to maintain and continue to improve its fiscal incentive, as required.</p><p> I would be very happy to take any questions members may have, as would my colleagues, Ms Ward and Mr. Rooke.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-24a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019092400002#CC00300"><p>I thank SPI for its presentation.  Before I ask a number of questions, I wish to say I am very much in favour of the State providing support to film and all the other arts in the sector, and indeed I would welcome a very significant increase in the budgets for them.  However, I am not, as I suspect the witnesses know, convinced that the way in which section 481 is structured achieves the ends we want in terms of the provision of quality employment and training, which is the legal requirement of section 481, or the development of companies of scale, which 24 years ago the Indecon report said should be the purpose of section 481.  That report strongly criticised the project-by-project nature of the Irish film industry and said section 481 - or section 35, as it was then - was encouraging and perpetuating a project-by-project, short-term film industry which would not result in the development of companies of scale.  Furthermore, the EU, in its guidelines on state aid to the audiovisual sector, pointed out that such aid should deliver the consolidation of the industry through the creation of soundly based production undertakings and the development of a permanent pool of human skills and experience.</p> <p>  I put it to Ms Geraghty that none of that is happening.  For example, SPI and other supporters of section 481 came before the arts committee a year and a half ago and said there were 17,000 whole-time equivalents in the industry, which sounds good.</p><p>Today the figure of 7,000 has been used but there was a counter-point put at that committee from the workers in the industry, who said the figure was actually nearer 2,000 and that very few, if any, of those were secure jobs.  On foot of that debate, the Minister asked for an investigation into the matter.  A study concluded that in 2016 the Revenue Commissioners estimate the number of employees directly engaged in section 481 productions was 2,158.  In other words, SPI and other supporters overstated the level of employment in the film industry deriving from section 481 by 800%.  That is pretty significant from a value for money point of view for the public.  Ms Geraghty might tell us how many of those are permanent or even secure jobs.  One of the things the Indecon report stated way back in 1995 was that what we actually had was a series of micro-companies with a very small number of permanent employees.  That continues to be the situation.  Almost nobody has any security of employment.  There is absolutely nothing to protect workers from wholesale displacement or even blacklisting, which has been alleged by workers in the industry.  Riddle me this; given that section 481 says specifically that it is given on the proviso of the provision of quality employment and training, how can it be that when challenged by workers in the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, SPI's members claim that production companies that apply for and get the relief are not the employers?  I do not see how a company can get a relief to provide quality employment and training and simultaneously claim that it does not employ the crew on those films, but hide behind a designated activity company, DAC, which is an accountancy tool, not a company.  Although the companies that actually apply are standing companies that exist year after year, such as Element Pictures, Metropolitan Films and so on, they claim to have no responsibility whatsoever for the employees.  They claim they are not their employees or trainees.  As a result, nobody has any kind of security.  In terms of training, can anybody even tell me how many trainees have qualified in the different categories of employment over the past ten years?</p></speech>

I will try to answer all of the Deputy's points and if I miss any, he should let me know.  I will just take a step back and talk about the industry and how it is constructed.  I touched on it in the overview that I gave in the first five minutes.  I will ask Stephen and Siobh&aacute;n to speak to this because they are company owners.  The role of production companies and their job is to create opportunities for employment.  I have set out what those producers do and the kind of people who work as part of their core staff.  The responsibility of producers is to find projects, create projects, get them funded, get them produced, make them successful and give the opportunity to create the kind of employment the Deputy is talking about.  That is the role.  The Deputy talked about the EU directive around a permanent pool of talent; I would focus on the word "pool" as opposed to the word "permanent."  Thankfully in this country we have a fantastic pool of very talented crew who work across all of those genres, TV, documentary, drama as the Deputy described, and film.  They have been available and are available.  They are incredibly talented.  We have a permanent pool of workers.  In terms of what that looks like and what their day-to-day looks like, our industry is no different from any other territory where a screen industry exists.  It operates in exactly the same way.</p><p>The role of the producer is to create the opportunity, to be enterprising and create employment opportunities and to add value to the economy.  That is the role of the production company <i>per se</i>.  Often they are managing the opportunity of two, three or four projects at any one time, which is very challenging in its own right, but that is when employment is created.  To suggest it could be any other way is really not accurate.  It cannot be any other way.  The purpose of the pool is that we have available talent and crew when we need it, and we have that.  The Deputy will remember how after the culture committee hearings in the Oireachtas back in January and February, as a direct result of what was being said at those meetings, the film guilds of this country organised to tell the Deputy and those who may have a different view of the industry how their industry works for them and how they wish to work.  Yes, it is project-by-project but the point about what we do as professional producers is that we create as many projects as possible and, ideally, have so many that we can operate and offer work 365 days a year.  That is the model and it is not going to change.  <br/><br/>Let me take a step back to address this idea about not being supported in terms of security and the other words the Deputy used around the sense that perhaps people who are engaged and employed in the industry do not have protections.  We as employers are under the same scrutiny and subject to the same employment legislation as absolutely every other employer in the land.  That is the first thing.  The second thing-----</p></speech>

I appreciate that Deputy Boyd Barrett did go into other areas but I am conscious of the time.  This is a budget committee and we are not revisiting the whole area of what the sectoral committee did earlier in the year.</p></speech>

With the move to a self-assessment model, the producers themselves are individually required to declare that there is compliance with lots of things, including skills development.  One has to put forward a plan in order to get certified in the first instance to be allowed to be considered for section 481 at all.  I refer also to areas such as legislation and quality employment.  In that context, "quality employment" means adherence to all employment legislation.  Producers are required, individually and personally, to give a written declaration that they will be obliged to deliver all of those.  In the context of section 481 as a relief in its own right, regardless of any other discussions in any other committees, that is what is required of a producer.  The Deputy wanted to speak about companies of scale.  I will defer to my colleagues who actually own a company.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-24a.360" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Rooke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019092400002#EE00700"><p>If we are going to look at the concept of companies of scale, we have to understand the television and film business.  There are three major sections within our industry, namely the animation industry, the factual industry and the drama industry.  Companies in those three areas are always on a different scale.  The factual industry is where Tile Films comes from.  We are a company based in D&uacute;n Laoghaire that employs ten people full-time and can employ up to 250 people when we are doing a production.  We are of the same scale as the average factual company based in London, New York or L.A.  When we are looking at section 481 in terms of companies of scale, we have to look at the individual areas.  We have companies of scale here as would be the norm across our industry across the world.  An animation company may have 200 or 300 people employed because of the type of work they make.  A factual company will never have more than ten to 15 people employed full-time.  We are generating projects so we have people in development and finance and people going out selling those concepts to broadcasters around the world.</p><p>Drama companies are a different animal because there is more development work taking place on scripts and so on in a drama company.  By its nature, a drama company will probably grow to a bigger scale.  We have companies of a scale here, such as Metropolitan Films and Element Pictures, that are as big as drama companies in Los Angeles.  It is wrong to say that we are not building companies to scale here.  I think every producer who works in this business is keen to build as big a company as possible.  In reality, companies do not get beyond a certain size when they are not involved in production because when a production company is not making something, it is developing something.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-24a.362" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Siobh&aacute;n Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019092400002#FF00200"><p>With regard to companies of a certain scale, that is not to say that there is not growth within the type of companies that we work in.  Crossing the Line Films started in 1995 to make one film about the Irish Everest expedition.  Now we generally try to have two or three productions at different stages at different times.  It does not go from project to project, with one project being finished, nobody knowing where they stand and then the next one starting.  Projects are constantly getting off the ground while another one is being worked on.  Section 481 has been a key part of that growth.  We had a project, "The Secret Life of the Shannon", which received section 481 funding and was entirely Irish-financed.  That added a layer of production value.  The programme went on to win awards.  The BBC and PBS wanted to license it for their channels so that when we went to them about our next big natural history project, entirely about Ireland and made entirely with Irish crew, they wanted to be in at the start as full commissioning funders with a much larger budget.  Consequently, foreign funding came into the country and allowed us to make a much larger-scale project, with double the budget and double the eligible spend.  That allowed us to grow our company, increase our number of permanent staff and employ a greater number of people on that production.</p> <p>  In high-end creative documentaries, as Ms Geraghty was saying, it is not a six-month shoot after which people are gone.  The project is in development and one could be filming over two years for a natural history programme.  We could have someone sitting in a hide waiting for a badger to do whatever it needs to do.  There is a significant amount of post-production involved in crafting strong narratives to ensure these are films that travel across the world and do not just stay in Ireland.  In addition to the different companies of scale in the different sectors, which Mr. Rooke mentioned, there is growth within the companies.</p></speech>

A figure on the numbers working in the audiovisual sector was cited at a previous session.  Deputy Boyd Barrett would prefer me not to refer to it.  The figure was not from us but from the Olsberg report on the numbers employed in the whole audiovisual industry.  Instead of taking out the element that refers to film, television and animation, which is the 7,070 figure that I stated, it was incorrectly but not intentionally given as 17,000.  The overall figure is actually 16,930.  The Deputy asked if separate work was done.  That work is actually the cost-benefit analysis from the Department of Finance, which was before the committee and gave another number-----</p></speech>

That is like comparing apples with oranges in one sense because the data set is completely different.  The Department of Finance's cost-benefit analysis did not look at post-production, which is a significant part of production.  It came out with a set of numbers over a different period.  The economists are much smarter than I am but we are looking at two different pieces of information.  That Olsberg number was a broad audiovisual number.  If one drills down into our sector, the 7,070 figure is accurate.</p></speech>

We have just finished producing a series called "Aerial Britain" for the Smithsonian Channel in Washington, DC.  Some 60% of our company's turnover in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is export work.  Money comes in to finance programmes that we make for the international marketplace, especially the Smithsonian Channel.  That project had all Irish crew, all Irish post-production, all Irish writers and all Irish composers.  The whole production was based out of D&uacute;n Laoghaire but obviously the filming all took place in the UK.  When the Irish crew steps into the UK or when the director goes to the UK, all of that becomes non-eligible expenditure, but all of the expenditure that happens out of the base is eligible.</p></speech>

That was going to lead me to my second question.

Concerns have been discussed here which I have also raised relating to quality of employment and so on.  Can we drill into some of that?  Ms Geraghty mentioned that there were 85 certified projects in 2017 which availed of section 481 tax relief.  Of those, how many, for that year, equated to the figures that we are talking about relating to employment of 7,070 full-time equivalents?</p></speech>

One of the promises with the Olsberg report was that there would be a methodology to continue to analyse data in the industry and get these kind of statistics, such as the Deputy is speaking about right now.  That was not brought forward as part of the report, which was eventually published last year.  The last data we have which are done in any great detail are for 2016.  We are without it though it would be helpful to have it in some form or another, because one is just working on top line numbers from Revenue rather than a deeper dive into what the industry is like and how it is structured.  The information is there.  It is a matter of gathering it.</p></speech>

If we were to say all those full-time equivalents were companies availing of section 481, then, as a rule of thumb, on average each certified project availing of section 481 was employing approximately 80 full-time equivalents.

I refer to the depth of content and what is produced.  We have another member based in Kerry, for example, that produced "Ireland's Deep Atlantic", without a huge number of staff, etc.  That programme is now on the junior certificate curriculum.  How, then, does one measure value?  It must have a cultural impact as well.  One must be able to say it leaves a footprint, has longevity and allows companies to leverage what they do such that when they go to public service broadcasting in the United States or whatever, they can build their companies and build scale.  It is a blunt instrument to say "X number of hours equals Y amount of income".  A number of measures must be considered when looking at value.</p></speech>

There are personally signed declarations about commitment and compliance with all these things.  Certainly, our industry is slightly different; it is not a bricks-and-mortar concern and we do not produce widgets.  That does not mean we are a special case, however.

Does she believe it is working?  Maybe some of the witnesses can talk about its importance or effectiveness for that sector.  The provision is tapered and I would like the witnesses' views about that.  Going back to my earlier point about support for the industry and trying to nourish it, we are very proud when we see the achievements, the talent and the productions on-screen.  Ms Geraghty has come here arguing the case for section 481 which is in place for the next number of years.  What else could be done for the industry?  It need not be a tax measure.  Are there any opportunities in the context of all that is happening that Ireland needs to grab with both hands, to attract more investment and support the talent that we have here by additional productions and so on?</p></speech>

It has taken a while but is extremely welcome.  Most production takes place around Dublin and Wicklow so opening it out beyond those areas is incredibly important.  There are two reasons, really.  It is costly to bring crew with skills out of Dublin.  It is incredibly important for places like Troy Studios in Limerick, for example.  In parallel with that, it also allows skills to develop within those regions so that in future when productions happen, we have local crew.  The uplift is 5% and there are lots of obligations with it.  The focus is on looking into the local talent pool and building a permanent talent pool outside the usual areas where production takes place.  It is really important, especially for incoming and studio-based productions.  It is only for four years and it is tapered so we need to see how successful it will be.  It is only the very beginning.  Maybe in a year's time the Deputy can ask me again.  I will let him know how it goes.  I do not know if Ms Ward wants to contribute on that.</p></speech>

For producers, it does make the idea of bringing a production to a region much more attractive.  When we are looking at the figures we might consider if we could do this in Kerry, Galway or Mayo rather than the places we would have used.  We are always looking at the bottom line, asking if we could do it and what the extra costs would be.  I think it will cause a lot more people to consider it.</p></speech>

Specifically in the last week we have been speaking to Donegal about all of this.  There are myriad things that could be done.  Our industry falls between a lot of stools in terms of Government Departments.  The audiovisual steering group examines all the recommendations of the Olsberg report with everybody in the room and that is really helpful.  I would really like our screen industry to be considered as an industry in its own right and to be championed.  There is so much value and so many good stories.  There are small, medium and big companies that are doing great things and we tend to fall between all of these stools.  It needs to be considered in the round.</p> <p>  When we think of screen industries in particular, what do we think of?  We think of drama, film, documentary, animation and everything in between.  We have a fantastic story for Ireland in these really difficult times.  We are going to be up against it, especially after today and what Brexit means, so we need to batten down the hatches.  The UK is burgeoning with the amount of production that is coming through.  Its studios are bursting.  We need to make sure that we have more studio space, that it gets through planning permission.  We need to continue to grow our crew.  Skills development is going to be fantastic.  I would look to be sitting at decision makers' tables as often as possible when we talk about Ireland Inc. and Ireland's screen industries.  I welcome D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Finnegan, the incoming chief executive of Screen Ireland.  It is going to be great to meet D&eacute;sir&eacute;e and learn what the plans are ahead.  They are our ambassadors when they leave these shores and they need to be supported and able to sell "brand Ireland" for incoming productions.  I would finally say that if anybody has any concerns about any element of our industry, we are always open for business and for questions.</p><p>Members can come out to visit one of the sets, watch a documentary being made or sit in a hut as a nature programme is being filmed.  There is an open invitation for them to visit Ashford Studios, Ardmore Studios or wherever to see things up close for themselves.</p></speech>

Our guests say that the particular nature of the industry means companies of scale are actually much smaller.  I put it to them that this is not the case with animation.  An animation company can have a much bigger workforce that enjoys some security of employment.  I do not accept that that cannot be done with live action film and television.  Given the amount of public money going in and the fact that it is largely going to nine companies, and if, as our guests describe it, there are ten to 15 people in each company, how many people have permanent jobs when the figures are added up?  Is it 100, 200 or 300?  That is a significant problem.  Whether our guests say it is 2,000 or 7,000, it means that all the rest have absolutely no security of income or employment from project to project.  I put it to the them that this is the current situation and that there is nothing to stop wholesale displacement of people who may have worked in the industry for years or blacklisting, which has been alleged not just by some of those outside the ICTU fold but even the Irish Equity representative here in January 2018.  He stated that there was a significant problem with bullying and harassment and that workers had no protection.  Who is the employer of these people?  The production company is not, or at least it tells the Workplace Relations Commission that it is not.</p></speech>

The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act cannot and does not apply if the employer is a designated activity company, DAC, which can only exist for the purposes of one project.  As a result, is it not correct to state that almost nobody in the group in question who have contracts of indefinite duration or any kind of expectation of or right to employment from one project to the next?  Our guests stated that it should be comparable with other employment.  Do most of those workers get sick leave, holiday entitlements and maternity entitlements?  How many trainees have qualified?</p></speech>

The structure is completely different from live action.  It is not possible to compare the two.  It might be helpful if the Deputy met Animation Ireland to discuss how that industry works because it is very different from live action and drama.</p><p>As producers who apply for section 481 relief, we are required to set up designated activity companies, DACs, which are responsible for engaging the crew.  I have been in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, many times, happily successfully, on occasions where the point in question has been around which is the employer and which is the DAC.  It is very clear how the structure is set out with regard to section 481 and where obligations are required.  There are contracts and holiday pay is paid.  All of those things occur.  I really do not know how I can say it any clearer.  There is no obfuscation here.  There is a very clear structure to which we are required to adhere.</p><p> The Deputy spoke about permanent employees.  Consider the case of a production company that makes one project that requires construction and does not make another for four years.  Is it being suggested that that company takes on a permanent staff of construction workers because that is the right thing to do, even if the company never makes a project that requires construction?  That can never work and is not how it works.  That allows people who work in construction, or whatever element of crewing they are in, to be hired for the projects that are suitable for their grades and talents.

We will deal with some housekeeping matters in private session afterwards.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I remind members to either turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they interfere with the sound and broadcasting systems and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the proceedings of the meeting.  Television coverage and web-streaming would also be adversely affected.</p> <p>  No. 1 on the agenda is, as mentioned, engagement with the Minister on the interim report on reduced timetables.  I welcome him on behalf of the committee.  Earlier this year it shone a light on a very worrying practice which had been hidden in plain sight for a long period, namely, reduced timetables.  We held three stakeholder sessions, at which some of the evidence unveiled was, to be perfectly honest, quite shocking and appalling.  While members of the committee welcomed the Minister's announcement yesterday that schools would be required to give formal notification to Tusla of the use of reduced timetables - one of the recommendations we made in the interim report - we will be seeking further information on the announcement and the proposed guidelines for notifications.  It was quite ironic that the news was released yesterday prior to our engagement today, but we take it in the spirit in which we hope it was intended.  I understand the Minister has to attend the D&aacute;il to take two Topical Issue matters and that his time is tight; therefore, I ask both him and members to be very focused in the questions and answers throughout this engagement.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting will be that I will issue an invitation to the Minister to make an opening statement which will be followed by engagement with committee members.  As the Minister is aware, the committee will be publishing his opening statement on its website following the meeting</p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank the joint committee for its invitation and affording me the opportunity to speak about the issue of reduced timetables.  I also thank the representative bodies who presented on the issue at previous hearings for their input and contributions. </p> <p>  The basic aim of the Government is to use our economic success to build a fair and compassionate society.  Equality of opportunity is at the heart of our vision.  As I stated on many previous occasions and reiterate today, each and every child has a right to an education to enable him or her to live a full life and realise his or her potential.  I have made my position clear that all pupils enrolled in a school should attend for the full day, unless exempt from doing so for exceptional circumstances.  Reduced timetables are not in any way a standard aspect of a child&rsquo;s experience of school and must not be allowed to become such; rather, they are an exceptional measure.  While it may be necessary in some circumstances to use a reduced timetable, for example, as a means of assisting the reintegration of a pupil into a school routine, such arrangements should only be put in place in limited and time-bound circumstances.  </p> <p>  Officials of my Department have been working closely with officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla which is within the remit of that Department in the monitoring of and reporting on this practice to address the issues raised in the committe's interim report.  A set of guidelines is being prepared jointly by my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla.  The purpose of the guidelines is to provide clarity for school authorities and parents or guardians on the reporting of reduced timetables in schools to ensure their use is limited to those circumstances where it is absolutely necessary and, where in the rare circumstances such usage occurs, schools follow best practice, with the interests of the student to the fore.  As is normal practice, prior to finalising the guidelines, my Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla are arranging for a consultation process with education stakeholders, including the school management bodies.  </p> <p>  Provision of support is critical and I want to highlight the investment the Government is making.  This year&rsquo;s education budget is &euro;10.8 billion.  This highlights the Government&rsquo;s strong belief in and commitment to the power of education.  Nearly &euro;1 in every &euro;5 of this year&rsquo;s budget, or about &euro;1.9 billion, is being invested in supporting children with special educational needs, including those with challenging behaviour, in school.  This is the highest ever level of Government expenditure on special education.  It provides for a continuum of special educational provision to be made available to children with special educational needs, including those with challenging behaviour, in order that, regardless of the level of need of the child, educational provision can be made for them.  </p> <p>  The number of special education teachers has increased by 37%, from 9,740 in 2011 to over 13,400.  The number of special needs assistants, SNAs, has risen by 51%, from 10,575 in 2011 to 15,950.  Schools can now allocate additional teaching support to a child whose challenging behaviour is having a significant impact on his or her ability to learn in school.  Children do not need a special educational needs diagnosis to access these supports and parents or guardians will no longer be required to have their child receive such a diagnosis.  Schools may also access SNA support for children with additional care needs, including challenging behaviour.  All schools can access in-school supports and continuous professional development through the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to assist teachers in working with children who display challenging behaviour.  </p> <p>  The number of specialist placements for children with complex special educational needs has also been significantly increased by the Government.  Over 1,050 additional special placements have been provided in the new school year.  There are now 1,621 special classes, compared to 548 in 2011, including 1,355 to cater for children with autism.  Some 125 special schools, including a new special school to be established this year, also provide specialist education for students with complex special educational needs.  These schools provide over 8,000 places compared to 6,848 in 2011.</p> <p>  I note that the committee questioned whether SNA support was the most appropriate in dealing with a child&rsquo;s challenging behaviour.  As committee members are aware, the view of my Department and that of the NCSE is that students need the right support from the right person at the right time to achieve his or her full potential.  To that end, a preschool and an in-school therapy demonstration project is being undertaken in 75 preschools and 75 schools to provide in-school therapeutic support for students.  In addition, &euro;4.75 million was allocated in budget 2019 for the trialling of a new school inclusion model of support to include in-school provision of behavioural practitioners, psychologists and regional support teams to build capacity in schools to meet the needs of their students.  The outcome of the pilot scheme will inform future policy and service provision, including the provision of behavioural support.  </p> <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, works with both primary and post-primary schools and is concerned with learning, behaviour, social and emotional development.  The Government has recognised the valuable input of the NEPS for pupils and schools.  Over its lifetime it has increased psychologist numbers from a sanctioned level of 173 whole-time equivalents in 2015 to 204 whole-time posts, with a commensurate increase in investment, from &euro;18 million to &euro;20.75 million per annum in the period.</p><p>There are 190 posts in the system, with recruitment to fill 14 new posts and vacancies under way.  Supports are also provided for DEIS schools, at an overall cost of &euro;125 million for 891 schools serving approximately 190,000 pupils to improve attendance, retention and school participation.  </p><p> Enhanced capitation payments for Traveller children in the system are provided, at a cost of &euro;1.1 million.  Actions are being progressed under the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy to improve education outcomes for Travellers, including a pilot project to target school attendance, retention and participation, commencing this September.  Additional supports have been provided to support this pilot project in the form of home-school-community liaison officers funded by my Department, in addition to Traveller education workers funded by the Department of Justice and Equality and educational welfare officers employed by Tusla. </p><p> In summary, I anticipate that the guidelines and notification system will allow us to monitor the use of reduced timetables and, ultimately, address the issues raised.  If parents have concerns about the use by a school of a reduced timetable for their child, they can contact their local educational welfare officer who has statutory responsibility for ensuring the rights of the child to an education are upheld and will advise them on the most appropriate action to take.  My Department will continue to work closely with Tusla's educational welfare service and the NCSE to ensure that where in the very limited number of cases a reduced timetable is deemed to be necessary, such measures will be used for time-limited periods only.  </p><p> I again thank the committee for highlighting this issue.  I am aware that it is an interim report and that the committee will be working on new proposals and suggestions in the not too distant future.  I look forward to working with and hearing from it in that regard.  I thank the groups and individuals who have contributed.  As a Government, we have demonstrated and will continue to work to realise our commitment to ensuring all children receive the fullest possible education.  I am also very conscious that there are challenges and that parents and children are facing them.</p></speech>

I am glad that various charities, including AsIAm, and the Traveller organisations highlighted this issue for the joint committee and that we put the spotlight on it at the start of the summer because as I noted then, the practice is a national scandal and must end.  I think everybody sitting around the table is in agreement.  What the Department states in reply to parliamentary questions is correct.  The practice is different and I hate to say it, but the guidelines differ from it.  The guidelines open everything up and that will not be acceptable to Fianna F&aacute;il.  We must start from the premise that every child has a legal right to an education.  We cannot start from the premise that this practice is allowed if procedures are followed.  That is what I worry will happen.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned challenging behaviour quite a number of times.  The committee does not have evidence that challenging behaviour is the primary reason for engaging in the practice.  In fact, we do not have much evidence at all  and we certainly do not have evidence that challenging behaviour is the reason for it.  It should not be because in replies to parliamentary questions the Department states reduced timetables can only be in place for medical reasons.  Therefore, I am not sure from where the reference to challenging behaviour comes.  It can be dealt with in many other ways.  The guidelines also do not address the issue of Travellers being disproportionately affected by reduced timetables.  </p> <p>  I have been criticised by some teachers for highlighting this issue.  They say they operate in difficult circumstances.  I have no doubt that many of them do, but we all have a role to play in the education system, regardless of whether we are policymakers, Ministers or teachers, to ensure each child's right to an education is upheld.  I would worry about anything the Minister proposed that moved away from the words of the Department in replies to parliamentary questions about exceptional cases and involved a return to a school acting on professional advice.  Doing anything else would be wrong.  </p> <p>  The representative from Tusla was excellent at the last meeting.  I was delighted when he was very clear that where it was not done in accordance with the guidelines, it amounted to suspension or expulsion.  I do not think that is mentioned in the information that is required to be given to parents.  We must take a really hard line if we are to take the issue, the needs of children and their right to an education, seriously.  The committee has blown it up.  Schools need to get the message that this is not the way to deal with disciplinary issues.  The premise of the Minister is almost that this is a disciplinary issue when it cannot be.  Under the law, as he has set out in replies to parliamentary questions, disciplinary issues do not come into it at all.  Therefore, I do not know why challenging behaviour has been mentioned, unless, of course, it is a medical issue, but it does not look like that.  </p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the special school that is to be established this year.  Will he confirm whether it has opened and, if not, when will it open?  </p> <p>  I am not entirely satisfied, but I am glad that action is being taken.  However, it requires a change of mindset - even on the part of parents.  For all the good work they do, some advocacy organisations seem to think it could be possible to do it in circumstanes even broader than those outlined by the Minister as long as there are guidelines.  I would take a much harder line.  I do not think it should be possible, except where there are medical issues, as the Minister mentioned in replies to parliamentary questions.  If schools cannot cope with children with special needs, clearly the required resources and training are not available and it is up to policymakers and the Government, in particular, to make sure they are provided.  The bottom line is that each child is entitled to an education and there are no "ifs" or "buts.  I am afraid that this document brings in a lot of "ifs" and "buts" and does not address a number of the recommendations we made during the summer.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister's statement, but when one looks at it, one can see that it is seven pages long, with the issue of reduced timetables dealt with in three very small paragraphs on the last page.  In the rest of it it seems that the Department is patting itself on the back, stating, "Aren't we great in the Department of Education and Skills.?  This is what we are doing."  However, it is not tackling the issue.  On the form use, will the Minister consider requiring a school to document the other measures taken to deal with an issue before a child is placed on a reduced timetable?  I know that the form asks for information on the support the school has sought, but it needs to outline exactly what has been done.</p> <p>  Who has the right to say "No" or "Stop, we don't want this"?  What happens when a parent says he or she does not want it to happen?  What are the guidelines given to the school?  What monitoring or reporting will take place during the time a child is placed on a reduced timetable?  At the end of each plan, is there a requirement to notify all parties concerned of progress, regardless of whether it is being sought to renew it?  Even renewing it is bizarre.  Is there a requirement to report progress on how a reduced timetable is working?  </p> <p>  According to the guidelines, the NCSE must be notified when a reduced timetable is agreed to for a student with special educational needs.  Does the Minister intend to include or specify a further role or will it remain the case that the NCSE or the special educational needs organiser, SENO, must be notified and that is it, full stop?  What is the role of the educational welfare officer or the SENO, particularly when it comes to renewals?  </p> <p>  Regarding guideline K which stipulates a school must only consider an extension in exceptional circumstances and only with the further written consent of the parents, it should be made very clear in guideline A that the practice should only be considered in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>There is a mention here of when a reduced timetable might be used, but I think it should start in the key requirements, stating that this is only to be used in a exceptional circumstances.  That should be reiterated to the school if it is considering it.</p><p> Would the Department consider making it a requirement not only to consult the parents or to get their written consent but also at least to have consultation with NEPS or another outside disability service provider relevant to the child in question?  I am sure the witnesses read the Inclusion Ireland report, Education, Behaviour and Exclusion, in which it seeks that.  I think it should be done.  Does the Department intend to put a hard limit on the use of reduced timetables?  Six weeks is given as a guideline and I think the word "ideally" is used.  "Ideally" is not the word that should be used here because that leaves a lot of scope for abuse.  I would prefer to see a hard limit.  I think six weeks is an extraordinarily long time for a student be removed from school, to be on a reduced timetable, and to be isolated socially from his or her peers.  Maybe the witnesses will look at that again.  I notice on the information collected in the form - it may be an oversight - that there is no reference to gender.  I see ethnicity but not gender.  Is there a particular reason it has been left out?</p><p> What assurances can we be given that the teachers placed with these students have been given the robust training that they need?  It cannot be a case of a teacher drawing the short straw and being told he or she will have the students on the reduced timetable because he or she happens to be free.  That is not fair to the students, to the parents or the teacher.  It is a disservice to all involved.  What guidance is given to the school about what subjects the students will have access to?  When one starts probing into a reduced timetable, there are questions of what teachers will be qualified and what subjects will be taught.  It is very problematic.</p><p> Deputy Byrne referred to challenging behaviour.  There is no definition of challenging behaviour and this is an ongoing issue across the world with departments of education.  It leads to abuse of the term "challenging behaviour".  There has to be training in challenging behaviour and resourcing of teachers, staff, schools and principals to address challenging behaviour.  That means it is not child-centred, and instead of trying to support those children, they are just removed because of the so-called challenging behaviour that no one can define.  Is the Department liaising with or does it intend to liaise with the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health to ensure that child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, are properly resourced to provide the necessary assistance?  What interdepartmental communication has taken place since we discussed this in Joint Committee on Education and Skills during the summer?  We must make sure that at-risk children are given the appropriate help.</p><p> I know that one recommendation in our interim report is that any guidelines relating to the use of reduced timetables must also outline the complaints process if a parent is dissatisfied.  Parents must know how they can complain and the process must be in black and white.  Where is that?  The guidelines do not include that and I think that should be put in place.  At the root of all this is the question of why schools are resorting to the use of reduced timetables, especially for children with disabilities.  The Inclusion Ireland report stated that one in four children with a disability had been placed on a reduced timetable, with half of those being for more than 20 days.  How can we ensure that every student with a disability or learning need has access to an appropriately trained teacher?  How will schools be supported with these issues so they do not have to go to reduced timetables?</p><p> If the Department is going to go ahead with these guidelines, which I have a problem with because I do not think they are rigid enough, could we have an annual report on the use of reduced timetables?  Everyone could see every year the gender, socio-economic background, ethnicity, if there is a disability, and the length of reduced timetables.  We need to see that every year.  I have raised the issue of the inspectorate's critique every year since I was inspected.  The inspectorate has to be asked to remove the question of why there are so many students with special educational needs as a critique of a school, whereas schools that do not have many students with special educational needs should be asked why and what they intend to do about it.  That attitude needs to be changed.</p></speech>

This is an issue that, anecdotally, people would have had some sense of.  Unfortunately, with regard to the Traveller community, there would have often been a tacit awareness that in many instances they were not getting the full benefit of the school places that they held down.  Great credit is due to this committee and also to Inclusion Ireland and Technological University Dublin for the report.  The committee and report have forced action on this issue.  It is unquestionably the case that the mechanisms that exist were being abused in a way that frustrated these children's ability to gain an education and their full potential.  There is no question that the level of the abuse in the examples that were given and the frequency or the time that people were out for is absolutely unacceptable.  I am glad that there is movement now.  There are difficulties, as has been outlined with regard to the guidelines.  While it is an interim report, the Minister has, as I understand it, had sight of it.  Does he accept what is outlined in that document and does he agree with the recommendations made in it?  I particularly endorse recommendation No. 9, which outlines the need for additional psychological supports.  The Minister needs to provide additional resources in the upcoming budget.</p> <p>  Section 2 refers to regulations and guidelines and I ask for clarification about which it is.  I do not view a regulation as being the same as a guideline.  I would imagine a regulation as having much more effect.  It comes to a point raised by Deputy Martin.  Point E states that, ideally, the period on which a student is on a reduced timetable should not exceed six weeks, and a reduced timetable must not be carried forward from one academic year to the next.  Ideally, it would allow some wriggle room.  An issue with the guidelines as a whole is that if a school does not comply with the objections that have been set out by the Department, what are the consequences and the sanction?  I do not see any and that is a difficulty.  It will always be open to a school to try to point to the extraneous circumstances it has had to go beyond what the Department has in mind.  How do we avoid that and ensure that schools do not frustrate the intention of the Department and that there is a sanction if a school is once again using some mechanism, either through this set of guidelines or any other way, to frustrate the intentions of the Department, the committee or the entitlement of these children to gain a full education?</p> <p>  I have a query relating to point H, a requirement to provide appropriate work to the student while not in school and to arrange for this to be checked.  Instinctively, I am not sure if that is necessarily always appropriate.  It may be appropriate in some circumstances, but I can imagine a situation where that might be the source of conflict or disagreement or that it might not be appropriate or aid the reintegration of a student into the class, which is intended to be the objective of having any kind of flexibility with regard to this.  The purpose of any kind of flexibility is to enable reintegration.  I have a query about whether that is appropriate.</p> <p>  There is no excuse for the fact that some schools allowed this abuse to happen, but this would probably have occurred in schools that were under significant pressure.</p><p>That has to be acknowledged and additional resources need to be allocated to those schools.  There is no excuse for the manner in which the mechanism was used.  A very robust line needs to be taken to ensure that procedures such as this are not abused in future.</p></speech>

I agree with others that this is a very important issue that the committee has highlighted.  There was very little public information on this practice and it was only when parents came across it with their children that they realised that it existed.  It came to light when we looked at the transition of Traveller children from primary to secondary level.  We realised that a very large number of Traveller children were being subjected to reduced timetables.  There was very little knowledge about it.</p> <p>  Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation did a study on reduced timetables among children in Limerick, the city I represent.  It established that only 27% of education welfare officers knew that a child was on a reduced timetable.  It is crucial for that information to be conveyed and known.  We need to have good data collection.  We frequently heard in our hearings that there were no data.  Cases of reduced timetables were not registered by schools because they were not considered to be either suspensions or exclusions.  I understand from the Minister - he might clarify - that there will be much more comprehensive collection of data.  The data need to be continually updated and shared.  I agree with Deputy Catherine Martin who said they should be reported back to the committee.  We need public reporting of how frequently this mechanism is used and why it is used.  There needs to be intervention so that there is an alternative arrangement for the children in question when this occurs and the measure should only be used in exceptional cases.</p> <p>  On the issue of this being used in exceptional cases, in all of this parents need to have equal power in the relationship.  It should not be a case of schools saying they need to remove a child for a period with the possibility of being suspended or expelled.  There should not be pressure on parents.  It should be a relationship where the parents are genuinely involved and have the power to say they do not want their child taken out of school.  As Deputy Thomas Byrne said, education is a right.  The Ombudsman for Children referred to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child - the right of the child to have an education.  It is vital that that power relationship is changed.</p> <p>  The representatives of management bodies told the committee that they agreed that reduced timetables should be exceptional, time limited and apply only after consultation with parents.  Parents' groups, Inclusion Ireland, AsIAm and the Traveller representatives all had a different story about this measure being used quite widely, with parents being phoned to come in to collect their child to be taken out of school.  It was not planned or recorded.  They did not feel they had any real power in the decision-making.</p> <p>  It is important that we have shone a light on the issue.  It is important that we get it right.  I hope the Minister will take note of the submissions we got.  I have a question on the role of the inspectors in gathering the information.  It should not be seen as negative for a school to be inclusive; it should be seen as positive.  However, the data need to be gathered.</p> <p>  I agree that there must be consultation with the various educational partners on any proposals and the Minister has said he will have that consultation.  How long will that consultation take?  When will we have something final in place providing full information for everybody involved?  The welfare of the child must be paramount.  There need to be alternative supports and educational opportunities where it is agreed that it is in the best interests of the child.  Everyone who appeared before the committee agreed with us that this option should only be taken in very rare cases and should not be something schools use to deal with children whose behaviour is perceived to be difficult.</p></speech>

That is what she has been offered.  When she asked what she should do when she is in difficulty at home, she was advised to contact the Garda.  I welcome that the Minister is here and I welcome the statement he made.  It is important for him to acknowledge that his Department has failed children consistently.  I join my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, in acknowledging the work of this committee in shining a light on this issue.</p> <p>  The issue of data collection is key.  It is shocking that we do not know how many children are affected by reduced timetables.  Will the Department pursue an overhaul of its data collection, maintenance and presentation policy?  If so, will this include an expansion of proper data management practices to other areas affecting children with special educational needs such as the provision of ASD special classes in post primary education?  I note that the Minister's opening statement did not highlight the drastic difference in numbers between primary and secondary schools when it comes to ASD classes.  I ask him to comment on that.</p> <p>  What will the Department do to address the lack of specialist training regarding special needs education for teachers in mainstream schools?  Continuing professional development for special needs education is currently available for teachers.  Will the Department open this continuing professional development to special needs assistants who are currently left out of such CPD programmes? </p> <p>  The Minister will know the Special Needs Parents Association has recognised the role of home tuition in supporting children who have fallen through the gaps left behind by the Department.  Will the Department take any action to expand access to home tuition and home tuition payments for students on reduced timetables?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-24a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019092400002#E00400"><p>I thank the Minister.  Much has already been said.  We need to look beyond the reduced timetables.  Other speakers have already mentioned why reduced timetables have become such a norm in so many schools.  We need to look at pupil-teacher ratios.  Teachers will say reduced timetables are being used because of the number of children they are trying to teach in a class.  All of a sudden one disruptive child becomes a problem that needs to be removed so that the teacher can adequately teach the rest of the class.  There is a major issue with classroom size and the ability of teachers to work effectively with children.</p> <p>  Based on how they are being used, if reduced timetables had existed when I was in school, there would have been very few people in my classroom.  Something has gone wrong.  Outside intellectual disability such as ASD etc., which is very widespread across all backgrounds, it is a socio-economic issue.  The parents who are involved come from the most vulnerable families that one could meet.  Irrespective of how much it might be written into guidelines, the power balance is not there.  There are groups who have had a negative experience of the school education system.  Travellers have negative experiences of the education system daily.  Who effectively will advocate for a parent in this situation where they will say "No" to a school?</p><p>No matter how much we try to address the power imbalance in guidelines that everything needs to be black and white, there needs to be an advocate.  There needs to be somebody, within the community or within the system, who is only there to support the family and the student in situations where this type of stuff is beginning to happen.</p><p> In Tallaght, there are two families that I support at present.  One child has narcolepsy and that is why he is being sent home.  The father rang me one day almost crying, stating that he does not know what to do.  The child slumped in the classroom and the school rang for him to be taken home instead of waiting for him to come back around out of the condition that he has.  They started sending him home every day at 10 a.m., one hour in, in secondary school.  Now he has to re-engage.  I will not name schools because it is not fair to do so.  In another school, in west Tallaght, there is a child who has dyslexia, who has no behavioural issues and who loves school.  They are trying to influence that child's mother to put the child on a reduced timetable because she struggles in some subjects in terms of dyslexia.  This is how it is being used.  There would be nobody left in the classroom if we were to keep allowing this to be implemented in the way that it is.  We need to look at having a support service or a support person outside of the school community, not necessarily the school liaison teacher because he or she at one stage was a teacher in the classroom the year before or the year before that who, sometimes automatically, will understand why teachers feel they may need to do this.</p><p> When they report to Tusla, I wonder whether it is merely the filling of this form or is there some sort of supporting document?  On ticking boxes, it asks whether there was parental involvement.  How do we know what that involvement looks like for a parent and what support that parent received?  Any school could tick many of the boxes on this form and send it off.  It is not representative of the experience that the family and student have had over a period with the school.  That is why I favour some sort of advocate who would exist within the Department or within the school system and who would be part of those conversations and a witness to the parental and student involvement in processes such as this.  There will be medical situations.  As the mother of someone on the autistic spectrum, I am aware there will be medical situations where it will be better for one's child to take him or her out for a period of time.  I am talking about doing so for a few hours within one week, because a day is particularly difficult for sensory reasons and so on.  I am not talking about six weeks, which is a long time.  Consider how quickly one moves through a mathematics curriculum in six weeks.  Sometimes a class spends a week in school on one part of the curriculum and it will have already gone three or four times' further along the curriculum than the child is able to catch up with.  Parents in communities where there is high deprivation and low educational attainment are already under-resourced and cannot support their children at home to keep up with that curriculum.  In many cases, the parents left school at 15 or 16 years of age.</p><p> I have one more question, which seems a little off-topic and has to do with children's allowance.  Many children have been suspended or expelled from school over the past number of years and while I do not know where it came from, there is an idea that when one's child reaches 16 years, one must get the school to stamp a form to say that he or she is still in full-time education or one's children's allowance is stopped.  This disproportionately affects working-class communities where on many occasions, because parents have refused reduced timetables their children have been expelled and the welfare system has come in and removed their children's allowance.  Somewhere along the line, children's allowance, which was not set up as an educational payment, has been linked to educational attendance.  It will disproportionately affect some of these families that are falling through the cracks in relation to reduced timetables, expulsions and suspensions.  Such measures should not be the option but their families are also ending up in even worse positions than they were in because now they are attaching a social welfare payment to it.  It is something the Department should look at.  I do not know where that relationship originally developed from.</p><p> My main point is that there should be some sort of parent support worker or advocate who is engaged in any process that happens between a school and Tusla because of the distrust in institutions.  When parents feel they have been targeted by institutions their whole life, it is difficult to go into a school and have a conversation with a principal in a suit.  Parents end up agreeing with everything the principal says because they nearly feel inadequate to be able to put up some sort of advocacy for themselves and their children.</p></speech>

I will make a few brief comments before I come back to the Minister.</p><p>I will taking up on that issue.  Many parents have difficulties with their children having shorter school days.  People have asked me on occasion what does &quot;reduced timetables&quot; mean.  It means reduced hours within a school.  Children are not in school for the recommended level of hours.  Many parents, because of different issues, and possibly because of challenging behaviour and intellectual disability, are exhausted trying to deal with the system.  I would agree that they need to have an advocate, such as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, GAL, who would help support them with it.</p><p>It is important, no matter what, to remember that schools are not only a place for academic learning.  They are a place where children grow socially and develop social skills.  It is a place where they also develop emotional skills.  Children who are not in school for full days are losing out on that.  I am aware of a school in my own area where eight children did not have any school for six months and then got a second-level placement.  These are children with intellectual disabilities.  Last year, they only started school in November.  They straight away went onto a reduced timetable for every single day.  When they started this year, in September, they were told that there would be a reduced timetable for the next two years, that is, for each one of the 167 days of the school year.  That is not good enough.</p><p>The Minister spoke of the financial investment in special education, the number of the special teachers and the number of special needs assistants, SNAs.  While that is acknowledged, it is not only about the funding that is invested.  It is about the outcomes for the children.  That is the most important part of it.</p><p>In the draft recommendations the Minister has made, I note that the Department will have full consultation with educational stakeholders.  I would ask that the Minister ensure that a copy of the interim report that we have made is sent with that consultation request.  It is important that we as a committee have the opportunity for our voices to be heard.  This was a cross-party committee.  We were all shocked by what we learned.  We acknowledge that the topic is multifaceted but we feel strongly that it has to be taken out of the shadows.  We intend to have further engagement.  That is why we brought out the interim report.</p><p>We appreciate the Minister coming today to engage with us on this issue.  We wanted that to be part of where we as committee need to go next with this.  Education is the constitutional right of all children and cannot be undermined at any level in terms of unregulated practice.  I call the Minister.  I am conscious of his time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-24a.443" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019092400002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their contributions.  There were a number of questions but there were a number of suggestions as well.  That is helpful.  As I stated at the outset, this committee did quite a bit of the heavy lifting around this issue.  When one considers that the committee submitted its interim report in June - I propose to take the Chairman's last suggestion first - it would be important to keep the committee involved right through the consultation.  I am happy to provide a copy of the committee's report to the stakeholders.  In fact, many of the committee's suggestions and recommendations frame these guidelines.</p> <p>  On top of that, in response to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's question on a timeframe, I would like to work within quite a tight timeframe on this consultation.  It will be up until 18 October.  We are looking at this year to try to get something in there and get something working for the new year or the new term.  Let us work together on that.  I would be happy to include the committee on that.</p> <p>  On Deputy Thomas Byrne's questions, first of all,every child has a legal right to education.  The Deputy spoke about the evidence and the lack of evidence.  Let us face it, the committee was working on anecdotal evidence but the Department was working on anecdotal evidence as well.  The idea of this exercise and of these guidelines, is to find out the scale and the nature of the issue we are dealing with here.</p><p>That will determine where resources will flow thereafter and how practice will be shaped.  The Deputy mentioned behavioural issues and there are medical and mental health issues.  As I stated previously, the position of the Department is that all pupils who are enrolled in a school should attend school for the full day unless exempted from so doing for exceptional circumstances, such as medical reasons, and that reduced timetables should not be used as a de facto suspension or as a behavioural management technique.  That is what was happening, it was being used as an intervention in such cases.  That is still very much the case and my position has not changed.  There will be a process and guidelines.  The principal will inform Tusla and if reduced timetables must be used, there must be a reason, as well as an outline process and continuum explaining that this part of the reintegration.  We are going to be very clear and transparent around that.</p><p> The Deputy also mentioned issues regarding when a special school in Dublin 15 will open.  As far as I am aware, the training for the entire team has been completed and consequently we now are in a position to start.  I will inform the Deputy as soon as I have that information readily available but we are on the cusp in that if it does not happen next week, it will be the following week.  One demand from the parents was very clear.  As they want it done in a phased process, that is something we are adhering to as well.  The Deputy also made a point about resources and training.  As there is no point in having a guideline on reduced timetables if we do not put adequate resources, training and support into schools, that will come hand in glove.</p><p> Deputy Catherine Martin referred to scepticism.  When one embarks on anything new that has been basically left out and where there has been a gaping hole, it is a case of figuring it out and doing so properly.  That is why the consultation with the key stakeholders will be so important.  I mention in particular the parents' council.  Members spoke about empowering parents.  Their voice will be really important in that consultation.  The Deputy asked what will happen when the parent says "No".  That parent will be empowered, will have a right to say "No" to a proposed reduced timetable and will have the right to state this is still a de facto suspension.  If parents are not satisfied, there is a process to deal with this by appealing directly to the Department through section 29 of the Education Act.   We must be very clear and continue to empower the parent in that regard.</p><p> In terms of the consultation with NEPS, the guidelines are underpinned by the principles that a reduced timetable or reduced day should never be used as a sanction, offered as an alternative to a sanction or used as a behavioural management tool.  It should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to facilitate a return to school on a full-time basis.  The guidelines should be read in conjunction with relevant guidelines from Tusla, including developing a code of behaviour, guidelines for schools and a statement of strategy for school attendance.  Other resources include information on NEPS and support from the Department.  It is important that lines of communication are always open.  We are all trying to achieve the aims set out in the school inclusion pilot, whereby we have the HSE and the Departments of Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs Health working hand in glove together.  That is why we will be informed by the school inclusion pilot.</p></speech>

We are trying to ensure that the information we have includes the scale and extent of the issue and to find out if there are resource deficiencies or a weakness within the school system.  We are not informed at the moment because we have only anecdotal evidence.  What we are trying to do is to ensure we get the process right first.  That is why the guidelines will be so important, as will be the consultation with the educational partners and members' continued observations, in ensuring that the parent and the young person will know what the transparent process is.  We are not starting from scratch or a blank page but we have a very complex issue where parents and students naturally feel aggrieved on the one hand and we have issues in schools on the other hand, where members of boards of management, principals and teachers will state they do not have adequate resources to work through the situation.  It is about informing ourselves of the scale and extent of the issue.  That is the reason I do not want to see this used as a behavioural mechanism.  I acknowledge it is being used as a tool for dealing with behavioural issues and as a sanction at present and I want to move away from that.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin also asked about the higher limit on the use of reduced timetables.  While six weeks is a long time, a plan must be put together.  Senator Gavan referred to one hour a day.  It is not acceptable that one could have one hour per day over a period of six weeks.  There must be a progression.  It could be one hour a day on the first day and then there must be a progression towards reintegration within that period.  Six weeks is the one that has been suggested for the consultation.  The feedback varies on whether that period is appropriate.  We are open to receiving feedback on it.</p> <p>  There is no reference to gender but there is a reference to ethnicity.</p></speech>

The Deputy also referred to the need for more consultation and suggested an annual report.  The data we receive will be important in informing the Department as to where resources are needed and where they should be directed.  She also raised the issue of capacity, which is something of which I am very conscious.  We must ensure there is sufficient capacity and support under the new model for schools.  I have already covered the Deputy's point on the need for the complaints structure to be transparent.</p></speech>

The Department is working on anecdotal evidence on this particular issue.  I accept and agree with many of the recommendations in the guidelines, most of which came from the report.  The Deputy referred to regulations versus guidelines.  No matter what issue one is dealing with, it is usually, in the first instance, covered in guidelines and circulars that are given to schools.  Once we have a system in place whereby Tusla is informed when a reduced timetable is being introduced, that information will be recorded and will form part of the data.</p> <p>  On the scale and nature of resources, the Deputy referred to reintegration, process and flexibility and there being no excuses as to how things were done in the past.  I agree there is no excuse for allowing a situation to emerge where a child is being disadvantaged in his or her constitutional right to an education.  That is an issue which we are all working to resolve.  There is no specific sanction where a school is not complying in this regard but I intend to ensure we are informed as to the scale and extent of the resourcing need.</p><p>If extra resources are needed in these areas, we will certainly do that.</p><p> Deputy Jan O'Sullivan observed that 27% of education and welfare officers were aware of schools using reduced timetables and highlighted an information deficit in that regard.  She said a more robust collection of data was required.  The Deputy spoke about parents' consent and an equal power relationship but I also talked about the voice of the child.  She mentioned different groups having a different story, the importance of getting this right and the role of the inspectorate.  The Deputy will be aware that the specific role of the inspectorate in the Department of Education and Skills is to examine the quality of learning and teaching.  The inspectorate will continue, in the context of the work, to evaluate the effectiveness of schools' implementation of specific interventions and initiatives and to provide up-to-date information to the system.  On the timeframe, the consultation period ends on 18 October.</p><p> Senator Gavan made a reference to one hour per day, which is unacceptable, and not having a plan as to how to reintegrate that student back into education.  Data collection is key, and that is a gaping hole.  We do not have those data and if the practice was and is being used as a behavioural tool, that is not acceptable.</p><p> I referenced the social inclusion pilot because the Senator also mentioned autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes, the difference between primary and post-primary and where the investment is going.  We have 4,000 schools.  Currently, we have upwards of 1,500 special classes.  Some schools are providing up to four classes.  Others are providing one class.  If we do a quick mathematical summary of that, less than 25% of schools have special classes.  It is an enormous challenge to try to get that right.  As the Chairman pointed out, we are investing a great deal of resources - one out of every five euro - in special education but we still have a long way to go.  Parents today are having difficulties accessing special classes in preschool and primary school and at post-primary level.  That is a major challenge that we want to meet head-on.</p><p> The Department of Health has a budget of &euro;17 billion and the Department I preside over has a budget of nearly &euro;11 billion.  I see enormous potential for much greater collaboration between the two Departments.  </p><p> Mention was made of behavioural issues.  The school inclusion pilot will look at speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, the potential for physiotherapy, even though it is not in the pilot, but also to have a behavioural therapist in the school.  We are trying to get from where we are now to a place where there is much more joined-up thinking and integration at an interdepartmental level and between State agencies.  </p><p> Senator Ruane's contribution on empowering parents was very interesting.  She referenced Tallaght, although she did not want to highlight any school in particular.  I have fond memories of Tallaght, having done my teaching practice in St. Mark's school, in Springfield.  The present-day classrooms are in a different country to the classroom I was in back in 1993 .  I went in as a student teacher, stuck to the subject area and got on with it.  It was a different scenario to the classrooms I go into in either primary or secondary schools.  There is much more complexity.  If something is needed in terms of empowering parents in their decision-making as to what is best for their sons or daughters, we will have to be open to that.</p><p> The Senator referenced medical situations.  Perhaps there could be a reduced timetable for a particular day.  We have to be open to all the new ways of thinking in terms of how we deal with complex issues.  I refer to the notion of having some sort of support for parents to help them make the decision.</p><p> I am reminded of when I was a youth worker in Letterkenny.  When parents would approach me informally about something that was happening in primary school, they were looking for my advice and advocacy.  It may not have been right all the time but they were reaching out and had a level of trust.  That goes back to all the different informal places, whether it is community groups, youth groups or whatever.  The Senator may have hit on something that I have experienced in terms of helping parents make that decision.  I would like to explore that further.</p></speech>

That may be because it emanated from Tusla but it does not look like a circular the Department would issue.  I say that without disrespect to anybody.  It does not appear to be written with the same level of precision one normally associates with Department of Education and Skills documents or circulars.  They are normally extremely precise.  This document needs to be much clearer as to the circumstances in which these reduced timetables can happen and the procedures thereafter.  In terms of No. 4, the key requirements, that mixes up the reasons for this with the procedures.  The procedures are long and drawn out and could be easily reduced to bullet points in terms of doing this or that.</p> <p>  The form does not require any evidence as to the necessity for the reduced timetables when that is a key requirement, according to what the Minister said today.  From my reading of it, that is not required to be provided.  The form also refers to a right of appeal.  I am not clear on that right of appeal.  The only appeal I am aware of would be under section 29 in terms of appeals against suspension or expulsion.  To what does that refer?</p> <p>  The document would do well to quote what the gentleman from Tusla - I do not recall his name-----</p></speech>

We know everything that is done but the document needs to take the form of a circular.  It does not appear to be written in that way, although it may have been rushed.  I do not mean any disrespect because to be fair to the Minister, if the document is read in the way I would like it to be read, it can be considered to be very strict.

I was not sure if the Minister was talking about a capacity issue for an annual published report because I was about to say that has to be done and we need to be able to see that report.  The form does not leave much room for detail.  It asks whether a plan has been developed to support the student's return to full education and provides for a "Yes" or "No" answer.  I would like to see the plan and Tusla should also see it.  There is a lot of box-ticking and little detail available.  We want this to be child centred.</p></speech>

I am not sure bullet point H makes sense.  I am not sure if additional work should always be provided or if that would always be suitable.  What are the consequences if a school does not comply?  It is not immediately clear to me that it would be possible for the Department to enforce this requirement.</p> <p>  There has been some discussion of resources.  When the previous round of additional DEIS designations was announced a few years ago, no new schools were added to the DEIS band 2 category.  While many of those schools are much less resource-intensive than DEIS band 1 schools and would not require the same reduced pupil teacher ratios, but they would avail of school completion and home school liaison supports.  That is a resource that needs to be looked at again.  In many instances, good work done with school completion and home school liaison would prevent some of these issues arising as the relationship between the family, the child and the school would be maintained in a much better way.  That is a point that needs to be considered.</p></speech>

The decision should not have to go straight to a section 29 appeal where it would become confrontational.  I do not know whether there is a role for education welfare officers.  Senator Ruane mentioned advocates but maybe an education welfare officer could have a role in advocating for the child in such circumstances.  I agree that some avenue other than a section 29 appeal must be available to parents who do not agree to a reduced timetable.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan that there should be a middle ground.  The only reason I wanted to mention this in terms of a suspension or expulsion was that it prods people into acting because it highlights how serious this is.  If this is done incorrectly, a child will be suspended or expelled and that is a whole different ball game from the school's point of view.</p></speech>

The purpose of this part of the meeting is to welcome Mr. Andrew Brownlee, the new chief executive officer of SOLAS, who will talk to us about the success of the team that represented Ireland in Russia earlier this year.  We take this opportunity to wish Mr. Brownlee well in his new role.  The Irish team has again done us proud by winning four gold medals, one bronze medal and seven medallions for excellence at the WorldSkills Competition.  This is an excellent achievement and I have no doubt all of the competitors are proud.  We are interested in hearing about their experiences at the competition.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Brownlee, CEO; Mr. Ray English, chair of WorldSkills Ireland; Mr. Luke O'Keeffe; Mr. Ryan Dempsey; Mr. Ryan McLoughlin; Ms Megan Yeates; Ms Hanna Mathe; Mr. Pat Twomey; Mr. Chris Kehoe; Mr. Adam Flynn; Mr. Jack Lynch and; Mr. Mark Wasson, who all represented Ireland.  I also welcome a number of people in the Gallery.  Every team needs to have a good and supportive team beside them.  I welcome Ms Shauna Dunlop and Mr. David Tracey, who were official observers; Mr. Michael Hourihan, who was an official delegate; Ms. Nikki Gallagher, director of communications and secretariat of SOLAS; Ms Emma Kelly, communications officer with SOLAS; and Ms Vivienne Patterson and Ms Louise Sherry from the Higher Education Authority.</p> <p>  The format of this part of the meeting is that I will invite Mr. Brownlee to make a brief opening statement.  Mr. English will then contribute, after which we will have an engagement with members.  If any of the other witnesses would like to contribute thereafter at any point, I ask them to indicate and I will be more than happy to allow them to do so.</p><p>Before we begin, I draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by myself, as Chair, to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in relation to their evidence.  They are directed by myself that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also wish to advise witnesses that any submission or opening statements that they make to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice members to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I now invite Mr. Andrew Brownlee, CEO of SOLAS, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I look forward to working with the committee and helping it in anyway I can as we move forward.  I will keep this brief as I know the committee really wants to hear from the WorldSkills team.  On behalf of SOLAS, the HEA and WorldSkills Ireland, I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity today to celebrate the excellent performance by a brilliant team of young apprentices, trainees and students at the WorldSkills Competition in Russia in August.  I am delighted to be joined today by members of the team, including Ray English, chair of WorldSkills Ireland, and his colleagues, and Vivienne Patterson of the HEA.</p> <p>  I would like to provide a short overview of the WorldSkills competition, and explain how SOLAS, the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills and provide support to the Irish team.  The WorldSkills competition, which is held every two years, has a 60-year history and is the biggest vocational education and skills event in the world.  The competitors represent the best of their peers in 56 different skills and are selected from skills competitions in over 77 WorldSkills' member countries and regions.  The Department of Education and Skills introduced national and international skills competitions to Ireland in 1957 and Ireland has taken part in every single competition since.  Funding of almost &euro;400,000 for the WorldSkills team comes through a number of sources, namely, SOLAS, the HEA and the Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI.</p> <p>  WorldSkills Kazan took place from 22 to 27 August.  It involved 63 countries, more than 1,300 competitors, and had over 200,00 visitors.  The opening and closing ceremonies, which were held in the Kazan Stadium, were attended by more than 40,000 people and were broadcast live on Russian TV to approximately 45 million viewers.  Ceremonies were also streamed live on the Internet - I know many people in Ireland tuned in - so that everybody could be part of these Olympic-style spectacular shows.  The closing ceremony was addressed live by President Putin.</p> <p>  The WorldSkills Conference, which was run in parallel to the competitions, included contributions from people such as Scott Kelly, a NASA astronaut, and our very own Minister of State with responsibility for skills, Deputy John Halligan.  The Irish team was made up of 17 young apprentices, trainees and students.  They are Cormac Thompson, Allanagh O&rsquo;Sullivan, Ryan Dempsey, Luke O&rsquo;Keeffe, Jack Lynch, Olivier Bal-P&eacute;tr&eacute;, Hanna Mathe, Glen McNamara, Adam Flynn, Mark Wasson, Megan Yeates, Patrick Twomey, Jack O&rsquo;Donnell, Ruair&iacute; Grealish, Jennifer Mangan, Christopher Kehoe, and Ryan McLoughlin.  They showcased their skills in the areas of aircraft maintenance; beauty therapy; building information modelling; bricklaying; cabinet-making; cloud computing; construction metal work; cookery; electrical installation; freight forwarding; industrial mechanic millwright; joinery; plumbing and heating; restaurant service; visual merchandising; and welding.</p> <p>  The competitors spent several months prior to the competition being trained by experts at TU Dublin; the institutes of technology in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Dundalk, Carlow and Athlone; the education and training boards in Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Limerick, Clare, Donegal and Dublin-D&uacute;n Laoghaire; and Shannon College of Hotel Management.</p> <p>  The training and the hard work paid off.  Ireland has a long history of winning medals and Medallions for Excellence and this year was no different.  The team won four gold medals, one bronze medal, a Best of Nation medal, and seven Medallions for Excellence.  Ireland is also now ranked tenth in the world for skills in terms of the medal rankings.  I am sure the members will hear from the team themselves in more detail about this remarkable achievement.</p> <p>  Ireland has also been chosen to host the next WorldSkills General Assembly and Conference which will take place on 5 to 8 October 2020 in Dublin and plans are progressing to finalise this and the next Ireland Skills Live event, following the success of the inaugural event in March this year.</p> <p>  I would like to conclude by saying that WorldSkills competitions are an excellent way to promote Ireland&rsquo;s skills to a global audience.  Our brilliant teams benchmark the quality of further education, training and skills against the best in the world.  They are also incredible role models here at home for anyone considering their post-secondary education choices.</p></speech>

I would like to welcome the Deputy Butler, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which is also doing a report on apprenticeships.  Would Mr. English like to say a few words?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-24a.487" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019092400002#K00400"><p>I will say a few words.  It is worth noting that WorldSkills Ireland remains primarily a volunteer organisation from the competitors themselves who, after selection commit to training to the experts who we rely on to train to WorldSkills standards, often for up to 40 hours a week.  All of that is all done on a voluntary basis.  That training takes place in education and training boards, institutes of technology, and Technological University Dublin.</p> <p>  The basis of this team came from the 2019 Ireland Skills Live Competition, which was held in March in the RDS, as has been noted.  That attracted 15,000 young people who came to look at the skills.  A number of young people went to Kazan and many others did not.  The support of the Higher Education Authority, SOLAS and industry partners, such as John Sisk &amp;amp; Son, in delivering Ireland Skills Live needs to be noted.  That led to the great success that we saw in Kazan.  It is important to note that it was each team member who gave us that overall tenth position.  In any of the indices, Ireland came in the top 20 of the 63 countries that participated in Kazan.</p></speech>

Given the Olympic standard, it is incredible to think how well everyone did, and across such a wide breadth of different skills and areas.  It is really fascinating.  On behalf of the State, I thank everyone and acknowledge the positive impression of Ireland I have no doubt everyone gave in Russia.  That is hugely important.  We want to send our best people because they are ambassadors for us abroad.  Given their significant achievements, I have no doubt that they played that role really well.</p> <p>  Most importantly, I acknowledge the inspiration I have no doubt the competitors are to the young people in Ireland.  They are an inspiration to their fellow citizens, to their fellow students and to us, as committee members.  I have no doubt that they, along with their families, are very proud of what they have achieved.</p> <p>  The team had the opportunity to sit in on our earlier hearing on reduced timetables.  Normally, parliamentary committees discuss what is wrong in society and the difficulties and problems we have, in particular within the education and skills system, which we deal with in this committee.  In our experience, these problems affect younger and vulnerable people, in particular.  It is so refreshing and encouraging to have the team here to shine a light on what they have achieved.  Despite the difficulties and problems we have in society, the work they do and their achievements will give all of us better hope for the future.</p> <p>  I would like to ask our guests to say a few words about their experience and about their particular skill and achievement.  If they are not comfortable doing that, that is absolutely fine.  If anyone who would like to speak, perhaps they might indicate.  We will be more than happy to welcome them to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-24a.489" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Megan Yeates" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019092400002#K00600"><p>I would like to thank the committee for inviting us in.  This is an amazing opportunity to speak on behalf of the team.  I know everybody will want to give their input.</p><p>I also thank the team we have behind us.  As was said, a great team supports us and brings us along.  To give a little background, I won gold in the freight forwarding category at WorldSkills.  It was the very first year in which freight forwarding made it to the WorldSkills.  Two years ago it was a future skill that was being tested.  It was an amazing opportunity to be able to take part in it the first year going.</p><p> WorldSkills is an absolutely amazing opportunity to get to represent one's country at an international level.  There are not enough words to say how great this year's event was.  What one takes away from it is the training opportunity we had leading up to it.  I had ten weeks of intensive training from June to August, which was supported by TU Dublin.  As Mr. English mentioned, I had my chief expert, who worked with me on a volunteer basis, and I was training five days a week, Monday to Friday, from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m.  It is intense and a lot goes into it.  When we travel over there we are up against the best in the world so we have to give it our all and be as informed as possible.  We go over there almost wanting to know more than our experts.  My expert is quite a few years ahead of me, but the support we get from the institutes is amazing.  I know that some of my colleagues here had the opportunity to train with different institutes across the country.  I was very lucky that I got to go out into my industry.  My background is that I completed my logistics and supply chain management level 8 undergraduate programme in TU Dublin, so a lot of the companies that support the college through the work placements were very welcoming and opened their doors to me throughout the summer, took me on and gave me training.  Not a single person in industry who was approached refused to get involved.  It is very refreshing to see that and that all the companies out there are very supportive of the younger generation coming up and want to give that support to nurture our skills and help to educate us to make us the leaders and the industry experts into the future.</p><p> I would now like to pass the floor to one of my colleagues, who would like to continue the discussion.</p></speech>

It is an incredible achievement, and I know that Ireland has been really successful over the years.  Well done to everybody involved.  One thing I feel strongly about is the fact that opportunities for young people coming out of school do not have to be the standard go-to-college, get-a-degree opportunities.  I commend SOLAS on the work that has been done on apprenticeships, including the new apprenticeships that are now available.  My main question is this, and Ms Yeates has already given us an example: have some of the participants some experience of how what they have done will help them in terms of a career and job opportunities?  It is so important for young people to recognise that by going down the skills route, there are fantastic opportunities out there, particularly for those of them who have represented the country so well.</p> <p>  I congratulate each and every one of the participants.  I do not know if SOLAS would like to respond about the new apprenticeships and whether some of them are tested.  Traditionally, there were a number of skills.  I think Mr. Brownlee said there were 56 different ones.</p></speech>

I also commend the work of SOLAS, the HEA and the volunteers and WorldSkills Ireland on what they are doing for our youth.  The participants should not underestimate the inspirational role models they are on that world stage for the youth of Ireland as they ponder their next careers.  They are showing them the potential they have.  Do the participants think their schools or career guidance counsellors give them enough encouragement to consider apprenticeships?  What was their experience in secondary school and so on?  Furthermore, I noticed that of the 17 participants, four were women.  That is roughly the percentage of women we have in the D&aacute;il, so we definitely need more women in the D&aacute;il and more women apprentices.  I, therefore, ask the following question of the women in particular, although I would like answers from some of the young men here as well.  What has the women's experience been and what can we do to get more women involved in this?  What do the men think we can do to get more women involved in apprenticeships?  It is an untapped resource.  There is such potential there.</p></speech>

It is an amazing achievement.  There has clearly been a strong track record over recent years.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for the participants but also for SOLAS.  New courses are opening up and we are moving in the right direction, but we are still a long way behind the likes of Germany and Austria in that I think they have occupations well into the hundreds.  I am not sure how many occupations we have.  The witnesses can tell me now.  It is certainly fewer than a hundred, I would say.  It is in the 40s.  There is surely significant scope for enhancing that, so perhaps the witnesses could tell us a bit about how they intend to move in that direction and how we might move towards the way in which they manage things in Germany or Austria.</p> <p>  I have a very specific question about something that has come up with industry.  Are there many apprenticeships in instrumentation and electrical instrumentation at the moment?  As far as I know, there is a serious shortage in this regard.  It comes up with businesspeople in Cork - pharmaceutical companies and so on.  There is a gap there.  It is a really attractive trade but not many people seem to be going into it.  If the witnesses have not already answered that, perhaps they might do so.  It is an anecdotal matter.</p> <p>  It is probably difficult for the participants to say what about the system could be fixed, given the current environment, but perhaps they could tell us what the best elements of the apprenticeship system in Ireland are and what we need to work on.  Also, many schools across the country do not really give many students the option of entering apprenticeships.  It is not really open to them as an option.  People are discouraged and it is not really considered a viable option.  Do the participants think there is a role for them as well as SOLAS in going into schools and outlining the positive experience they have had and how apprenticeships can be an attractive option?  I know they might be reluctant to speak but perhaps they could give us just a sense of how diverse their ranges are.  Could they tell us in just a phrase what competitions they entered and competed in?</p></speech>

I reiterate the congratulations that everyone here has expressed to the participants for their participation, their representing the country and their achievements at the world games in becoming world leaders in their particular fields, and that is the way they have to look at it.  Part of their being here is recognition for that.  The Minister quite rightly criticised some of the media here, who shall remain nameless, for not giving the games the recognition it merited.  It is important we give it that recognition.  I note that 45 million people saw the participants on Russian television.  It is up to us as public representatives to do our best to promote this because it is certainly one of the few world championships on this scale - and it is a huge scale - that has a lower profile here, which is a problem.  If the media are listening - there is always someone listening - I urge them to show this hearing rather than us.  We get on the telly all the time, and we hope to put the participants on the telly to show the achievements they have made.  That is really important.  They have represented the country at the highest possible level in their chosen fields.</p> <p>  I do not expect them to answer questions but I have a couple.  They have all come to apprenticeships.  Do any of them have any ideas or suggestions as to how we can promote apprenticeships and skills at school?  Perhaps some of them had a good intervention, a good guidance counsellor, a good teacher, a good ETB person - whatever.</p><p>Does anyone have suggestions on that?  What can be done to encourage more women to become involved?  The apprenticeship field is the outstanding example of underrepresentation of women in Irish society.  The number of women is crazily low.  I would like to ask Ms Yeates in particular what brought her to her category of apprenticeship, which is relatively unusual.  How did that happen? </p></speech>

I am the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  There is a bit of an overlap between our briefs.  I congratulate the Irish WorldSkills team on being ranked tenth in the world with four gold medals, one bronze medal, a best of nation medal and seven medallions of excellence.  We could say it all day long.  It is a phenomenal result.  This is an amazing opportunity to represent one's country at an international level.  I have no doubt that of the team members' commitment and determination, and as Ms Yeates rightly pointed out, the five days a week of training for eight weeks.  I am sure all of the witnesses did the same.  We recognise the commitment and dedication they gave to representing Ireland.  On behalf of the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I congratulate each and every one of the competitors and their mentors.  It is a fantastic achievement.  The committee will write to each one of them individually.</p> <p>  As the Chairman said, last year there were 15,500 apprenticeships in Ireland but only 400 were undertaken by women, which is an appalling number.  Apprentices have a key role to play in addressing future skills needs.  My committee looked at the role of apprentices in respect of work permits.  We found that during the recession, secondary schools focused more on academia than on apprenticeships that allow students to earn as they learn.  We also lost a lot of guidance counsellors during the recession.  It is very important that it is not only ETB schools that encourage students to consider the various trades.  My daughter is only 13 years old.  She started secondary school last year and her favourite subject is technical graphics because she  loves maths.  I never thought she would be drawn to that.  If she had not had the opportunity to engage with a subject like technical graphics at her school we would never have known that this could be the way she would like to go. </p> <p>  It is great to see Ms Mathe and Ms Yeates here.  Were there only two female representatives on the team?  I concur with the Chairman.  I noticed that when the competitors returned, my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, was disappointed by the lack of media coverage.  As a Deputy from Waterford, I to congratulate Mr. Flynn and Ms Mathe.  I compliment the Chairman for inviting the delegation and acknowledging what they have done.  Onwards and upwards.  I wish the witnesses the best of luck in their future careers. </p></speech>

I have given them enough time to warm up.  I wish to ask about their areas of expertise.  When I heard about the various areas, I thought it was incredible to have such a wide variety.  I ask them to say a little about their area and how they think apprenticeships or training can be given more prominence.  It seems there is not parity of esteem between apprenticeships and academic subjects or degrees.  We have discussed this several times as a committee.  We believe that is completely wrong.  We want to help to raise the profile of apprenticeships and we would like ideas from the witnesses on how to do that.</p></speech>

My skill is building information modelling, BIM.  Mr. Ryan Dempsey and I were a team in Russia, where we had to make 3D models of buildings.  It is an architectural skill.  We went to college.  I did not undertake an apprenticeship from the outset, mainly because it was not encouraged in secondary school.  I always loved woodwork and making stuff with my hands.  I always wanted to go down the apprenticeship road but I was discouraged by school and a little by my parents, as if one should not do that.  One should go to college, get a degree and then get a job.  Finally in college I found something I enjoyed, that is, architecture.  It is still pertains to apprenticeships in some ways.</p> <p>  The experience in Russia was unreal.  The scale of everything there is immense.  If it was not for Ireland Skills Live last year, half of the team would not have done as well as they did this year.  Ireland Skills Live brought everyone under one roof.  We competed and saw some of the scale we would see in Russia.  Without that we would have struggled.  We would have been caught in the limelight as there was so much going on around us.  Ireland Skills Live got us in the right mindset.  We knew what we were expecting when we went over there.  The Government should focus on that event, because it helps students.  Other colleges and secondary schools are invited to Ireland Skills Live to see apprentices and apprenticeships and meet the best people working in those areas. </p></speech>

As Mr. O'Keeffe said, our skill is building information modelling.  This is a new skill so it is in the "Future Skills" category.  The event took place over 19.5 hours over three days.  As Mr. O'Keeffe said, our background was in college but I see potential for BIM to become an apprenticeship.  There is a skills shortage in the construction industry at the moment.  There must be a greater emphasis on bringing people into the industry, including other apprentices.  Speaking from a selfish point of view, there must be a better roadmap so that students know the options out there.  There is an emphasis on going to college, but if the right roadmap is in place, students will know that apprenticeships are a viable option and they can get great careers from them.  The people around me show the immense potential of apprenticeships, which can allow people to represent their country.  It is not just about college.  It is important to push apprenticeships and get the message into schools by inviting people in to speak.</p> <p>  The Ireland Skills Live event was a great success this year.  It was great to see the students come in and walk around.  One never knew who might come along.  I even sensed a bit of inspiration from what we were doing and had the feeling students might follow us down this road.  Ireland Skills Live should continue and the media must be involved. </p></speech>

I represented Ireland in bricklaying.  I did not like school at all.  It did not work for me.  Apprenticeship was looked down on when we received career guidance.  No one spoke about it.  When we received career guidance, we were given a stack of books on all the colleges around the country but all we were given on apprenticeships was a leaflet.  There was no emphasis on trades or anything like that.  I followed the norm; I filled out the Central Applications Office, CAO, form and applied for colleges, but I did not want to do that.  I started an apprenticeship and enjoyed it.  Many more people could do the same.  I was the first bricklayer to register in counties Longford or Westmeath since 2009 and I do not know of one since.  There is a massive shortage of bricklayers and so on around the country.</p><p>In schools, there is a massive emphasis put on Higher Options and going to see colleges.  I believe there should also be an emphasis on Ireland Skills Live to see what apprenticeships are about and what people do in the trades, because currently a person cannot see what is done in each trade just by looking at a leaflet or researching it.  A person would have to see it to find out what it is about and it should be emphasised more.</p></speech>

Perhaps she will tell us what attracted her to that as opposed to anything else, and respond to any of the questions that have been put.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-24a.512" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Megan Yeates" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019092400002#N00300"><p>I will address the couple of questions directed towards me, but I will respond to the Chairman's question first.  It is a question people love to ask me, because the industry I am in of freight forwarding and logistics is quite unusual.  My degree title is logistics and supply chain management.  I did my work placement with DHL in my third year and I moved into the transport sector.  I also completed my certificate of professional competence management examinations at the end of second year.  Like many others I meet in the industry, I was not especially attracted to it, but I ended up in it by default.</p> <p>  I was only aged 17 when I did my leaving certificate.  I considered myself quite young to be leaving school and to be deciding what I wanted to do moving on.  I took the initiative to have a year out and took a gap year, during which I worked.  In that time I decided I would like to do a business course because I was drawn towards that area.  In school, however, I had done all science subjects and I never completed a business subject to the leaving certificate.  I was looking for a business course that was a bit more detailed and specific as opposed to a broad business subject.  By chance I stumbled across the course in the Dublin Institute of Technology, which is now Technological University Dublin.  I had studied applied maths and higher-level maths and I enjoyed them so it drew me to the course with its spreadsheet modelling and other maths subjects it offered.  As I get more into the industry and the more business events I attend, I find that most people working in the logistics have just stumbled into it.  One does not go through secondary school saying, "I know what I will do when I leave school; I will go into freight, or transport or supply."  As I attended events, and especially over the summer as I met people, I have started working more on telling my story and I have taken time over the summer to write a blog.  I cover topics such as why I chose freight forwarding, why I got into logistics and my WorldSkills journey.  I have tried to share that journey to perhaps inspire somebody else along the way who might be looking for that little bit of inspiration.</p> <p>  My course is not an apprenticeship but TUD launched the logistics associate apprenticeship last year, which ran successfully for its first year and is now in its second year.  It has also launched in Cork this year with significantly high numbers.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the gender gap, which is a topical issue at the moment, especially in the industry itself.  I sat in on some of the meetings for the apprenticeship programme.  There was quite a high proportion of males.  My graduating class numbered 53 in total, of whom only eight were women.  We can see a gender divide in this regard but it is interesting that it was 95% women to 5% men competing in the WorldSkills competition.  In Europe, there appears to be a greater emphasis on women in the industry.  Noting the other competitors in my category, there was a higher percentage of apprentices than students in the competition.  There is a greater emphasis in Europe on freight forwarding and so on in apprenticeships.</p> <p>  A question was asked about school support at leaving certificate level.  I believe that honesty is the best policy here.  No support was given by my school in respect of leaving certificate choices for other options afterwards.  Once a week, career guidance time was set aside where we were given time but it was very much a case of, "Go and work in the computer lab and work on it yourself." When I came to leaving certificate level, I was unsure.  I was only 17 and it is quite a big life decision to make at such a young age.  I took the decision to take a year out to do further research, so I knew I was going into the right course.  Many of my classmates went straight into college and then dropped out within their first year.  This is quite normal.  I must give credit where credit is due.  The push by SOLAS now, and the Generation Apprenticeship launch is doing a fabulous job at the moment.  We are definitely starting to see it more across social media and reaching out to that younger generation.  As Mr. Dempsey pointed out, there is no support from schools for apprenticeships.  They are still struggling to get over the kind of image problem at the moment.  As Mr. O'Keeffe said earlier, even parents will still discourage apprenticeships because they were always seen at one level while third level education was at another level.  That is the way they were pushed.  A lot of positive work is being done at the moment.  It will just take some time to build up the momentum.  It has to be a case of going into secondary schools and starting with the students at an earlier level, perhaps at third year and transition year and fifth year.  If it starts at sixth year, it is too late.  As Mr. Dempsey  referenced, the student fills in his or her CAO application in October or November just for the sake of getting it done and out of the way so he or she can focus on the leaving certificate at that point.  This is definitely something that could be taken into account moving forward to target the younger audience.</p> <p>  My younger brother is currently in sixth year.  The students were brought to the Higher Options conference but there has been no push to bring them to any of the Generation Apprentice events.  Schools could be encouraged to cast a wider net.  The apprentice events are out there so there are opportunities to bring them along.  Ireland Skills Live does a great job at showcasing apprenticeships and we ourselves show what can be achieved, be it through an apprentice route or a third level education route.  There are amazing opportunities.  The content of the logistics apprenticeship is quite similar to the third level content, so the opportunities are available at the end are also quite similar and there is huge scope for opportunity with either path.</p></speech>

It is a huge honour, especially considering that we were 17 men and four women going to Russia for the competition.  I was grateful to have the opportunity to be one of them.  I can only speak for my own skill and I believe there are a couple of things that need to be addressed in terms of cookery nationwide - worldwide is a whole other conversation - especially for women.</p> <p>  I did not decide to go into cookery.  I finished the leaving certificate and took a year out as I was not really sure what I wanted to do.  I stumbled upon the four-year bachelor of arts honours course in Waterford Institute of Technology.  I was attracted to that course because the third year is done abroad.  I have just come back from that.  I was placed in a one-Michelin starred restaurant in Budapest, and then at the Institut Paul Bocuse in France.  I do not know if any member is familiar with it.  I believe that one of the major issues in the industry that scares women off - and men as well - is the toxicity of the long hours and the fact that we will always work on those occasions other people are off.  That is a whole other conversation and is something that needs to change within the job itself.  Women are put off the industry when they see that working kitchens generally are made up of 80% men and 20% women, and I saw this even in Budapest and France.  Head chefs and sous chefs are mostly men.  A woman has to go into a kitchen and doubly prove herself.  If a woman in a working kitchen asks anyone else to lift a heavy bag that she cannot, she will be looked down upon.  It is extremely unfair.</p> <p>  Apprenticeships were not encouraged.  My parents were not aware of the job I was going into but were very supportive.  Ireland had not put forward competitors for the cookery element of the competition in a very long time so I am the first one to go in eight years.  Ireland is a lot better than what we are putting forward.  More funding could go towards cookery and towards publicising and advertising the fact that there are good restaurants in the country.  Our food is some of the best in Europe and we should be showcasing that by sending more cookery competitors over there.  I must also say a major "Thank you" to Alan McCabe - who is not here today - who was my mentor.</p> <p>  Another issue I have seen relates to training for cookery.  Institutes of technology are mostly the institutions that provide cookery training.  I mostly had people from other institutes of technology who came to train me, which was incredible, but younger members of the industry need to be involved too.</p><p>People who are out working in industry need to be called on to work together with the institutes of technology to train the competitors.  Having been over there, competitors need to be warned about the vast numbers of people who will be there.  There were 46 competitors in my skill.  I observed the skill sets and the experience they had.  We could put more training into Irish competitors to compete against them.  We are well able for it.  This is something that should definitely be done.  More encouragement should be given to women to go into kitchens.  I have absolutely no idea how we can make it easier for them, but I think we could be doing much better.</p></speech>

I will explain how I came into the job.  I would not say the career guidance I was given in secondary school would have been much of a help.  Like others, I found there was a focus on college and on filling in the CAO form just for the sake of it.  I was offered an apprenticeship by a man for whom I was working in a summer job.  That was how I got to learn about apprenticeships.  The school did not help at all, really.  To be fair, SOLAS gave me some good help.  Any time I had questions, I could ring them up and that was good.  As I come from a Gaeltacht, I also got support from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which was a great help.  My experience at Ireland Skills Live was of great assistance when I was in Kazan.  I was used to having to deal with crowds passing by, and watching everyone as they did so, and that helped to calm me down and to get a little more used to it.</p></speech>

I am originally from Donegal.  I started secondary school, just like everyone else, and when I came to leaving certificate, there was no word of apprenticeships.  When I was going through school, I had slight learning difficulties.  I was not very much into books and all of that.  I was always into physical tasks, like those we did in woodwork and metalwork.  As everyone has said, there was a focus on going to college or to university but nothing was said about apprenticeships.  The big problem with being from Donegal, or from rural Ireland in general, is that it is difficult to find employers who take on apprentices.  Many employers do not know what apprenticeships are.  Many of them do not want to hear about apprenticeships because they are not interested in young fellows who will be going away for weeks.  This is a big problem up with us.  I went through the whole of Donegal before finally getting an apprenticeship after a while.  I could only get one company.  After I started out, I went from strength to strength.  I have done three years so far.  I represented Ireland in the joinery category and I definitely enjoyed the whole thing.  It was an unbelievable experience.  It definitely enjoyed it all.  I thank the committee for having us here today.</p></speech>

It is amazing.  Ireland Skills Live needs to be addressed more.  It needs to be bigger.  The route towards apprenticeship needs to start in primary school.  People can leave secondary school at the age of 16.  My dream started at primary school.  Things like posters are needed to give apprenticeships a higher profile.  They have to be seen more.  When school pupils come to Ireland Skills Live, they get an idea of what is going on and they want to have a chance to do an apprenticeship.  A greater focus on apprenticeships would strengthen Ireland's WorldSkills team.  A wider level of involvement will lead to more competition and a greater number of competitors.  If this sector is broadened, we will have a much better team and it is to be hoped we will get more medals.</p></speech>

In Ireland, our trade is known as mechanical automation and maintenance fitting.  Luckily enough, I had a brilliant engineering teacher in secondary school.  Without her, I would not be here today.  There was no focus whatsoever on apprenticeships other than in her class.  Going into her class every week was the light at the end of the tunnel.  I hated school otherwise.  I had a career guidance teacher, and I could not say she was a help.  Everything was focused on open days in institutes of technology and universities or on the agricultural side of things.  Absolutely nothing was done to encourage people to go down the apprenticeship road.  Why could they not have brought us out to industry or even to a pharmaceutical plant for an open day?  There was absolutely none of that.  I would like to see a greater emphasis on apprenticeships in secondary schools.  If it is not driven into us when we are younger, we will not bring it with us to this kind of level.  We will not get any further without somebody guiding us in the right direction.  That is basically what I would like to say about it.</p></speech>

Like other speakers, I found when I was in school that apprenticeships were not really pushed at all.  All of the focus was on the third level sector.  I got sucked into that and I went to college.  As I was going from third year into fourth year in college, it struck me that I would have preferred to go down the apprenticeship route.  When I was in school, apprenticeship did not seem accessible to me.  It seemed a bit too complicated.  It was not well enough advertised.  It was harder to get into an apprenticeship than to go to college.  College was easy to get into because it was a case of filling out the CAO forms and there you go.  The other thing seemed a bit harder to me.  Basically, that was it.</p></speech>

On behalf of all of us, I congratulate them and assure them that they are ambassadors for Ireland in this area.

We recognise as champions the 17 people who went to Kazan this year and indeed all of those who competed in the competition in previous years.  WorldSkills has also recognised them by giving them special pins to mark their achievements as competitors and champions.  We do not make enough use of that when they are back here.  Why are we not sending them out to second level schools and other places?  We should tell them that we are going to send them around the second level schools for a couple of weeks as part of a sort of roadshow.  We need to look at how we are going to develop that idea further on.</p> <p>  Interestingly, we have just started a conversation with WorldSkills about the One School One Country programme, which the guys would have seen in Kazan.  The programme involves the creation of links between schools in Kazan and teams elsewhere.  When I discussed this in general terms with Dr. Mary-Liz Trant of SOLAS and Dr. Vivienne Patterson of the HEA recently, we looked at how we can translate One School One Country into a much bigger event with the involvement of Generation Apprentice and the team.  We want this programme to grow dramatically within Ireland.  We will propose that to the WorldSkills board when it meets here in October.</p> <p>  Although we did not have a competitor in the painting and decorating competition in Kazan, it is interesting to note that 80% of the competitors were young females.  Most of them were from European countries.  It is also interesting to look at some of the results from Ireland Skills Live, which was attended by 15,000 people.  Slightly more young women than young men turned up at the event.  The ratio was approximately 51:49 in favour of young women.  This is interesting given that the event was aimed at skills, apprenticeships and undergraduate studies.  We really targeted the Saturday for parents.  We were not sure how it was going to work out.  It was really interesting to see a huge return on one of the days from young people who were saying that this is what they want to do and asking how they can move from an undergraduate course into an apprenticeship.</p> <p>  WorldSkills Ireland runs 56 competitions.</p><p>Some of them are new apprenticeships, so there is a changing demographic in the skills that we are involved in.  It is also interesting that Ireland promoted cloud computing as a competition and it is now a WorldSkills competition.  We have promoted building information modelling, BIM, as a competition, and it will be a full competition in Shanghai.  We are starting to use our awareness of our economic key factors and to promote those to WorldSkills as competitions.  New apprenticeships are coming on board which, when we build capacity, will also become apprenticeships.  The comment about technical graphics was very interesting.  That is a real lead-in to BIM as the guys there can tell the committee.  How it is not an apprenticeship at this stage is beyond me, because there is a huge economic demand for it as well.</p></speech>

It was highlighted earlier by Mr. McLoughlin that we need interchangeability between courses so that people can start off something and then possibly transfer into a more niche area.</p> <p>  I congratulate all of the participants.  They are all great ambassadors and we will be back to them again.  We look forward to hearing all about the conference that is going to be in October.  If there is a possibility for some committee members to attend, we would like to do that.</p> <p>  We are going to ask everyone, and they are very welcome to do so, to take a photograph with all of the participants, because we want to do our bit to highlight their achievements and to spread the message to media outlets that it is very important what they have, their achievements, and the fact that they are 10th in the world.  That is quite incredible.  That will bring them a long way in terms of future career opportunities.  I thank the volunteers and mentors who were mentioned.  I thank Ms Nikki Gallagher who organised today's meeting.  I will see everyone outside for a quick photograph and we will resume in private session because we have a huge amount of correspondence to get through.</p></speech>

I know specific questions were asked.  On general promotion, it is using these guys as incredible ambassadors.  The mainstream media did not cover the events in the way that we wanted, but the participants were stars on social media and that is the type of stuff that gets traction with young people.  We need to look at different ways to get the message across.</p> <p>  We talked a lot about guidance.  I do not think that it is just about guidance.  We need to look at how we develop vocational options and pathways in second level as well.  The last time I attended a meeting of this committee, there was a female apprentice who talked about the fact that she had to change schools because she did not have the subject options that she needed to pursue a vocational pathway.  We need to look at how the role of further education and training, FET, can deliver vocational options, vocational pathways and apprenticeship-type taster programmes in transition year or as part of a junior cycle and senior cycle.  There are a lot of things to think about.</p> <p>  New apprenticeships are rolling up.  We are targeting about 70 by the end of the year.  I understand the committee has looked at apprenticeship issues separately, and I am sure it will coming back to that.  There are issues to be addressed.  We need to get more employer buy-in.  We are kind of getting traction in terms of changing the culture and getting families and young people more interested in vocational options.  It is not just about apprenticeships.  It is about traineeships, vocational degree programmes in institutes of technology, and post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses that lead to exciting careers.  There is so much opportunity that we are pushing an open door if we can get the product right and promote it effectively.  Mr. McLoughlin mentioned that there are prospectuses for higher education.  We give a leaflet to people who are interested in apprenticeships.  Therefore, we need to package things a bit more, which is a big challenge.</p> <p>  There was a specific question on instrumentation and pharma.  There are new traineeships in that space.  I am happy to come back to the committee members to talk about the things that are being worked on in these areas.  I thank the Members for their time today.</p></speech>

This is important as they cause serious problems for the broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p><p>We will have an engagement via video conference with MEPs elected from constituencies in Ireland.  I am delighted to welcome the new and returning MEPs from constituencies in Ireland, including Northern Ireland.  I congratulate each and every one of them on his or her recent election to the European Parliament and wish him or her the very best of luck in his or her new term.</p><p>The European Parliament plays a vital role in representing citizens.  The committee has a strong appreciation of the role played by MEPs.  We very much value their insight into and expertise in dealing with European issues.  This opportunity to engage with them is very important.  I am delighted to pilot this way of engaging with them.  We are very interested in hearing about their priorities, the work they have started since the elections, the priorities of the committees of which they are members in getting ready for the Commissioner hearings and how the European Parliament considers the state of play on Brexit which, as we all know, is changing not by the hour but by the half hour.  This is the first of what I hope will be many engagements between Members in Dublin and MEPs in Brussels and Strasbourg via video link.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are only entitled thereafter to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence concerned with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>As I said to members before the start of the public session, the meeting will work best if we manage to have an open discussion.  I do not want it to be rigid in the sense that we hear first from the MEPs and then have members ask questions.  I want it to be more fluid as we all know one another.</p><p>On a personal note, to the MEPs in Brussels, some of whom are newly elected, while others have represented us ably in the past, I say I have no doubt that the people we send to Brussels from whatever political party and none are extremely experienced politicians.  They started at what I call the grassroots level of politics and worked their way up.  They are now our public representatives in Brussels.  I am very proud of each and every one of them following his or her election.  I know that they will do their level best to represent all of us to the very best of their ability.  This is what I call a friendly committee in that we very much work together and have done so for a number of years.  We thank the MEPs for giving of their time.</p><p>We will start with questions from the Vice Chairman, Senator Leyden.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-24a.547" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019092400002#A00300"><p>I send greetings from Leinster House to Brussels.  I hope the MEPs can hear us loud and clear.  I congratulate them on their election.  I say, "Well done," to Mairead McGuinness, First Vice President of the European Parliament, for the excellent work she has been doing for a long time in Brussels.  I congratulate Luke Flanagan; Matt Carthy; Maria Walsh; Barry Andrews who will take up his position, depending on the outcome of Brexit; Se&aacute;n Kelly; my former colleague in the Seanad, Grace O'Sullivan, whom we were sorry to lose because she was a terrific contributor, but I am sure she will bring the great commitment she showed in the Seanad to the Europe Parliament where she will certainly be a great addition; Mick Wallace, to whom I also say, "Well done,"; and Deirdre Clune who will join the Irish MEPs in due course when Brexit is concluded.  There will probably be an agreement, but whatever the outcome, I do not see the United Kingdom continuing to have MEPs in Brussels.  However, sin sc&eacute;al eile.</p> <p>  I congratulate Phil Hogan on his reappointment by the Government as Irish Commissioner and his nomination by the President of the European Commission as Commissioner for Trade designate, subject to the approval of the European Parliament.  That will be a matter for the MEPs.  I know that he will be a Commissioner for all of Europe, but he will also be of tremendous assistance to the Government and all others throughout Europe in the work he has been and is doing.  I also acknowledge his commitment to and work in the area of agriculture.</p> <p>  I do not have many questions for the MEPs because they have only just taken up their roles.  Some of them were outgoing MEPs.  The few I can see are new MEPs and just getting to know the ropes in the European Parliament.  As the Chairman said, what is of vital importance is the position on Brexit.  I would like to hear about the discussions they have had in that regard as they have a very important role to play as MEPs.  It is not us, as members of the committee, but they who will have to ratify the agreement reached between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is a major responsibility.  Irish MEPs will play a vital role in that regard because what they say in Brussels will be listened to as this is the country that will be most affected by the decision of the United Kingdom Government to leave the European Union.</p> <p>  On the renegotiation of the Common Agricultural Policy, because of the deduction of funding from the United Kingdom, it will not receive the share of the pool.  Northern Ireland farmers will not receive any of the money, nor will British farmers.  It is vitally important that Irish MEPs seek to protect the Common Agricultural Policy.  There cannot be any reduction in subsidies.  They are well aware of the dispute between farmers and the meat factories.  If there is any cut in subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, it will leave farmers in dire straits, even worse off than they are now.  I come from an agricultural area where we depend greatly on the subsidies paid by the European Union for organic suckler cow herds.  I will be relying on all Members of the European Parliament to ensure they will fight tooth and nail to preserve the subsidies payable under the Common Agricultural Policy at the maximum rate.  I am in favour of capping them at a reasonable amount, not the major amounts paid to individuals.</p></speech>

It has taken us a while to find our feet.  Everything is very different, but we are trying.</p> <p>  On Brexit, if truth be told, we are very much at the mercy of what the British will decide.  They do not yet know what they want, where they are going or what will happen.  Therefore, it is very hard for anyone else to know.</p><p>Anything could happen.  It is not guaranteed that it will happen but, obviously, it looks like it will.  The shape of it is very much in the hands of the British and there is not much that others can do about it.  </p><p>There will be opportunities to question some of the new Commissioners next week.  There was a lot of debate over the election of President-elect von der Leyen but whether things change very much remains to be seen.  She talked a lot about an emphasis on environmental issues from now on.  Whether she matches that talk with deeds remains to be seen.  Hopefully, she will match it with actions.  If one had attended or watched the plenary for the three different weeks during which we were in Strasbourg, one could see that the environment and dealing with the challenges of climate change are paramount in all the groups and there is a broad consensus that things must change.  I know that President Tusk made an announcement yesterday and spoke as if everything is grand, the EU is doing great and everyone else would not do as well but truth be told, the EU is not doing near enough and things must change otherwise we will not solve the problems at which we are looking.  Significant changes are required.  I believe MEPs from various countries and different parties are all feeling pressure from their own people that things cannot continue as they are and must change.  There is no doubt that environmental issues will be paramount.  They will be the biggest game in town for the next couple of years.  </p><p> The idea of linking with committees at home in this manner is an excellent idea that makes sense.  Obviously, it cuts out the travel, which is a significant factor.  It is mind numbing at times and we must do less of it.  Holding a meeting using this format is an excellent idea because it is important for us to tap into the committees at home as much we can.  </p></speech>

We all appreciate them.  It is a great honour to represent Ireland in the European Parliament and to get the support of the public.  People are engaged in European issues in a way they probably have not been previously, particularly with Brexit.  I will start with the support we have received here, which is striking.  We hear about it all the time but to go into the parliament and see the seven-page resolution that was passed last week, which is totally supportive of the Irish position on the backstop and issues such as protecting the Border, making sure there is no hard Border and protecting the all-island economy, is striking.  It is also striking to see the depth of knowledge among MEPs from all countries and the level of support so it is very strong.  Michel Barnier, who has spoken to us on quite a number of occasions, and Ursula von der Leyen are following through on the policy we have seen with Mr. Barnier saying this is a critical time.  It is a time to tell the public the truth regarding the impact of Brexit.  The new developments in the UK Parliament earlier are disturbing.</p> <p>  I am a member of the European Parliament's committee on economic and monetary affairs, which is an important committee for Ireland because it deals with financial services and banking and has been caught up in the significant challenges Europe has been through over the past ten years.  I agree with what Mick Wallace MEP said about the green deal.  Ursula von der Leyen is very striking and strong on that.  It is everywhere.  People are utterly committed and it is now about the implementation of that.  We will do a lot of work together because this is where there is a lot of compromise as opposed to adversarial politics.  There is a lot of working together.  Different parties will put forward their priorities and we will end up with stronger action but it will take time.  </p> <p>  The committee on economic and monetary affairs is also examining money laundering and more effective legislation across Europe.  Ireland does well in this regard but it is a critical issue.  It is a much bigger problem in other countries and we need to get working on that.  Sustainable finance will be a significant topic that the committee will hear more about.  Our banks and financial institutions will need more instruments to support what can done in respect of financial support for green energy.  I attended an interesting meeting last week on the sustainable development goals.  It was very disturbing to hear about the trillions of euro that are needed to implement those and the low level of support from the public and private sectors.  Both sectors need to up their game considerably if we are to implement these goals.  That is a topic that this committee might like to pursue at another point.  </p> <p>  The European Investment Bank, EIB, has a significant amount - &euro;700 billion - to invest over the next number of years.  We must make sure that Ireland gets its fair share of that.  Approximately &euro;1 billion is currently going towards climate change initiatives and support for small business that will experience difficulties one way or another during Brexit.  The EIB makes funding available through the banks for small businesses.  This is something this committee might be interested in keeping an eye on to see how the implementation of that fares over the next few years and to make sure we put forward reasons we should get money from this fund.  In the past, we have not always taken down the full amount of European funding we could have taken.  </p> <p>  I am also a member of the European Parliament committees on development and women's rights and gender equality.  A new gender equality strategy will be brought forward by the Commission, which will be important.  It will involve making sure every project that comes from Europe has a gender budgeting aspect.</p></speech>

It sounds like Eurovision.  Apparently, the Chairman is going to buy the pints afterwards so I do not know how he is going to deliver them to the MEPs.  I do not know how relevant my questions are.  I welcome our witnesses, including my friend and colleague, Martina Anderson MEP.  The first question is the most obvious one.  How can we better support the work of our MEPs in the European Parliament, specifically their work on designated committees, and how can we improve engagement between them and the Oireachtas?  I know it was a challenge previously.  The day the Joint Committee on European Affairs met, we tried to tie in so it might be too soon to ask that question but we are all agreed that we want more serious engagement with MEPs so how can we facilitate that and the witnesses' work on various committees?</p> <p>  Do our MEPs believe the European Commissioner-designates will be supported by the European Parliament?  Will they vote to support them and if not, why?  What do they think about the decision by the President-elect von der Leyen, to create a vice president with responsibility for protecting our European way of life?  Do they agree that this is the language of the far right and racist?  Even Marine Le Pen endorsed the new portfolio calling it an ideological victory.  What exactly is President-elect von der Leyen talking about when she refers to protecting our European way of life?  That might tie in with some of the more controversial statements that have been made by Irish politicians about refugees.</p><p>That is also one of the major challenges facing Europe.  I know Mick Wallace MEP would have been involved in going to Calais, and many of the MEPs have been interested in this issue.  The number of refugees Ireland takes in compared with Italy, Greece and so on is a major challenge for Europe.  If there is time, I would like one of the MEPs to comment on that.</p><p> The MEPs will have heard about the decision of the UK Supreme Court and people are calling for Prime Minister Johnson's resignation and so on, but Ireland is in a unique position.  In fairness to all the previous MEPs, a lot of the groundwork has been done.  Will the MEPs give us a sense of how they can work together on the Brexit issue?</p><p> Like Senator Leyden, I congratulate the MEPs on their election and I am looking forward to working with them in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-24a.557" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Grace O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019092400002#C00200"><p>It is a great honour to be in the European Parliament and to be speaking to our Oireachtas colleagues.  I mention the first point Deputy Crowe raised about communications and the facilitation of same.  This is it and this is the start of it.  It is great the initiative has been taken for us to make an input to the committee and to share points of interests.</p> <p>  On the last point Deputy Crowe raised on Brexit, we had Mr. Barnier in last week to brief us in the Greens-European Free Alliance on the negotiations.  The one thing I noticed in that briefing that I have also noticed more generally in the European Parliament is that every time the word "Brexit" is used, Ireland is mentioned.  It is almost like they are glued together.  Everyone recognises the greatest impact of Brexit, should it happen, will probably be on the island of Ireland and on the UK itself.  Ireland is clearly front and centre in all talk about Brexit, and that is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  This morning at a meeting of the European Parliament Committee on Fisheries, PECH, we had a Commissioner in to talk about the technicalities of access to EU waters by EU members should Brexit happen.  Equally, the issue of British access to Irish waters was raised in terms of reciprocity so some kind of an agreement would be made.  It was very clear from the language that was being used today at that meeting in terms of the fishers on both sides that there is still a sense, just five weeks out from a potential Brexit, that we are not really ready should the UK leave.  For European nations, particularly the eight countries that use the UK waters, because nothing has really been finalised, there is still a great sense of uncertainty for the fishers.  Inasmuch as some attempts have been made at trying to achieve some kind of agreement, it is difficult because the EU is finding it difficult to get engagement with the UK on this.  Also, there is an issue with the habitual use by many fishers in Ireland of UK waters.  What will happen?  Will some kind of barrier go down on 31 October or on 1 November?  There is a lack of security for fishing communities, processors and the industry in general.  It is concerning.  The members of the committee have all alluded to the fact there have been significant developments today, so we will see how it plays out in the UK.</p> <p>  I am also on the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, ENVI.  I will go back to what Mick Wallace MEP said on this.  Climate change is another area that is front and centre.  To my mind, Brexit and climate change are probably the two areas that are most spoken about in the European Parliament since I have entered it.  I will be very involved in all environmental issues, such as public health, food safety and the environment in general.  I am a member of the European Parliament Delegation for relations with Mercosur, DMER, as well, so we have to get going on that, but we have been watching closely what has been happening in Ireland in recent weeks with the negotiations between the Minister and the different farming organisations.  I am also on the Delegation for relations with Palestine.  That gives a sense of the work areas I have in my portfolio.</p> <p>  The new Commissioners-designate will come before us next week.  I am the co-ordinator in PECH for the Greens-European Free Alliance, so I met Commissioner-designate Sinkeviius, who is from Lithuania.  He seems quite competent but he will come before the Parliament to be questioned and scrutinised, as should be the case.  Maybe that is an area where the members of the committee could contribute.  If they had questions they thought we could ask on their behalf of the Commissioners-designate next week, that is something we could do.</p></speech>

I do not see anybody wearing any green, but I am sure they will all do us proud and we wish them well in their functions in the European Parliament.  Now that it has been clearly established that Parliament is sovereign in Britain, I would be interested in a preliminary view from Brussels from the MEPs on that.  Do they see Prime Minister Johnson having to obey the law and write for an extension of time on the basis that he probably will not be able to get a deal in place before 14 October?  How do the MEPs see that?  Will he be extreme and resign?  I would be interested in any preliminary views the MEPs have on that matter.  I have no doubt that, from Ireland's point of view, the MEPs will all work well together and they will get on and work very well with Commissioner Hogan, as has already been said by Senator Leyden.  I would be interested to hear any view the MEPs have on that and on the new Commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-24a.560" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Billy Kelleher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019092400002#C00500"><p>I thank the members for their kind words and I wish them well.  We are at two ends of political cycles.  We are at the start of our cycle and the members of the committee are coming to the end of their cycle, so I can understand that the focus will change dramatically in the coming weeks in the Oireachtas.  From the perspective of the matters raised by Senator Coghlan, what was interesting in recent days was the exceptional and intense briefing by the UK, both semi-official and unofficial, around the European Parliament.  They were saying Ireland will be under huge pressure and Ireland would be exceptionally vulnerable in the event of a crash-out Brexit.  They were doing a lot of briefings like that quite intensively.  They were also trying to divide the European members, especially those that are affiliated to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, by pointing out that the UK is a NATO member, that the UK would defend European interests, and that Ireland is a neutral country and it would not defend European interests.  That was more or less targeting the eastern countries that have major concerns about threats from further to the east of the European Union.  There has been an intensive lobbying in recent days to drive a wedge between the varying views and groupings in Europe.</p><p>Overall, I can safely say that there is significant solidarity among all political groupings and countries for Ireland's predicament with Brexit and what could flow from it.  The Supreme Court decision will bring about its own internal issues in the UK.  From our perspective, there is a simple view that we must do everything to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.  It would undermine all that we have achieved on the island.  It certainly is not in keeping with the spirit and possibly even the law of the Good Friday Agreement relating to the all-Ireland economy, North-South co-operation, and normalising life on the island.  There has been strong support and solidarity from all political groupings and countries for Ireland's position and our vulnerabilities to a Brexit with no deal or a bad deal.  We have been gazing into the crystal ball for some time about this issue, guessing what will happen, but we know for sure that there is a political crisis in the UK, and many of the decisions that will have an impact will be made in Westminster or by the Executive itself.  As long as the UK sticks to its original commitments to the Good Friday Agreement and has that as its base point, I expect that the UK is honour and duty-bound to do nothing and should do nothing to install a hard border, either by design or by accident, on the island itself.</p><p> The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, has been mentioned.  We can all say nice things.  I get the sense that the CAP budget will be under a lot of pressure in the next years.  While the previous agricultural committee in the outgoing Parliament made its recommendations, there is no doubt that CAP recommendations will be revisited by the new agricultural committee.  It may not open it up to full discussions and amendments from outside the committee itself, but it will certainly have a view on it, as will Parliament, along with the new Commissioner, who will most likely be the Polish candidate, Janusz Wojciechowski.  He will be a Commissioner for the European Union but there is a lot of pressure from the east to talk about parity of payments in any CAP reform.  There will be pressure there, but our duty as elected representatives is to defend Ireland's interest in those negotiations.</p><p> Ms Frances Fitzgerald and I sit on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, ECON.  Significant issues there include access to credit for small and medium-sized businesses, capital markets, and how we fund small and medium-sized businesses in the years ahead.  The committee probably knows more than anybody else that the Irish banking system is not functioning as we would like it to.  It seems to be incapable of assessing business loans and unsure of whether banks should be interested in lending and in supporting small and medium-sized businesses.  The latest figures indicate that it is not lending to the broader economy and that it is not acting as a stimulus to support small and medium-sized businesses.  That is having a profound effect on the capacity of businesses.  If we have a shock Brexit with short-term cashflow problems for many small and medium-sized businesses, the Irish banks have to step up to the plate and significantly improve on what they are currently doing, where they do not lend into the broader economy.  That is an issue which Oireachtas committees and Members should pursue in the short and medium term to address the immediate issues of Brexit, a potential crash-out and cashflow crisis and, in the longer term, the sustainability of the economy and underpinning that with proper credit.</p><p> Deputy Crowe asked about one of the portfolios of a Commissioner-elect, namely, protecting the European way of life.  We should really talk about protecting life in Europe and across the planet.  Our priorities in every aspect of policy will be first benchmarked with regard to environmental impact.  That is my reading of the political dynamics now at play in Europe and across national governments, with an increase in people participating both civically and electorally, who are pushing the climate change agenda.  It is now very much in the mainstream here.  That will have implications for agriculture, transport and how we construct in Ireland.  We should be at the forefront of it.  There is a question of how we fund all these things in the Irish context when our banking system is not sound enough to lend into the broader economy to stimulate investment in the green agenda and green economy.</p><p> Those are thoughts and opinions.  Brexit is the short and medium-term issue here that we are concentrating on.  The Commission hearings will happen and there will obviously be varying views from political groupings and individuals, and one or two may not make it into the final selection process.  My view on Commissioner Hogan is that he will be a great asset to the European Union.  Facing potential trade negotiations with the UK in the context of Brexit, I welcome that we have Mr. Hogan as trade Commissioner because he will bring a perspective and understanding of the all-Ireland economy and what is required to ensure that we have as little disruption as possible between the Republic and the North, and the island and Britain.</p></speech>

I am delighted for them and think that we have a solid team representing Ireland.  The first thing that I want to talk about is Brexit, as everybody here seems to talk about.  Eleven countries, between Finland and Greece, have borders.  What would make Ireland different in the event of a soft or a hard Brexit?  I have been saying since 2016, and it is beginning to catch on, that we would have no choice but to manage a border.  The level of management will be a function of the way in which Britain leaves the EU.  As I am sure the MEPs would agree, there cannot be an open border with a third country.</p> <p>  The European community has failed to deal with the issue of migration, forcing economic migrants to declare themselves as refugees.  We have no policy with respect to economic migration and Ireland, above all countries, should be leading on this.  We have been economic migrants for as far back in our history as we can remember.  Forcing people to declare themselves as refugees so that they can get residency in Europe is causing significant problems across Europe, especially in eastern Europe and lately in Ireland.</p> <p>  The final matter relates to defence.  There is an ongoing discussion in this country about a European army.  One cannot have an army without an intelligence unit that is independent of all countries.  Can any of the MEPs see a situation where the European Parliament and the 27 members ratify the setting up of an intelligence agency for Europe independent of all countries?  I cannot see it happening in any way and I think there is an obligation on those who have been elected to the European Parliament to dispel myth.  I can certainly see a need for a defence or security agreement.  We need greater co-operation between our police forces with respect to people trafficking, drug trafficking etc., but the notion of a European army is miles away from that.  There is an onus on those in the European Parliament to spell out whether we are heading in that direction or that this is a nonsense and that we are trying to have a security policy rather than a defence policy.</p> <p>  I thank the MEPs for their time.  It is always good to see them.  I congratulate them.  Can I have Ms O'Sullivan's soft armchair back now that she is gone?</p></speech>

I feel like I am back in the Oireachtas, which in a sense I am, although remotely.</p><p>It is good to be representing an all-Ireland group of MEPs from both north and south of the Border this afternoon with my colleagues, Ms Martina Anderson and Mr. Matt Carthy.</p><p> Brexit is very much on the agenda.  Mr. Michel Barnier spoke passionately and wisely last week, not only at the main plenary session in Strasbourg but also to groups.  He spent about an hour with the Green group.  He said very clearly that he has listened to the voices of women on the Border, who are very afraid of what might happen.  When a man like that, a negotiator, has sat down to listen to those voices, one can have confidence that the EU is acting in the best interest of Ireland and the Union.  Brexit is very much in the news.  Our colleague, Ms Naomi Long, is hosting a Brexit hearing tomorrow.  Two former taoisigh, namely, Mr. John Bruton and Mr. Bertie Ahern, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair will be addressing it.  It will be great to be at that event.  Ms Long has just joined us in the room.  I congratulate her on organising the event and bringing so many of us together.</p><p> In a sense, however, Europe has moved on.  We are looking at the next Commission and the multi-annual financial framework.  We should not kid ourselves that Brexit is the only show in town in Brussels or Strasbourg.  There have been significant negotiations on what Europe will spend the money on over the next seven years.  All of us in our respective committees are part of that process.  From my party's perspective and the perspectives of all of us, we are very focused on the speech from Ursula von der Leyen about a green new deal and the prospect of aiming for lower emissions.  That was summed up in the incredible video from yesterday in which one saw the US President walk past a child from Sweden, therein capturing the global challenges we face at the moment.</p><p> The Chairman and I realise that these challenges are not easy.  They are tough and will affect what we build, where we build, how we travel and what we eat.  It is a huge challenge to reduce our carbon footprint.  Finding a meeting ground in the middle is a challenge to the policies the Chairman and I espouse.  I look forward to further discussion on that.</p><p> I will respond briefly to three questions, the first being on the challenge associated with the European way of life.  I am a European and very proud of it but I do not believe Europe would be what it is today without the influences of culture, food and people from the Middle East, China and Africa.  That is a significant part of what makes Europe.  It was very dangerous for Ursula von der Leyen to pit migration and the European way of life against each other in the same portfolio.  That was wrong.  I hope she will reconsider that proposal.</p><p> On the second question, Senator Craughwell raised the issue of the 12 countries, stretching from Finland to Greece, that have a border with the region outside the Union.  The difference is that Ireland is very dependent on its friend and nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom.  The countries stretching down the eastern border of the European Union do not have strong economic, social or environmental links with their neighbours but Ireland is inextricably bound to the United Kingdom and must manage the separation process.  It looks likely that there will be very significant job losses as part of that.  That is where the European Union comes in and where the Irish and UK Governments have to show leadership.</p><p> The final question was on an intelligence service or army for Europe.  The European Union has an internal security and situation centre.  We have an external action service.  Therefore, there is a lot of co-operation on how we meet the threats Europe faces within and without.  It is a very large jump to go all the way to the suggestion of a common European army from the clear need to have internal and external co-operation on issues of security.  We should be very careful not to conflate good security and intelligence with the need for a common European army.</p><p> I will leave it at that.  I must attend a meeting of the industry and energy committee so I will not be able to remain here for much longer.</p></speech>

I am sure they are very busy in the European Parliament.  I congratulate them on their election.  There was a gruelling campaign and they did very well.  I congratulate them on taking up their roles in committees in the European Parliament.  We miss the Deputies and Senators who have been elected and we will deal with the by-elections that they have left us with in due course.  I thank them very much for that.</p> <p>  The European Parliament elections were very interesting in that the European People's Party and the Socialists and Democrats no longer command a majority.  There were gains for Renew Europe and the Greens.  It is quite a fragmented Parliament.  Do the witnesses believe there is any fallout from the appointment of the new President of the European Commission, in that the Spitzenkandidat system broke down and the European Council leaders did their own thing?  Is there bad feeling about that?  The mechanism for making major appointments in Brussels seemed a bit unseemly from this distance.</p> <p>  To follow on from that, it is suggested that Ursula von der Leyen had to rely in the European Parliament on votes from far right and populist MEPs from Italy, Poland and Hungary.  Is she compromised in that regard, in that she will not be seen to be effectively doing everything possible to ensure the rule of law is enforced at European Union level?  This is related to some of the questions some of my colleagues asked.</p> <p>  I have a final question.  The Brexit situation is unfolding as we speak and every day there is a new development.  The UK Supreme Court's judgment today is significant.  How do the MEPs and other movers and shakers in Europe feel about another request for an extension of Article 50?  It must be a genuine possibility arising from developments today.</p></speech>

I will deal with the questions in three parts.  First, I will deal with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, AFCO, of which I am a member and the co-ordinator.  I am also member of the Committee on International Trade, and I am the co-ordinator of my group on Brexit.</p> <p>  On the AFCO committee, I will run through the current position on the files.  The committee is the lead committee dealing with Brexit.  The right of inquiry is one of the files that is still on our table.  It was on the table before the last mandate.  Unfortunately, the European Council, of which the Irish Government is a member, is blocking the right of inquiry in the sense of the Parliament having a role in strengthening the power of the Parliament.  That said, we have had legal services telling us we could possibly take the Council to court.  That is a discussion that is taking place among the co-ordinators and the Chair.</p> <p>  The other objective is to enhance the remit of the ombudsman.  As the committee knows, will be voting for the ombudsman in the time ahead.</p> <p>  We are currently doing work, led by me, on a proposal on possible treaty change that will cover climate justice and climate accountability.</p><p>Reference was made to the Commissioner's comments on European values.  When it comes to the environment and the carbon credit allowing global industries to pay to pollute, this does not meet the values promoted by our group.  The AFCO committee will be the lead committee in respect of the receipt of information on Brexit.  </p><p> On trade, I am a member of the trade committee, on which, along with my colleague, Mr. Matt Carthy, I am working hard on issues relating to the Mercosur agreement.  The D&aacute;il has already indicated its opposition to this agreement and Mr. Carthy and I propose to organise a hearing on the matter in the future, on which we will provide information to the committee.  </p><p> Like Ms Grace O'Sullivan, I work on the Palestinian delegation and previously chaired that delegation.  I have been calling relentlessly for the suspension of the association agreement because of the behaviour of the Israelis acting with impunity.  The D&aacute;il has supported the occupied territories Bill, which provides that the EU should not access goods made in the illegal settlements.  </p><p> The Australia-New Zealand trade agreement, which is at an advanced stage, is likely to provide for agricultural access.  Mr. Carthy is very concerned about the implications it will have in Ireland.  On the question of the difference between us and the other 11 countries referenced, Ireland is partitioned, it has had a conflict and is party to an international agreement that was lodged at the United Nations.  I could go on.  </p><p> Brexit will have profound implications for the island of Ireland.  The North of Ireland will be severely damaged by it.  This meeting is more than just an exchange of views between MEPs and Members of the Oireachtas or the observer status that exists.  This committee should be facilitating the conversation that is well under way, particularly in the North of Ireland, with regard to our future.  That is a democratic right.  People cannot speak out of both sides of their mouth, in my opinion.  They cannot continue to say they are going to uphold the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts, respecting the democratic provision in that agreement that affords us the opportunity to get out off this train that is going to potentially crash and go over a cliff, and at the same time tell us that we have to remain on it when there is a trigger mechanism in the Good Friday Agreement, an international agreement, and in law in terms of the two Governments having put in statute our right to self-determination.  Nine opinion polls have shown that the majority of people in the North do not want to crash out of the EU and do not want to be taken out of the EU.  </p><p> In regard to Brexit and the backstop, the backstop is the least-worst option, which we have stated repeatedly, but it still drags us out of the EU.  We do not want a situation where cows and washing machines have more EU legal standing than people.  This is about people.  It is about the peace process and the political process.  While not speaking for the people of Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal, I would say the last thing they want to see is physical infrastructure being moved onto that part of the island because of a UK crash-out from the EU, with the North being designated a third country.  This should not be tolerated and nor should it be expected that the people of Ireland would put up with it.  The sum of &euro;1.2 billion in weekly trade supports 200,000 jobs across this island.  This list of possible damage is endless.  Time does not permit me to go into all of the likely affected areas.</p><p> Next week, on 9 October, Matt Carthy and I will launch a report here in the European Parliament by Colin Harvey and Mark Bassett, which sets out the role the EU should be playing, as it did in Germany and Cyprus.  They identify all of Cyprus as being in the EU, even though the north of Cyprus is under Turkish control.  They set out the role the EU could play in facilitating a calm and considered conversation about the time ahead with regard to when a unity poll should be triggered, what should happen were the outworkings of that poll to be consent across the island - obviously, the consent of the two parts of the island is required - and the role and the work that would need to be done by the EU in planning for the day when the country would be reunited.</p><p> Later today, wearing my hat as co-ordinator of the AFCO committee and as GUE-NGL co-ordinator for Brexit, I will meet one of the Commissioner-designates and I will meet another tomorrow.  Mr. Carthy will address Commissioner Hogan's appointment.  Ireland could have nominated someone that had garnered the support of more of the people of Ireland than he did.  Mr. Carthy has been quite vocal on that issue.  I could say a lot more but I will leave it at that.  </p></speech>

I will be brief.  I am a member the Committee on Industry, Trade, Research and Energy, INTE and the Committee on International Trade, INTA.  </p> <p>  On trade, as the committee will be aware the outgoing Commissioner for Agriculture, Commissioner Hogan, is now the Commissioner-designate for trade.  His hearing will take place here in Brussels next Monday at 6 p.m. in respect of which we do not envisage any problems.  Based on the meetings I have attended thus far, Parliament has up to nine Commissioner-designates in its sight.  One or two may be dropped, or to use the unfortunate word used here, "killed", but Commissioner Hogan will not be one of them.  He will get through with flying colours and he will do a very good job.</p> <p>  On data, earlier this morning Ms Frances Fitzgerald and I had a meeting with Facebook on issues such as fake news and how to control it, etc.  I also attended another meeting with representatives of the biopharma industry in Ireland who are concerned about Brexit and industrial policy here and the IT climate, which is an area in which I have been involved for the past five years.  The areas on which I will be concentrating over the next few years are climate, industry, trade and agriculture.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell asked whether Boris Johnson is likely to resign as a result of today's decision.  As we would say in Kerry, he will like hell, not a hope of it.  He is likely to come up with some other concoction.  There is no point going into too much detail on that issue.  We will just have to let it run its course.  </p> <p>  On Brexit and Deputy Haughey's question regarding whether, if an extension was requested, it would be granted, I believe it would.  It is encouraging that last Wednesday in Parliament, we voted on the European Parliament's resolution on the United Kingdom withdrawing from the European Union, which provided for the granting of an extension, if required, and the result was 544 for and 126 against.  This is an indication that if there is a crash out, the European Union will not be to blame for it. </p> <p>  As has been said, a meeting has been organised for tomorrow morning by Naomi Long, at which all Irish MEPs, North and South, will, hopefully, be in attendance, to discuss Brexit and its consequences.  Ms Long will be able to elaborate further on that meeting.  There is cross-party support here on Brexit, with not only MEPs from Ireland but from across Europe wearing the green vest on this issue.  We have held the line and this will be a further indication in that regard.  I will leave it at that because I also have to attend the INTA committee, which has already commenced.</p></speech>

We are living in very interesting times.  We wish all the MEPs the very best in the challenges they face into the future.  I have long held the view that the UK leaving the European Union will be a disaster for the UK and will be of no great help to the European Union.  The European Commission, Mr. Barnier and his negotiators, have remained constant on the unified approach of the European Union.  That is the secret of success.</p><p>There will be other challenges.  There will be challenges to the rule of law across Europe, but I have no doubt that the European Parliament will be well able to deal with them as they arise.  However, we are living in a changing world.  It will be dramatically different from the world of the past 15 or 20 years.  In dealing with the challenges we, as Members of the national parliament, and the Members of the European Parliament need to keep in touch with each other to co-ordinate our approaches and recognise a common cause.</p><p> It is often said the European Union should be brought closer to the people.  I have the opposite view, that the people need to be brought closer to the European Union to ensure we all recognise each other as contributors to the European agenda, as well as major stakeholders in the European picture.</p><p> For several months there will be a serious recognition on many sides of the dire consequences if a member of the European Union breaks out with or without a deal.  The theory about a better deal being available after a break-out needs to be dealt with as it cannot be that way.  If it were to happen, the European Union would be no more.  There is a recognition on all sides that Brexit was not a good idea to start with and will not improve anybody&rsquo;s position, either elsewhere in Europe, the United Kingdom or Ireland.  The Good Friday Agreement was agreed to by the UK Government, supported by the United States and the European Union, while the Irish Government was a co-sponsor.  Much has been said about how the backstop is undemocratic.  The Good Friday Agreement was not undemocratic.  It was strongly supported by people on both sides of the political and social divide in Northern Ireland, as well as in the South.  In the time ahead Members of the national parliament and the European Parliament need to keep in close contact with each other to ensure we will have an influence on the agenda, as well as to recognise the challenges faced.  We must also recognise that the next five years in the formulation of the modern Europe will be vastly different from what we have experienced in the past 40 years.</p></speech>

It is another useful opportunity for us to share our views.</p> <p>  I hope Phil Hogan will be a success in his new commissionership role.  As Se&aacute;n Kelly said, I do not see much opposition in the European Parliament to his appointment.  I personally hope he will succeed, but I do not believe he will as he has not succeeded in any political role he has ever had before.  He was a disaster as a Minister and failed miserably as European agriculture Commissioner.  His final act in that role was to endorse the Mercosur trade deal which was a kick in the teeth for Irish farmers, the environment and the domestic economy.  It was done for the sole purpose that he did not want much opposition at European level to him taking on the trade commissionership.  Time will tell and I hope I will be proved wrong.  It is important that we have a strong Commissioner and it would have been my wish for the Government to appoint somebody with a track record who would have given confidence.</p> <p>  There are significant debates occurring all at once.  The EU trade agenda is the subject of one such debate.  I get the sense that the prevailing political opinion in Dublin is that free trade has been good for Ireland and that, therefore, all free trade deals are good.  I accept that free trade has been good for Ireland and that we need an open economy with trade agreements.  However, I do not agree with the premise that all trade agreements are good.  I do not believe the Mercosur trade deal is a good one for Ireland.  I am also concerned about the New Zealand trade deal.  What the beef sector will lose in Mercosur, the dairy sector will lose in the New Zealand trade deal.  I disagree with the proposition of investor-state dispute courts which will allow foreign corporations to sue national governments for implementing democratic decisions if they believe their profits have been impacted on.  This has been incorporated into most of the EU trade deals being negotiated.</p> <p>  There will be a big battle over the EU budget.  This is the crux of Senator Craughwells&rsquo;s point and where our opinions diverge.  There is an argument about whether we are on the road to having a European army.  Oireachtas Members and others across Europe, including the Commissioners responsible, have cited permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, and the European Defence Fund as pivotal building blocks for a European army.  That is their language, not mine, and they celebrate that fact, which is regrettable.  The proposal made by the European Commission is that Ireland will pay hundreds of millions of euro extra into the European budget.  In return, we will get less back under important programmes such as the CAP, in cohesion funding and other vital funding streams, for which EU membership is so valued.  Instead, the Commission is proposing that we open up a new budget line of &euro;13 billion for a European Defence Fund.  Ironically, that amount corresponds to what the British Government contributes to the European Union.  This is a militarisation agenda which does not have the support of people across Europe or the Irish people.  It is one of the mechanisms by which we see growth in the far right and other xenophobic elements.  This is a crucial time in terms of the direction the European Union will take.  If it wants the support of peoples across Europe, rather pursuing an expensive vanity exercise which will contribute nothing to peace and more to conflict, we need to change tack.  The Irish people, through their representatives, should be leading the charge in that regard.</p> <p>  CAP reform has fallen slightly off the agenda, but it will be crucial.  We have to protect and increase the budget, but this will proving difficult considering that our Commissioner signed off on a budget which will see a 15% cut in real terms in CAP funding.  For several weeks we have seen farmers protesting at beef factory gates because they have reached breaking point.  While it is welcome that the protests have been lifted, there is an onus to use all mechanisms to address the inequalities in our farming model.  They will be addressed partly through reform of the CAP.  I look forward to working with our colleagues in Dublin to ensure we will have a strong voice in calling for a redistribution model for the CAP that will ensure family farms that need most support receive an increased contribution under the CAP which, in turn, will allow them to continue providing the most sustainable agrifood products.</p> <p>  Much has been said about Brexit.  What we saw happen today was another outworking of the dysfunctionality of the Westminster system.</p><p>Given that the British Government is being taken to court and losing, with the court essentially describing its actions as unlawful, one can see why more and more people in Ireland are turning their backs on Westminster.  We have a big job of work to do.  We have been working here in the EU with everybody who will work with us to try to minimise the damage Brexit presents.</p><p> On Senator Craughwell's question, I am astounded that somebody would ask what is the difference between the border of Finland with another country and the border that partitions our country.  That is the fundamental difference.  The Border in Ireland is an artificial border that was put in place for political purposes and has been nothing but a cause of grief since being implemented.  The Border and partition has cost Ireland economically, politically and socially.  It has cost us countless lives as a result of the conflict and, therefore, the mechanisms that were put in place to undo the damage of partition and undo the impact of the Border were twofold.  These are the Good Friday Agreement and the rights that were provided within it, especially the right of the people in the North to identify themselves as Irish citizens if that was their choice.  This means there is a responsibility on Oireachtas Members to protect the rights of those citizens.  Coupled with that was the membership of the Single Market and the customs union, which meant the physical manifestations of the Border could be undone.</p><p> I am from County Monaghan and my nearest county is Armagh.  To suggest to me or to anyone in the community where I live that we would just have to accept checks or regulations between Monaghan and Armagh is the equivalent of someone saying that the Chairman should have to do the same between counties Kerry and Cork.  It would not be tolerated in Munster, and it should not be in Ulster.  I believe we should be strong in that position.  If the British Government or the EU are insistent that some checks or hardening of the Border takes place, there will be an onus on us to consider constitutional avenues to ensure this does not happen.  Those constitutional avenues are available within the Good Friday Agreement.  There is an onus on all of us to start having the conversation in event that we need to use those avenues to undo the damage of Brexit in our country so that the preparatory work is done and we will have had the conversation around the constitutional, economic and political frameworks of a united Ireland, the transitional arrangements, and what all of the outworkings would look like.  There is an onus and responsibility on all of us to have those conversations now so that we do not make the same mistakes as the Brexiteers and end up having a referendum with nobody knowing what happens next the day after the referendum.  We want to make sure that does not happen, but for us to be able to that we must collectively have those big conversations.</p></speech>

I apologise for running late.  Reference was made to the events unfolding in Westminster today and before I arrived, I was dealing with some of those issues in the media.</p> <p>  I shall briefly outline the committees I am on and I shall also refer to the appointment and election of Ursula von der Leyen.  I want to focus on Brexit because that is my central focus in the EU Parliament.  Brexit is at a critical juncture and it is important that I retain my focus on that above everything else.</p> <p>  I am a member of the EU Parliament's committee on regional development, REGI, and of the FEMM committee, both of which are important in terms of equality and rights.  Those committees will also have an impact on funding in a post-Brexit scenario, which I take a particularly keen interest in.  I am also a sub on the committee on agriculture and rural development, AGRI.  Some of the joint committee members will have rehearsed the challenges of Mercosur, especially for beef farming, and for agriculture more generally.  I am keeping an eye on this for farming and environmental reasons.  I have quoted the figures I got from the Ulster Farmers' Union, UFU, previously.  A kilogramme of beef produced in Ireland has a carbon footprint of about 16 kg.  A kilogramme of beef produced in South America has a carbon footprint 80 kg.  When it comes to reducing carbon uptake, this is a significant difference.  We need to get this across.  There is no point having high ideals on the environment if our trade relations do not reinforce those high ideals.</p> <p>  Reference was made to Ursula von der Leyen.  I have no issue with promoting EU values such as openness, equality, freedom and democracy.  These are all very valuable values that we should act to protect and promote.  I have a problem, however, when people use phrases such as "our European way of life" because I believe there is a tendency for phrases like that to be used as a dog whistle to those on the far right, those who are Islamophobic and those who are xenophobic.  The President-elect, Ms von der Leyen, has coupled this with the work on migration and this is an unfortunate juxtaposition because I believe it says that it is in some way related to migration.  I do not believe that immigration is a threat to our way of life.  Some of the threats to democracy at the moment are coming from within, not from without.  We need to be conscious of othering people who come to the EU from all around the globe and who make a valuable contribution.  I will wait, with a degree of scepticism, to see how that pans out.</p> <p>  With regard to what is happening in EU Parliament on Brexit, which is of acute concern to those of us in Northern Ireland in the Border counties and beyond, I detect that patience is starting to run out with the process.  I detect this particularly among some of our French colleagues.  I believe there is something of a power play going on at the moment.  The exit of the UK would leave France in a much stronger position within the EU, and I suspect this has contributed somewhat to their eagerness to see this resolved in sharpish fashion.  We also need to be careful because it plays into the general exhaustion of the public, the political class and the media with Brexit.  People are sick of Brexit and I hold my hands up because I am also sick of Brexit.  There is a tendency of people to get into the mindset of, "Just let us get this done."  One of the key messages I am trying to get out with colleagues is that this will not go away once a decision has been made.  Over the next ten to 15 years, this will continue to be on the political agenda, affect decision-making going forward and influence policy.  Right now, it is more important to get this right than to get it done.  It is much more important that we take the time to make decisions correctly and not rush towards a conclusion simply because of people being fed up.</p> <p>  It is almost inevitable that the UK Government will not survive the current crisis without a general election.  There is also the possibility of a second referendum, momentum for which is growing in the EU Parliament.  Even if a deal is possible in the short timeframe available, there will need to be an extension for it to be ratified in the UK Parliament and in the EU 27 member states.  Some form of extension is almost inevitable.  I am reasonably confident that this extension will be granted if asked for, and certainly the resolution that was passed last week in the EU Parliament indicates support for that.  I have a concern that there is a degree of conditionality attached to this.  While I have sympathy with those who want a clear answer as to what the UK intends to use the extension for, I am concerned that the conditionality could give Boris Johnson wriggle room to say that he has complied with the letter of the law in asking for an extension but that he will not accept the extension given because of the attached conditions.  We need to tread cautiously.  There is work for the Irish Government and others to make sure that any extension is not framed in a way that allows Boris Johnson to wriggle out of his responsibilities.  As we saw with the ruling of the Supreme Court today, he is more than happy to wriggle out of responsibilities at every single level.  On the question of his future and whether he should resign, I have no doubt whatsoever that he should.  He is unfit for office and this has been reinforced by today's judgment, not discovered by it.</p><p>He ought to go but will he resign?  I do not believe he will.  He may use today's ruling to try, through some machinations, to get a vote of no confidence moved in the British Parliament against him that would put the Labour Party in the invidious position of having to vote confidence in the British Prime Minister to keep the British Parliament standing and avoid the snap general election that he has sought all along.  That could cause real problems.  Trying to predict what might happen from here is incredibly difficult but I am pretty certain that whatever is Mr. Johnson's next move, it will be to try to sustain himself in Downing Street.  That is his only objective.</p><p> It has been mentioned by others that we will have an event tomorrow focusing specifically on Northern Ireland and the issues around the Good Friday Agreement and people's quality of life.  Much has been said about the economic impact of Brexit and that is understandable because it will have a massive impact across the island.  There are also psychological, political and social ramifications of Brexit that we must consider.  We must examine how people's lives will be impacted by changes at the Border.  Tomorrow we will start by looking at the Good Friday Agreement and we have a former Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, as keynote speaker.  We will also have contributions from Mr. Tony Blair and Mr. Bertie Ahern.  All the MEPs from Ireland, North and South, and the UK who are pro-remain have been party to the organisation of the event.  I have also invited Ms Diane Dodds, MEP, from Northern Ireland.  I invited a member from the Brexit Party because it is important that such people hear first hand the realities of the Border and do not simply sweep away or dismiss the concerns that people are expressing.</p><p> The second panel will involve people from Northern Ireland.  They started to arrive today.  It is a broad mix, with people from Border Communities Against Brexit and the Climate Change Coalition in Northern Ireland, as well as a community worker from Derry and some academics.  It is a broad panel and the idea is to try to give a lived experience that brings colour to the concerns relating to the Border.  MEPs who observe the proceedings should feel they can understand better than when they arrived the complexities of the position. </p><p> There are different views among all the parties and I have listened to Mr. Carthy and Ms Anderson understandably arguing that the solution to this is a united Ireland.  It is the solution to everything when one speaks to them and I understand where they are coming from on that.  There are complexities in other people's positioning.  Some of the UK MEPs want a people's vote and others want a general election, etc.  We are trying to get to a point where everyone agrees that a hard Brexit would be incredibly damaging, as all the Northern Irish parties do, on the surface at least.  That is a common position taken North and South and it is a position that I want to see other UK MEPs bring on board, as well as other MEPs from across the European Union.  We need to reinforce at this point just how vulnerable Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement would be to any hard border.</p><p> It is also important to say that I hope we will be able to get some kind of joint statement from all the MEPs as a result of this, which would be quite a powerful counter to what we have seen of late where much of the diplomacy between Dublin and London feels like megaphone diplomacy.  I do not necessarily hold Dublin responsible for it and the way the UK Government has responded to the Brexit issue has made it incredibly difficult.  I was a member of the Assembly but it has been suspended for three years and there is no serious prospect of it being restored because of what is going on with Brexit and the inability of the UK Government to shake loose of the Democratic Unionist Party.  I am concerned that the Good Friday Agreement should be front and centre of the discussions we have on Brexit and the restoration of the Agreement in all its parts.  I agree with Ms Anderson as all its parts should include having a working Assembly and delivering for people on the ground through it, as well as all the other structures North and South, east and west, as envisaged.  Until we get to that point, we have much work to do.</p></speech>

I hope this is the first of many engagements with our MEPs using this video link.  It has been very worthwhile and it will set a precedent for other Oireachtas committees in using this technology.  I express gratitude to the technical staff and our secretariat, as well as the people in Brussels who had to do technical work to put this together.  It is worthwhile because there should be continuous engagement with MEPs, whether it is through this or other committees.  For example, it would be worthwhile for the agriculture committee to deal with MEPs who specialise in agricultural matters or attend agriculture committees in Brussels.  When they wish to engage with the Houses of the Oireachtas, this is a great forum to use.  I have been looking forward to this meeting for a while and we tested it earlier.  We wanted to get it up and running properly and today is the first success.  I thank the MEPs for their time as I appreciate they all have meetings to attend.

T&aacute; toradh ar an gcur chuige seo &oacute; thaobh roinnt ball foirne a spreagadh chun dul faoi oili&uacute;int sa teanga, agus faoi l&aacute;thair l&eacute;irigh beirt bhall foirne suim i gc&uacute;rsa me&aacute;nleibh&eacute;il agus ball foirne amh&aacute;in i gc&uacute;rsa ardleibh&eacute;il.

D'fhonn aghaidh a thabhairt air sin, t&aacute; l&iacute;onra na Gaeilge ag an Roinn a chasann le ch&eacute;ile go rialta agus a chuireann deis lean&uacute;nach chumars&aacute;ide ar f&aacute;il sa teanga.  T&aacute; strait&eacute;is foghlama agus forbartha &aacute; cur le ch&eacute;ile ag an Roinn faoi l&aacute;thair.</p><p>Beidh scileanna teanga san &aacute;ireamh leis an strait&eacute;is sin.

Anuas air sin, leanfaidh an Roinn de chuir chuige nu&aacute;lacha a phl&eacute; chun &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge a spreagadh agus a chur chun cinn.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste.

I am told today's meeting might even go viral.  It is great that there is such a level of interest in this serious matter of mental health issues and their effects on the Traveller community.  This is the first public session of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.  The joint committee was established at the end of May to consider a number of topics over the next six months.  As such, the clock starts ticking for our work as a committee today.</p> <p>  We are starting our deliberations with mental health, on which we will have three sessions.  We will then consider health, education, employment and accommodation and how these issues impact on the Traveller community.  As we listen to the voices and undertake our deliberations, I am sure we will realise that all of these matters are interconnected.  We will, however, consider them in their own right.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to meet and listen to representatives of the Traveller Mental Health Network, the Irish Traveller Movement, Kerry Traveller Health Community Development Project, the Wexford Development Group and Pavee Point.  Mental health is a critical issue for the committee to consider.  Suicide was the cause of 11% of all Traveller deaths in 2010 according to the all-Ireland Traveller study.  That report is nearly ten years old and the committee must address the importance of updating that study.  The statistics were stark then but we also need to know what the current position is.  In 2017, seven years after the 2010 study, the national Traveller behaviour and attitudes study found that suicide affected the lives of 82% of Travellers.  It is not only families but the whole community that is affected by suicide, as we will hear in great detail.</p> <p>  While the numbers are shocking, even more shocking is that very little changed between 2010 and 2017.  The experiences of racism, exclusion and discrimination that members of the Traveller community face have a profound and deeply troubling impact on mental health.  With 90% of Travellers in 2017 agreeing that mental health problems were common in their community, action, not just listening and talking, is urgently required.  Over the course of the three sessions we are devoting to mental health, we want to understand the scale and impact of the issue, the causes and drivers of mental ill-health and, crucially, how the State and its agencies respond to the scale of the crisis we have.</p> <p>  The Traveller population is approximately 40,000, which is equivalent to the population of Swords.  If there was such a high rate of suicide or mental ill-health in a town with such a population, we would declare a national emergency.</p><p>It is very important that we understand this, in that context of mental health.  It is grossly misunderstood and under-reported.  We, as a committee, need to understand the horrifying effects the mental ill-health epidemic has on Travellers' lives and communities.<br/><br/>Second, we need to address the causes and the pressure points.  Mental health cannot be analysed in a vacuum.  In the case of the Traveller community, it may be looked at as reaction - a reaction to racism, to unemployment, to persistent discrimination in schools, in workplaces and in the broader society and to poverty.<br/><br/>Third, the committee will recommend responses and solutions to improve the mental health and lives of Travellers.<br/><br/>A greater emphasis needs to be placed on Traveller mental health, without losing sight of the impact of internal factors on a person's mental health, which include the experiences of discrimination, internalised racism, inequality and the lack of cultural respect.  Most importantly, however, we must listen to the testimonials we will hear today, to the Traveller community and their voices.<br/><br/>We have with us today the National Traveller Mental Health Network, The Irish Traveller Movement, Pavee Point, the Wexford Traveller Development Group and Kerry Traveller Health Community Development Project.  In future sessions we will be hearing more voices, including on 8 October, and from health professionals, Government Departments, the Minister and the HSE.<br/><br/>On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Martin Reilly from the National Traveller Metal Health Network; Mr. Bernard Joyce from the Irish Traveller Movement; Ms Brigid Quilligan, Kerry Traveller Health Community Development Project; Ms Minnie Connors and Mr. Anthony Walsh from the Wexford Traveller Development Group; and Mr. Patrick Reilly.<br/><br/>One of the matters we need to be very careful about is privilege.  Therefore, in accordance with procedures, I am required to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings, which is mental health and Travellers, is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable, all of which is very important.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice members to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of these Houses, or on any official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones because this interferes with the sound system and the recording.  I also wish to advise that any submissions or opening statements that witnesses have made to the joint committee will be published on the committee website's after this meeting.<br/><br/>After the presentations by witnesses, there will be questions from members of the joint committee.  We will allow all the submissions to be made and will have questions then afterwards, so that we ensure witnesses' voices can be heard first.  Questions will follow.<br/><br/>I call on Mr. Reilly to make the opening statement for the National Traveller Mental Health Network.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for this opportunity.  I am part of, and one of the vice chairpersons of, the National Traveller Mental Health Network.  This network was set up to work around mental health issues within the Traveller community.  As stated in our statement, we are Travellers led by Travellers for Traveller organisations who deal with the mental health issues of Travellers.</p> <p>  We were established in March 2019 and since then we have seen issues regarding Traveller mental health become bigger and worse.  However, I am here to speak about my personal experience of mental health.</p><p>Almost three years ago, my son-in-law committed suicide and left a young wife and a daughter of three years of age behind.  It had a mental effect on me, my wife and my family.  The services are not providing enough care for mental health among Travellers nationwide.  We had nowhere to turn to and no one to talk to.  Where did we go?  We basically leaned on each other for support.  For me, it is a deep hurt that no services are available for Travellers.  That is where I am in my own mental state.  I was literally torn to shreds because I had nowhere to go, no one to talk to and no one to look at except to lean on the support of my wife and children.</p><p> This does not just affect me; it affects the island of Ireland and the Travellers within it.  I would like something to be done by the committee to act on the policies and procedures that will deal with this.  It is not just about me personally because everybody in Ireland needs it.</p></speech>

While it is hard to see any good happening from such a tragic loss, hopefully, what our deliberations are about today is making sure that these terrible losses and tragedies do not happen in the first place, or, when they do, that there is a good or better response than the one he received.  I thank Martin for being so candid and open.  It was very strong and very powerful.</p> <p>  I call on Mr. Joyce to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

As the director of the Irish Traveller movement, a national membership-based, Traveller-led organisation, I very much welcome the committee's examination on the matter of Traveller mental health and the opportunity to present to the committee.</p> <p>  Traveller experience of mental health is long-established and reflected in Government policy as far back as the Traveller health status study from 1986.  Traveller health was a national Traveller strategy from 2000 to 2005 that led to the Traveller health advisory committee being set up and recommendations which delivered the most comprehensive audit of Traveller health, referred to as the all-Ireland health study, in 2010.</p> <p>  Despite the Government strategy of 2002 and the benchmark and pathway all-Ireland study, no dedicated budget was made available to resource the critical actions within it.  Since then, there has been no prioritising towards resourcing Travellers' distinct mental health outcomes with a dedicated framework.  Since the 2010 study, there has been an ongoing increase in the level of suicide in the community and poor health outcomes broadly.  The national Travellers sample survey in 2017 found that 90% of all Travellers said that mental health was a problem in the community.  Some 82% of Travellers reported having been affected by suicide, four in ten of these being affected by suicide in the wider family, 49% among local Travellers or neighbours, and 38% among friends or colleagues, creating a multi-level effect on the family.</p><p>There are particular concerns regarding the rise of suicide among young women.  Suicide represented 11% of all Traveller deaths in 2010, most commonly in Traveller men aged 15 to 26 years.  This rate is six times higher than in the settled population.  There has been a steep rise in the incidence of suicide in the past five years, with a distinct emergence among Traveller women.  The past two years in particular have been a cause of great concern to us, where female deaths have included children as young as 14 years.  Reports suggest an increase of suicide among young women in their teens and early 20s.  Based on deaths reported to the Irish Traveller Movement by our members and networks, there were at least 30 deaths by suicide in the period January to August 2019 in Dublin, Cork, Tipperary, Limerick, Wexford, Clare and Kerry.  From our figures, though, this is an underestimate.</p><p> The incidence of suicide in the community is outrunning the very low progress to date of limited strategies such as Connecting for Life, the National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020, where Travellers are included in only one of 39 actions.  The lack of data by way of a national study or an assessment of need worsens the problem.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, and National Suicide Research Foundation have a role to play when recording and monitoring.  However, the CSO does not collect statistics on Travellers.  There is no specific inclusion of Travellers as a high-risk group in the HSE national service plan 2019.</p><p> Of grave concern to the community is that, in the nine years since the all-island health study, which demonstrated a disproportionate level of suicide and poor mental health outcomes, there has been little intervention.  In 2017, seven years after the study, 13 actions towards Traveller and Roma mental health were identified as part of a national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  The latest progress shows that one of these has been achieved, namely, the recruitment of nine mental health service co-ordinators to support access to and delivery of mental health services for Travellers in each community area.  Progress on other actions has either not been initiated or is at an early stage of development.  A budget to deliver on these actions has not been ring-fenced.</p><p> The policies and strategies to address Traveller mental health are disconnected and, given the scale of the programme, lack a priority focus.  There is no ring-fenced budget to provide resources.  There is additional complexity, as the actions are dispersed across Departments.  There is no advisory group overseeing the implementation and progress, and supporting data collection is inadequate.</p><p> In our submission, we have made a number of key recommendations.  I can refer to them later in my reply.</p></speech>

He painted a stark picture, particularly of the trends among young women and children.  The estimated figure of 30 deaths by suicide to August is grave.

I am the manager of Kerry Travellers Health &amp;amp; Community Development Project.  On behalf of our organisation and the Travellers in Kerry, I thank the committee for the opportunity to make a presentation on the topic of mental health issues affecting the Traveller community.  Ours is a county-wide community development project which incorporates a health action zone.  We work with Travellers who are static, those who are nomadic and those who have emigrated but who find it difficult to access services abroad.  We operate from the principles of community development, equality, participation, empowerment, inclusion and self-determination.</p> <p>  We have been working for 21 years to support the local communities of Travellers in Kerry to respond proactively to the issues facing us.  We have developed innovative programmes and initiatives in the areas of health, education, culture, identity, accommodation, leadership, Traveller economy, employment, enterprise, horse ownership, gender-based violence and youth development.  Our work has evolved over the years, as has our analysis.  We are fortunate to have the benefit of a strong HSE community work department in the region, strong links with mental health services locally and nationally, a strong Traveller health unit in the region and a Traveller community that is proactive and committed to creating change.</p> <p>  Using a social determinants of health model, we see clear implications for health associated with poor living conditions and high levels of exclusion and discrimination faced by Travellers every day.  All these issues, experienced to a greater or lesser extent by most Travellers, impact negatively on both mental and physical well-being.  While we work on supporting access to mental health services, in order to have an appropriate response to prevention we must look at the root causes of the mental health issues and suicide epidemic among Travellers.  We use the word "epidemic" because it is an epidemic.  There is no single Traveller in the country or in this room who does not know the heartbreak, pain and hopelessness of seeing somebody one loves spiral into darkness in mental health, thinking that suicide is the only option.  Fine young men, women and children are dying before our eyes.  Travellers in Kerry are diverse.  We have the most beautiful county in the country, and this sometimes is part of the problem.  The beauty belies the mental health crisis that the Traveller constituents of Kerry are experiencing.  A strong, proud and resilient community, we are at breaking point.  There is no person in the community who has not experienced the devastation of losing somebody he or she loves to suicide.  We watch our loved ones battle anxiety, depression, severe mental illness and addiction.</p> <p>  In preparing this submission, we consulted 61 individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds and experience within the Traveller community.  The findings were that the Traveller community in Kerry feels under siege, externally and internally, and that our mental and physical health is suffering.  The key message from the community is that there is a mental health and suicide crisis in the community.  All 61 respondents had lost family members or close friends to suicide.  Five respondents had attempted suicide and 22 are being treated for depression.  Seven respondents were hospitalised in the past five years for psychiatric problems.  The abuse of alcohol, prescription drugs, illegal drugs and gambling were named as co-existing problems.  We asked them what was the one message they wanted the committee to hear.  Overwhelmingly it was that they had been treated badly from a young age because of their Traveller identity, that this had created great trauma and that the mental health crisis in the Traveller community is a result of the denial of, and attack on, Traveller identity, ethnicity, culture, history and ways.</p> <p>  The community feels that the work the Traveller projects the mental health services in the community work department do is very valuable.  However, it is viewed as addressing the symptoms, not the causes.  A culture of blame is perceived to exist, where Travellers are blamed for their oppression, the marginalisation and discrimination they experience and the poor outcomes they experience in the areas of health, education, employment, integration and equality.  The hurt and pain the community feels as a result of its mistreatment over generations by the State was relayed time and again.  There is a sadness that addiction, suicide and intra-Traveller conflict appear to be increasing and an analysis that the community is turning on each other.</p> <p>  The 2016 census showed that there were 998 Travellers in Kerry.  Conservatively, we believe the figure to be 50% higher.</p><p>We have a large nomadic population in Killarney, the second largest in Ireland.  The nomadic Traveller community from Kerry travels within Ireland, the UK, the US, Europe, Australia and Canada.  There has been a strong history and culture in Kerry of Travellers from all towns travelling frequently for short spells between the UK and Ireland for the past 50 years.  We have no concrete research on this, just anecdotal evidence but we believe that nomadic Travellers who self-identify as such fare better in terms of their mental health.</p><p> There is a national unconscious bias against Travellers.  It is the last acceptable form of racism in Ireland.  Being a Traveller and being proud of one's identity feels like an act of resistance.  There is no acknowledgement of the pain, hurt, abuse and racism that generations of Irish Travellers in this State have suffered.  </p><p> I will now give a brief outline of our recommendations which are covered in depth in our written submission.  The main recommendation is that Traveller mental health and suicide be approached and named as a national crisis.  We need a different approach to dealing with Traveller mental health.  It must be taken much more seriously because too many of our people are dying and effective policies are not being implemented.  We call for an independent national inquiry into the treatment of Travellers since the formation of the State and for enhanced legal protection of Travellers.  We recommend the introduction of targeted mental health programmes specifically for Travellers and a national media campaign to highlight the issues around mental health for Travellers.  We call for a review of services to Travellers, the representation of Travellers across all Departments in Ireland and for an ethnic identifier to be implemented across all State services.  Anti-racism and discrimination training for all staff must be prioritised by the Department of Health.  In order to address inequality, Travellers must be central to the design and delivery of services to their community.  The inequality in the political representation of Travellers must be addressed by the State.  Community development departments must be reinstated within all CHO areas.  </p><p> On behalf of Kerry Travellers, I thank the committee for listening to our presentation and welcome the opportunity to elaborate on some of the points made and to answer questions.  </p></speech>

She paints a very stark picture.  The fact that her submission was based on speaking with 61 people who either experienced mental health difficulties, including attempted suicide, or who had loved ones so affected brings a great depth to her contribution.  The image of fine young men and women dying before our eyes and a community under siege will stay with people.  I am sure we will have a chance to ask more questions on that later.  I thank Dr. Quilligan and invite Ms Minnie Connors to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

The submission before the committee was difficult and painful to put together but the Wexford group has little confidence that it will make any difference to the lives of Travellers in Ireland.  Since speaking in this House in July, many other examples of the worst type of discrimination have occurred around me.  A young Traveller family was granted a house after passing Garda vetting but, following objections from local people with the support of local councillors acting on information passed on freely by the council, the decision was overturned and the house was taken back.  Only last Monday, my husband brought my children to school early.  He was told by a member of the staff that children could only enter the school at 9 a.m., a rule we had never heard of in decades of connection with the same school.  In the school playground about 25 children played freely, including children of the staff member.  We have been accustomed to such treatment but our children should not be made to suffer the same level of racism and discrimination.</p> <p>  Almost everywhere Travellers go, there are judgments and assumptions made about us.  In Ireland's social pecking order, Travellers are given the lowest status.  Travellers are viewed by the vast majority of settled people as engaging in anti-social and criminal activity, particularly stealing whenever they have the opportunity.  As long as these blatantly unfair assumptions exist, based on ignorance and prejudice, there is little hope of developing social inclusion within our communities.</p><p>The stereotyping of Travellers is also the reason so few are employed.  This means that Travellers are dependent on the State for social welfare, which reinforces low social status.</p><p> Many important questions have to be answered.  Why are Traveller mothers encouraged to use Wysoy food supplement for their newborn babies when settled mothers are encouraged to breastfeed?  Why, even in death, do people not want to be buried beside members of the Traveller community?  Why are Travellers, especially male Travellers, who present for mental health services treated in an off-hand way and asked questions which settled people are never asked, such as whether they are facing any criminal charges?  All of these factors contribute to the feelings of hopelessness and isolation which many Travellers experience.  As a result of the erosion of Traveller culture due to laws enacted by the Irish State and Travellers being forced to settle, mental health problems, including suicide, have increased greatly.  I would not wish to see this horrendous level of pain inflicted on any person, but Travellers live with it every day.</p><p> There are positive and negative practices and values in the Traveller community, the settled community, and every other community.  Despite this, the Traveller community is blamed for all the ills it experiences to justify the high levels of prejudice heaped upon it.  Stigma and myths are taken as fact.  When a person is made a scapegoat in a society, many unhealthy social traits are expected of that person.  I have been at many Traveller events and I have never experienced any trouble at any of them.  Despite this, I have to suffer the consequences of the few instances that have occurred.  I do not steal or take what is not mine, yet I am followed around shops and often asked to leave.</p><p> One of the recommendations we have presented in our submission, recommendation 1.3, is the vital need to raise awareness of Traveller culture at every level of society.  This includes schools, the HSE, mental health services, county councils, any organisation part-funded by the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, all Departments and, most important, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Training for Travellers with regard to the promotion of positive mental health would be beneficial, particularly if groups were established in which members of the Traveller community could work together with members of the settled community, motivated by a common focus and common goals.  A model could be developed that celebrates and challenges positive and negative aspects of both communities with a view to greater understanding and inclusivity.</p><p> I dream of the day when Traveller culture is honoured and celebrated.  This will greatly boost our self-esteem on a bedrock of good mental health.  I represent all the Traveller community today, but I especially represent my children in the hope that they will one day be treated with respect and fairness and seen for the unique, beautiful people they are.</p></speech>

This disrespect goes to the heart of how people feel about themselves.  She mentioned Traveller awareness training.  This committee held such a session.  It was attended by many of those present.  We found it very useful.  A member of the committee, Senator Coffey, suggested that such training be provided to elected representatives in local authorities.  It would also be useful for the groups Ms Connors mentioned.  Our committee will consider that.  I thank Ms Connors for her candour.  It cannot be easy to talk so personally.</p></speech>

I compliment my colleagues from the other Traveller organisations for highlighting the issues affecting our community.  Given the limited time we have and the complexity of the issues we wish to highlight, we will focus specifically on the key issues and the strategic recommendations.</p><p>All members of the joint committee have received a copy of our submission, which sets out some key issues and recommendations for Travellers with regard to mental health.  To date, Travellers have been invisible in mental health policy and service provision.  The well-established findings of the all-Ireland Traveller health study reveal the extent of the Traveller mental health crisis and identify the Traveller community as a high-risk group in relation to suicide and poor mental health, including frequent mental distress.  The Traveller population experiences a higher burden of mental illness and suicide than the non-Traveller population.  The suicide rate among Travellers is six times higher than the rate among the general population.  Suicide accounts for approximately 11% of all Traveller deaths.  I ask the members of the joint committee to take a moment to reflect on the fact that one in ten Travellers dies by suicide.  We have moved beyond crisis point.<br/><br/>As the mental health worker in Pavee Point, I engage on a daily basis with Travellers who are experiencing crises of this nature.  As a Traveller man, I see directly the impact that suicide and poor mental health are having on our community.  To put this in perspective, suicide is so common in our community that it is part of everyday reality.  When I was at a Traveller funeral two years ago, someone said to me that suicide has become so common that we do not make a wonder of it anymore.  That is the level we are at.  We are tired of the <i>status quo</i>.  Traveller organisations alone cannot take the burden of addressing these issues.  We have done our part in responding to the crisis by developing local responses within existing budgets which are already under-resourced.  Traveller health has not received any new dedicated funding since 2008, although we acknowledge the once-off funding from the HSE from the Dormant Accounts Fund 2017-2019 action plan mental health initiative for Travellers.  Nine HSE mental health service co-ordinators for Travellers have been appointed, but just eight of them are in their positions at present.  If we are serious about having better outcomes, we need a long-term plan that is focused, strategic and resourced.<br/><br/>I ask members of the committee to bear in mind that the Traveller mental health crisis is arising in the broader context of widening Traveller health inequalities.  We do not think such inequalities have been prioritised or supported at senior management level in the Department of Health.  It is clear from the recent draft of the national Traveller health action plan, which was circulated by the HSE earlier this year, that the Department has absolved itself of any responsibility for Traveller health.  This is further evidenced by the Department's refusal to re-establish the Traveller health advisory committee, which has not met since 2012 despite the support of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  This is an unsustainable solution to a protracted crisis.  A well-resourced and co-ordinated strategic national response with all key stakeholders, including the Department of Health , is urgently required.  Traveller organisations, health units and primary health care projects are ready, willing and able to play a part in identifying the issues and developing appropriate responses.<br/><br/>It is in this context that we are making our recommendations.  The national Traveller health action plan should be published as a matter of urgency and an independent implementation body, with ring-fenced budgets to drive delivery and implementation, should be established.  Sl&aacute;intecare recommends that there should be access to universal GP care within five years.  We recommend that Travellers should be prioritised and fast-tracked in this process.  Furthermore, we recommend that all Travellers employed in primary healthcare projects should be entitled to retain their medical cards with immediate effect.  The service that the employees in question have given to the State, when taken with the level of health inequality among the Traveller population, which is similar to disability, means that this entitlement should be extended to community service programmes and community employment schemes.  This would involve approximately 300 medical cards across the country.<br/><br/>Traveller-specific health infrastructure, including Traveller health units and primary healthcare projects, should be protected.  Increased resources should be allocated for their expansion and development.  A clear budget should be allocated and protected to address Traveller health inequalities at national level.  Dedicated resources should be provided to support Traveller mental health.  A standardised ethnic identifier, consistent with the national census and inclusive of the Roma population, should be implemented as a matter of priority across all routine data and administrative systems, including mental health services, to monitor equality of access, participation and outcomes across suicide prevention and mental health services for Travellers, the Roma population and other priority groups.  It is essential for the application of an ethnic identifier to take place within a human rights framework.  Finally, the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care should be implemented without further delay.</p></speech>

I am reminded that we are here to try to look at solutions.  Having listened to the witnesses, I feel at a loss, yet the State expects Travellers to find solutions to the problems they did not create or have control over in terms of discrimination, accommodation and State oppression over many years.  We have been tasked with finding solutions.</p> <p>  It reminds me of putting a lot of people in a working class community who have experienced poverty into a room and asking them to figure out how to get out of poverty.  We do not put people who have experienced massive privilege in a room and ask them how they will find solutions to sort out their privilege.  People who have the least amount of resources and control are expected to change policy and services.  Sitting here today as a Senator, I know how difficult it will be to make sure that we do something that is strong and representative enough and can actually create change because nobody wants to have to keep telling their stories for the rest of their lives in the hope that the regurgitation of the discrimination, pain and trauma a person feels will result in something coming of it.  That has an effect on mental health.</p> <p>  We see the headline stuff that massively impacts on mental health, namely, accommodation, education, discrimination and exclusion.  Anybody who wants to contribute to what I am saying is welcome to do so.  My comments are not directed at anyone in particular.</p> <p>  Exclusion between settled people and Travellers is something I have always observed in my community and between students in our classrooms.  I always wondered if there was a way to create better solidarity at a very basic community level.  Growing up, when I felt State discrimination and exclusion due to my background I still had a strong community to identify with and relate to, and I knew it would have my back.  We do not support and back many of the Traveller friends and students living in our communities, and the very first instance of exclusion begins in the classroom with peers and students.  I want to know how we begin to challenge the very first point of exclusion of communities within communities.</p> <p>  I try to challenge bias within groups of friends and people I love and respect.  I find myself backing away from the conversation because I am always very conscious that I am in a room full of people and if there are Travellers in the room I do not want them to all of a sudden hear a heated debate between someone who is advocating for respect for Travellers and someone in the room who has an awful view which I am trying to fight.  </p> <p>  How can we be better allies in classrooms, schools and our communities?  When walking through my community I always wondered why I could walk through the whole estate, but not the purpose-built estates where Travellers lived.  There was no avenue for me to walk from my house to the shop and be able to pass my Traveller friends in my class and say, &ldquo;Hello.  How are you doing?&rdquo;  In the makeup of the estate we always seemed to be separated.  How do we create conversation, awareness and be allies in a safe way for Traveller inclusion on that basic level in our local services, communities and schools?</p> <p>  My next question concerns schools.</p><p>I visit a lot of schools and I hear a lot of conversations which teachers have.  Recently, a teacher kept speaking of "dealing with the Traveller children".  I wondered what she meant by "dealing with".  Every student in the classroom is a student but she used this phrase in this case, instead of "teach" or some other such word.  She framed the matter as a problem to be dealt with.  How can we begin to change that and get to the stage where schools have Traveller or Roma teachers or board members, with whom young Traveller students can identify?  How can we educate people to change this?  It is awful to have to talk of training people to be human.  We should not have to teach people about unconscious bias.  People should treat people with respect and should respect other cultures and diversity.  Indeed, we should celebrate these things.  How can we begin to address the community aspect of discrimination from primary school through to the final school levels?  A young child feels exclusion and discrimination from an early stage in the education system.  If we address this only towards the end of a child's time in school, we only put plasters on the problem such as with targeted mental health programmes.  What do we need to do to prevent high suicide rates, depression and anxiety in the Traveller community?</p></speech>

As Mr. Reilly said, it is an enormous task for the witnesses to take all this on themselves because the responsibility is not all theirs.  Nor does the blame lie with them.  How can things change in schools in terms of attitudes and the conversations that are held there?  How do they feel we can tackle unconscious bias?</p></speech>

It is very difficult for our community but we want to address it and that is why we are here.  We have striven at local level for 30 years to build relationships and to understand the contexts for exclusion.  We have tried to build an analysis and find ways to build bridges with communities in local areas and in society, which is now quite diverse.  In the context of the values and principles of Traveller organisations, we work towards building solidarity and unity and the issues we have are very much those that affect the wider community at some level.  Racism affects our community but it also affects other communities, such as migrant workers who come from different countries.</p> <p>  There is an extent to which people want to integrate Travellers into their way of life, as opposed to accepting our way of life, and this shows an imbalance of power.  Nomadism is one of the core parts of Traveller culture, identity and way of life.  It is not a lifestyle but a way of being, yet it was robbed from us by the 2000 Act, which criminalises Travellers for moving.  Other legislation in recent years curtailed horse ownership while other legislation, made by non-Travellers, restricts every element of Travellers' culture and identity and strips it away.</p><p>We have only recently come before the political establishment in terms of these forums.  We have moved from policy to legislation followed by more legislation seeking to literally eradicate or remove Travellers to then assimilating them, and that has been happening since the foundation of the State.  We have no Traveller representatives in the D&aacute;il, no Senators or Deputies, no political representation.  Every discussion we have is on the back foot.  When we talk about culture people talk about justification and try to convince me about Traveller identity and culture.  When we talk about racism people try to justify or explain how Travellers should be better citizens and again we are starting from being on the back foot.  Yet when it comes to national level and representing Ireland, we are to the forefront; we carry the flag.  Francis Barrett went to the Olympics and he was a frontrunner in carrying the Irish flag.  We feel very proud of our nationality, culture and the achievements people have made on our behalf, both nationally and abroad.  We watched the rugby over the weekend and all the other sports.</p><p> In terms of where we are coming from and where we are going, first, we need to address the legislation and policy.  We need to ensure we address the core cause of Travellers&rsquo; mental health issues.  We must put forward some of the recommendations that have been made.  It really is about the ethnic identifier, the ring-fencing of resources and having a national Traveller health strategy.  Some members of this committee have championed a Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  It is not up to individuals to constantly have to articulate these issues and we cannot expect them to do so.  In terms of legislation, it is important society starts to look at Travellers differently post-Traveller ethnicity recognition and examines how we can build a better society that acknowledges and recognises everybody and that the Traveller community have a really important role within that.  It is about acceptance.  When one accepts that one accepts other cultures and one accepts Travellers as an indigenous group within Ireland who want to play a full and active role.  We have been doing that for as long as I - both an activist and member of a local organisation, now the Irish Traveller Movement &ndash; can remember.</p></speech>

We now have political will.  We have the Minister saying that this is what is needed and that this is what will happen but at Department level it was completely blocked.  When we talk about solidarity, it needs to be at that level because as Traveller organisations or Traveller representatives, we have done the studies.  The All-Ireland Traveller Health Study  and the Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes study is available.  We cannot do any more research.  It is available and staring people in the face.</p> <p>  I know Martin, whose son-in-law died, and I have seen the effects of that.  I cannot talk for anyone else here.  We know what is happening on the ground.  We have good politicians.  The political will is there but the solidarity is not there at departmental level.  We saw that with the Traveller Health Action Plan on which there were good consultations across the country.  However, when that plan went back to the Department of Health, it was butchered.  </p> <p>  Brigid Quilligan spoke about the social determinants.  We cannot look at Traveller health or mental health without taking into consideration the social determinants.  I cannot tell a Traveller that he or she needs to go for a walk or join a football team if he or she is having issues with their home in that there is no accommodation.  It is a broad issue.  We cannot examine Traveller mental health without looking at the social determinants.</p> <p>  Some suggestions have been made regarding the schools.  Traveller culture, language and identity needs to be part of the school curriculum without any consideration and that needs to be taught.  I learned about Cuchulainn.  Why should I not learn about Traveller culture, way of life and language?  It needs to be included in the school curriculum.</p><p>I learned about C&uacute;chulainn.  Why should I not learn about Traveller culture, the Traveller way of life and the Traveller language?  Those issues need to go into the school curriculum.</p><p> Regarding the budget, it needs to be clear that 48% or &euro;2 million of the Traveller budget nationally for 2007 to 2008 was allocated to Traveller health.  A total of &euro;1.8 million of it was taken away to balance the HSE's books.  It was completely unacceptable for Travellers on the ground suffering from many issues to be told that &euro;1.8 million of their funding was going to balance the books.</p></speech>

Like my colleagues, I have been living and working with Travellers and putting community development into practice for as long as I have been walking.  We have been justifying ourselves for as long as we have been walking.  Most people say that their first experience of discrimination was when they started school at four years of age.  I was very lucky with my school experience.  However, while doing this survey, we met people who experienced discrimination in County Kerry until the 1980s and early 1990s.  Lines were drawn in the yard; one was for Travellers and one for non-Travellers.  People were taken from their homes and bused into school in the morning, which looks like a very supportive act, but then they showered <i>en masse</i>.  They were practically hosed down.  They were humiliated.  Girls and boys were showered together with their clothes taken off.<br/><br/>I am rambling a bit.  What I want to bring the discussion back to is that our community is in a lot of pain.  In Irish history there has been an awful lot of covering up people's experiences.  Thankfully, in recent years those people have had their experiences acknowledged.  Travellers were part of that as well.  There needs to be more exploration and acknowledgement of the deep hurt people face.  Every day we encounter parents who tell us about their experience with education, sending their children to school and the retention and attainment of children at school.  We meet parents who, even as adults, are still deeply traumatised by their own experiences of the education system.<br/><br/>One of my colleagues said something very profound in our office at a consultation in recent weeks on World Suicide Prevention Day.  She asked why someone would turn to the person who has hurt them to heal them.  We need representation of our community in the different spectrums of society, but first we will do the work on the ground.  People are engaged in community development work, education and access to services.  That is what we do and we do it very well, but we need leadership from the top if we are to change anything concerning Traveller mental health.  We need the State to say there will be zero tolerance for racism against Travellers, for lack of attainment and lack of outcomes for Travellers and for Travellers being treated differently and less favourably in the State.  We must have true acknowledgement of Traveller history and Travellers' contribution to this country.<br/><br/>Alongside all of the work that Mr. Reilly and Mr. Joyce spoke very well about in terms of policy work nationally, there needs to be an acknowledgement of the true, deep pain Travellers have gone through.  If that trauma is not addressed, it will continue through the generations.  It is intergenerational now.  The question is how long people can be resistant and resilient.  For how long and for how many generations?  We are now seeing that even the most resilient people are falling.  If it is not alcohol, they are overeating, taking drugs or they are engaged in violence.  We are turning on each other and there is conflict and violence.  There are so many issues.  Education and solidarity require leadership.  Sometimes it only requires one person in the school or other setting to make the change.  I always tell people to reach out to other people.  Whether it is a Traveller or an immigrant, we are all human beings.  A child is a child.  What has happened for generations in this country is that Travellers have not been seen as human.  People are being dehumanised.  We face that now.  We see that some of our youth have no hope.</p><p>When people have no hope and feel as if they do not have opportunities, there is not much left.  We are facing a scenario where an entire generation has no hope.  We want the members' solidarity but we want it to be meaningful such that it can be transferred into legislation and implemented in policies and action.  We do not want to come back here in ten years' time to raise the same issues.  If we come back here, we want it to be to report on the success and how all of us together turned around the mental health crisis and suicide epidemic among the Traveller community.</p></speech>

I am anxious to hear from other members.  Deputy Joan Collins has a number of questions.

From the comment made by Ms Connors I picked up that the contributors have very little confidence that this will make any difference to the lives of Travellers in Ireland.  I understand that because at a previous meeting, a group from Cork made the point that very good recommendations were made in the task force report in 1996 to try to assist communities but they were not implemented.  There does not seem to be a driving force to have reports on mental health and other areas implemented and ensure there are checks and balances and accountability.  I can see that coming from the top because there is no real drive to try to deal with the issue.  That is probably one of the main issues the committee will have to raise in its report.  In my experience with local authorities, there was always money available for housing for the Traveller community but it was never used.  There was an attitude at that level that was dismissive of the community and its issues, culture and way of life.  That has to change.</p></speech>

This has been raised in all the reports published in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and in the task force reports.  What can we do to ensure there is change at the top level, which is where it is driven?  However, nothing has changed in terms of the education of children and so on.  I want feedback from the witnesses about what we need to do.</p></speech>

The focus of today's meeting is on health and mental health.  In the Department of Health, for example, there is no one driving the issue of Traveller health.  It has been given to others.  We have heard back that those who get the issue of Traveller health to deal with are unlucky.  That is the way it is viewed.  We need a driver waving the Traveller hat, so to speak.  We need a Traveller to implement the issues around mental health.  If we do not get that, it will fall to someone else and dissolve away.  We want people in the Department of Health to drive and implement policy on Traveller health.  The only way forward is to have a consistent driver to implement that.</p></speech>

We have the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS.  It is about giving a committee like NTRIS more teeth.  If I had a magic wand, I would like to see Departments being held accountable for the progress or lack of progress on every issue relating to Travellers.  If we are to be frank, we are at a point now where a lack of will and racism are behind the lack of progress for Travellers in Ireland.  That is not good enough.  Accountability is the key.</p></speech>

With regard to the public service duty, established in section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, there should be compliance.  As colleagues have said, the suicide rate in the Traveller community is not at crisis point but beyond it.  The recommendations need to be hammered home to the Cabinet.  I am not sure what other community Travellers could compare their statistics with.  If they do not ring alarm bells and if they are not regarded as indicating a crisis, what value does it put on Traveller life in Ireland?  No alarm bells would mean the political establishment giving a very wrong message.</p></speech>

When Traveller children go to school at four years of age, they feel they are different because of how the teacher regards them.  It takes away a child's whole life.  Imagine taking away a whole life.  At four, a child&rsquo;s life is gone because he or she is a Traveller and because the teacher at the door on the morning chooses to tell him or her that he or she is different from all his or her little classmates.</p> <p>  An apology would be nice for the generations.  Suicide has featured generation after generation in my family.  My grandmother lost two children to suicide.  My mother has lost one to suicide.  Is it going to be my turn?  Am I to be next?  Will one of my girls take her life, or my 16 year old son?  Who is next in my family?  This is the way we feel now and how we look at it.  It was my grandmother and then my mother, so it is now my turn.  Where is it going to stop?  Is there any end?  I have no confidence whatsoever.  I do not believe any other Traveller in Ireland has any confidence in any kind of help or support.  We are dragged down and cannot go down any further.  We are on our knees at the minute.</p></speech>

Acknowledgement in the form of an apology was called for.  Accountability is required and the buck has to stop somewhere.  There has to be accountability for the promises and commitments made.

What they are saying is dark and depressing in some ways.  Sometimes at meetings of these committees, I have questions but I am not sure what to say today.  As Mr. Reilly said, the Traveller community is in pain.  The internalisation of racism and discrimination is hard to quantify if one has never experienced it.  I have experienced it but not at the level of members of the Traveller community.  The institutionalisation of racism against the Travelling community is hard to quantify mentally and physically.</p> <p>  Let me refer to the terrible connotations of the media in this country and certain politicians who stored up horrible stereotypes of the Traveller community.  We are all human and there is only so much of this a person can take.  This leads to internalisation and mental health difficulties.  It can be very difficult to share the hurt, which leads to people taking their own lives.</p><p>If this involved any other ethnic group in this country, it would be deemed a crisis.  There is no political will to challenge these stereotypes and what is happening to the Traveller community.  As Mr. Reilly alluded to, there has been an 80% cut in funding to the Traveller community since 2008.  The advisory committee has not met since 2012.  The landscape is stark.  This all feeds down to a negative perception that members of the Traveller community do not have a contribution to make to society.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If that is being constantly said to someone, it will have a detrimental effect on their well-being and lead them to taking their own lives.</p></speech>

I want a positive message to come out of this meeting.  The delegations will always have our solidarity.  If there is anything practical members can do, we will do it.  This is a good committee from which to start.</p> <p>  People need to change their minds to realise the Traveller community has as much a part to play as anybody else does in Ireland.  I see the subtle stuff about Travellers that goes on in society with my own friends who are not bad people.  Certain things they say about the Traveller community should not be said.  These are the small things that become larger involving the institutionalisation of racism.  The media has a part to play, as do politicians, the Traveller community and the settled community.  If we do not deal with the smaller issues such as the constant humiliation of individuals and the Traveller community, we will have this conversation in another five and ten years&rsquo; time.</p> <p>  It is about resources.  Is it correct that 30 people in the Traveller community have died through suicide this year?</p></speech>

It is seven times higher than the national average.  Accidental deaths such as road accident fatalities and overdoses do not come into it.  We could say it is a lot higher.</p></speech>

When we talk about figures, in some areas it could be higher.  It could be up to 12% which is way above the figures thrown out today.</p> <p>  We have always come to the table and been productive in putting key recommendations.  Will those recommendations be brought forward, however?  If so, how will they be implemented at national level?  As Ms Quilligan said, it is about political leadership from the top to address the mental health issues which give rise to suicide.</p></speech>

We have presented to the committee on mental health care on numerous occasions and made several good recommendations.  It is frustrating when we come here and the committee makes recommendations.</p><p>Then six months has passed and we are on the phone dealing with all this stuff.  On primary healthcare projects, for example, Martin asked where a person goes for support.  Primary care centres are primarily based on office hours and outside those hours, at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, someone who is in crisis cannot be told to come back on Monday morning.  In the Traveller projects, it is the primary healthcare workers, the men's health workers and the mental health workers who take on that mental health work.  It needs to be considered that some of these are on 20 hours or 12 hours.  Some of them have issues with medical cards if they go over the threshold.  Some of them are not even getting the basic minimum wage.  These have been workers for more than 20 years.  There are staff within the Departments for 20 years or 30 years who will receive a pension on retirement and our people are working on the ground day in, day out.  As Ms Quilligan and Mr. Joyce will be aware, these people are not unemployed.  That is the harsh reality.  It is stark.  We will be repeating the one message until all of those matters are addressed at national or departmental level.</p></speech>

The committee members can go home.  They can turn their phones off, unplug them from the walls or whatever.  We are constantly, even when asleep, worrying about the door knocking where somebody else is in crisis, has attempted suicide or whatever the case may be.  We are at it 24-7, 350-odd days of the year.  We can never switch off.  The members can walk away from here tonight, go home, sit down and have their food.  We are always on the go.  Ms Minnie Connors, who is a Traveller, myself and everyone else are worried about that knock on the door or that mobile phone ringing at any hour of the day or night.</p> <p>  The committee needs to do something because, as Traveller representatives, we are fed up giving the members everything and them not acting on it.  Enough is enough.  As Ms Connors stated, what does it take?  How many more lives have to be taken, either by their own hand or anyone else's hand, before the committee states that they need to act on their procedure and policy?  That is what the members are elected for.  As we discussed outside, every decision the members make in here has an effect on everybody on that street, and they need to make the right ones.  They should stop taking from people and instead give back to them because, after all, we have given the members enough.  That is what I would like to say on it.</p></speech>

I have three teenagers.  I have five children at home.  I have one married who is 18.  She suffered severely with anxiety attacks since her aunt died.  I have a 16 year old, a 17 year old and two younger ones, aged ten and nine.  I cannot switch off my phone.  As Mr. Martin Reilly stated, we do not switch off.  If I switch off my phone, I have it in mind that my Johnny is trying to ring me to tell me that he is going to do something to himself or Mary is feeling unwell in the bedroom.  As Travellers, we do not switch off from our children and from our families and friends.  We are always thinking when we are talking to them whether this is the last time we will see them.  We kind of make a laugh about it and then we will joke about it.  In Wexford, we do that.  It is becoming such a normal life event.  It is just expected.  I go to funerals of young people and look at their children crying at their graves and say, "Lord have mercy, they were too young to die."  That is it.  We are accepting it.</p></speech>

Speaking for Minnie and Martin, in my statement I spoke about the frequent mental distress.  That is the frequent mental distress.  The study that was carried out showed that 62% of Traveller women and men reported that their mental health was not good for one or more days in the past 30 days compared with 19% of the settled community.  Looking at it, when Travellers wake up in the morning it is frequent mental distress all day, every day.</p><p>There are issues in the school or in the social welfare office, as Mr. Martin Reilly pointed out.  Ms Connors spoke about the constant worry.  Travellers experience mental distress all the time.  Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.  That is the frequent mental distress Travellers suffer.</p></speech>

There has been a significant crisis over the last ten years in terms of anybody, whether working class or whatever, getting access to mental health services.  This is compounded for the Traveller community.  This issue is not happening in isolation but it is societal one and relates to cutbacks in the health services.</p> <p>  Being a minority and being completely marginalised compounds the issue and these problems can then be internalised.  In some ways, this can be counter-intuitive, where people do not go to get help and completely internalise the issue.</p></speech>

He said it time and again, we have the data and we know the issues but I thank him for doing this.</p> <p>  Ms Quilligan mentioned unconscious bias, which is probably one of the most generous descriptions of Irish people's attitude to her community.  She also mentioned an act of resistance.  Sometimes when I am walking down the street holding hands with my boyfriend, I feel that standing in opposition to the norm is a great and beautiful thing and might always be an act of resistance.</p> <p>  Like Ms Connors, I too have been to many Traveller events and have never once experienced trouble.  I was the mayor of South Dublin County Council and I have been to Tallaght Library at Traveller community events on many occasions and they have been great and beautiful.  In regard to what Mr. Patrick Reilly said, I particularly take on board that Traveller organisations alone cannot tackle the extent of this crisis.</p> <p>  Sitting here has been quite emotional.  I heard it said once that emotion is not a good trait for politicians.  Not enough people in this place have emotional intelligence.  I did not think I would be able to coherently say anything in response to what I have been told.  I sit here with a lot of guilt as a member of the LGBT community that has had a struggle which has advanced so far in such a short space of time.  We have representation in Leinster House and it baffles me that the Taoiseach has not appointed nominees to the Seanad, which is his right.  Political parties also have a responsibility, and we take that on board.  One of the Taoiseach's nominees has done great work, which is something.</p></speech>

I got through my youth with music and the arts.  My family is probably better known for music than for politics.</p><p>When I was growing up and was distressed because of sexuality, I would have taken it out through music - the violin, the fiddle and traditional music.  So many of the songs I would have learnt were collected by Travelling people such as John Reilly from Carrick-on-Shannon, who lived in Boyle.  There were songs about the Travelling people, like Ewan MacColl's "Go, Move, Shift" and John Spillane's gorgeous song about John Reilly.  I would say the scholars and song collectors could scarcely believe their ears when they heard John Reilly chanting ballads they thought had long since disappeared.  So many of the songs I would have learnt were collected by John Reilly, and there is this rich culture that the Traveller community has.</p><p> My question is related to the arts and mental health because that was my way of dealing with hassle and mental stress.  Will the witnesses paint a picture of the state of Travelling culture in terms of music and song?  What could the State do to support that, not only as a means of supporting mental health but also of keeping the tradition and culture alive?</p></speech>

While the witnesses are thinking about their answer to that, I call Deputy O'Loughlin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-09-24a.735" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019092400002#U00300"><p>I apologise for being late but I was elsewhere dealing with educational issues.  I must also apologise as I am going to have to leave early for the same reason.</p> <p>  When I was in my office getting my papers, I had the opportunity to listen to Mr. Reilly, and I know Mr. Joyce has been before the Committee on Education and Skills a number of times at meetings instigated by Senator Kelleher, who is certainly a champion of Travellers' rights.  We have had hearings on the education of vulnerable groups to find where the gaps are.  Most certainly, we were including Travellers as one of those vulnerable groups that need to have extra supports.  One of the recommendations we made from those committee hearings was that the teachers for Traveller children should be reinstated because children from Traveller families can fall behind.  Some do not and I have had the experience of teaching children from Travelling backgrounds in primary school, but in many cases, that extra help and support is needed.</p> <p>  It strikes me, and the witnesses might comment on it, that young children in the education system need to have confidence to be able to blossom, and that may well help to support their mental health and resilience in terms of dealing with the other challenges they have.  When I was a young teacher and young local public representative, the late Brian Lenihan was Minister of State with responsibility for children, and he undertook a special project on Cant and launched it at the Riverbank Arts Centre in Newbridge.  This ties in with what Senator Warfield said in terms of celebrating culture and heritage.  It was one of the most fascinating and interesting events that I ever attended and I still have the book I was given on that day.  It was wonderful to see the children there so proud of their uniqueness and of something they could contribute that the rest of us could not.  I remember thinking at the time that if we could bottle this and try to bring it out, life would be so much easier.</p> <p>  Senator Warfield mentioned emotional intelligence and he is absolutely right.  We need to have public representatives who are in touch and who are emotionally intelligent, but who also have compassion for the different groups of people we come across.  We cannot legislate for middle of the road children or people who have access to a middle-class education.</p><p>However, that is what is happening.  I feel for the teachers, too.  When they come out of college, they are all too often geared towards a certain type of child from a certain type of background.  While much has been done in terms of home-school liaisons, more needs to done in respect of vulnerable groups.</p><p> I worked with the Special Olympics years ago.  Ireland hosted the world games in 2003, and we considered ways of having a legacy programme subsequent to the games that would develop new clubs and give support to young people and their families.  We tried to reach out to the Traveller community, but there were no Traveller children in our clubs.  That was a failing on our part, but we also found a block to getting Traveller children with disabilities to join.  Something has to change.  Our guests might comment on those points.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Loughlin's question was on supports for children in schools and outreach.  Since we are probably approaching the last round of contributions, would each of our guests like to make a comment?  We will start with Mr. Reilly.</p></speech>

Regarding Traveller education, the Travelling with Austerity study showed that the most disproportionate cuts during the austerity period were to Traveller services, including an 85% cut in respect of education.  That is baffling in light of how important education is.  If people have good qualifications, they can get good jobs and have a good lifestyle.  It has physical and mental health impacts.  Education is very important.  Unfortunately, 85% of Traveller education funding was cut.</p> <p>  A point was mentioned that I had meant to make, but it left my mind.  In terms of mental health, we are talking about youth mental health, maternal mental health, women's mental health, men's mental health, LGBT mental health, etc.  It is broad.  There is a major issue with access to services, with services not meeting Travellers where they are at.  There is a cultural lesson to be learned from this.  We must be mindful that what works for one community might not work for another.</p> <p>  My message to the Oireachtas is that, while we welcome this opportunity, we are here and doing our part.  We want to do it and will continue doing it.  We just need the involvement of the top levels and for all Departments to work with us, not block us.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

He was very agitated and threatening to take his life.  It took me four hours to get him to the hospital.  I had to keep him sitting there waiting for the doctor to come.  It was an horrendous day.  When we went into a little room to talk to the consultant or whatever he was - he was not human - the very first question he asked the young man was whether he had any criminal court case pending.  Why?  The young man was a sick person.  He was shaking.  He had reached such a bad state in his life that he had nowhere else to go, yet this doctor chose to ask that question.  That was it, and the young man just stood up and walked out.  Maybe the doctors could-----</p></speech>

This only happened two weeks ago.  There is a perception about Travellers in general, but particularly young ones, that we are liars and thieves and cannot be believed.  One internalises that.</p> <p>  Regarding Senator Warfield's comments, I am a great believer in the arts.</p><p>We want to be able to tell our story and we want our children to know the contribution our ancestors and forefathers made to Ireland and to realise the contribution we make today.  Sometimes that is shoved under the carpet or thrown out like dirty water.  However, Ireland's music and poetry would not be so rich without our people.  I would like to see our language preserved.  There is a great move in that regard and it will be of immense value to our young people.  It will be a validation, an acknowledgement that we matter and that what we have to say is right.  In certain places, when we were children we were slapped if we were speaking our language, and not by our parents.  We were slapped and told we did not know what we were saying, but we were speaking our own language that came from our home.  I am proud today to be able to hold onto that language, but many of the young people do not.</p><p> In terms of the arts, mental health and the culture, with horses we see more horse care and coppersmithing and we would like the committee's support for that.  That can go hand-in-hand with the policy implementation.  My final words today are that whatever is agreed in any committee must be implemented and monitored.  There is no point in making recommendations, policy and legislation for the sake of it.  They must be implemented, enforced and monitored.  There must be outcomes.  If I was in a job tomorrow morning and I was not producing outcomes in that job, I doubt that I would be in that position for long.  All we are asking for Travellers is that they get the proper outcomes and are given a chance to get them.</p></speech>

It is a difficult issue for people to articulate.  I also strongly feel that where people have been very closely affected by that it is a big thing to ask people who are directly impacted to make a presentation.  It is quite an unfair request.  However, individuals present because they feel they need to air their living experience.  It is their living experience.  I should add that Travellers are very resilient.  They have overcome many hurdles.  At this stage they probably feel they are ready for, and nearly anticipate, how society is going to treat them.  They are geared and resilient.  Part of it is about preparing their children for that hostile, difficult and challenging environment.</p> <p>  However, cracks tend to happen.  One of the big aspects is that our culture has been and continues to be under siege.  People pick some nice parts of it, such as the music and poetry, and say it is great but they do not do much to support or enable it.  There has been no support for nomadism, which is a core part of it.  With regard to Traveller accommodation, there is very little in terms of the budgets being drawn down.  In the case of education, we are still playing catch up from a system that was institutionalised.  Brigid Quilligan spoke about the segregation but I was one of those, along with many others, who were in a special, segregated class.  I would nearly describe it as apartheid, like in South Africa.  There was really no difference.</p> <p>  We are resilient and we have a positive outlook on life, despite the negative elements that affect us.  We want to achieve and do better.  We want to reach out to the community.  It is probably in our genes that we want to reach out because we are a community that strives on what a community is and we have much to learn from others.</p> <p>  I saw some positive elements recently, such as the formal State recognition of Traveller ethnicity.</p><p>Recently Cant and tin-smithing were named as part of the tangible assets of the Traveller community, along with hurling, which is a really positive step.  In the areas of sports, music, arts and culture, Travellers are really putting themselves out there.  Reference was made to Traveller musicians and the song "Go, Move, Shift".  My family lived on the Darndale Road at the time that song was written and it has a personal resonance for me; it is all about people's lived experience.  The focus should not just be on the musicians of the past but also on the musicians of today like Sharon Ward, an absolutely fantastic, resilient singer and persona, Thomas McCarthy and Pecker Dunne.  </p><p> The approach to addressing the underlying issues must be right across the spectrum.  People might hinge on music or other areas but we must get back to the real issues in terms of recommendations, political will and resources.  It is about putting forward key recommendations that can be delivered and monitored, with clear outcomes.  The figures in front of us today are absolutely unacceptable and the State cannot stand over them.  The Minister must be asked what his Department is doing to address these issues for the Traveller community.</p></speech>

In terms of the recommendation on Traveller-specific mental health services, do the witnesses envisage that being integrated within existing mental health services or a stand-alone service?  It is important, in terms of developing services, to know that.</p></speech>

It is very precious and has saved many lives throughout the community.  That service needs to be supported and rolled out around the country.  In Kerry, we paid for a counsellor who has been supported to develop her analysis around Travellers and to provide a Traveller counselling service because people told us that when they attend counselling sessions, they had to explain their whole life story and justify their culture.  In that particular instance and until a sufficient number of trainers are trained, we would need to have people with a high level of competency around Traveller cultural awareness delivering counselling services.</p></speech>

Today is not the last word for any of our witnesses.  We can turn our phones off but they cannot.  I am really grateful to them all for their contributions.  I know that it has been painful for them to share so many stories.  As Senator Warfield said, the fact that so many people had to share their stories in order to be heard, is problematic.</p><p> Deputy Gino Kenny talked about a stark and grave crisis and the personal cost of sharing one's experiences of it.  Our guests really have shared and we are more informed than ever as a result.  It has been difficult to listen to the stories.  It should be difficult to hear about these situations, which Mr. Reilly estimates have affected 30 people, although that is an underestimation because it does not include those who may have tried to take their own lives.  There is a big mismatch between the scale of the problem on one side and the response and resources provided to tackle the problem on the other.  That came across very clearly.  We have been given a really good insight but there is more to be explored with regard to the root causes, as Ms Quilligan mentioned.</p><p> Our next session be on 8 October, when we will meet with the Traveller Counselling Service, a group from west Limerick, the Offaly Traveller Movement, the Galway Traveller Movement and Exchange House.  We had a record number of submissions, which is a powerful indication in its own right.  The powers that be will also be coming before the committee.  We will be putting to them the questions our guests have asked.  We will be meeting the Minister for Health and officials from his Department, HSE officials and Dr. Brian Keogh, an academic from Trinity College Dublin who is interested in these matters.  We have also invited Senator Joan Freeman to appear because there were strong recommendations in the report of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care about which we do not want to forget.  It was hard enough for some of us around the table to get those recommendations included in the report and we want to ensure that they are not forgotten.</p><p> If our guests will accept us, we will be their allies.  It is up to them to decide but those on the committee are allies and it is our intent to produce a report to be acted upon rather than another document which will be considered to have been full of broken and unfulfilled promises in ten years' time.  I thank the members of the committee for their great attention and for the great questions they have asked.</p></speech>

At the start of the meeting, we laid out the plan for future sessions.  In private session last week, we agreed that there would be a session after those that have been set out at which we could hear the voices of those who would not normally contribute to policy or academia.  The Chair did not mention that session and I wanted to ensure that it is still to be held.</p></speech>

That was discussed.  We will put the proposal to invite a wider selection of people to members and I am sure there will be agreement.  Mr. Reilly and Mr. Joyce have paths worn to the Oireachtas but there are other voices we want to hear.  Ms Quilligan stated that 61 people are engaged in this process.  That is very encouraging.  When the committee is finishing its overall deliberations, we will try to invite some of those who, unfortunately, are not regular visitors to Leinster House.  We will take that up.  If there is agreement, I will make sure to include it in our schedule.</p> <p>  We will now adjourn until 11 a.m. on Tuesday, 8 October, when we will continue our discussions on mental health issues affecting the Traveller community.  We would be grateful if our guests could stay around for a quick photograph because it is important to document and record the work of the committee.  I again thank them very much for their kindness, candour, and direction.  It is very much appreciated.  Maya Angelou said that when one knows better, one does better.  We are all learning all of the time.  We have learned a lot today, although there is more to learn.</p></speech>
