I remind all members they are required to participate either within the meeting room or remotely from within the Leinster House complex.  Should a division occur, members participating remotely will be required to make their way to the meeting room within the normal division time to vote before returning to their original location.  The proceedings of Oireachtas committees are now conducted without the requirement for social distancing, with normal capacity in the committee rooms restored.  However, committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online through MS Teams.  All those attending in the committee room and their environs should continue to sanitise, wash their hands properly and often, avail of sanitisers where possible, be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Those who have any Covid-19 symptoms, no matter how mild, should not attend the meetings.</p></speech>

The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a scheme of statutory sick leave by employers covering the existing gap caused by illness-benefit waiting days and set a minimum floor of entitlement for employees who are unable to work due to illness or injury.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, who is accompanied by his officials.  Does the Minister of State want to make a brief comment before we start?</p></speech>

I thank the Chair for facilitating this legislation quite quickly and for his work on the pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation.  I apologise for the slight delay at the start of the meeting.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the Sick Leave Bill 2022 with the committee today.  It will ensure that for the first time in Ireland all employees will have a statutory entitlement to paid sick leave if they are unable to work due to illness or injury.</p> <p>  The pandemic exposed the vulnerable position of many people, especially in the private sector, when it comes to missing work due to illness.  Our view, which I think is shared by the majority of the committee, is that workers should not feel they have to go to work when sick because they will lose all of their income otherwise.  It is not just bad for them, it is bad for public health, as sick workers might infect colleagues, clients and customers and be more likely to make a mistake, injure themselves or do harm to others as well.</p> <p>  As a starting point, this scheme will cover the three waiting days before eligibility for illness benefit from the State kicks in.  As we know, illness benefit can last up to two years.  Where an employee has an extended period of illness, this scheme will operate seamlessly with the existing illness benefit scheme and system.  Once employees have exhausted their entitlement to paid sick leave from their employers, they will move on to illness benefit paid by the State, provided they have made adequate PRSI contributions.</p> <p>  The length of coverage will increase over time and eventually provide for an entitlement to ten working days or two weeks annually in the fourth year of the scheme's operation.</p><p> Events of the last two years have shown how necessary this legislation is.  While it represents a new expense for some businesses, and we understand the pressure that will put on them, it is common across Europe that employers cover a portion of sick leave costs.  We have taken care to ensure that costs are not excessive.  That is why there is a four-year lead-in period with this legislation.</p><p> Some have said that they think the Bill goes too far, and others argue that it does not go far enough.  We believe, in general, that we have got the balance right with the legislation we are proposing here.</p><p> Ultimately this Bill means that workers will not have to attend work while sick through economic necessity.  This will be one of the positive legacies to emerge from the pandemic.  While Deputies might differ on the approach, we are all agreed that this legislation is the right thing to do and the sooner we can implement it, the better.</p><p> I thank Deputies for their contributions on the Bill at the earlier Stage and I look forward to our discussion here this morning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#B00200"><p>A number of amendments tabled on Committee Stage have, unfortunately, been ruled out of order.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 9 in the name of Deputy O'Reilly form a composite proposal which would allow employees to self-certify for sick leave instead of being required to provide a medical certificate.  We will come to all of these as we go through the Bill.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 7, in the name of Deputy Paul Murphy, would require a medical certificate only after the tenth day of sick leave.  Amendment No. 8, in the name of Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, would only require a medical certificate after three consecutive days of illness.  These amendments would create a statutory entitlement to sick leave pay for public servants above and beyond what is currently the case under regulations.  This would potentially lead to greater costs for the Exchequer arising from sick leave payments.</p> <p>  Sick leave remuneration for public servants is determined by way of ministerial regulations made under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  The current regulations under the Act are the Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations 2014, Sl 124 of 2014.  Under those regulations, public service employees must provide a medical certificate to qualify for sick pay, except where a local employer decides to waive that requirement.  In accordance with Standing Order 212(3), the amendments must be ruled out of order as they have the potential to impose a charge on the revenue.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 25 and 27, in the name of Deputy Paul Murphy, would remove the 20-week cap on the amount of remuneration that may be awarded by the Labour Court.  This exposes the Exchequer to higher costs in the event of a public sector employee winning a case.  In accordance with Standing Order 212(3), the amendments must be ruled out of order as they have the potential to impose a charge on the revenue.</p> <p>  The remaining amendments will be considered at today's meeting.  The groupings are as follows: amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 16 to 18, inclusive; amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive; amendments Nos. 10 to 14, inclusive; amendments Nos. 20 to 24, inclusive; and amendments Nos. 26 and 28.  I propose that we try to complete our consideration of the Committee Stage of the Bill today.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

One of the points it raised was the absence of a definition of "illness or injury".  Having gone through it - I will not use the word "reform" because it was really a slashing of the public service sick pay and sick leave scheme - I am aware it is really tough to define that, notwithstanding that it referenced the fact and raised a concern that there is not an existing definition.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would investigate it further or if he was in a position to confirm that the Department does not have any issue with it.</p> <p>  I am raising it because it was raised by legal experts.  There is a difficulty.  As we found out, one cannot draw up a list.  Is the Minister of State concerned or is he happy that, without the definition, it is okay?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#B01100"><p>I am conscious that this amendment is not being allowed but it is something on which there could be general discussion.  It came up in a previous discussion on this Bill as well.  Generally, in the legislation, both in this and in social welfare legislation, it is not defined and it is accepted as the ordinary meaning.  That has been acceptable and has worked and I have heard no real argument not to continue with that.</p> <p>  If there is a major issue the Deputy wants me to have a chat with her about before Report Stage, I can do that.  It is not something we are concerned about.  The Deputy obviously is so I am happy to chat to her about it if she wants before Report Stage.</p></speech>

The Government proposal is that we start with three and that it will be increased over time, subject to the Minister agreeing to do it.  There is no guarantee in the Bill that will even happen.</p><p>My amendment is simple.  It is to remove the limitation of three and to state that people are entitled to sick pay when they are sick, regardless of the number of days they are sick.  That should be a basic right and we should deal with the consequences of that in terms of compensation for employers, etc., at a later stage.</p><p>The basic point is that when people are sick, they should be entitled to sick pay and we should not arbitrarily limit it.  We certainly should not arbitrarily limit it to three days, which is a very small number of days for an entire year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#B01800"><p>The Labour Party Private Members' Bill provided for ten days' sick leave, and rising to 30.  I suppose my party's concern with the Bill is that it is not robust enough and that aspirations, as has been suggested, from the Minister of State, Deputy English, and from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, are not hard wired into the Bill.  We want to delete the same lines and to insert, "An employee shall be entitled to up to and including 10 statutory sick leave days in a year, or such additional number of statutory sick leave days (if any) up to 30, as may stand specified from time to time by order of the Minister ..."  The Minister would have within his or her power the ability to increase that to 30 days over a period of time, but we have to start with ten.  That is our strong view.  If the Minister of State does not accept the amendment, I would be happy to discuss it or to try to convince him about a period of time, but we intend to push it again on Report Stage.  However, I am interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#B01900"><p>I stated at the outset that I understand members will have different views on this.  What we are trying to achieve here is that, as a starting point, this scheme will cover the three waiting days before eligibility for illness benefit kicks in, and that can kick-in for two years thereafter.  I want the members to bear that in mind as we have this discussion.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has been very clear on the medium-term plan to make sure employers know what their obligations will be.  The statutory entitlement to sick pay will be phased in as part of a four-year plan and will initially be three days a year once the Bill is enacted and commenced.  This will effectively fill the gap in coverage, as I said, caused by illness benefit waiting days.  It is important that we close that gap at the outset.  Closing the gap of current waiting days before being able to access illness benefit will help reduce the numbers of sick employees presenting for work.</p> <p>  This four-year plan takes account of the current economic climate and the existing financial pressures on businesses.  We must bear in mind what businesses have been through for the past couple of years with Covid and what is now happening in relation to the war in Ukraine.  The latter is putting extreme pressure on businesses.  We want to get the balance right here with this legislation but it is also important that we try to protect those jobs that are there and give businesses a change to adjust to this scheme over a couple of years as it is being implemented.  The number of days will increase incrementally, with the goal that employers will eventually cover the cost of ten sick days per year from year four.</p><p> We fully understand many businesses are struggling with additional costs because of the conflict in Ukraine, Brexit, our coming out of Covid and the disruption these have brought.  That is why we have chosen to phase in the new right.  While we all agree it is important to introduce this right, there has to be a balanced approach to it.</p><p> Amendment No. 16 would provide that the number of paid sick leave days could not be reduced below ten by any ministerial order.  As statutory sick leave will be introduced at three days per year, this amendment would not align with the timeline of the scheme proposed.</p><p> Amendment No. 17 would not restrict the number of days by which statutory sick leave could increase in any given year.  Subsection (2)(b)(ii) currently stipulates that the Minister may not increase the number of sick leave days by more than three in any 12-month period.  This provides certainty to employers by ensuring that unexpectedly large increases in the number of sick leave days will not be introduced.  This is a sensible approach that allows businesses to plan ahead and anticipate the potential cost increases, which are significant for many, certainly for SMEs.</p><p> Similarly, providing the Minister with the ability to increase the number of sick leave days by ten days, as per amendment No. 18, under any one order would be disproportionate and unfair to employers.  Such a dramatic increase in coverage could have unintended negative consequences, with employers unable to afford the associated costs.  Again, we have to bear in mind that it jeopardises jobs if we force too many costs on employers.  We are trying to get the balance right.  I ask the members to try to understand our approach and that there will be incremental growth over a four-year period.  This, we believe, is balanced and fair, and recognises the circumstances we are in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#C00200"><p>Where did three days come from?  Why is it three rather than two, four or five?  How did the Minister of State come up with three?  We are being asked to agree to three days because it is to increase to ten.  We are being reassured that this will happen but the Bill does not provide such reassurance.  Stitched into it is a wide-open loophole that means the current or another Government may well decide not to increase the number.  The factors the Minister must have regard to in section 6(1) in deciding whether to increase the number include the state of the economy generally, the business environment, national competitiveness, the potential for any disproportionate or adverse effect on the economy generally, specific sectors of the economy, and employers and employees.  The Minister must also have regard to the views of employer representative bodies.  I would bet quite a large amount of money that the view of the employer representative bodies on increasing the number of sick-pay days will be that we should not be increasing it because the employers do not want to pay for it.</p> <p>  Even if we get to ten days, does the Minister of State not accept that we would still be far behind what is normal in many countries in Europe?  In Austria, for example, workers are entitled to between ten and 16 weeks.  It deals in weeks, not days, on 100% pay.  In the Netherlands, people can get sick pay for up to two years.  There are many other examples.  Does the Minister of State accept that an entitlement of even ten days leaves us significantly lower than where we need to be?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#C00300"><p>On our amendment, the circumstances are frustrating.  It is a bit like talking to a residents&rsquo; group about a planning application in that what is in the planning application is what matters.  What is in the legislation is what matters, not what the Minister of State said here or what the T&aacute;naiste said, or what is said in any media interview about aspirations.  If it is in the legislation, it is in the legislation.  No Minister will be in breach of the law or regulations if he or she still stands over three sick-leave days in five, ten or 15 years, because it will be covered by the legislation.  That is it.  The Minister of State may aspire to increase the number to ten but it is not written down.  That is not how we do business.</p> <p>  It almost feels as if the Government views the sickness of an employee in terms of how it affects the employer rather than the employee.  That is not how we should do our business, I contend.  Following on from what Deputy Paul Murphy said, how did the Government come up with the number of days?  How does it equate with the European norm?  How are we supposed to do our legislative work if aspirations uttered by Ministers are not written down in black and white?</p></speech>

I share the concerns regarding the link between that and sick leave entitlement.  Would the Minister of State be open to strengthening what is currently in the Bill to ensure we will get to the increased entitlement rather than saying there is an aspiration to get to it?  He should ensure a much clearer pathway.</p> <p>  Previously, Ministers took to the microphone to talk about workers&rsquo; rights but when they were presented with an option in this regard, they cut in half the entitlement for serving civil and public servants.  My concern is that the provision in the Bill is not robust enough.  I am curious about this.  As the Deputies just asked, where does the figure of three come from?  Would the Minister of State be open to strengthening the Bill to address my wariness about extending flexibility?  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State but I am referring to someone who might be sitting in the Minister of State&rsquo;s chair in the future.  The flexibility could mean that there will still be only three days in ten years&rsquo; time, and the Minister will have stayed within the law.  There is a genuine concern.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#C00500"><p>I have a couple of points.  The legislation is designed to facilitate whatever Minister sits in this chair in the years ahead.  We need to bear in mind that the number today is zero and that we are asking businesses and employers to adapt to a new statutory sick pay scheme, which they are paying for.  It is only right and fair that we introduce it over a period of time.  It is about the management of businesses.  Some would say it is not about management, but we are trying to get the balance right.  The measure does not favour any one sector or social partner over another; it is about achieving a balance that protects jobs, will continue to grow jobs and enable businesses to continue while recognising the benefits for everybody of having a statutory sick pay scheme.  It is a matter of introducing it at a pace that is manageable.</p> <p>  What is proposed compares quite well with the arrangements in many European countries.  The number of days varies from country to country.  The majority have around ten days or fewer.  Australia, New Zealand and Canada all have the ten days.  The commitment by the Cabinet, as expressed by the T&aacute;naiste in D&aacute;il debates and discussions here, is to go to ten days over four years.  The legislation does not cap that.  There is no ambition capped either.  There is flexibility for future Ministers to go beyond ten days if they so choose.  In the legislation, we are asking that the Minister reflect on the circumstances in the country on any given day.  The Minister must consult not only employers but also all social partners.  This was expressly requested by this committee.  It is written into the Bill.</p> <p>  The reason the measure was suggested for regulation, not legislation, is that this is the best way to adapt to any situation as a country.  The members have been discussing here for nearly a year the permits legislation that I am trying to adapt and make changes to.  Since the provisions are expressed in primary legislation rather than regulations, it is very hard for us to work with them and make any changes needed or recommended by most people here.  If the provisions are in regulations, the Minister can adjust and make changes much more quickly on behalf of the country at the right time to reflect current conditions.  That is why we are not over-prescribing in primary legislation.  Primary legislation does not always work to the benefit of everybody.</p> <p>  On the matter of the three days, following the discussion in the very early stages of this in the D&aacute;il a commitment was made by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, to introduce this legislation.  Thereafter, there was consultation across all the Departments and among all the social partners.  Members of this committee and many others went through all this.  We fixed on an entitlement of three days to begin with to close the initial gap associated with the illness benefit because nobody gets anything for the first three days as matters stand.  That was the most important gap that the T&aacute;naiste wanted to close.  The aim was to build on that thereafter.  That is why we introduced the three days, as well as consultation with everybody.</p> <p>  It is proposed to have three days, moving to ten days within four years.  We believe this is a fair and reasonable request of employers.  Members should bear in mind that employers are paying for this.  That must be understood and accepted.  Future Ministers can decide to make changes to the proposal if they want, but this is what we are recommending at the moment.</p> <p>  I hope members will understand that our job in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is to get the balance right to protect workers at work, prevent the unnecessary spread of illness, encourage people to stay at home when unwell, try to cover the cost of their staying at home, and recognise that employers of all sizes have to implement this scheme as a statutory sick pay scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#D00100"><p>I, like other members I am sure, want to see a sick pay scheme implemented.  The Minister of State pointed out that employers are paying for this, which is the truth of it.  In some of the preamble to the Bill he tried to give credence to the difficulty out there and he mentioned the social partnership.  I wish to raise two matters.  One is something I asked before and raised in the D&aacute;il on a number of occasions which is why Irish Small and Medium Employers, ISME, is not part of this leave Bill.  I do not believe small businesses are being properly represented as part of the social partnership agenda.</p> <p>  Further, employers will be quite willing to look at expanded sick pay schemes but the problem is that they are paying for it.  One of the things this Bill does not address is any support for small or micro-enterprises which may have to take on people to fill a role while an employee is sick, which happens quite a good deal in many industries.</p> <p>  On the last occasion I asked that the Minister of State might look at tabling an amendment to provide a tax rebate, or something like that, for this double whammy where a small business has to put up the resources for the scheme and then has to pay, possibly through an agency, to find support and help.  These employers are getting no support for that.  The larger employers, as we know, already have sick pay schemes in place because they can afford them.  The problem here is that we are trying to legislate for everybody but, as the Minister of State rightly pointed out, this is going to have an effect on employers.  We cannot have the idea of having unlimited sick days but we want to start with something fair.</p> <p>  This is where I would be coming from.  I ask the Minister of State to consider tabling an amendment on some type of tax rebate scheme, which may be one of the easiest things to do, to take account of small and micro-enterprises which are going to be significantly impacted, particularly as this scheme is extended.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#D00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his work on this Bill to date.  The Bill is very welcome but it has caused a great deal of concern among small business owners.  We are all aware well aware that the bulk of businesses are small, owner-operated businesses.  This will pose an additional headache for them while at the same time they recognise that the Bill and the statutory right to sick leave and pay needs to be enshrined in legislation.</p> <p>  It is important safeguards are put in place for those small businesses and, following on from what the previous speaker said, those small businesses feel greatly at risk.  We are very much an enterprise committee here and there is an onus on us to help cultivate and generate enterprise across the country.  Several small business owners I have spoken to would see this scheme as a possible deterrent to them taking on staff in the future.  There has to be scope to look at the possibility of a rebate scheme where employers can avoid a double whammy.  This has been raised with us by many representative groups and small business owners who will have to pay the sick pay and, in the case of a business that perhaps only employs three or four people and is public-facing, will have to bring in a person in to cover that work for the day.  They will face a double whammy.  Some engagement with Revenue should be possible so that we can come up with a rebate scheme that ensures those businesses are not penalised.  Even with the smallest of businesses, which may not have the most sophisticated risk matrix, they will operate that risk matrix but within their own heads and will see this as a high-risk scenario.  Provision needs to put in place so that they are not being penalised on the double.  I would hope this suggestion can be considered in an amendment.</p></speech>

Sick pay should be there for workers but I have been contacted by small family businesses with a number of employees, and as was mentioned by the previous Deputy, it is very difficult to meet that expense.  Is there any format or way within the Bill through which they can be provided with some form of rebate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#D00400"><p>This issue came up from the very start.  We are trying to strike a balance and everybody recognises that workers need a right to sick pay and that traditionally this was provided only by the State and the employer did not play any role and that was not fair or balanced.  The difficulty with the proposal, and I can understand how others can say that sick pay should be extended, is that the reality is that the State takes on the responsibility after a certain period of time and sustains pay but in many workplaces, of course, there are much better terms than the State arrangement alone.  We are trying, therefore, to provide a safety net for people who are not in those more generous schemes in order to balance that against the reality that other Deputies referred to, which is that there are many small businesses with a small number of employees who are customer-facing and do not have the sorts of options to substitute and to cover which larger employers who are not in the customer-facing business have.   This means that they have to get somebody in when somebody is out sick.  There is this balance to be struck and I am unsure as to how it is to be resolved.</p> <p>  At a minimum, I would hope the Minister of State would commit to having a review done after a reasonably short period to see how this is impacting on those smaller employers, with the possibility of some form of relief for them other than the long-stop one which is in the Bill of proving inability to pay.  That is a fairly draconian system in order to establish that level of proof.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is quite correct in that we are trying to strike a balance.  Employers have a responsibility here but we have to try design that responsibility in a way that does not unfairly impact on certain types of employer.  There is scope to try to explore that further before Report Stage, if the Minister of State can do so, or at least by way of a review at a very early date to address the fears of excessive burdens being placed on some of these labour-intensive customer-facing roles and the need for some relief.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#D00500"><p>A number of issues have been raised.  I share the concerns raised by the previous speakers.  To address Deputy Bruton, I have committed to a number of employers that we will track and review this to see if we are putting jobs in jeopardy or are placing an excessive a cost on businesses.  The T&aacute;naiste is very clear that we will phase this in in order to give such businesses time to adapt and to cope with it.  It could potentially increase the payroll bill by 0.8% to 1% in some cases, which may put extreme pressure on businesses, certainly from a cash point of view if one has to replace customer-facing roles.  We will monitor this and will continue to address the concerns of Deputies Shanahan, Flaherty, Duffy and Bruton, and others who are concerned about engaging with the small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, community as we track and watch this as it is rolled out.  We will then seek to find ways to support, where possible, these businesses.</p> <p>  Rebates are not very proportionate and have not worked very well in the past when it came to other redundancy schemes, and so on.  All of us want to ensure we do not jeopardise any jobs or businesses.  There is, as had been referred to by Deputy Bruton, in section 10 an inability to pay provision but that may come too late for some businesses or is a hard bar to reach.  It has not been used, as far as I am aware, in the minimum wage legislation.  We will track this and try to find other ways to support the SME community, if needs be, through our business development agencies, such as our local enterprise organisation, LEO, network or Enterprise Ireland.  We are trying to find ways to provide support, if needs be.  We will monitor this but such a provision does not belong in legislation.  What is important here is that we introduce a statutory sick pay scheme and that we track that aspect of it.</p> <p>  This is similar to the provision where the Minister of the day may adjust and make recommendations every 12 months to increase this.  The effect on the economy at that time will be tracked, not just for employers but also for employees in terms of cost of living and so on.  That will be monitored to get the balance right, which I stress here.</p> <p>  We recognise this is not the ideal time to bring in this legislation given what has happened over the past number of years with Covid-19 and Ukraine.  We recognise also, however, that we are an outlier in Europe by not having a statutory sick pay scheme.  It is important we bring one in and the commitment was made on the floor of the D&aacute;il that we would do that.  We must ensure we do so in a manner in which businesses can cope with it.</p> <p>  There is a commitment to keep PRSI as low as we possibly can for employers, given with the effect that this could have on employees.  This scheme may limit the need to increase PRSI on employers, so there may be an offset of cost there.  That is something that we will track and keep an eye on as well.</p> <p>  I have talked to many in the SME community and I have met many businesses, as has the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, over perhaps the past year to 18 months and have discussed the legislation with them.</p><p>We have been trying to encourage them to work with us on this scheme and to recognise the importance of protecting their employees and ensuring that employees do not feel that they have to go to work.  Everyone would benefit from that - other staff, customers and clients.  Many members of the business community throughout the country tell us that they cannot get staff and access the skills they need.  Many of those are customer-facing roles.  If we can strengthen overall terms and conditions, we believe it will assist in competing for talent.</p><p> In the European context, we are out of sync by not having a statutory sick pay scheme.  We are constantly striving to get the balance right between protecting employees and protecting employers.  The Government's response in recent years has shown that we are on the side of job creators as well as employees, in light of our supports during Covid, which were of equal benefit to both.  We are introducing this legislation in that spirit and in a balanced manner, with an implementation phase of four years committed to by the Cabinet.  I hope members will accept that we are doing our best to get the balance right.  We recognise that it puts pressure on SMEs.  Larger companies can probably absorb these costs.  It is fair to say that many employers already have their own sick pay schemes.  While many others do not have formal schemes, they operate some schemes, look after their staff well and facilitate them when they are sick or have other commitments.  There is a balance.  This Bill puts a formal scheme in place, but many employers already operate within this space well, and we should recognise that.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has just committed to a review of how this legislation will affect employers over time.  Can I assume the same review will investigate how it is protecting the health of workers?  Our conversation already feels imbalanced.</p></speech>

That will be recorded.  In line with the committee's recommendation, the Minister of the day will monitor and check all of that before recommending additional days at any stage.  When we say that it is a given that the legislation is balanced for employees and employers, we will of course review that, but the question in this context was on additional supports for businesses to cover the cost.  That element is not in this legislation because it cannot be, but we have told employers of all shapes and sizes that we will track costs with our ongoing business supports that are tailored to jobs.  Any Minister who sits in this chair and recommends increasing the number of days to ten days and beyond, if that is what he or she wants to do, must review the circumstances of the day and engage with all of the social partners, which was a fair recommendation of this committee.  That will allow for amendments.</p></speech>

The Minister of State was responding to a question on businesses, but it is important that the scheme's operation be tracked on behalf of workers as well.  As Deputy Bruton pointed out, a trip to the Labour Court can be a draconian process and take a long time.  That is also true for workers.  If they are not given their entitlement, they will have to go through a not dissimilar process.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State outline more formally the intention as regards the review and how it will be done?  It cannot only be done through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, because the Family Business Network, FBN, is not represented on it.  Clearly, the concerns being raised are being raised by smaller businesses.  Concerns are also being raised with me by people working in smaller businesses, who tell me that we can introduce all the laws we like, but the people they work for will not follow them.  The scheme has to be tracked formally.  I appreciate and respect that the Government is constantly in touch with businesses and workers' representatives, but this needs to be a more formal process.  If the employers go to the Labour Court &ndash; I do not believe they will &ndash; to say that they cannot pay for the scheme, this matter needs to be examined because it means that workers are not getting their entitlement to sick leave.  We need a process that is more formal than "keeping an eye on it", one that is done through LEEF but also has all of those who are involved at the table.</p></speech>

The Deputy is asking for a formal review, which is what Deputy Bruton proposed.  We have already given a commitment to the SME community to track this through our other business supports and business development agencies.  If we need to assist, which we do regularly across many areas, we will consider the issue.  I can revert to the Deputy on Report Stage on the question of building a formal review into the legislation.  I believe it will be captured in the ministerial regulations.  We can examine those to see if we can find a wording with which the Deputy agrees.</p> <p>  The Department engages regularly with all employer and employee representatives through many mechanisms regardless of whether they are in LEEF.  The issue of who is in LEEF has been discussed for a long time.  I would value interventions by all organisations as well as by the various committees that we have set up to review various elements.  They all feed into this.  Any legislation that we have introduced has been based on consultation that has been open to everyone.  We will ensure that happens in this context.  LEEF does not cover everything, but it is a useful process for dealing with issues like the work safely protocol.  Everyone is involved in the consultations on legislation, though, and rightly so.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will see a significant change in the SME environment this year.  Many companies have already availed of Government supports in terms of debt warehousing and so on.  I have spoken to many businesses, particularly in the manufacturing sector.  They are facing significant headwinds and none is making money.  Indeed, quite a number are losing money.  We all support the Government's introduction of this progressive policy, but there is a cost and it has to be balanced.  Any review system needs to examine which way the incomes of small indigenous companies are going.  If they are not making money, they will not employ anyone and there will be no need to worry about sick days.</p></speech>

There is an exemption in the legislation from the obligation to pay sick pay under the statutory sick pay scheme.  I appreciate that there is a similar exemption in respect of the minimum wage.  It is not used by everyone, which I have made clear to employers and bodies on all sides that have engaged with me.  That has nothing to do with whether it is onerous.  Rather, the majority feel that they are able to pay the minimum wage.  It is important that we keep an eye on this matter and the exemptions allowed for in this legislation.  That will be in addition to what the Deputy is talking about.  We will have an ongoing consultation after enactment, and it is important that we do so.  I am happy to commit to it.</p> <p>  I accept that the committee's members want to ensure that we get this right without unduly affecting the employer or jeopardising jobs while also putting protections in place for those who are genuinely sick.  Employers have told the committee and us that the certification process has to be managed well.  It is important that we balance the medical certification process right.  That will probably allay some of the fears that a number of employers have.  To be fair, the majority of employers have been clear to us that they want to protect their staff.  They recognise the importance of not having sick people at work.  There will always be some who argue, but the majority have been clear to us about wanting to do right by their employees.  They recognise the importance of strengthening their teams and skilled workforces and of availing of all of the supports that we have across the system, including from the Departments of Social Protection, Education and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p></speech>

We have been an outlier in this area for too long, so it is important that we get this right.  A review process has been built into this and all other legislation.  We will learn from this one's review process as the situation involves.</p> <p>  As Deputy Shanahan said, the overwhelming concern being raised by small businesses &ndash; most of them are micro businesses &ndash; relates to how they have faced significant headwinds for the past two and a half years.  Many of them are operating with single digit profit margins at best.  Some are barely breaking even.  Banks have removed their overdrafts.  They are struggling, and they view this scheme as an additional challenge and burden.  At the same time, though, they want to meet and embrace it in the spirit of the Bill.  As the Minister of State rightly said, no employer wants to have sick staff.  We have to look after staff welfare.  If staff are sick, we have to give them the space and time to facilitate their recovery.</p> <p>  There will be a review.  There will also be a mechanism through which employers can go to the Labour Court if they are unable to pay.  That will be an additional burden, though, and I cannot imagine any employer risking not only the cost of going to the Labour Court, but also public ire in its community if it takes that route.</p> <p>  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State gave a commitment that his officials would examine this matter before Report Stage.</p><p>It may not be a rebate from Revenue.  I quite like the idea that was put forward of administering it through the LEOs, which are in tune with our local business network across the country.  They do well on the e-voucher schemes and other matters.  That might be the vehicle by which to do it.  For the benefit of businesses that are concerned but ready and willing to embrace this new legislation, assurance needs to be given beyond a long-term review process.  Something needs to be enshrined in the legislation.  Hopefully, the Minister of State will look at that and come back to it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

There is nothing to be afraid of there in the context of public opinion; it is based on factual evidence.  I am conscious that, for whatever reason, not everyone is aware it is in the existing legislation or uses it.  The sick leave has to be certified and employers have asked, as an issue of fairness, that that remain in the legislation.  Others have a view on that as well.  That is the protection the employers need to know about because the majority of employers already look after people who are sick.  It is important that the statutory sick pay scheme recognises this.</p> <p>  We can continue this conversation on Report Stage.  We will look at it.  We bore in mind the ways to reach out to companies that need assistance to protect jobs and their business.  We do that on an ongoing basis.  As I said to Deputy Bruton and others, we will track that between now and Report Stage and see if members want to strengthen the wording around it.  As with any legislation that is brought in, there is always a post-enactment review.  That is built in across the board.  This is to strike a balance, as Deputy O'Reilly said, between people who are sick and feel under pressure to go to work and those who are creating those jobs.  It is important that any reviews covers that.  That is what we will try to do.</p></speech>

This is an important issue.  Workers should be entitled to sick pay from the moment they start work.  The consequence of the requirement for 13 continuous weeks is the exclusion of many vulnerable workers.  It will discriminate and disproportionately affect women, to a significant degree.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has written to the T&aacute;naiste pointing out that it: &quot;<font color="#333333">will leave hundreds of thousands of mostly women and foreign-born essential workers employed in low-pay jobs, who routinely have their service broken by their employer, without coverage for three months each year.&quot;  </font>That happens all the time in childcare, for example, where workers, 98% of whom are female, are let go over the summer period and rehired in September.  It will also massively and disproportionately affect young workers, more than a third of whom are on temporary contracts and will not be covered for the first 13 weeks.  The basic point is that you are not any less likely to get sick when you are on a temporary contract or in an industry where you are laid off over the summer because your employer breaks your service.  It is not your fault and there is no reason you should not be entitled to 100% sick pay from day one at work.</p></speech>

I raised the issue with the T&aacute;naiste.  I took, possibly from his body language rather than anything he said, that he was amenable to this and heard the concern about, specifically, workers in education.  It is a tactic of employers to lay off workers to keep them on their toes, and there is no point saying that it is not.  I am not referring to all or most employers, but some are doing it.  The need for continuous service means one is continuously having to build service.</p> <p>  I am not hostile to the notion of a service requirement.  It is done in other legislation but this effectively puts people, specifically women, workers on low incomes and foreign-born workers, as outlined by ICTU, outside of the scheme when they need the scheme more than anyone.  There are likely to be working for small employers rather than multinational corporations so are likely to be working in a place without an in-house sick pay scheme.  It is a bad start to exclude these workers from the beginning.</p></speech>

There was toing and froing on issues like whether medical certificates should be required.  Some felt that such certificates are necessary, even if good custom and practice would see that many employers do not always insist on them being produced.  The one thing there was consensus on was that it is hard to justify saying a person's rights to sick pay should start some period into employment with a new employer.  Sickness can strike anyone at any time, as we have seen during Covid.  It does not seem to me to have a foundation to say the right should be deferred for a period.  Probation is not about sickness; it is about reliability and other things.  If someone is sick and has produced a medical certificate to show that, I do not see how not offering it from the first day is justifiable.  Reflecting on the experience of Covid, it is important that people have the confidence that if they go in to work and are sick, they can get cover, particularly for the three-day period for which the State does not offer cover.</p></speech>

I have asked Deputies to understand we need to address this as best we can.  The 13-week service requirement is in place to ensure time is allowed for a relationship to develop.  Most people will accept a relationship has to develop between an employer and employee before the employer is required or asked to pay for illness-related absences.  It is not intended that employees who work for the same employers year after year will be required to repeatedly work 13 weeks before they can access sick leave.  That is not the intention, and it will not be the case with the legislation.</p> <p>  We had significant discussions on Second Stage about the position of workers who work term-time type employment.  Many Deputies expressed concerns that workers who are laid off over summer months will have to repeatedly requalify for statutory sick leave and routinely be left without protection for the first 13 weeks after returning to work.</p><p> Deputy O'Reilly read correctly the language used by the T&aacute;naiste at the time.  I think he also said that.  That is not a situation he wants to continue with.  I assure Deputies that a break in service caused by lay-off will not constitute a break in the employee's continuous service.  This is by virtue of the linkage to the provisions concerning continuous service in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973.  However, we acknowledge that the position is less clear for employees who are employed on new contracts by the same employer, following the end of the previous contract, for which Deputy Murphy has pushed hard.</p><p> I confirm that it is our intention that successive periods of employment with the same employer should not give rise to a requirement to re-qualify.  I agree this matter requires further clarifications so that employers and employees are fully aware of their obligations and entitlements.</p><p> We will table an amendment on Report Stage that will better clarify this issue.  I am conscious the Deputies have tabled amendments on this matter but I ask them to hold off on them until we get our wording right, in conjunction with the Attorney General.  Officials in the Department are working on the wording of an amendment in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  As the amendment was not ready for today, we will bring it forward on Report Stage.</p><p> I recognise what members have said because they have pushed this matter today, during our discussion on Second Stage and during pre-legislative scrutiny.  We will have this matter clarified.  I hope members understand that we just did not have the amendment ready in time for today's discussion.</p></speech>

I ask that when the Minister and Minister of State consider the amendment that they ensure the people who are intended to be captured in it do not have an additional requirement.  Reference has been made to the need for a worker to be repeatedly employed.  Let us say we stick with the 13 weeks, then a worker will end up with a 26-week requirement in a certain instance.  Let us say a worker signs his or her first contract at the start of 2000 and qualifies after 13 weeks, then experiences a period of being laid off, then signs another contract at the start of 2001 and has a another 13-week period, that means that worker will have needed a 26-week period to qualify when another worker would only have a 13-week period, assuming that we stick with the latter period.  If there is a service requirement, then it cannot be doubled only for the person who finds himself or herself in the precarious situation of having rolling contracts.  I ask the Minister of State to keep that practical aspect in mind.</p> <p>  I hope to support the amendment but the result of it cannot impose an additional requirement on a person.  We have already established these people are among the most vulnerable workers in the State and, therefore, the Government cannot make the period of 26 weeks or double whatever the service qualification is going to be.  Of course, if the Minister of State accepts the amendments tabled by either of my colleagues, then he would not have that problem as employees would qualify from day one.  If that is not the way the Minister of State is going to tackle this matter, then, if there is a service requirement, it cannot be double the period for someone on a low income.</p></speech>

The legislation covers the majority.  We certainly do not believe the legislation will jeopardise hundreds and thousands of workers but we want to make sure it is right.  To get it right, we need the correct wording.  The wording has still not been agreed with the Attorney General.  That is why the amendment was not ready for today.  We want to get the wording right to ensure we do not put additional requirements on anybody and do not omit anybody.  This matter has been well flagged by the members, which is the benefit of having a committee.  We will get the wording right.  If we had brought forward wording today, then it would have been rushed.  I hope members trust me and accept my commitment that we will table an amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Let us assume we got the new amendment, it would deal with a part of the problem that concerns workers with the same employer but the contract has been broken, etc.  I still think that there is an outstanding issue that has not been dealt with.  Let us consider a pure and simple situation where someone is not going to have his or her service broken but starts work somewhere and is not entitled to sick pay for the first 13 weeks.  The explanation the Minister of State gave is that the employee does not have a relationship with his or her employer at that stage.  If one is a worker and a boss asks for something to be done in work, the worker cannot say to him or her that there is no work relationship yet.  It is a contract, one must work, one is being paid, one is treated as a worker and one has all the responsibilities of a worker who has been in employment for more than 13 weeks but for some reason, we are arbitrarily saying this worker does not get the rights that go with his or her employment in terms of sick pay.</p> <p>  The commitment is welcome in terms of the issue the Minister of State is dealing with as it is a large part of the problem.  However, I still think that there is an outstanding issue in that when someone starts work somewhere, he or she should still be entitled to sick pay.</p></speech>

Most legislation in this space, in terms of workers' rights or entitlements, here or across Europe allows time for a relationship to develop and does not automatically kick in on day one.  Again, the employer will pay for this sick leave.  It is important to recognise that a relationship of some sort of employment would be necessary before these entitlements would kick in and we suggest 13 weeks.  Originally, the time was around six months but after the consultation, in conjunction with the members, and pre-legislative scrutiny done by the committee, the period was reduced to 13 weeks.  In other legislation, the time is generally six months plus.  We have made allowances and gone further than would be the norm in Ireland and across Europe, which I hope members accept.  Again, we must strike the right balance and I hope people accept that.</p></speech>

I refer to the various things the Minister needs to take into account when deciding whether to vary the number of statutory sick leave days.  As the Minister of State and people will know, we are against this whole concept in the sense that we think there should be an agreed number of days and we are in favour of no limit.</p><p>If there are references to what is being taken into account, then we propose the deletion of the reference to &quot;the state of the economy&quot; and &quot;competitiveness&quot; as consideration for a Minister in varying the number of sick days.  Again, we think the worker's right to sick pay should not depend on the notion of competitiveness.  Workers should not lose out as a result of the economy not being, supposedly, competitive.  My amendment seeks the deletion of the state of economic sectors and the state of employers as considerations for the same reason.  It also seeks to delete the views of employers.  As the Minister of State will know, employers are not going to be in favour of increasing the number of days for sick pay.  Again, we do not think there should be a reference to that.  There is then the effect inflation has on the cost of living for employees.  This is an extra pressure that is affecting people at the moment and should be taken into consideration.</p></speech>

Deputy Murphy identified some of the issues with this section.  The section is very heavily weighted in favour of the employer rather than the worker, which is problematic.  Let us start with the premise that sick pay is an important tool in protecting public health and that no worker should consider going to work if he or she is sick.  The intention is to increase the entitlement but it is a little bit like the right that an employer has to say no to remote working.  There are many reasons there will be no increase but there is not an awful lot in it to suggest that other interests, such as those that would be in favour of workers, would also be considered.  When the Minister, or whoever it is, considers increasing the number or how that will be phased in, someone will always find an excuse not to do so.  The current wording in the legislation is very heavily balanced in favour of employers.</p><p>However, this is very much in the public interest and we should be coming at it from that perspective.</p></speech>

This is a basic provision in employment law across Europe.  The rhetoric from today's meeting is a little disappointing.  I am referring to the onus on the employer.  As Deputy O'Reilly quite rightly said, we have heard these arguments before in respect of wage increases, minimum wage increases, etc.  Every employer group told us Armageddon would occur, but it did not happen.  What we have been arguing for and trying to bring into law is a basic provision to prevent people from feeling they have to go to work when sick and so they will get paid to feed their children.  These provisions are basics across Europe.  Let us tilt the argument back to where it should be.  It should be about protecting sick workers.</p></speech>

Other members are either not accepting or have forgotten the reality that obtains when an economy loses competitiveness on the scale that we experienced for a period.  I am referring to the impact of the collapse of businesses into which employers have put a lifetime of work and to workers being left high and dry following the collapse of a business into which they have put a lifetime of work.  Those are genuine considerations.  Economies must not refuse to recognise that competitiveness is part of being successful and that enterprising people are needed.  Getting profits from one's enterprise is not some sort of error; it is what allows an enterprise to be successful, export, win new business and create wealth for everyone to share.</p> <p>  The question of balance the Minister of State is trying to defend is absolutely authentic.  Ireland has the history to prove it.  We went through long years when we failed to recognise the importance of enterprise of competitiveness, and we paid dearly for it.  We have succeeded over several decades, despite the financial collapse, in building a balanced economy that can provide opportunities to introduce legislation like this and do other things that we could not do for years.  People have to be conscious that having a provision that implies the competitiveness of our businesses and economic climate is important in deciding what new obligations we impose or rights we create is just sensible.  Trying to stick our heads in the sand and say it is not part of the balance that the Minister is obliged to strike is short-sighted.</p></speech>

I said at meetings of this committee before that I have a slight problem at times with some of the narration on employers.  I believe it was Deputy Paul Murphy who said it is the employees who are creating all the wealth.  Employers have to put the structures together for productivity to happen.  There is a balance to be struck.  I am certainly on the side of employees but we must remember what Deputy Bruton just alluded to: one has to be cognisant of what is going on in the economy.  We are trying to do something now that we have not done before, namely, introduce a statutory sick-pay scheme for all workers.  I welcome that but do not subscribe to the idea that we can just ramp up year on year without being cognisant of what is happening in the economy and the headwinds that businesses are facing.</p> <p>  To return to a point I made earlier, small and medium enterprises, which employ close to a million people in this country, are not being properly spoken for here.  As public sector workers who get our increments, it is very easy for us to go into the D&aacute;il and vote further expenditure into the pot to pay for the costs.  That does not happen in the private sector; in the private sector, one has to try to create a business margin wherever possible.  When margins are affected by increased costs, it is very difficult to combat.  When the Government says one must take on increased costs again that will impinge upon margins, we have to be mindful that it is a competitiveness issue.  We have built very efficient companies in this country because we are agile; however, when the public sector and public policy require new machinations for businesses that will add to their costs, it is a concern for them.  We have to be mindful of that.  Therefore, I believe that what is in the legislation, which is that the Minister must have regard to all the headwinds affecting competition and cannot just have a statutory increase of two, three or four days year on year, represents sound business and fiscal policy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#J00500"><p>I have a couple of observations and comments.  We are not opposing Deputy O'Reilly's amendment but saying it is covered by the existing wording.  She will recognise that herself.  We have made changes on foot of this committee's recommendations before.</p> <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy wants to exclude employer representative bodies.  He is asking for the provision in this regard to be deleted.  I could not condone that; that would be illogical.  We are trying to bring forward legislation that is balanced.  The Deputy said he is a champion of the employee and takes credit for that, but our job in government is to strike a balance and ensure there are jobs for employees.  It is a two-way approach. </p> <p>  I do not apologise for acknowledging that employers will have to absorb the cost.  It is a public health measure.  It will protect everybody and gives sick workers the option to stay at home rather than going to work because they cannot afford not to.  That is what the legislation is being introduced for.  Employers do not pay for such a scheme at present but they will be paying for it.  We have to recognise that, and I do not apologise for doing so.</p> <p>  We all agree that it is appropriate to introduce a statutory sick-pay scheme.  Most employers I talk to acknowledge and accept that, as mentioned by Deputies Shanahan and Bruton, but they recognise they are trying to run businesses with massive costs and that have seen cost increases over the past couple of years.  Employers accept these schemes if they are fair, reasonable and manageable and if the cost can be absorbed over time.  We are trying to introduce the scheme over several years to allow employers time to adapt and, in some cases, change prices.  However, they have to remain competitive.  I sat with Deputy Bruton across the road back in 2011 and 2012 when we had an unemployment rate of 16% or 17%.  Everybody you spoke to wanted a job.  Of course we all want jobs with good terms and conditions, and we are constantly striving to have improvements in this regard, but we also want employers to create those jobs, take the risk, have the ambition to go further and take on international markets.  However, they have to be competitive to do that.</p> <p>  Profit levels vary from business to business; there is no doubt about that.  Some employers make great profits while others just barely cover their costs and pay their own wages.  We have to recognise that.  This legislation will apply across the board for all employers.  For a small shop on the corner employing 20 people, this legislation could add a cost of &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 per year.  We have to bear that in mind.  Prices may be passed on, profits may be reduced, and affected businesses may become less competitive.  There is a combination.  We are trying to introduce legislation that is balanced for everybody and introduces good pay and conditions and a statutory sick pay scheme that is needed and recognised.  We are an outlier in Europe &ndash; no one is denying that &ndash; but it is a matter of bringing in the scheme in a phased way that is manageable for everybody and does not jeopardise well-fought-for jobs.  Everybody here, across all Departments, has worked to create an environment that is conducive to job creation.  We must recognise that at the end of the day, the cost proposed is an additional one and that it will be imposed in a few months when we finish this work.  We must also recognise that the majority of employers want to do the right thing by their staff.  In the majority of cases, they do that and accommodate sick pay schemes or other informal arrangements at their own expense.  However, the Bill proposes a statutory scheme that will have to be implemented across every place of employment.  The balance is right.  I disagree with Deputy Paul Murphy that we should delete the reference to employer representatives.  That is totally imbalanced.  We are trying to achieve the right balance here.</p></speech>

There has to be balance in this.  I remember my late mother telling me that if I wanted to find out how popular I was, I should go into politics or open a business.  I would sooner be in politics because it is very tough trying to run a business at the minute.  We have to accept that every action has a consequence.  The approach of the legislation, with its slow building of momentum and its addition of days over time, is the way to go.  It has to be inclusive and involve employer groups throughout.</p> <p>  I will come back to the point I made earlier on the ability to pay and having recourse to the Labour Court.</p><p>No small business owner will ever do that because if one were to take that action, the first thing that would happen to him or her is that any limited credit that he or she would have, be it 30 days or 28 days, would be withdrawn from him or her straightaway because it would raise red flags with his or her suppliers.  There is not sufficient recourse there for employers.  Hopefully, on Report Stage, the Minister of State can come back with an alternative for us in order to compensate employers.</p></speech>

I recognise the mechanisms.  If one uses the clause that is there under exemption, there are the consequences.  To respond to Deputy Paul Murphy, it is not to say that businesses cannot have their profits reduced.  It is that the business is not sustainable if it pays this out, and would not survive and it would put jobs at risk.  Nobody here wants to risk the jobs.  We all want to increase the number of jobs.  It is great that this country has had a jobs-led recovery.  Of course, we want good terms and conditions and to constantly improve that as much as we possibly can, but not to put jobs at risk.</p> <p>  This is a statutory pay scheme.  It is about rights across all sectors.  Business supports and supports to different businesses are dealt with elsewhere, but we will try to capture what Deputy Flaherty and others are asking on Report Stage in order to recognise that too.  However, it is built into the reform mechanism.</p> <p>  In terms of supports, such as job supports, we do not deal with them in statutory rights legislation.  However, I accept what Deputy Flaherty is asking me and I will try to deal with it more on Report Stage.  It is ongoing work we do through the local enterprise offices, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and many other organisations supporting jobs.  Even with Pathways to Work through the Department of Social Protection, we encourage and work with employers to give people a chance to work and to retrain, etc., across many Departments.  They are job supports in many other ways.  I will track that.</p> <p>  As I said, we recognise that some businesses will feel under pressure to absorb these costs over the next couple of years and that is why we are trying to get the balance right here.  That is why the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, has led on this and that over a four-year period, not straightaway, we will increase it up to ten days.</p></speech>

We should come in with the number of sick days that are required but if we are to have a situation where it changes over time, it should be a one-way street where there is not a possibility of any backsliding and reductions over time.</p></speech>

Subsection 2(a)(i) provides that no ministerial order will reduce the number of statutory sick leave days below three.  This means that once the Bill has been enacted and commenced, the number of statutory sick leave days can never go below three.  Earlier, I explained where the three came from.</p> <p>  The effect of this amendment would be that the number of sick leave days provided for could never be reduced.  This would mean that the Minister of the day would have no ability to respond to emergencies or changing circumstances, such as we have seen in the past couple of years.  There are currently no plans to reduce the number of sick leave days provided for under the Bill.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, and the Cabinet have been clear about the intention to move to ten days over the next number of years but it also makes sense to provide the Minister with the power to reduce the number of days, if the entitlement was deemed to be unsustainable.  That is only fair and proper legislation to bring forward.</p></speech>

Why not have a one-way ratcheting system?</p> <p>  At present, it is the first order.  We cannot go below three days but, apart from that, we could go up to six days and then go back down to three days on the basis of competitiveness or the views of the employer representative groups.</p> <p>  The Minister of State said that we would not have the flexibility.  Actually, there would be flexibility in the sense that legislation could be brought in to say we have an emergency situation.  I accept it would be up to the Government to get a majority in the D&aacute;il but what the amendment removes is the ability of the Minister to decide we are to reduce the number of sick days.</p> <p>  Even in the spirit of us starting at three days but going to ten days, people who have paid even a little attention to this would presume this is a one-way street and we cannot go up and down again and that if we are serious about going to ten days and then beyond ten days, it should only go in one direction.  If the Minister of State wants to make an emergency exceptional case, he should come forward with legislation and seek a majority in the D&aacute;il for it as opposed to simply leaving it in the hands of the Minister.</p></speech>

What we are trying to create here is good quality sustainable jobs but one must be able to react to the situation.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, and the Government is clear about what we doing.  Deputy Paul Murphy talks about D&aacute;il support and that applies to any side of the argument here.  We have laid out that the commitment here over the next four years is to go to ten days.  The legislation starts that process, brings in a formal statutory sick pay scheme and sets a minimum floor on that.  We intend to build on that as well but we believe that needs to be left up to the Minister and Government of the day.</p></speech>

He has been clear about this.  Section 6 provides that the Minister will not make an order adjusting the number of statutory sick leave days under the Bill until 12 months after its enactment and that a period of 12 months must pass between each subsequent adjustment.  The amendment would remove this provision and place no restrictions on how often the number of sick leave days could be changed.  Limiting adjustments to once every 12 months provides employers and employees with a degree of certainty about their entitlements.  Once enacted, employers will know in advance of each year what their obligations are on statutory sick leave and what they have to plan for and accommodate.  This will allow for better alignment with contracts of employment and tax responsibilities.  The limit on adjustments will also allow the Minister time to reflect on the impact of any previous change.  Everybody is requesting that we do this on a regular basis.  It is important that we give people time to be able to implement changes, and 12 months is a reasonable period.</p></speech>

They propose to get rid of the arbitrary 70% up to &euro;110 per day, which is what is contained in the Bill.  Many of the workers that will be affected by this are minimum wage workers who would be getting less than &euro;110.  In many European countries the standard is 100%.  There is a very good reason for this, which is that people have built their lives and responsibilities, such as repaying mortgages and buying groceries, around a certain level of pay.  We do not think they should be arbitrarily reduced from this level on the basis they are sick.  There is still a clear public health argument for sick pay.  If people's pay will be reduced there will still be a pressure on them.  They may feel they cannot get by on 70% of their pay or &euro;110 a day.  There will still be a certain pressure on people feeling they have to go to work to get the full 100% because they rely on it for their mortgage or energy bills, particularly with prices increasing.</p></speech>

While an element of paid sick leave is welcome and a statutory sick pay scheme is long overdue, and we have discussed this, it cannot exclude people because they are on low incomes.  They will have to put their hands in their pockets to go to the doctor.  I tabled an amendment that would have eliminated this until such time as we have free and universal access to GP care.  We do not have this, and we are a good bit away from it.  I respect that it is an ambition of the Government but we are a good bit away from it.  Not only will low income workers get 70% of a very low income, they will also have to pay out a higher proportion of that income to be able to access the sick leave scheme.  I am conscious of anything that will act as a barrier for those workers on low incomes.</p> <p>  I am sure the intention is that this will have equal application for all workers.  In practice there are barriers and the burden is too high.  People will get a reduction in their wages when they are already on low incomes because they had to take some time off sick.  They will also have to pay to go to see the doctor.  There is time between now and Report Stage to reflect on this.  I ask the Minister of State to reflect on the impact on workers on low incomes.  How likely are they to avail of it if there are a number of barriers in their way?  There is also the return they would get during the time spent off work.  We have to add to this the cost of going to the doctor.  The Minister of State knows that things are tight for people on low incomes and that every shilling is accounted for.  We cannot have a situation where a worker says he or she cannot afford to be sick.  The intention of this is that a worker who is sick has a safety net.  It is low income workers who are facing this.  We have heard the phrase "the double whammy".  We have all received correspondence on it.  This is a doubled whammy for a low-income worker.</p></speech>

A total of 23% of Irish workers are on low pay.  We have the third highest proportion of low-paid workers in the OECD.  People in Ireland are paid poorly.  We do not have the same basic state provision of GP visit care as other European countries.  The two elements that make the Irish context different are the number of people who are poorly paid and the poor provision of basic public services such as GP visits.</p> <p>  If people get sick it will cost them money.  It will cost them to go to the doctor and to get whatever the doctor prescribes.  It may make more sense to people to pretend they are not sick and to go to work.  The Minister of State has to get into the mindset of poorly paid workers.  A disproportionate number of them are women.  They will have to make this choice.  They may decide they cannot afford to take the dip in their wages as outlined in the Bill because of the costs they will have to incur in attending a GP and purchasing medicines.  We have to have a sympathetic Act that protects workers who have to make this horrible choice so we do not have in the workforce people who feel they have to go to work when they are sick as otherwise they could not pay bills or feed their children.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to this.  We have a pandemic of low pay in the economy.  This is a recognised fact.  We also have the cost of being sick in Ireland, which is much higher than anywhere else in Europe.</p></speech>

This speaks to low-paid workers, and Deputy O R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has highlighted the fact there is no opportunity for them.  They have to pay to get medical certificates.  This is a problem.  On the other hand, we have the problem with the employer.  Small employers have to pay 70% of the rate and probably have to find replacements.  This speaks to the need to find a way to shore up the costs of the scheme, particularly for SMEs.  It also relates to some large employers that use low-cost pay.  I am not sure what we can do about that.  It is more to do with employee law.  This speaks to trying to find some way to mitigate costs where employers would be happier to pay if they were getting a subvention.  They would be happier to pay lower-cost workers a higher amount for being sick.  It might also cover their costs.  Again, this highlights the need for a review of where the Bill is going.</p></speech>

Deputies O'Reilly and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in raised the issue of medical care and GP costs.  That is a public health discussion.</p><p>There are targets set and commitments made by the Government.  I am sure that others will also make commitments to be able to reduce the cost of attending a GP and to reach those people who are vulnerable or on low pay.  That is one part of it.  We will see steady series of improvements that will reduce the costs for the low paid or those who have difficulty accessing GPs.  That is one aspect.</p><p> What we are trying to achieve here is a minimum-rate entitlement.  It is also to ensure that all workers receive a reasonable level of financial compensation.  We are trying to get the approach right in order that we are supporting both the worker - that is, the employee - and the employer, get the balance right and recognise the cost base and the pressures people are under as we bring this scheme in.</p><p> There was mention of what is happening in other EU countries.  In most EU countries, the replacement rate for an employee who avails of paid sick leave is set at a percentage of the employees normal wage.  It is quite common to have a percentage.  It is not the norm that it is 100% everywhere.  We need to bear in mind not only what is happening across Europe where these schemes work and work well but also the position in the countries that we compete with when it comes to job creation and business.  The range is from 25% at the lower end to 100% in some instances.  The figure of 70% is in line with many European states, including the Netherlands, Croatia, Bulgaria and Estonia, and is greater than that offered in, say, Spain, Lithuania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.  In the UK, the amount is &pound;96 or &pound;97 a week.</p></speech>

I am just quoting the rates that are in place around Europe.  Ours is set at 70%, which we think is a reasonable balance.  The Minister is very clear on the medium-term plan which is to set the rate at 70% of basic pay, capped at &euro;110 per day.  It is to ensure that employers know what their obligations would be and they know that the percentage is linked to the average wage.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 20, 21 and 23 set the rate of remuneration at 100% of the employee's basic pay.  Our approach is to support both worker and employer.  It is the Government's view that a 100% rate would impose excessive costs on employers in certain sectors, particularly those that have to deal with the costs of immediately replacing a sick employee.  We need to recognise that is often the SMEs that we are in here trying to support and that we talk about every day who need additional supports.  It is about getting the balance right that this scheme is manageable and doable and that employers can take it on because they do want to look after their staff as best as they possibly can.</p> <p>  As with all employment rights, the legislation is intended as a floor-level protection and will not prevent employers offering better sick pay terms or unions negotiating for more through a collective agreement or putting in place other arrangements around certification of sick pay.  Some operate at the moment.</p></speech>

I ask that he please do that exercise and consider whether that would be an attractive option.  "Attractive" is the wrong word, but he should ask if there would be too many barriers in place.  If he does the maths he would see that the money that will be taken out, particularly to pay for the visit to the GP.  And we are talking about people who maybe do not go to the GP when they need to because money is a factor.  You are asking them to take that money out of a reduced take-home pay, in effect.  The Minister of State might think about that in the absence of availability of free GP care.  He cited all the European rates.  I understand that it varies, but the other supports available in those countries also vary except where it comes to access to free GP care.  We are very much an outlier in that regard.  I respect the fact that it is an aspiration of the Government to bring it in at some point but it is not here now.</p> <p>  I ask again, therefore, that between now and Report Stage that the Minister of State does those simple maths and has a think about the matter.  This does act as a barrier.  All of us acknowledge that for this to work as a public health tool, it has to be as accessible as possible.  I do not think that it is specifically for those workers on low incomes with those two things coming together, that is, the 70% income and the necessity of paying a GP.  It places a burden on the worker.  I will say it again: no one wants to work in a place where people feel that they have to come in when they are sick.  That is not the intention behind this Bill.  In order for it to work, it has to work for all workers including those on low incomes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#M00500"><p>I agree that it has to work for all workers.  It is particularly targeted at those in the lower-paid sectors where, according to research, there are no sick pay schemes.  All that was borne in mind when we set the 70% rate and the &euro;110 maximum.  We did take all that on board.  We tried to go as far as we thought was reasonable in order to protect jobs.  We recognise that this will increase the cost base of employers as well.  I know what the Deputy is saying.  Some of the countries I mentioned have different health mechanisms but, equally, the very lowest-paid and part-time workers in this country are more likely to have medical and GP visit cards.  It is necessary to go further to improve that, but it is outside the scope of this Bill.  It is a public health matter for the Department of Health, but there are commitments from the Government.  Others can make commitments to the same level if they wish and back it up with finance.  We have made our commitments and will continue to deliver on it.  It is important that we do that.</p> <p>  This legislation recognises that as of today there is no statutory sick pay scheme and those people are extremely vulnerable today because they get no income support for one, two and three days.  This Bill will change all that.  They will get support.  I accept that it is set at 70% and capped at &euro;110 a day but we think that is a major improvement and removes a lot of barriers that are there today and discourage people from staying at home when they are sick.  It is a major improvement.  People can come in here and argue both sides.  They might argue that we are going too far or that we are not going not far enough.  We believe that at 70% it is a major improvement and gives the majority of workers a reasonable level of financial compensation for the days that they are sick.  Today, in the early days of sick leave - days one, two and three - workers gets no compensation whatever and they are not discouraged from going to work.  That was very evident during Covid.  It goes back to balance.  I totally accept that the Deputy is genuinely making the case.  I know that, but we have to get the balance right in order that we do not jeopardise jobs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#M00600"><p>We absolutely accept that this Bill will improve things.  It should not be left unsaid that this is a welcome move by the Government.  We are working constructively to try to improve it.  However, it is a hell of a thing to worry about getting sick if you are in a low-paid job and you are genuinely terrified that you might be unwell because you cannot afford to be unwell and therefore you might hide that sickness and go to work because you cannot afford a dip in the wages or the costs that you would accrue for attending a GP.  It is a hell of a thing to be that worried, looking at your children or at your bills and knowing that you just cannot afford to get sick.  That is why we are bringing forward these amendments.  Our fear is that this may be an underutilised provision because people just do not feel that it protects them enough so they go to work sick, hiding their sickness, pretending that they are okay, coughing in secret, telling people they are fine if they are asked, because the protections that are being brought in for them will just not work.  Over a period, we may find, through the Department's analysis, that it did not work for the people that it needs to work for most.  Those are the low paid, vulnerable workers in insecure work often exploited, who are disproportionately women, migrant workers and young people.  We should, therefore, be trying to eliminate the fear in a household or a that person.  That is why we put forward these amendments.  I absolutely appreciate that employers have fears about their businesses but we live in a country with a low-pay epidemic and one which does not provide basic healthcare in terms of free GP care that other countries just take for granted.  That is why we feel so strongly about these amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022050400002#M00700"><p>We had a discussion on the accessibility or otherwise of the proposals.  The absence of access to free GP care was cited by Dr. Laura Bambrick of ICTU during the pre-legislative scrutiny phase.</p><p>She made the point that very few people who are working have access to GP cards or medical cards.  This means that here is a significant cohort of workers involved.  I again ask that the Minister of State do the maths, put himself in that position and consider whether he would be able to take the hit.</p><p> The purpose of this is to ensure that people have the comfort and security of not going to work when they are sick.  For a person on low income, it is the two things together - the 70% plus the GP care.  My amendment, although it was ruled out of order, would have delayed the need for the medical certificate until universal access to GP care is available to all workers.  If people are on low income and they are hourly paid, the chances are they will be looking for all the overtime that is going in order to supplement that.  It is only 70% of the basic, although I accept that is entirely the norm in other states as well.  However, the countries that the Minister of State is comparing us with also have GP access.  It is the combination of the two things together.</p><p> I do not believe it is intended to put unnecessary barriers in people's way.  This is definitely welcome.  The provision of statutory sick pay is important, but it is also important that it applies to all workers.  As the Minister of State said, the specific intention is that low income workers would be encompassed by this but I think the barrier might be too much.  I ask that this is looked at before Report Stage.</p></speech>

We are saying that for low-paid workers and those who do not have a GP card, ultimately, they have to pay, if they can see the GP on the day they are sick, by the way, which is a significant problem in itself.  On Report Stage, the Minister of State will have an opportunity to consider something different and along the lines of what Deputy O'Reilly is proposing.  However, I do not feel it is fair to ask employers to pay 100% or pay for the lack of some mechanism whereby people can get access to a sick certificate, if that is what is required.  That is basically what we are saying in a roundabout way.</p></speech>

We have done the maths on this scheme and we have come in at a figure of 70%, which we believe is fair and reasonable.  I do not want to give the impression that we are going to go away and come back on Report Stage with an increase on that because that is not the intention.  As with every discussion we have here, we will reflect on it, we will talk to the T&aacute;naiste and to our officials and we will work through this.  However, a lot of work has been done to achieve that target of 70%.  I did not say it is the norm across Europe to have 70%.  In many cases, it is a lot less and goes down as far as 25%, although I accept it is higher in some cases.  I am not saying that the norm is 70%.  We are above the norm or above the average.  We have put forward a reasonable proposal.</p> <p>  It is set out in regulation, for the reasons I laid out at the start.  That gives scope to the Minister to react and to adjust accordingly over the years, as opposed to having to bring in primary legislation, which can be very time-consuming.  That is there as well.</p> <p>  We share Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in&rsquo;s understanding and concerns and that is why we are bringing forward the legislation.  As a Government, we understand both the barriers that are out there and the necessity for this.  That is why we are proposing it and bringing it forward, with the support of the Deputies.  We are in tune with what is happening out there as well.  We think we have the balance right on this, and we will monitor the position in that regard.  It goes back to the balance and the costs that we put on employers because they also have to be able to balance their books and to survive.  We want to have as many jobs as possible.  We want people who are on low pay to be able to constantly aim to get a job, improve their job and build on their terms and conditions, if that is what they want to do, in order to be able to pay their bills and look after their families.  They should not have that fear that I know is out there, which is &ldquo;If one of us gets sick tomorrow or next week, how do we manage and how do we pay the bills?&rdquo;  That is why it is important to have good-quality, well-paying jobs with good terms and conditions.  For that to happen, we have to have a balanced enterprise environment to manage that and to create those jobs in the first place.</p> <p>  It is a chicken-and-egg situation, but we will check and monitor this.  It is in regulation that the Minister of the day can adjust this through regulation, as opposed to having to go back to primary legislation.  However, I do not want to give the impression that we have not done the maths and that we are going to run out and change it, and then come back here on Report Stage.  That is not the intention.  It is linked to the average wage.  We think we have the balance right.  As I said, naturally, we will at every stage review what we are doing and keep an eye on that.  However, that is where our homework has brought us to at this moment.</p></speech>

This is to bring it into line with the protections afforded to other types of leave, where the level of penalty is approximately in line with the duration of the leave concerned.  In considering these amendments, I thought it particularly notable that the amount of leave set out in the Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016 is two weeks, and the penalty for non-compliance is two weeks' remuneration.  As the amount of sick leave intended to be provided for under this Bill will rise to two weeks over the next few years, it seems appropriate and proportionate that the level of penalty be set at that two weeks' remuneration.</p></speech>

In terms of the balance of risk and reward for an employer not abiding by this legislation and not providing the sick pay required, and the employee having to go through all of the steps to prove that and then get a judgment, a penalty of two weeks' remuneration is extremely minimal.  The danger is that some employers, though not all, let us be clear, will decide that is a risk worth taking.  Even if they get caught out, it will only be a penalty of two weeks' remuneration.  That is very small, and I do not think it is in line with the idea of balance.  Surely there needs to be a considerable penalty to discourage attempts to evade or not implement this legislation, and not give workers the sick pay rights that we are talking about.  It is quite a serious change that I would be seriously opposed to.  I would press the matter to a vote in this regard.</p></speech>

I respect the need to remain within the boundaries of other legislation and so on, but this makes it a risk worth taking not to grant it.  All of the discussion we have had today is centred around recognition of the need for this, but it has to work.  Deputy Bruton described the draconian process that an employer has to go through to go at the Labour Court but it is the same for the worker, and it is a lot of energy and effort that they are going to have to put in to be able to take a case.  Doing so takes a long time.  If people are doing it on their own and they are not in a union, it is very arduous.  Given there is a cap at the end, someone's boss might say it is worth the risk.  The punishment should not just be in terms of restoring to the worker what they would have had.</p><p>It should also act as a deterrent for employers &ndash; not all employers, not even most employers, but we do not need to legislate for good and decent employers who are doing the right thing anyway.  We would not be here talking about this if there was no need for it.  We need to legislate for workers potentially being denied this leave where they are entitled to it.  It will take a long time for them to vindicate their rights through the procedures, especially if they are doing so on their own.  I would encourage people to join a union, which is the best way of going through these procedures anyway.</p><p> There needs to be a deterrent for employers.  Cutting the period by 90% is excessive.  I appreciate that it is not technically a cut, given that it is not in place yet.  I should have chosen my words better and the Minister of State would be right to correct me on that.</p></speech>

The original proposal was 20 weeks, but now it is two.  That is a 90% reduction, albeit a reduction in something employees did not have.  In this case, though, I do not believe that we can say that you never miss what you never had.  This will be missed.  There has to be some element of a deterrent.  As matters stand, it is a risk worth taking.</p></speech>

I would have thought that some level of discouragement or penalty was reasonable and that the worker who was denied his or her rights would have the opportunity to see that done.  An adjudication officer might decide that different amounts are payable in different circumstances, but to deny the adjudication officer the opportunity to call out unacceptable behaviour does not seem right.</p></speech>

The ambition was to deter people.  We might have gone too far with the 20 weeks, but I take the point that setting it at two weeks might be too low.  We will reflect on this matter to see if we can get the balance right.  We ended up on two weeks after tracking penalties in other legislation.  This period is approximately in line with what the offer was.  We are committed to a maximum of ten days of leave, which is two weeks.  Even though it will take four years to get to two weeks, I accept the point that some employers might decide that the risk is worth taking.  I will consider this matter and revert to members.  We believed that 20 weeks was probably excessive and not in line with the magnitude of the offence.  The intention is to reduce that.  I will take members' comments on board and re-examine the matter with my officials and the T&aacute;naiste.</p></speech>

Going from 20 weeks to two does not seem balanced.  We are trying to implement a scheme that nearly all employers will abide by, but for those that do not, there has to be a sanction.  Two weeks is not an adequate sanction.  I welcome that the Minister of State will revert with something more robust.</p></speech>

Where paternity leave is concerned, it is two for two.  There is an entitlement to 26 weeks of maternity leave and a 20-week penalty.  That is why we lowered it to two weeks - to reflect what was common across other legislation.  The Deputies will accept that 20 weeks was probably disproportionate, but we will consider the matter and revert to members.</p></speech>

As the Chairman has mentioned, I am joined by Dr. Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer.  While exercises on lessons learned on the pandemic are under way throughout the world, it can be seen from objective data relating to mortality, hospitalisation and vaccination uptake that the response to the pandemic in Ireland was among the best in the world.  <i>The Lancet</i>recently published a major global review of excess mortality during the pandemic with data from countries and subnational regions throughout the world.  It found that &quot;some countries ... such as Iceland, Norway, Ireland, and Cyprus had some of the lowest rates [of excess mortality] in the world, at less than 50 deaths per 100,000&quot;.  As members know, the rate in Ireland was 12.5 per 100,000 of population.  The cumulative rate of recorded Covid-19 deaths per million of population in Ireland remained consistently below the EU average throughout the pandemic.<br/><br/>Nonetheless we have seen over 7,000 deaths from Covid-19, as well as high levels of illness.</p><p>Both the societal and economic consequences of the past two years are well known to members of the committee, with the pandemic costing the Irish Exchequer circa &euro;20 billion to date.  In the context of such costs, it is right that governments and health systems around the world are now investing significantly in public health capacity.  In the Department of Health we are working to find new and innovative ways to refocus and to strengthen public health capacity.  A clear component of this is to develop leadership capacity in public health in order to strengthen and to prepare in the event of future pandemics.  This is set out in the programme for Government.</p><p> As I have set out previously, I had initial discussions with the CMO in August 2021 about his future plans, as did the Secretary to the Government.  Given the changing disease profile and concerns about emerging variants, those discussions were necessarily paused until earlier this year, when disease indicators confirmed that Ireland was in a much better epidemiological position.  At that point, and in the context of Ireland's future pandemic preparedness, the CMO raised with some third level institutions how the Department of Health could, in an innovative and responsive manner, strengthen the knowledge and practice of public health leadership.  These engagements had particular regard to public health protection, informing policymaking, understanding the role of public communications and behaviour change and research of relevance to these domains.  Over the course of these engagements, the proposal for a professorship emerged.  The purpose of this was to ensure that Dr. Holohan's expertise and skill set remained within the public service, with a view to strengthening public health capacity and leadership in Ireland.  In this role the Department's intention was for Dr. Holohan to lead the development and activities of collaboration between all universities and the health sector and to develop stronger links with the WHO and agencies of the EU.</p><p> On 25 February of this year, the CMO requested my support to progress a secondment to a Dublin university.  He indicated that he had informed the Secretary to the Government of this request.  In early March the Secretary to the Government spoke to me and I confirmed that I was working on the details of this arrangement, including the proposed research funding element.  I was aware that the Government had recently endorsed particular secondment arrangements to the university sector for senior civil servants.  Given his long and distinguished service and the crucial knowledge and ability he brought to bear in the pandemic, I felt it was equally important that Dr. Holohan's expertise be retained and utilised in the public sector.</p><p> Further discussions took place, and the Department issued a letter of intent to Trinity College on 16 March which set out the main details of the proposals, with further detail on secondment arrangements to be agreed between the relevant HR departments of Trinity College and the Department of Health.  As part of these proposed arrangements, the Department considered that the funding of Dr. Holohan's post was something that needed to be worked out but that the Department would support the development of this innovative approach to progressing an important initiative through dedicated additional research funding.  It was envisaged that this would involve competitive funding organised appropriately to support the spirit of the initiative outlined above.  The letter of intent therefore provided for Dr. Holohan's salary to be paid, in time, as part of a wider fund which, it was envisaged, could be administered by the Health Research Board, with details to be agreed between all three parties, as per the well-established practice of funding of health research in the third level sector.</p><p> As the committee will be aware, there are a number of well-recognised steps from the generation of an idea to the funding of a specific project or service that all Departments and Ministers must follow in order to allocate funds.  It was clear to me that this proposal was in line with the Government's commitment to investing in public health, as outlined in the programme for Government.  As such, and as required, funding of research in this regard by the Department would form part of the normal Estimates process, subject to ministerial and Cabinet approval.</p><p> It is a matter of regret to me that what I viewed as an important and innovative proposal for increasing our public health capacity in Ireland is now not going ahead.  I believe that this important work would have benefited greatly by being led by Dr. Holohan.  I believed when we conceived this proposal that it was essential that we continued to harness Dr. Holohan's knowledge and skills in the public interest, and I regret that that will no longer be possible.</p><p> I am happy to answer any questions from committee members.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt is becoming somewhat of a celebrity, whether by intent or not.  I am not sure if he would consider a position on "Dancing with the Stars" next January.  I think he is the best known public servant at this stage, and not always for the right reasons, unfortunately.</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Watt's comment, "I felt it was equally important that Dr. Holohan's expertise be retained and utilised in the public sector.".  That, I think, would be supported by the majority of people in the country, and it is regrettable the way things have developed in that regard.</p> <p>  Considering that this process started last August, and considering the furore at the time over the Katherine Zappone appointment, did it not register with Mr. Watt that it would be prudent to ensure that the Minister, the Cabinet or the senior individuals in Cabinet, certainly the three party leaders, signed off on this, with all the details laid out, including the funding, the salary and the plans for a research fund?</p><p>Would that have been the prudent and wise thing to do, considering the timing of the Katherine Zappone issue?</p></speech>

I will spare the people of Ireland my dancing skills.  That is a relatively private matter.</p> <p>  The intention was that the details were to be worked out between the Department and Trinity College.  When we had finalised the exact details of the secondment and the funding, it would have been appropriate at that stage to ensure we had full approval and that the Minister was aware of all the details.  We may have even brought it to the Government at that stage.  I do not know whether we countenanced that but we certainly would have socialised it throughout the system in a more formal way.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, and previously in the report, the details had not been worked out.  The general idea had been set out in the letter of intent.  That was what we were intending to do.  The intention was that when the details were worked out, we would go through the formal process in the normal way these decisions have to be-----</p></speech>

This was a very senior and respected individual who had been on our television screens for a year and a half at that stage.  This was not a junior position.  It was a person who was well known and respected.  Mr. Watt should have known this was going to create headlines, particularly when the issue of the salary arrangements was relayed.  That should have been brought to the Cabinet, at least, for Mr. Watt's own sake and, more important, that of Dr. Holohan.

At various stages when the conversations were taking place the disease was still circulating and we did not want it to be leaked that the CMO was thinking about moving on.  We did not think that would be good, so we tried to manage it in a sensible way, given the challenges we faced and that, ultimately, this is a personnel matter in the Department.  Notwithstanding the profile of the CMO, it is a personnel matter.</p></speech>

That was put to Martin Fraser of the Department of the Taoiseach and he responded:</p> <blockquote> 	I do not know what he is referring to. I assume he is referring to former Secretaries General who are seconded to the third level sector. I do not know whether they are open-ended, to be perfectly honest. </blockquote> <p>To what was Mr. Watt referring?</p></speech>

We were aware of that and we were aware that precedent had been set.  From what I am aware - I am not over all the details of it - I do not think they are fixed terms.  I think the period of the secondment is up to the time the individuals are due to retire.  I was aware that had taken place and we were aware that precedent had been set.</p></speech>

Second, the Government was involved.  The Minister knew the generality of it.  We thought that was sufficient.  Obviously, with the benefit of hindsight, we should have handled that part of it differently.

I set out for the committee the nature of the opportunity and the ambition this would have represented for the country but when I saw the concerns being expressed in public I thought it was important I made an early decision, which I did, that I would not proceed with the role.  I had two broad objectives in that regard.  One, was to try to ensure -  I said it in the words I issued in public on that occasion &ndash; that both senior civil servants and senior politicians would not continue to be diverted by the ongoing nature of it.  I genuinely wanted to ensure that.  The second objective was that I had substantial regard for Trinity and for the Provost, in particular, and for their early support in this.  I had no desire to see them being drawn into any, if you like, suggestion of impropriety of controversy, of which they had no part whatsoever.</p><p>I wanted to make a clean and early decision in relation to that, a decision I did not necessarily set out to make in the first instance.  I had a good opportunity to brief the committee on the last occasion on the nature of my personal motivation around both the nature of this work in public health and the commitment to working on that work in the public service.  That was my personal ambition.  </p></speech>

He did not inform the Minister or this committee about it.  In his opening statement, he has said that this will need to be approved retrospectively through the Estimates process.  It is breathtaking arrogance that a Secretary General would sign off on expenditure of &euro;2 million without getting any approval from a Minister or from Government.  He thinks he has the authority to make a commitment in writing to pay potentially &euro;20 million of taxpayers' money to a third level institution without any ministerial approval and not even to inform the Minister when he was responding to the media on the issue.</p></speech>

We did not approve the spending.  The spending ultimately, if the money was to be spent from 2023 onwards, would need to be included in the Estimates process.  The Minister would need to approve that amount of money and it would need to be included in the Estimates.  That Estimate would be published as part of the abridged Estimate and then the revised Estimate.

He lost the run of himself.  I am currently reading a book entitled <i>Pandemonium</i>.  I am sure he will at some time read it himself.  It seems officials in the Department described him as &quot;Minister Watt&quot;.  To many people, it seems he is the one making decisions, rather than the Minister for Health doing so.  He cannot say that he was going to seek retrospective approval.  Once he was committing in writing &euro;2 million a year in recurring funding to an outside body, he had an absolute obligation to inform the Minister for Health.  He failed to do so.  He had an absolute obligation to inform the Government.  He failed to do so.  He had an obligation when he was before this committee.  He failed to do so.  That is an overreach on his part.  With respect, we cannot have senior civil servants committing taxpayers' money without any democratic oversight - which is what was happening here - and hoping that when it is all done and dusted they can then get some sort of seal of approval.  Mr. Watt did not inform the relevant people right through this process.  In my view, he failed in his duty because of that.</p></speech>

The Government in the context of two recent memos and the Brady review set out a commitment to enhance public health research and capacity.  In a further 2020 paper on the impact of research funding, it set out a clear commitment in that regard.  In effect, what we were trying to do was to implement policy that had already been agreed by the Government.  A memo was circulated and the Minister for Health provided observations on the memo, setting out clearly his intention in respect of the support for enhanced investment in public health research.  That was the intention.  I am just looking for the document.  It states that the Minister for Health welcomes the proposed new national research and innovation strategy 2030.  It states that our experience in the pandemic has shown how research can affect public policy and clinical practice and demonstrated how research collaboration across the public, academic and private sectors can directly and rapidly respond to societal needs.  It further states that the aims and objectives of the strategy will inform our direction on public health research.  It goes on to refer to strengthening the research culture of the health service and links to academia.</p> <p>  A few weeks previously, the Government had approved a policy in respect of research.  A few weeks before that, it approved a specific policy in respect of the Brady review.  What we were trying to do in the Department in the context of Dr. Holohan's moving on was to give effect to the intention of the Government which it had set out clearly and which the Minister, in welcoming the memorandum, had set out his support for this endeavour, so------</p></speech>

Of course, the Government is going to commit, in general terms, funding to public health.  Of course, that is the case.  Mr. Watt cannot then conflate that with him running around the place sending letters to Trinity College committing funding without any ministerial approval.  The very fact that he does not get that smacks of arrogance, it must be said, and it is simply not good enough that that is how he sees the world and the spending of public money.</p></speech>

There are two Secretaries General who have been seconded.  That is by Government agreement on a decision from 2011 and 2021 which says quite clearly that if they have not achieved the 40 years pensionable service or whatever, they will at the end of their term in office as Secretary General be offered an alternative position in the Civil Service or public service at a salary equivalent to a Secretary General or in an international institution with the intention that they will be offered a position until their preserved pension age, and that retirement before that age would not be the norm.  Is that a fair interpretation of what was described as an open-ended secondment, in other words, that this would bring Dr. Holohan up to his natural retirement age?</p></speech>

The open-ended secondment, therefore, is actual practice if a Secretary General has reached the end of his or her Secretary General term in advance of retirement.  There is a procedure in place.  The language says they will at the end of their term be offered an alternative position in the Civil Service, public service or an international institution, which covers Trinity College Dublin.  Therefore, there was a structure in place by precedence.</p></speech>

It is important in any situation that we all try to learn from things.  We were motivated by the public interest here.  The proposal is not taking place and that is a disappointment.  We need to reflect upon that and to learn lessons from it.  As the Deputy says, there is a review to look at it.  We need to think about that.  On socialising proposals, we had reflected upon this and we thought we were doing the right thing here.  We did not anticipate that it would lead to this response.  That is a judgment issue for me, the Secretary to the Government and Dr. Holohan.  We just did not think that it would lead to such a response.  We have to reflect upon that.  We have to think about how in the future we manage these things, how we socialise them, how we get different stakeholders on board and how we communicate.  There is lots to do in relation to that.  I am happy that what we are trying to achieve, the policy intent and the innovative approach in terms of Dr. Holohan going to a university, a third level institution, and having that collaboration and for the State to enhance the funding, is very positive.  That is the way it should be.  That is very consistent with what the Government wants.  We need to learn lessons from why it did not pan out the way we would have wanted.</p></speech>

That would have differed from the arrangement for Secretaries General.  That may be a question that Dr. Holohan can come back on.</p> <p>  In terms of learnings, it has been said that any reasonable person looking at this objectively would have seen this as a bit more than a personnel issue, that it was a strategic type decision dealing with a person, to use an American football analogy, of quarter-back stature.  This was not just an ordinary civil or public servant, but a person who is held in very high esteem.  The books are giving us very colourful background narratives of the different and fraught nature of relationships political and administrative, but they arise in the type of crisis that we were going through.  Mr. Watt referred to the programme for Government.  The programme for Government at public health level states that we will maintain leadership at the highest level with a Cabinet Committee on Health chaired by the Taoiseach giving overall strategic direction.  This is the first Government to establish a department of research and innovation, which illustrates the commitment of the Government to that piece.</p><p> I ask the CMO to answer my question on the private sector pay piece.  Does that differ from a normal personnel decision?  The Cabinet Committee on Health, which is chaired by the Taoiseach, was to be seen to be in charge of overall strategic health direction.  On the communications piece directly, were there casual or informal conversations between the CMO and Ministers or the Taoiseach saying, for example, "we are looking at this, investigating this, we have brought it this far and it is going to come to you guys at some stage for formal approva"l?</p></speech>

So, although I have never availed of it, I think that the current position in respect of my role as a civil servant is that I am not debarred from being involved in things outside of my role that do not conflict with my role.  I do not have any such arrangement but I know that there are plenty of civil servants who have arrangements, businesses, write books and things of that nature and earn moneys from those where they do not conflict with their role.  I think that is the formal position for anybody who works in the Civil Service.</p> <p>  In respect of Trinity, and I think this is the purpose for its statement, and for the avoidance of doubt, there are arrangements across the academic sector that pertain to all academic appointments, as I understand them.  Trinity College has, in the public domain, published detailed guidances for the rules and requirements of individuals to comply with.  So I see that as no more than a statement in a contractual situation of exactly analogous arrangements both in the Civil Service and Trinity and that I would have to comply with those.  It was not a statement of commitment to some specific or certain opportunity that I had any particular personal intentions around.</p></speech>

During the pandemic - and the CMO was involved in these conversations - there were very many discussions with the political system about the need for us to enhance our preparedness and readiness for future pathogens and pandemics.  We were very clear that while we felt that we had done well over the last two years, like all countries if we had been better prepared, had better integrated systems, had different capacities in different places and had a different structure then we could have managed it better, particularly regarding the questions of data and integration, the availability of data, and how we can access the capacity that exists across sectors.  There are many people in public health departments across local sectors so how can we access their abilities?  There were many conversations at a political level over the last number of years about how we can be better prepared for future pandemics.  Part of what we were trying to achieve was to respond back to that clear view.</p></speech>

It was interesting that Mr. Watt used the phrase "this innovative approach".  We are not talking about the rights or wrongs of investment in research.  We are talking about the handling of this particular proposal and I think that it is a bit of a misnomer to refer to it as an "innovative approach".  It was a serious mishandling of a proposal.</p> <p>  I happen to be somebody who has been very supportive of the whole idea of enhancing public health and I have been very conscious of it for a long time.  It was very clear during the early days of the pandemic just how weak that function was within the health service.  As far as I know, it is the only discipline within health that does not have an academic chair.  It would have been a very good idea to have an underpinning in one of the universities.</p> <p>  Today, we are here to talk about how Mr. Watt, as Secretary General of the Department, handled this matter.  I find his opening statement curiously vague because the actions that he took were very specific and what he said in his letter to Trinity was very specific.  His opening statement misrepresents the situation.  I do not think his opening statement is accurate but I want him to clarify the following.  He said: "I was aware that the Government had recently endorsed particular secondment arrangements ... for senior civil servants".  What are those arrangements?</p></speech>

He talked very vaguely about things and said that the letter to Trinity was from the Department.  It was from Mr. Watt himself.  This is all about how Mr. Watt handled this matter.  He talked about that letter setting out the main draft details.  They are not really draft details.  They are very specific in the letter to Trinity.  He said that "Dr. Holohan's post was something that needed to be worked out" but that is not the impression that Mr. Watt gave in the letter to the Provost of Trinity.  Mr. Watt very specifically said: "Under the proposed agreement the Department of Health commits to...".  So Mr. Watt was committing the Department of Health to funding not only for the first year, a figure of &euro;2 million, but he was committing to multi-annual funding over a period of about ten years and that comes to a figure of about &euro;20 million, which is a very substantial amount of money.  In addition, there is the question of Dr. Holohan's salary over that period and, conservatively, that is probably in the region of &euro;3 million.  So Mr. Watt was making a commitment of &euro;23 million of taxpayers' money without the authority to do so.  This was not a vague thing where one was going to work out the details.  Mr. Watt committed in his letter to Trinity and I believe that he went beyond his authority and power to do that.  It is very hard to understand the mentality of somebody who would do that.  A sum of &euro;23 million is a huge amount of money so I would expect that a Secretary General in a Department would first get informal approval and certainly make the Minister aware of what he proposed to do.  Mr. Watt already committed taxpayers' money in that letter and I do not think that is an acceptable action for a Secretary General to take.</p> <p>  Where did Mr. Watt get the figure of &euro;2 million a year?</p></speech>

There would be &euro;2 million,  out of &euro;949 million of research funding this year across the entire system.  So we felt that it was fully consistent with Government policy in terms of the commitments here and the details were to be worked out.  That when it got to the stage where the actual funding was to be made available to the Health Research Board, and it was not for Trinity College but for the Health Research Board to distribute that on a competitive basis and all of the institutions could compete for that, and then on that basis the Minister would seek approval and sanction spending as normal.  I think that was made very clear to everybody involved that this was to move the process along.</p></speech>

Is it not the case that he cut across established procedures for decisions on spending for research and undermined the HRB?  The Secretary General did not consult with them.  Mr. Watt committed HRB money, went against normal procedures and did not consult the HRB at all.  Is that not a further overreach by the Secretary General?</p></speech>

We committed to finding additional funding for this project, which one would administer through the Health Research Board, and then we would work through with it, in the context of the Estimates in September or October, how that would be managed.</p><p>There would be further details about how that programme would be managed.  I was not cutting across the HRB because it receives an allocation from the Minister for Health to deliver on various health objectives.  It is then mandated to manage these programmes and research funding and it does that on a competitive basis in the main.</p></speech>

It was a commitment to investment in public health research.  The intention, which I think is set out very clearly, is that the CMO would be based in Trinity and would lead this.  In the letter we talk about inter-institutional collaboration and public health departments across the third level sector.  We talk about the EU, the WHO, the Department of Health and the HSE.  The money was not for Trinity College.  The money was for this broad research agenda.

It would then invite proposals from across the sector.

It would not be confined to health but would also bring in some other disciplines that might help us to find other innovative ways.</p></speech>

It would have been a joint appointment between two schools, as Trinity makes clear.  That was the structure proposed within Trinity.</p> <p>  To elaborate on what Mr. Watt has said, the shared intention of everybody was that this would be a collaboration between all the universities.  I made that clear to the committee when we met in private session.  Ultimately, an individual based in one location would still have the obligation to lead something that was about all the institutions together.  To put it in simple terms, it was about ensuring that we as a country could bring together the relevant experts.  There are university departments of public health and there are experts in it, like Professor Cecily Kelleher or Professor Ivan Perry down in Cork.  We would bring all these people together in one collaboration and, to use a simple term, put on the Irish jersey.  An enormous amount of funding is now potentially available at a European level through the newly-established Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority to massively increase Europe's clout in dealing with these issues.  These are huge opportunities for us as a country to position ourselves to work together collaboratively and go after some of this funding.  That was the broad objective for all the universities working together.</p><p>It was not just about Trinity.  It was to be about all the universities.</p></speech>

The research would be there for the country and would help the Department of Health and the HSE and would contribute to the wider discussion across the EU.  As Dr. Holohan has mentioned, significant research funding of more than &euro;5.3 billion has been set aside at a European level.</p></speech>

The intention was that a properly led programme across the different public health departments, led by Dr. Holohan, would have been able to leverage very significant funds across the EU.  The contribution of the Irish Exchequer would have been a part of it.  When the details were worked out, the balance may have changed between the Exchequer contribution and the EU contribution so the Exchequer contribution would have been lower.  This is something in which, as a country, we are going to have to invest significantly-----</p></speech>

It is probably safe to say there has been a lot of confusion and ambiguity about Dr. Holohan's position with regard to this secondment.  It is quite unfortunate for everybody involved that this has happened.  My first question is for Mr. Watt.  Obviously, the position was tailor-made for Dr. Holohan given his public service, particularly in the past two and a half years.  Am I correct in saying that?</p></speech>

There were discussions about how to develop that research programme and that capacity.  The CMO made it known he was intending to leave his current role and Trinity College was interested in exploring how we could develop this.  It was not the only university that was interested.  Based on the overall funding commitments the State had made and on the Government's commitment in this space, Trinity decided to establish this professorship or chair.  Dr. Holohan will correct me if I am wrong but that is the broad genesis of how we got here.  We were motivated at all times by trying to advance public interests and what we thought were the best interests of the country in terms of the need for us to enhance our capacity in this space.</p></speech>

Is it normal practice when public servants go into secondment arrangements that their salary generally stays the same?  Is that general practice?</p></speech>

That would be the normal approach.  That was one of the issues here as it was proposed there would be no change in the terms of conditions of employment of the CMO when he moved across.</p></speech>

How do we come to the figure of &euro;20 million that has been bandied around?  I have not heard anyone explain that.</p></speech>

I presume it is &euro;2 million multiplied by an estimate of how long the CMO would have spent in the new proposed career.  Of course, that is speculation but I think it is &euro;2 million multiplied by ten years.</p></speech>

The intention was that it would fund a lead or senior investigator who would head up these research programmes and then there would be groups of people.  Most of the funding would ultimately fund teams of people doing research.  That is where most of the spending would be incurred.</p></speech>

Dr. Holohan has been in the public eye for the past two and a half years around the pandemic.  The vast majority of people will have paid attention to what Dr. Holohan has done and there is a lot of gratitude towards him for his role in the pandemic, and towards others.  Have recent weeks left a bad taste in Dr. Holohan's mouth after his public service over the past two years and much further back?</p></speech>

Obviously, I would prefer if it did not happen and had not happened that way.  That is clear.  I would prefer to be in a situation in relation to where this has ended up.  I will let others judge the impact of anything I have done over the course of the previous 15 years.  It does not take from any of that, in my view.  I would take the opportunity to say the things we have done in as a country in relation to the pandemic have not been things I have singularly done.  I have been visible in ways that many people have not been, but there has been enormous effort and I could start in the Department and go all the way from there to the front line of the health services.  Right across the board, people visible and others less visible have played a significant role in helping to support the country's response to the pandemic.  This is not credit that I either wish to or seek to take entirely unto myself.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned open-ended.  I did have the opportunity when I spoke to the committee the last day to make clear that from my point of view that was important.  The reason it was important was because if I was to say I was stepping back for a five-year period, as some have suggested, because that is the usual period of time for Department to Department secondments, it would create a doubt and uncertainty over the potential tenure of any successor of mine.  It would probably fetter the competition or likely make the competition for a successor less attractive.  Fewer people would apply and the possibility of me returning would arise for person who was successful.  I wanted to make clear, therefore, and this is the commitment I made to the Department out of respect for the role and the potential appointment of a successor, whoever that would be, that I did not have an intention in seeking to come back as CMO, even if in the secondment terms it meant that, strictly speaking, if I wished, I could come back at some point in some other role.  I wanted to be clear so that the ground could be left clear for another individual to decide to apply for the job and know he or she would have a full and clear mandate in doing that job in the same way as I had.  I thought that was important for the role.  That is the reason the period of time was potentially longer than five years.</p></speech>

I wish Dr. Holohan every success in his future career.  His answers to Deputy Lahart suggested there may be some scope for him to continue in the public sector.  That would be very welcome.  There is an onus on Trinity College to engage directly with Dr. Holohan on this role because it is clearly needed and funding will be provided for it.  Perhaps TCD can do something directly.  Either way, I wish Dr. Holohan every success.</p></speech>

Did he sign off on the press release before it was released?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.403" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022050400002#P00800"><p>I do not recall signing off on it.  The original press release, and I do not mean this in a pejorative way, was quite anodyne.  It said the CMO was moving on, resigning from his position and taking up a role in Trinity.  We did not get into the details of exactly how that would operate.  I think it was a standard press release by the press people.  I do not think there was anything to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-04a.404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022050400002#P00900"><p>Would Mr. Watt agree that in light of what has happened, perhaps there should have been more detail in the press release and it should have been held off for a couple of days and done properly?  A huge amount of this would have been avoided had the detail, or at least the detail of the secondment, been put into the public domain by the Department of Health as opposed to the manner in which it did come into the public domain.</p></speech>

There was a lot of confusion and people reaching conclusions based on information that was not fully out there or partial interpretation of information.  That is probably true.  With the benefit of hindsight, we should have issued a holding statement and said that further detail was to be worked out and we would make a fuller statement in due course.  We did respond to media queries during the week.  Obviously, the communication of this could have been better.  That is unfortunate.</p></speech>

It is not just a middle-ranking civil servant.  The CMO is a top-level civil servant and out of courtesy, the Government should have been notified.  We are not out of the pandemic.  Hopefully we are in its twilight but we are certainly not out of it.</p> <p>  The letter Mr. Watt sent to TCD on 16 March includes the word "commit" in terms of the funding of &euro;2 million per year.  If the scenario presented that Government approval for the &euro;2 million was not forthcoming, given that Mr. Watt had committed it in a letter, does he accept that he was leaving the Department of Health exposed perhaps to litigation from Trinity?  Clearly TCD was going ahead with this appointment.  It was creating this role.  Mr. Watt was looking for retrospective funding to be sanctioned.  If that were not sanctioned, does Mr. Watt not think he was leaving the Department of Health exposed?</p></speech>

We were very happy that there was a strong commitment to increase funding for research.  The CMO's proposed salary would have been a fraction of the &euro;2 million and what we think will be the overall amount of money that will fund research in this area into the future.</p></speech>

Broad policy commitments are made all the time and we have to give effect to those broad policy commitments in the normal way we do.  As I mentioned, I was involved in many conversations at political level where a very clear need for us to enhance our capacity in this space to get the university sector working together was expressed.  Moreover, in two recent memorandums, the Government set out clearly its policy intent here.  I was very happy, therefore, that the broad intent would be fine.  The CMO's proposed salary would have been a little over 10% of the &euro;2 million, so in terms of what Trinity would have been committing to doing, even if there was some issue with the subsequent funding, it was not a significant sum in the context of the overall fund.</p></speech>

If things had gone the way they should have, we would be in a different situation, addressing the challenges of the public health services in this country, which should get and need to get priority at this time.  Like other members, I believe there is still time to rescue the issue, and every effort should be made by everybody involved to ensure that will be done as a matter of urgency.  I ask Dr. Holohan and the Secretary General to re-examine the matter with a view to ascertaining whether it might be possible at this stage to salvage something in the interests of the country, the public health system and the reputations of all involved.</p><p> Long ago, I suggested that having learned from the experiences earlier during the Covid pandemic, we should apply them in general to the delivery of the public health services.  That was a natural thing to happen, and it should and must happen.  We must draw from the success of those experiences.  I fully appreciate the great effort made by Dr. Holohan, NPHET, the team in the Department of Health and the team throughout the country.  It was a very significant effort 24-7, on call all the time for a protracted period, in a way that was exemplary.  We have to record our appreciation of what has been done so far, which can be done again.  If we go off in different directions, however, as we are doing now, distracting ourselves and taking away the focus of attention from the issues that need to be dealt with, that would be sad and a failure.</p><p> I have no reason to be acrimonious towards anybody.  There is no need for it and no gain for anybody in it.  It does not work.  Members of the committee, Ministers or whoever being at loggerheads or cross-purposes with one another or with Departments serves no public purpose.  I hope lessons will be learned and I hope Mr. Watt has learned some lessons as well.  The lesson I see, as a former Minister of State like other members of the committee, is that there can be no proceeding anywhere without the approval and the updating of the Minister concerned.  It cannot be done.  It always ends in tears.  The necessity, therefore, is that wherever issues such as this one arise in the future, lessons that have been learned will be put into practice and, as a result, we can proceed knowing that whatever we do will be done in the national interest and the best interests of anybody.  It is important to recognise that, not least as we proceed to the challenges I referred to earlier.</p><p> In that context, there are now unprecedented waiting lists in every hospital in the country and in every department therein. It has been shown to the committee in the past that some people, in particular those who have been well placed in the services, can achieve great results.  It is a question of bringing them all together and putting them all in the same place at the same time in order that the sum total of what they can contribute individually will be seen to be greater, as I have no doubt will be the case.</p><p> In January of this year, I requested an urgent reappraisal of what was required, as our guests might recall.  At the time, Mr. Watt indicated he would tell us in November or December what might be possible, but it is too late for that.  That is way off and I think that, on reflection, he will have to admit that himself.  The necessity was to look at the issues that were now pertinent to the realm of the Department, and if we do not do that, we will be seen to have been negligent.  That is what future generations will say.  They will know full well that we have the capacity to take the steps that are expected of us, by whom I mean everybody involved at every level, from the public service, the political service and all that goes with that.  </p><p> As has been mentioned, lessons have been learned, but we have heard that phrase many times previously.  Why would it not have been possible to take account of the advice of committee members, for example?  We all had the feeling that we needed to divert our attention to the delivery of health services and put in place the necessary foundations for doing that straight away, not next November, December or the year after next but now?  It would be a simple step to take at this level and that needs to be dealt with.</p><p> I am sorry the reputations of many great contributors in the course of the pandemic have suffered, given it has been presented as though the system was doing something wrong.</p><p>The system was not doing something wrong.  It was attempting to keep on board all of the people who had a major contribution to make and continue to do so.</p><p> Reference was made to Dr. Holohan perhaps being able to look at this again.  I know that is difficult and he has made his own decisions, as he is entitled to do.  Dr. Holohan has also shown that he is committed to the public health system.  More than ever before, the public health service badly needs the expertise, leadership, concern, devotion and dedication of people who have been on the front line, or any line, of the pandemic.  I ask Dr. Holohan to consider this in the context of what might follow, so as not to lose all the information gleaned and all the expertise that is ready to be tapped for the public or for research insofar as the public health system is concerned.  That would be a disaster.  I do not want to continue incessantly as most of what I was going to say has already been said.  I wanted to emphasise that particular point.</p><p> With regard to senior officials and proceeding, we need senior officials with flair and innovative tendencies in the public service and I compliment those among them who have those qualities.  It is vitally important, however, that anything done is conveyed at an earlier stage to the political heads of Departments.  These are the persons who are supposed to know, and when they go on the public stage to discuss a particular subject they are entitled to have all of the information at their fingertips.  They need to be in control.  If they do not get information from the system in which they serve, they are no longer in control and they are boxing in the dark.  That does not work.  I hope that lesson has been learned and that with any such attempt in future not only will a letter or email be sent to the relevant people to apprise them of the particular situation, but that a copy will also be sent to whomever else might be involved.</p><p> I appeal to all concerned to think again about the position we are in now and the urgency of the matters that are ahead for the Department of Health and the health services.  We talk about this all the time.  It is not something we should refer to only for discussion.  We need action and the action can only come when the expertise, dedication and involvement of those dealing with the pandemic is refocused on the general delivery of health services, in particular the public health services.  That is all I want to say.</p></speech>

Now that we are through the latest wave of Covid, our focus is on the absolute public health needs, and particularly waiting lists.  We have an enormous challenge now because of the backlog of treatments.  We need to do everything we can.</p> <p>  I will mention two points.  There is a need to galvanise the system in dealing with challenges we now face, the more systemic challenge in the system.  We must galvanise the system in the way we managed to galvanise the system in responding to Covid.  That is very important.  People are suffering because they are waiting too long for treatment in many cases.  We need to have that same can-do spirit and the flair the Deputy mentioned is needed in that context.</p> <p>  My second point, to which the Chief Medical Officer has alluded, is that while the CMO is the public face of our response to the pandemic, along with Dr. Glynn at times, it is a team of people, including people in our Department, the HSE, the Department of the Taoiseach and many other Departments.  By the nature of it, someone has to lead that team and, in the case of a pandemic, someone had to be the public face.  It is very important to re-emphasise what the CMO said about many people being involved who, in my view, did a great service over the past years.  I thank Deputy Durkan for his comments in that regard.</p> <p>  The key thing now is for us to focus on what we must do for the health system to address the challenges.  That is what the Minister is very committed to doing and the Department and I are focused on helping him to achieve his objectives.</p></speech>

My major concern on this is the commitment of the funding over a ten-year period.  I am also concerned as to why there was an urgency in the letter that it had to be signed off on by 30 March.  Is there a particular reason it had to be signed off by the end of March this year, before there was any real full authorisation?  Perhaps some clarification could be given on that.</p></speech>

I do not think there was any specific motivation behind that date, apart from needing a given date by which we could say we were going to conclude discussions between Trinity College and the Department.</p></speech>

The academic year would not have started for another number of months.  Why was there such an urgency?  Looking at the letter that was sent, it would indicate a serious effort was being made that it would be signed off on before anyone really found out about it.</p></speech>

At the stage when there was a formal commitment of money or a formal sanction of money, then obviously the Minister would have had to approve that, and it would have been part of the normal Estimates process.  I think it was just a desire on our part to move it along.</p></speech>

For example, if I sent out a contract for the sale of a house, the other person would say he or she is signing the contract subject to getting a loan.  Likewise, should there not have been some indication in the letter that this was subject to the Minister signing off on it?  There is no indication of this in the letter.  This was not set out at all in the letter.</p></speech>

It was a letter of intent, or a proposed agreement letter of intent.  It talks specifically within the letter about working through the details.

The letter was quite clear.  It had to be signed off by the end of March.  There was no reference at any stage in the letter that this was subject to the final agreement of the Minister.</p> <p>  I wish to move on to this other issue of a joint approach by the Department.  By the way, I agree we need to have a far greater and better relationship between the university sector, private sector and public sector.  The best example I can give of this is a project in Canada at the moment where there is a new children's hospital being built, with two thirds of the funding coming from the state but the remainder coming from people contributing, whether it is people contributing $5 per month or pharmaceutical companies contributing major money.  The whole project is $3.8 billion.  They must raise $1.2 billion themselves and so far they have raised more than $900 million.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Watt believe we should now be looking at this in the context of the way we do health and health research in particular?  Does there need to be more co-ordination and more of a joint approach between our third level sector, our hospitals and the private sector in view of the fact we have huge numbers of pharmaceutical companies based here?  In Cork alone I think we have nine of the top ten pharmaceutical companies.  However, we seem to have drawn a clear line on connectivity with our medical services.</p></speech>

There is a need for more research and certainly the extent to which scientific research then feeds into medical practise and activities.  There is a lot of good collaboration going on between the university sector and our hospitals.  That is a standard thing.  This is something we need to do much more of in supporting research collaboration between different institutions.  It is in the main for the Department with responsibility for higher education to have further funding that drives this.</p></speech>

Do our guests think we could do much more if we set out a clear 20-year policy on how we can have better co-operation?  There is an advantage for both sides.  Has the Department looked at that or will it be doing so?  Medicine is now developing at a very fast rate and treatments are developing at a fast rate.  Do our guests not think we should now have a policy dealing with that whole issue?</p></speech>

The Deputy's point is a good one and it is correct.</p><p>If we look not just at pharma but biotech or IT, especially those aspects that apply to the health sector, such as those that help people to be maintained in the home and all those kinds of new technologies, many of these industries are present on this island at a scale that is out of proportion when compared with other countries.  The scale is enormous.  There probably is an opportunity for us as a country to find ways that are appropriate to collaborate with those-----</p></speech>

To collaborate with those as one country as opposed to it always being a series of different institutions and maybe making the whole environment in this country a place in which the testing and bringing to proof-of-concept of those becomes easier, in a way that is appropriate of course, there probably are significant opportunities here.  That would enable the translation into impact of many of these kinds of things at a much earlier stage.  There is a huge opportunity given the presence of those and the fact that this is a small country and we have a singular health system.  We have a number of universities and if we are able to build that kind of collaboration around those kinds of opportunities, we would do great things-----</p></speech>

There is clearly research policy in place.  Significant advances have happened in recent years around individual universities and generally in the country to facilitate that kind of research and innovation activity.  As I said, I am of the view and would be advising from a healthcare point of view that there are still enormous opportunities for us if we can find a way of collaborating.</p></speech>

Obviously, these are personal matters but the CMO indicated he was thinking about moving on.  The key issue was the timing of that in the context of the pandemic and to find a time when we were happier to be in a better place.  The initial conversation took place in August.  They were very outline conversations.  Those conversations were basically paused when we had the Delta and Omicron waves because we were all involved in responding to that.  The conversations then began in earnest in February.  They were very outline conversations and no more than that really at that stage.</p></speech>

Some of them are for fixed terms and some are open.  In the main, the receiving organisation pays the salary.  That is not always the case, but it is normally.  This is a function of changes that have taken place over the past ten years or more whereby we have tried to have a greater flow between different parts of the wider service.  Previously, the Civil Service was closed in terms of recruitment and moving people during different stages of their careers.  We have tried to open it up.  I almost always welcome proposals for secondments.  They generally work out well for the receiving organisation and the sending organisation.  They tend to work well for individuals as well, allowing them to try something else.  In my experience, they have generally been positive.</p></speech>

I want to reflect accurately and fairly his characterisation of the process regarding the letter.  It is his contention that, while the letter does not read "subject to approval", the funding element of &euro;2 million would have needed approval and the letter was setting out the bones of the objective in terms of funding this project.  From his earlier testimony, additional funding would have been made available to the Health Research Board to fund the post.</p><p>It was not coming from the board's existing budget.  Any spending by it would have come from additional funding, which would have been subject to the relevant and proper approval processes, including the Estimates process.

Mr. Watt wrote in his letter: "the purpose of this letter is to propose an agreement to the secondment of Dr Tony Holohan to Trinity College Dublin in this regard."  He also wrote: "I anticipate that these [the details of the agreement] will be finalised within the time frames set out below."  The letter then set out the details, which included a commitment to a &euro;2 million funding allocation.  However, Mr. Watt also wrote about appointing "Dr Holohan as a full professor with the title of Professor of Public Health Strategy and Leadership for a period from July 1 2022".  He was to take up his position on 1 July 2022.  However, if I understood what Mr. Watt just said correctly, the Estimates process would not have approved the funding until October.</p></speech>

The contention is that there was no proper scrutiny of this process.  There was no ministerial or governmental approval.  Mr. Watt's contention is that that would have come as part of the Estimates process, but that would have been after the event.  I did not write this letter - Mr. Watt did.  In his letter, he set out that Dr. Holohan was to have taken up his position on 1 July 2022.  Mr. Watt asked in the letter that the final agreement be signed prior to 31 March 2022.</p></speech>

If it had got to the stage where the details were finalised, we had got beyond the proposed arrangements and letter of intent, which mentioned that the details needed to be worked out, and we had a firm agreement, the intention had always been for the Minister to be involved then.</p> <p>  I will revert to the choreography of this, which we have already addressed.  We announced that this was happening but that we had not worked through the details.  The proposal was to work through the full details and make the announcement once we had those.</p></speech>

At no point does it say "subject to ministerial approval" or "subject to an Estimates process".  I do not know whether the Health Research Board would have needed to give approval.</p><p>It was not, it seems, informed about the process.  It knew nothing about this.  Many people were kept in the dark, including the organisation that would have to be a conduit for the funding, the Minister for Health, other Secretaries General and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Mr. Watt has stated that at some point the Minister would have been informed.  Earlier, I talked Mr. Watt through the timeframe.  On 25 March, when the announcement was made that the CMO was taking up this post, the Minister for Health was not informed of the &euro;2 million and, on 6 April, when on "Morning Ireland" he was also not informed of the funding at that point.  Given all of that, did the Minister for Health ever say to Mr. Watt in conversations: "I should have been informed, I am disappointed; I am not pleased or happy with the fact that I was not informed of the details."?</p></speech>

He was not entirely with us so we had to have that conversation.

I am asking Mr. Watt about those private conversations.  I am asking him about conversations in regard to this process.  We are entitled to know the Minister's view.</p> <p>  I have a final question.  The circular issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in December 2021 in regard to secondments states that all secondments will be temporary in nature and, in general, will be for a period of six months or up to a maximum of five years.  A response to a parliamentary question to the Minister in regard to secondments in the Department of Health states that 14 of the Department's employees in various grades from clerical officer through to principal officer are on secondment to other organisations and that the duration of these secondments varies between six months and five years.  The circular and the rules are very clear that secondments are temporary in nature and they should be secondments in the time range of six months to five years.</p><p>There are 14 people from the Department on secondment.  How many of those secondments are what are now being termed "open-ended secondments"?  If this was a permanent departure by the CMO, and we were told in private session with the CMO that he was not coming back to the Department, how could this reasonably be described as a secondment?</p></speech>

The policy paper the Deputy referred to relates to secondments within the Civil Service, between Civil Service Departments.  It is dated December 2021 and it relates to secondment within the Civil Service.  The reason we have temporary secondments of civil servants is that the policy is to have lateral mobility moves, to have people going under the lateral mobility scheme rather than secondment.  This document refers to secondments within the Civil Service.</p></speech>

How many of them are outside of the range of six months to five years?  Once the secondment was put in place, for how many of those 14 people was it agreed that it would be a permanent transfer?</p></speech>

We do not need names, just the details of their roles and for how many of them, at the point they departed, it was clear it was a permanent departure or that it would be what is now termed an "open-ended secondment"?  The Secretary to the Government, when before the finance committee, had no knowledge of "open-ended secondments".  That was news to him.  Where did that policy come from?  Of the 14 secondments currently in play, how many are open-ended?  If Mr. Watt does not know that today, although I believe he should know it and maybe he does, will he come back to the committee as quickly as he can with that information?</p></speech>

I appreciate that Dr. Holohan withdrew from the process to, as he said, take away from the distraction from all of the public health work and other work the Department is doing.  Is there a reputation crisis now facing the Department of Health?  Is there an erosion of trust with the public?  If so, what actions need to be taken either by Mr. Watt, as the Secretary General of the Department, or the Minister?  What actions will be required going forward?  It seems to be that this is rumbling on.  As highlighted, a huge amount of work has been done around Covid and in light of the global situation things happened.  However, over the past while, a couple of things have happened that are eroding people's trust.  At a time when we are still in a global pandemic and we still have arguably a healthcare crisis, the erosion of public trust in the system is not ideal.  Will Mr. Watt comment as to whether there is an erosion of trust and a reputational crisis and, if so, what needs to be done?</p></speech>

I have not seen the latest data.  I think, generally, people do trust the health system.  They do respect the health system.  There are issues around access, but once they have access, they express very strong positivity around the service they receive.  In terms of the Department of Health, I would certainly be very proud of what the Department has delivered over the last number of years in incredibly difficult circumstances.  I think officials of the Department can be very proud of what they have achieved in navigating us through this crisis.  By its nature, there are always issues in health.  I do not listen to radio but I am told that on most mornings, of the first five or six items on "Morning Ireland", close to half, or the majority, are health issues.  The nature of health is the nature of the system that we have.  It is a vast Department.  The health system is by far the biggest provider of a service by the State to our citizens.  It affects all of us.  All of our families have been affected.  As we all know, at various stages in our lives, we have to access the health system and at a time which could be most distressing for us.</p><p>It is a very challenging and emotive place and it is very contested.  It is inevitable.  It is my job to deliver on the programme for Government, to work with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and the Taoiseach to deliver and to get the Department into as best shape it can be deliver on that.  That is what I do.  We try not to get distracted by other things that can be somewhat extraneous, ultimately.  We try to focus on getting the Department in the best possible shape and focusing on the big policy challenge over recent years, which was the pandemic.  We have a challenge now to prepare for the emergency department situation that we will face next winter, no doubt.  We also have issues around waiting lists, which Deputy Durkan touched on earlier.  That is our focus and what we do.  I do not think it is possible or realistic to expect that health will not be in the headlines or that there will not be issues and things thrown in our direction.  That is inevitable.  Our job is to keep on delivering and working away and that is what we are trying to do.</p></speech>

It was interesting to see whether Mr. Watt thought this was outside of what would be the norm - he listed a number of things that consistently come up, such as waiting lists and satisfaction and stuff like that - and whether he thought this, while it was extraneous, was enough to do reputational damage to the system, but if he feels it is just par for the course, that is of course his business.  That was my only question.</p></speech>

On one reading, the letter to Trinity was a proposal and not an agreement.  The term &ldquo;proposal&rdquo; is loose enough.  That is the benign interpretation.

I absolutely understand, and perhaps it should be communicated a little bit better, that the kind of experience, knowledge, information and expertise a Secretary General would accumulate and garner over time in running a Department, depending on the Department, but many Departments have budgets of billions, deserves to be shared and is worth sharing in academic circles.  That is a good public policy position.</p> <p>  Second, it is unrealistic to expect a person who has served as Secretary General somehow to disappear anonymously back into the same Department and work to another Secretary General.  Someone who has been CEO does not go back in, as it were.  Such people are fixed term, and I am assuming that explains the Government decision in 2011 and followed up again in 2021 regarding those Secretaries General who had not attained 40 years' public service and could not qualify for their entitlements.  However, it was not only for that but also so their expertise would not be lost, because Secretaries General are getting younger.  It is my understanding in the case of the two Secretaries General to whom I referred that they have both gone to the university sector and their salaries and superannuation entitlements are looked after not by the Department but rather by the State through its funding of the universities to do that.</p></speech>

The terms and conditions involved in doing this in a State-funded manner, which is what Mr. Watt attempted to do, perhaps blindsided one or the two of the organisations for which the funding was intended.

There will be reviews of books and things like that.  Some people have been described as bullies, thugs and all the rest of it.  Some people have been said to be robust in getting their own way.  It was an interesting and fraught period.</p> <p>  However, the communications piece just seemed to misunderstand not the nature of the position, but the person who Mr. Watt was seeking to accommodate - the CMO, who is known to everybody in Ireland.  I just find it hard to believe there was no informal conversation saying, "This proposal has come up and we are trying to facilitate it this way, there is a precedent in terms of Secretary Generals and I think it would be appropriate to use that model in terms of the deputy Secretary General."  Otherwise, I can see the model that was followed.  I am not inclined to the witch-hunt piece or the conspiracy theories, although Department officials have left themselves open to it.</p> <p>  I would summarise it as follows.  A request was made by the CMO.  The Secretary General decided to act on it.  The model is not unknown.  There is precedent in that it is actually provided for in terms of Secretary Generals.  It is not unprecedented that a person is funded by the State outside of and beyond their role until they reach their 40 years or retirement age or whatever.  This then bounced into public disclosure by leaks and the public learned of an unfinished symphony.  That is my sense of it.</p></speech>

If there was a decision not to extend the term and he was nowhere near his 40 years of service, we could anticipate a similar arrangement could be entered into, given the Government has approved this process in 2011 and 2021, so his particular expertise and experience would not be lost to the public service.</p></speech>

It is an important point and we need clarity on it.</p> <p>  Has Trinity College Dublin been in touch since this matter unfolded?

It is important for a maternity hospital to be built that is fit for purpose.  There is much concern in particular about whether the Vatican gave consent for the transfer of the lands.  The Minister was asked that and he did not answer the question this morning.  There are issues and I do not apologise for raising the question.  It is of significant public concern.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt will have a meaningful role to play in that.  Does he recognise the role he must play in the recovery of the rest of the health services in general after Covid-19?  In other jurisdictions they are now finding out that various areas of health services were neglected due to the pressure of Covid-19.  An attempt is being made to catch up on those now.  How does Mr. Watt see his role in co-ordinating and delivering on that?</p></speech>

I am thankful we are on the way to recovery and to deliver services for our citizens.  It is my job to advise the Minister and implement his policies, ensuring the Department is structured as best we can be to support the Minister and the Government.  That is my job.</p> <p>  The big challenges we have relate to preparing emergency departments, which see enormous attendance every week.  There is an average of 26,000 or 27,000 people per week turning up at emergency departments, with 5,000, 6,000 or 7,000 people admitted into the health system every week through the emergency departments.  These are enormous challenges and we must prepare for what we may be facing for the winter, when Covid-19 may re-emerge in some form, and there will no doubt be other respiratory illnesses.  They have been fairly quiet over the past number of years but may reappear along with other normal winter-related pressures.  There are challenges in the emergency departments to prepare as best we can.  The Deputy also mentioned waiting lists, and it is my job to galvanise colleagues in the Department to help the Minister deliver his agenda and that of the Government.  That is how I spend my time.</p></speech>

I am only a guest of the committee.  I thank the witnesses for being here and the opportunity to make a few points and put a few questions.</p> <p>  There is some history here but at the outset I say that I have the height of respect for the Secretary General, Mr. Watt.  We have a history of spats at the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees but if I were in the private sector and part of a company large enough to afford Mr. Watt, I would certainly want him on my board.  However, we are not in the private sector and that is where much of the difference is evident.  I am a democracy purist.  Once, at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, I raised the question of wastage of &euro;10 million because of an error by the Office of Public Works with the rent of the Department of Health.</p><p>It would cost &euro;10 million over the course of the lease.  My question was whether there was a disciplinary process afoot.  Mr. Watt was then in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  He said he did not know but that a "gotcha" culture did not operate in the Civil Service and these things were used as a learning experience.  I thought that was a very expensive learning experience.  If it was in auctioneering, say, Jones Lang LaSalle, you would probably not get as far as lunchtime.</p><p> Before I get into my questioning, I will say that because something is the practice, it does not make it correct.  It does not make it morally correct in the interest of taxpayers' money.  I, for one, in 20 years between the Seanad and the D&aacute;il and six years on the Committee on Public Accounts and the banking inquiry, have watched senior civil servants waste billions in taxpayers' money and circling the wagons to create a facade to put across a prescribed narrative which betrays democracy.</p><p> Do you have a seven-year contract as deputy Secretary General or CMO?</p></speech>

Unlike what Deputy Lahart said about moving Secretaries General whose expertise we would lose after seven years, that did not apply in Dr. Holohan's case.  He was looking to move on.  I will quote the Minister when speaking on "Morning Ireland" on the relevant day.  While I hate to over-familiarise, the Minister said, "Tony wanted a new challenge."  God knows, it is about time someone in the room said that Robert Watt was retro-engineering it in direct conflict with the terms of the circular which quite clearly refer to six months at a minimum and five years at a maximum but he said it was open-ended.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  The next point is directed to the Secretary General, Mr. Watt.  "This was agreed by the Department" is a sentence he has used regularly in this room and elsewhere.  By whom in the Department was it agreed?</p></speech>

I understood the Minister is the boss.  Mr. Watt used the terminology, "We have a relationship, an employer-employee relationship".  If that is the case and he was my employee and plenipotentiary who headed off and spent &euro;2 million of the company's money without telling me, he would be gone.  However, because we do not have a "gotcha" culture that includes himself, he will be here into perpetuity.  Did Mr. Watt agree or did he ever bring up the matter at a management advisory committee, MAC, meeting?</p></speech>

I must intervene here.  Mr. Watt is trying to create an impression here.  It is not that I am letting the Government out of the gap because as far as I am concerned, its autopilot approach to all of these matters is reprehensible.  He is not the secretary to the Government.  In fact, his words outside this room - we are talking about Mr. Fraser - were that it was mentioned in a corridor.  He mentioned it to Mr. Watt in the corridor.  Where does Mr. Watt meet people formally?  Is it always in corridors?  He is the Secretary General of the Department.  What this is about here is that Mr. Watt approved it.  Is that right?  Mr. Watt approved it on his own.</p></speech>

I am sorry about that; it is just that I am very passionate about democracy.  I do not think we are getting much of it around this particular issue, I am sad to say.  The circular states: "All secondments will be temporary in nature, and in general will be for a period of six months up to a maximum of five years."  That is the very first key principle.  How can Mr. Watt reconcile that with the idea of an open-ended term?  The CMO has very kindly pointed out he is a good distance from his 40 years.  Therefore, on top of proposing funding of &euro;2 million per year, Mr. Watt was in effect proposing that should the CMO opt to retire in the interim &mdash; say, after five or six years &mdash; he would, under the special clause in the superannuation Act, bump up the 27 or 28 years to 40.  Is that not correct?  We know there is no precedent for this, because Dr. Holohan did not have a seven-year contract.  We also know, from what I have just read out, that Mr. Watt was in clear breach of the circular.</p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane was quite clear in questioning Mr. Watt earlier to determine whether the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, had expressed any displeasure over this.  Mr. Watt said "No" eventually.  Was the CMO's secondment part of the Minister's agenda?</p></speech>

As we set out earlier, the CMO indicated that he wanted to move on, and we explored options in respect of that.  That is how we arrived at this.</p></speech>

What if it were decided by some of the new universities without a particular health function, such as the new Atlantic Technological University, that it could be very useful to introduce a public health function related to the CMO's expertise?</p><p>What is coming across here, on which I must disagree fundamentally with my colleague and friend Deputy Lahart, is, to me, corruption by any objective analysis.  It is unbecoming of both of the witnesses, with their expertise and professionalism in other ways, because this was retro-engineering of a position for somebody and seeking to bounce the Government into it, until there was pandemonium in the D&aacute;il about it.  Unless and until the three Acts &mdash; the 1954, 1924 and 1997 Acts &mdash; are dealt with so that you people quite frankly accept there is a democracy here and a Parliament, or an Oireachtas, that are not and should never be blindly subservient to a position regarding which, depending on who you are, different rules apply, this will remain an issue.  In the Minister's own words &mdash; I am sorry to say it to Dr. Holohan &mdash; "Tony wanted a new challenge", and the taxpayer was prepared to dig deep, in the order of &euro;2 million, to deliver it.  Scandalous.</p></speech>
