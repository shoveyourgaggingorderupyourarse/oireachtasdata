    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#A00200"><p>All those present in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Today we are looking at tax reliefs in the film sector.  For clarity we will have two sessions today.  First, we will have an hour and a half with representatives of the Irish Film Workers Association, IFWA, and then representatives of Irish Equity will appear at 7 p.m..  I welcome Mr. John Arkins and Ms Liz Murray from the IFWA.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction from me.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses that the remit of the committee is limited to tax expenditure and the film relief tax credit.  The wider industry or sector is not necessarily within the committee's remit and any issues or cases specific to individuals or companies should not be discussed at this session.  I invite Mr. John Arkins and Ms Liz Murray to make their opening statements.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Arkins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#A00300"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to address the committee on section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended.  I have worked in the film industry for almost 29 years as a stagehand, supervising stagehand and standby stagehand since 1994.  Since 1998 I have worked with the largest group of film producer companies in Ireland.<br/><br/>Central to my employment is section 481.  Employment and training form one of only two key fundamental objectives of the Act.  The current film regulations are covered by SI 119 of 2019.  The objective of section 481, as amended, are set out in Part 2 of the regulations as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	(3) A certificate shall not be issued by the Minister under section 481(2)(a) of the Act of 1997 in relation to a film unless &mdash;  	 <blockquote> 	(a) the film is eligible for certification under Part 3, and<br /><br />(b) the Minister is satisfied that the film will either or both - <blockquote> 	(i) be of importance to the promotion, development and enhancement of the national culture including, where applicable, the Irish language (referred to as &lsquo;the Culture test&rsquo;), and<br /><br />(ii) act as an effective stimulus to film making in the State through, among other things, the provision of quality employment, and training and skills development opportunities (referred to as &lsquo;the Industry development test&rsquo;). </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>The objectives as set out at subparagraph (i) are no longer met, as we understand it, despite the recent success of Irish language films.  The objectives as set out in subparagraph (ii) are not capable of being met according to the employers and their representative body.  It should be noted that film workers were fully aware that the objectives at this subparagraph of the regulations were not being met.<br/><br/>However, the fact that these objectives cannot be met only came to my attention by way of statements submitted to both the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and Labour Court of which I have direct knowledge.</p><p>The employer and the employer's representative body - Screen Producers Ireland - submitted to those statutory agencies that section 418 prevented the production sector from having an ongoing employment relationship with the crews.  This they attributed to the structure of section 481 and the uncertainty associated with the production sector globally.  They provided no rationale for this contention.  If the facts submitted by the employers and their representative body are correct, then it begs the question as to why they and others consistently and aggressively lobby for the section's retention in its current form.  Despite the forerunners of section 481 dating back to 1984, given the statements referred to above, the industry appears not to have benefited to any great extent from the legislation.</p><p> Until 2015, section 481 was a tax relief available to investors who had a corporation tax liability.  It is now directly payable to film producer companies regardless of whether they have a corporation tax liability.  Clearly, section 481 has become a handout, and a significant one, amounting to 32% of the budget up to a maximum of &euro;70 million, plus a 5% regional uplift in many cases.</p><p> Given the employers' assertions and the fact that there are no companies of scale, no employees and no owned infrastructure despite almost &euro;4 billion of taxpayer investment to date, it is clear that there are fundamental structural reforms relating to the relief that need to be debated and implemented.  Film producer companies are the only beneficiaries of section 481, yet they are never directly heard.  A number of outlier organisations run interference for them, which serves to muddy the waters and stifle debate.  Given the requirement of the legislation that the relief be predicated on meeting the culture test and the industry development test, the only relevant voices are those of the producer company executives and the taxpayer.  If those tests are not being met or are, for some inexplicable reason, incapable of being met by the beneficiaries, then the Minister is not doing her job and there are fundamental governance issues to be addressed.</p><p> One way to address the issues is by amending the order in which the relief is paid.  Currently, 90% of section 481 is payable up front on certification of the film by the Minister.  A fairer system for the taxpayer, and one that would afford significant protections for the workers, would see only 10% being paid up front.  It should be noted that section 481 was not designed to be an operating subsidy or an investment buy-in for the producers.  The remaining 90% would then be payable after six months when compliance had been determined by the relevant Departments.  Compliance cannot be determined in advance.  Although I am no expert, it would appear that corporation tax is a cumulative liability that cannot be determined in advance either.</p><p> What we are suggesting is not in any way an unreasonable request.  Therefore, we urge Deputies of all parties to take the opportunity presented by the extension of section 481 and the impending amending film regulations to ensure that a fairer and more transparent system of stimulating film production is brought about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Liz Murray" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#B00200"><p>I am an advocate for the Irish Film Workers Association and I work in employment law.  Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended and currently structured, does not work.  It does not work for our cultural aspirations, the crews or the taxpayer.  Committee members will have received submissions from a wide range of vested interest individuals and organisations, none of whom is a recipient of section 481.  Many of the submissions will say that section 481 is crucial to the ongoing development of the film industry.  While section 481 has been crucial to the development of the Irish film industry since 1984, there has been no significant development.  If one cares to drill down, one will see that there is no indigenous industry because we lack the essential characteristics of an industry.  We do not have large employment numbers - 2,158 was the Department of Finance's estimated figure in 2019 - and the producers do not appear to have a business model, buildings, infrastructure, machines, vehicles, etc.  Since the producers do not own content, they have no ownership of the product either.</p> <p>  Content is crucial to the taxpayer as well.  Creative Capital, a Department-commissioned report to plan for the industry from 2011 through 2015, recognised the issues relating to owning content in the films being made.  One of its key recommendations highlighted the difficulties for the indigenous industry when the producer companies concentrated on simply servicing "Hollywood" productions.  The report's committee recognised ownership of content as crucial to development.  This is what it said was needed: "Rights ownership to vest in production companies and content creators to drive export growth."</p> <p>  I will outline a few facts about section 481 that are not generally understood or may be ignored because they do not fit the narrative of the vested interests.  The objective of section 481 and its predecessors was to stimulate the development of an indigenous Irish film industry, meeting two key criteria - a culture test and an industry development test.  My colleague, Mr. Arkins, has referred the committee to the relevant film regulations.  Section 481 is payable to an Irish producer company that has a track record in film production, is based in the State and gives a solemn undertaking to the Minister that it will adhere to all employment, social and Community laws.  Section 481 is not payable to foreign directive investment, FDI, companies and is not intended as a mechanism to attract FDI, according to the legislation.  If filming here, FDI companies must take on an Irish producer company and crew.</p> <p>  Section 481 is part of a significant suite of State aid available to Irish producer companies to meet the criteria of the regulations.  Be that money loans or grants from Screen Ireland or investment by RT&Eacute;, TG4, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, or any other State-funded agency, the criteria are the same.  The sole objective of section 481 is to develop an indigenous industry turning out Irish product.  It is not payable so that the producers can invest it in "Hollywood" for no return on the investment to anyone other than themselves.  Section 481 is not payable so that the producer can service American multinational and streaming platforms so that, when they complete their film or TV projects, fold up their tents and strike for home shores, the Irish producer lays off the crews and sits back until another service opportunity arrives.  This is not the way to develop an indigenous industry, yet that is the reality in Ireland.</p> <p>  State aid to film productions is mandated by EU law.  The obligations are the same - produce films that express European culture and train and maintain a permanent pool of experienced employees.  It is unclear how the EU will view Ireland's film industry if we are only servicing Hollywood productions and not developing an indigenous industry or maintaining a permanent pool of experienced crew.</p> <p>  Using the Government's own commissioned report as a benchmark, there are approximately 500 production companies in Ireland.  Based on Department of Finance figures, there are 2,158 employees, 900 of whom are PAYE workers, the remainder being freelance grades.  This translates to an average of 2.5 employees in each of those companies or, in other words, the principals of the companies.  This is wholly consistent with what our association has known for many years through union membership figures.  It is a far cry from the 17,000 being touted by vested interest groups.  Crucially, the 2,158 have as-and-when jobs, not full-time ones.</p> <p>  To recap, there are no jobs other than casual as-an-when jobs, no buildings, no infrastructure, no camera equipment, post-production or other paraphernalia associated with a production process, and we do not own any content of note.  In other words, there is no industry.  Is that a fair return for the taxpayer on an investment of close to &euro;4 billion since the reliefs were introduced?  Not by a long shot.</p><p>We hope the committee can see there is something fundamentally wrong with this picture and urge reforms, and that the key stakeholders, that is, the taxpayer, the employers and the employees, can be brought to the table to debate what are serious and fundamental structural problems.  With amending film regulations imminent to reflect the extension of section 481, the time for debate is now.  Kicking cans down long roads does not work and will not work anymore.  The taxpayer simply cannot afford this playacting.</p></speech>

They have made a clear and compelling case for how this is working, or more accurately not working, in its aims and objectives.  They mentioned, in the context of qualifying for the relief, that production companies are required to pass certain tests, one of them being the industry development test, and that they need to provide quality employment and submit reports, including evidence they have followed the WRC findings or an explanation of why they have not done so.  Are production companies passing the industry development test, and if not, how are they able to avail of section 481?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Liz Murray" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#C00300"><p>We can only give anecdotal evidence.  Currently, 40 people have been displaced from their employment.  No reasons were given, although we suspect it has something to do with us looking for rights of entitlement under employment legislation.  Members of the association, my colleague included, appeared before an Oireachtas joint committee on culture in 2018 and six months after that, he was displaced, as were the other workers who made the case.</p> <p>  The employers have not turned up at the Labour Court to discharge their burden of proof.  They have made submissions to the Labour Court and the WRC to say they do not employ anybody.  Their representative body made a submission to the Labour Court stating that the structure of section 481 prohibits an employment relationship between the parties.  I cannot see how that is the case, because how else can the industry development test be met?</p> <p>  As for production companies, nobody has a crew until somebody starts a film.  There are no crews in any of the production companies in Ireland until somebody makes a film.  They then go into the marketplace and hire a crew through, say, props heads of department and construction heads of department.  Our people are on the construction end in set craft.  A construction manager is hired and he or she rings the crew members and asks whether they are available and can come in.  That is how it goes.  The production companies pay the crew and when the film is finished, they are laid off.  If the crew members are lucky enough to be able to claim from the Department of Social Protection, that is what they do until somebody else looks for them, notwithstanding the fact they have might worked extensively with one employer.  Mr. Arkins, for example, spent 20 years with one employer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Arkins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#C00400"><p>I might come in on that and on the idea of the employment test being met.  I am a living testimony of the employment test.  I have worked here for 28 years.  The way it works in the film industry is that when you finish a production, the clock goes back to zero and you have no rights.  You have no benefit from your service.   I am a man of 58 years of age.  I lost my job because I appeared here in Leinster House in 2018 to talk about what it is like to work in the film industry, as did 40 other men.  I cannot get a job because I have no references from my 28 years of work.  The people I have worked for refuse to give me a reference because they say I do not work for them.  That is the impact on me, as a 58-year-old man in Ireland today, after working in a film industry where my employer has &euro;4 billion to create quality employment.  I have to hand copies of agreements that have governed my working life going back to 1994.  I was promised a pension in 1994 but not one penny has been put into a pension scheme for any worker in the film industry.</p> <p>  I am one of the men involved in the WRC case.  I was told to go to the WRC by Deputies in this building and I went and put in my case.  The people I identified as my employers have said they are not my employer.  They do not turn up.  One employer has made &euro;250 million within six years but he did not turn up.  Even when he was subpoenaed by the Labour Court, he did not turn up.  I have copies of statements from the representative body that produced a collective agreement stating that none of its members can have an employment relationship with any crew member, trainee or employee.</p> <p>  If there cannot be a relationship between an employer and an employee, there cannot be an industry.  They are the two blocks an industry is built on.  If I am making something and producing work, I will need a crew along that production line to make it.  I will need to sell it, get something back from it, put that back into my business and industry and keep on building.  That is how a business starts.  I could bring before the committee a gentleman who worked in the industry for 44 years.  The &euro;4 billion has to be spent in his lifetime.  He was told to get off the site and that he was not wanted, after 44 years.  He too is a living testimony.  We can prove the employment test is not working.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#C00500"><p>Mr. Arkins's testimony is very powerful.  The way he has been treated is simply not acceptable.  Nobody should be punished or blacklisted or lose his or her employment for advocating for better working rights for themselves and their fellow workers, and I hope this hearing can get to the nub of some of this.  Given the testimony we have heard, it is clear, as he said, that a signed statement that screen producers submitted to the Labour Court claimed that their members cannot have an employment relationship with workers because of the operation of section 481, and as we know, employees are employed through DACs.  It appears, however, that that is in conflict with section 481, given that section requires the applicant to give an undertaking to provide quality employment and to comply with all the relevant employment legislation.  How can a company, therefore, benefit from section 481 and the tax reliefs that flow from it and give that undertaking if it does not employ anybody?  Has Mr. Arkins or any of our other guests had any interaction with the Department of Finance regarding how companies are qualifying under these rules given they are not employing employees directly, are leaving that to DACs and are then operating at an arm's length from it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Liz Murray" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#C00600"><p>The section 481 relief is paid to a producer company, not to a DAC.  A document concerning section 481 was produced by the Department of Finance in the context of budget 2023.</p><p>This document says this is paid to the producer company and the special purpose vehicle is for accounting purposes.  It is an accounting tool to keep the money for each film within the confines of that single film so it cannot be spread about to other films.  In the context of section 481, therefore, the DAC is muddying the waters in that the employers are telling us or trying to imply the DAC is perhaps the employer.  However, in the undertaking the Department of Finance made in 2019, the Department specifically mentioned certain legislation.  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act and adherence to that is mentioned specifically.  A person must be employed on two contracts over a four-year period to qualify for that.  The producer company then has to be the one with the responsibility to ensure adherence to that particular legislation, and from that flows all other legislation, but because that has a qualifying criteria of two contracts over four years, it is the one that is easiest to relate to.  It is simple to do that.</p><p> On the Deputy's question about the Department of Finance, the lads are calling me Andy Dufresne from "The Shawshank Redemption" because I write so often.  I have written to the Department of Finance and the Minister in particular, I have written to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Minister there, as well as her predecessor.  We have been writing to the Department of Finance since 2010.  We asked for forensic accountants to come in and examine the relationships and everything else because we cannot get to the bottom of it.  This document that was produced is so confusing.  There is something here that the Department says there are 8,630 weeks in relation to a production in 2019.  It is a long time since I was in school but as far as I know there are 52 weeks in every year and it does not matter how you spin that, you cannot come to 8,600 or whatever weeks in a one-year period.  We have written to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Our case-----</p></speech>

In fairness, they have not gone into the individual adjudications, if you like.  What they are saying is incredibly relevant because it underlines the point that the sole purpose of this tax relief is to create quality employment and training and to contribute to Irish culture.  If it does not do those things, then it should not be paid out.  More to the point, the recipients of that must sign a solemn declaration saying they are doing that.  Ms Murray and Mr. Arkins have spelled this out, but if they feel there is anything more they can say to do so, then they should, because as I look on, there is an incredible, gross contradiction.  On the one hand, film producers last year could get &euro;100 million for this by signing a solemn undertaking they are creating quality employment and training, and then the very same people can walk into the WRC and say they can have no employment relationship with the people who worked on the film production.  It is not just that they do not have an employment relationship with Mr. Arkins or a particular individual but that they say they cannot have an employment relationship with them.  They are blaming section 481, which is dubious, to put it mildly, but it is an incredible contradiction.  I do not know if Ms Murray and Mr. Arkins want to spell that out.  In that regard, I ask them to elaborate the point about the EU directives on state aid and industry development, because from my reading of this, the only reason the EU allows particular forms of state aid is to create a permanent pool of talent.  How do you create a permanent pool if the people who get the state aid say they cannot under any circumstances have any employees?  It is hard for me to understand how that can be sustained and whether it has to be investigated.  Ms Murray and Mr. Arkins may have some comments on that.</p> <p>  Another question I am interested in relates to something our guests often say.  Maybe it is worth underlining the figures for how much has gone into section 481 over the past decade.  Our guests always put it fairly starkly by asking what we have got for all that public money.  Can anybody think of any other area of expenditure where the State would have forked out &euro;4 billion and have nothing, literally nothing, for it, namely, no employees, no ownership of content, no studios, no equipment and no props?  We have literally nothing.  Maybe they could say a little about where that money is going or where they think it is going because, at the end of it, the State does not seem to have anything for the investment.  Where is the physical equipment bought with section 481 money on film productions going?</p></speech>

I was one of the people who went and collected all this equipment.  First, the equipment is bought by a production company using a VAT exemption form, so it does not pay any VAT on the goods it is buying.  That could be scaffolding, timber, paint, bathroom suites or anything.  A tax exemption form is handed in and no tax is paid on it.  The production gets all the stuff it needs.  I have worked on productions from the likes of "Love/Hate" to "King Arthur".  On all these jobs there are props and stuff built.  When all this stuff is built, it is accumulated.  At the end of the job there is what we call a fire sale.  The people who end up buying this stuff are usually the heads of-----</p></speech>

He would store it in his warehouse.  It would not be hired to anyone else, it would not go anywhere else and there would be no other business plan.  Then when the same producer would be doing a job, and I worked with the same construction managers and producers for 20 years, they would hire back at below the market rate the same stuff the taxpayer paid for on the previous production.  That puts pressure on the hire companies outside that hire stuff out.  That is where the stuff would go and that is the same for all departments.  I know that because I have witnessed it.  I have been in the warehouses where the stuff is that was bought by the taxpayer for the productions and for the production company that is supposed to be building a company of scale.  It is getting money to build a company of scale, to hold on to this and to these employees to save taxpayers money in the long run.  Instead, they rent the same equipment the taxpayer bought 20 years ago for 20 years.  That one scaffolding tube could cost the taxpayer &euro;1 million over a 20-year lifetime.</p></speech>

It comes by way of communication.  I am sorry but I cannot remember the number.  It is communication 13 or No. 381 of 13.</p><p>The section 481 legislation mirrors it to a certain extent.  I know the words are different but it mirrors it to a certain extent.  It seeks to develop a European film industry.  Europe cannot compete with America.  This is crucial because many of the productions coming in here are American productions and are made for Disney, Netflix, Amazon Prime or some of the other streaming channels.  Again, it mirrors section 481 so it seeks to develop a European industry capable of competing with Europe because we recognise we cannot compete with the Americans, to develop a permanent pool of employees and to be of cultural importance to European culture.  </p></speech>

At the very least, there is a question mark over where the ownership of the content goes.  In its submission, Equity says that in respect of the intellectual property and the royalties that would flow from their share of that intellectual property, they are either asked to sign away their entitlement or to get a far lower proportion of it than in other jurisdictions.  Is it the case that the producer is saying on one hand that it cannot have employees but on the other that it owns the intellectual property?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Liz Murray" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#E00300"><p>It is muddier than the darkest Hollywood drama.  It is so muddy that it is very difficult to understand.  One of the largest production companies has told us that it owned content in a particular project and, therefore, could make an arrangement with the crew.  Arrangements were made in terms of employment and a profit and the producer said he could do that because he owned some of the content, as I understand it.  I do not know who owns any other content.  I imagine the Americans do not let it go cheaply when they come here.  I do not imagine so.  I do not know the answer to that but I know what Equity is talking about - because the crews do as well - is the fact that they have to sign over their intellectual property rights to the producer.  A producer is actually entitled to intellectual property rights in a production.  A producer owns that.  For performers, there is equitable remuneration for their rights.  They sign a contract as with the DAC company.  After that DAC is wound up, they are supposed to be told where their intellectual property rights go - who then has ownership of those intellectual property rights - but they are not told that.  They do not know what happens.</p></speech>

It is all deflection away from the producer but the fact remains that the producer owns a 100% share of the DAC that is set up with section 481 money so the producer has the property rights.  We do not know what the producer does with them but the DAC is just an accountancy tool.  It has nothing to do with any of this stuff.  You have to go and ask for the person who gets the section 481 money and that is the problem.  Nobody actually asks them any questions.  So many people are running interference.  You need to ask them the questions because it is not me who is saying that they cannot have any employment relationships.  They are saying it.  They are saying it in submissions they lodged in the WRC.  We have the documents and we can show them to anyone.</p></speech>

In my 28 years working in the industry, not one person who got one red cent of that money has been asked what he or she did with it.  Even when it comes to their accounts, you cannot find out where the money is.  They use a TR2.  Nobody can find out where the &euro;4 billion has gone.  I do not understand.  Politicians are put in a privileged position by the Irish people - Irish taxpayers - to pay out their money but they have not spoken to the people to whom they gave it.

I take Mr. Arkins's point about how at the end of the day, none of these questions have been asked before while billions have been spent on this.  I accept fully his point that it is for us to investigate this.  To be fair, Deputy Boyd Barrett has been talking about this for a long time so I thank him.  As Mr. Arkins said, it costs the State &euro;4 billion.  Who is the biggest beneficiary and who bears the biggest cost?  In his opening statement, Mr. Arkins pointed out that the real value of the film and TV industry is not at the point of production but is in the copyright and intellectual property created by all the parties.  According to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, enforcement of intellectual property protection is essential to preserve the legal validity of intellectual property rights, prevent infringement in order to avoid wholesale damage to a person and his or her goods and services, including loss of goodwill and reputation, and seek compensation for actual damage caused.  Does Mr. Arkins think the State is failing in its obligation to protect the intellectual property of all parties involved in bringing a film or TV show to the screen?</p></speech>

I am a supervising stage hand.  Some &euro;4 billion has been spent so far.  If we made content and if there are intellectual property rights, money should be coming back somewhere.  If money is coming back somewhere, why do they still need handouts?</p><p>When do we find out who owns the copyrights and content?  We know the producer, who is the 100% shareholder of the DAC, got the money.  The questions need to be put to him.</p><p> As far as intellectual property rights are concerned, my colleagues and the people I have worked with in front of the camera will speak to that.  I do not know much about that issue but I do know, as someone who has worked in the industry for almost my entire adult life, that X amount of money has been spent and if we were making a success of the industry, there would be money flowing back into the country with all of the content that we have turned out.  Who is getting the money from the content?</p></speech>

Regarding the three people, of whom I am aware, scope found against the employer in those cases but those three people were not listed.  The contracts that were issued to them called them something else other than the grade in which they were actually employed.  This was done to suit the document.  In 2019, the document was withdrawn but a new version is under negotiation.  I have seen the draft of the new version and the people negotiating it are a commercial semi-State company, Screen Ireland.  I do not know what its involvement is but it has a huge involvement in employment matters that should not have anything to do with it.  The new document is being negotiated and they are looking to include actors as employees.  The irony is that we, the crew who have worked for all of these years, are not employees when it comes to prosecuting legal rights of entitlement.  Actors are truly freelance because they have unique qualities and Screen Ireland now wants them to be employees.  My suspicion is that someone who is an employee of a company does not have any intellectual property rights.  That question needs to be asked as well.</p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy has heard about the recent very successful Irish language film which won an Irish Film and Television Academy, IFTA, award.  It is reputed that it might be nominated for the foreign language category at the 2023 Oscars.  Screen Ireland gave a loan of &euro;350,000 for the film to be made.  The biggest employer in the State, who has had 19 DACs and has been in business since 1998, and his partner, who has been in business since 1984, are associated and subsidiary companies.  One of those partners drew down &euro;700,000 in a loan to make a film.  This man has been the recipient of a section 481 tax credit and since that was paid to the producers in 2015, this company and its two directors, whom I have described, have drawn down between &euro;89 million and &euro;264 million under section 481.</p></speech>

Having advocated for workers' rights as a shop steward, I am baffled by the no employees piece.</p> <p>  Mr. Arkins spoke about the constraints of section 481 and suggested the way to address these issues is to amend the order.  I would like to hear his opinion about an issue as I believe he is best placed to give an opinion.  I agree with Deputy Doherty that the way people have been treated is completely unacceptable.  What is the best way to deal with this issue?</p></speech>

Only 10% should be given and the company should be required to have in place all of the funding to make the production from elsewhere.  After three months, the Departments responsible for culture, finance and jobs should check the position and only give the remaining 90% when all of the boxes have been ticked.  That would safeguard taxpayers and workers and would build an industry.  That is the only and simplest way to do this.</p> <p>  We have outlined other ways to operate the section 481 tax credit.  We came up with the idea of using what was done in the Foynes pay office where various stevedore companies were coming in and people did not know if, when or where they were working.  We suggested that the money should be given straight to a company, which would look after employment, pensions, training, jobs and everything else.  This would ensure there was a structure in place but our suggestion was not taken on board.</p> <p>  We also suggested that everyone be paid for a flat 40-hour week and the stamps would continue to be paid when the production comes to an end.  Nobody would be in breach of legislation and so forth.  We have made 101 suggestions but the problem is that the person who got the money is not being asked the question.  We are talking about the Irish Government here.  It takes one official with a phone on his desk to make five phone calls because there are only five or six employers in the country.</p></speech>

I am not sure.  State aid rules mandate the Irish Government and all member state governments to produce a document listing all of the recipients of state aid, the amount they got, when they got it and every source from which they got it.  We do not know that.</p><p>RT&Eacute; has a production budget.  It sets aside &euro;40 million a year out of the licence fee to commission independent content.  The BAI gives a whole load of money.  The current capital spend for the film board is &euro;20 million.  TG4 has an obligation.  There are so many obligations it is very difficult to see where the funding goes and why.  If the Government were to say that I as a film producer received X amount under section 481 for, for example, "A Nice Boy", it might say that I got it from RT&Eacute; because that is where it will be shown.  I might have got some from the BBC.  We are speaking about a lot of State money.  State broadcasters in Luxembourg and other countries feed into this.  Canadian money is put in.  If we could find out where all the funding goes and why it goes there we would be able to establish how best to address the arts.  The entire arts sector is decimated, including musicians.  It is not just the film production sector.  Artists pay their taxes and we get something back because they satisfy audiences.  We get nothing back from the film production sector as far as I can see.</p></speech>

That way when the State wants to find out where the money has gone it could speak directly to them.  They are who the State should be talking to.  Section 481 funding is given specifically to people who have employees.  It is given to the producer as the employer.  No one else receives section 481 funding.  I, as a stagehand, cannot understand why the people with the &euro;4 billion are not being asked how many employees they have and what is their infrastructure.  One third of section 481 funding is for training, jobs and infrastructure.  Asking what has been done with it is a very simple question.</p></speech>

Let us imagine I am one of them and I apply for section 481 funding.  We all get the idea that there is the culture test and the industry development test.  There is meant to be quality employment and other factors.  What do I get as a percentage and on what basis do I get it?  I imagine I am meant to ensure I have other aspects of the funding sorted to deliver the project.</p></speech>

There are criteria.  There is a great big document that producers have to fill out with various sections and an undertaking at the end that they will adhere to all of the legislation.  It is on this basis that the Minister certifies the film.  It then goes to the Revenue Commissioners to be paid.</p></speech>

We do not quite know how it works.  A production or development loan of up to &euro;1 million can be obtained from the film board.  This has to be paid back on the first day of shooting of the film as I understand it.  I believe compliance is determined when the film DVD is delivered to the Revenue Commissioners with all of the accounts.  I am not sure how the Revenue Commissioners can ensure it is all perfectly okay.  This raises a major issue.  The phrase "stand down" is used in the industry.  If I lose my job after 20 years I am stood down.  Many of my members were stood down in August and November 2018.  That particular employer did not make another production until December 2019.  These people had been stood down for one year and four months by that time.  The employer did not re-employ them.  He blacklisted them.  I went to the Workplace Relations Commission which told me we were statute barred because these people should have taken a case on the day they knew it had happened.  People did not know it had happened because there was no termination letter.  Really and truly, we should be able to determine compliance after the six month time period for prosecuting a case runs out.</p></speech>

Approximately 40 films have been made over the past 50 years reflecting some of the culture of Ireland, nine or ten of which were in the Irish language.  The total value of section 481 relief for the production companies making Irish language productions in the period from 2015 to 2022 was &euro;120,000.  One of the companies, which I shall refer to as "Company B", serviced productions for multinational streaming platforms in addition to one-off film projects.  It drew down section 481 funding in the category of between &euro;89 million and &euro;264 million.  We know it is at the higher end of this category because we checked it ourselves.</p></speech>

I will refer to it as "Company B" and I will not mention the name.  Company B owns content in at least one streaming production.  It has also availed of supports available from Screen Ireland.  In 2021, Company B received a gift of &euro;650,000 from Screen Ireland to enable it to become a company of scale.  This company has also made submissions to the WRC, as we have mentioned already.  This is how section 481 funding is being used and what it is being used for.  If I can source this information from public websites so can anyone else.  We can provide this information on companies' submissions and what they state they are doing and not doing.  It is not us who are saying this.  This is what the companies are saying.</p></speech>

This DAC will last for the time it takes to make the production.  Within this are whatever costs are incurred.  We are not quite sure about the end product of this.  Whatever about what must be given to the Revenue Commissioners for ticking the boxes, we do not know who owns what intellectual property because the DAC no longer exists.  The tool that was used to draw down the money disappears and we have an entity that may or may not be worth a huge amount of money still in play.  The witnesses have spoken about materials that are bought that do not stay in play.  I imagine the entire idea of section 481 was to build up industry.</p></speech>

I was struck by something in the document produced by the Department of Finance on budget 2023.  The Minister stated that a new collective agreement had been agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, regarding construction crew.  Part of that collective agreement deals with pensions, but there is a significant issue with pensions, one that also has to do with state aid and Europe in general.  The agreement is an industry agreement that the Department says should make things equal, but it does not stand approved by the Labour Court.  Industry collective agreements were shot down by the Supreme Court as being unconstitutional.  The Deputy will recall the construction industry registered employment agreement, REA, and the catering agreement.  For example, National Electrical Contractors Ireland had a case.  Those bodies won their cases and the legislation was amended in 2012.  Now, we can have sectoral employment orders, but they must be approved by the Labour Court.  The Labour Court must take a great deal into consideration, for example, the amount and ratio of representation in an industry.  If there are 2,158 people, it will not take much to work out the ratio, but we must also take into account the added dimension of other member states.  If someone from another member state comes to Ireland, his or her terms and conditions of employment cannot be driven down because we have an agreement that is at the minimum rates of pay.  I believe our colleagues in Equity will speak to the committee about the UK agreements and how Irish actors fare worse here than equivalent actors who come from outside.</p> <p>  I am sorry for forgetting my train of thought, but I wished to say something to the Deputy relating to Mr. Arkins's point.  A construction industry pension has been set up for people who work on film productions.  I presume, if someone says he or she wants money to be deducted, it will be.  I inquired about that pension.  Guess whose name it is in.</p></speech>

At the end of their working lives, they will knock on the door of the CIF pension scheme and say they believe they have pensions there.

Is it an industry wherein the technology moves on quickly and there are specific projects that require specific technologies?  Is it an industry that is more used to a leasing system?  For example, many medical facilities use leasing systems because medical technology moves so quickly.</p></speech>

How can we have an industry if the people who are working in it have to get taxpayers' money to rehire or repurchase equipment time and again?</p></speech>

From Irish Equity, I welcome Mr. Gerry O'Brien, president, and Ms Michelle Quinn, sector organiser.</p> <p>    Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, Mr. O'Brien and Ms Quinn are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present may.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses that the remit of the committee is limited to the film relief tax credit expenditure.  The wider industry or sector is not within the remit of the committee and any issues or cases specific to individuals or companies should not be discussed at this session.  I invite Mr. O'Brien to make his opening statement on behalf of Irish Equity.</p></speech>

It has played a key role in the growth of the sector and in the creation of contract jobs for our crews, a whole new generation of animators and our members, the professional performers who populate the film and television productions that are produced in Ireland every year.</p> <p>  It is vital that we remember the most important stakeholder in section 481, namely, the taxpayer.  Section 481 is the investment of taxpayers and it must be protected and the return on that investment optimised.  With these stakeholders in mind, it is vital that the reputational, legal, and financial risks associated with the operation of section 481 are fully considered and effectively managed, and our full submission is chiefly concerned with these risks and how they can be managed.</p> <p>  For the purposes of this introduction, let us consider one of those risks.  In the same way that contracted crews are protected by a range of employment legislation, all performers and creatives are protected by that legislation, as well as by the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and the European copyright directive.  However, although productions must sign a statement to the effect that they will comply with relevant employment legislation to secure section 481 investment, the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and the EU copyright directive are not specifically listed in the statement.  This legislation must be listed and applied in full and the rights of the performer must not be contractually overridden.</p> <p>  Why is this important?  The real value of the film and television industry does not exist at the point of production.  Rather, it is contained in the copyright and intellectual property of all the parties contributing to the final product.  All performers own property rights under the copyright legislation.  These property rights have a financial value to those who own them, namely, the performers, and those who want them, namely, the producers.  The most important of these rights is the right to proportionate remuneration for the ongoing financial exploitation of the performance, as enshrined in Article 18 of the EU copyright directive.  In order to manage this legislative risk, adherence to copyright regulation must become an eligibility requirement for section 481 applicants, if section 481 is to be consistent with Irish and European legislation.  For the record, the protections provided by Articles 18 to 22, inclusive, of the European copyright directive state that the protection of authors and performers is the core principle that should inform the interpretation and implementation of said articles and that this principle implies that the articles have a binding nature and cannot be contractually overridden, except insofar as expressly permitted by the directive.  Article 18 vests the performer with the right to an appropriate and proportionate remuneration for the ongoing financial exploitation of his or her work.  What this means is that a small percentage of the worldwide revenue streams created by the ongoing sale of the production will find their way back to the performer.  The European Copyright Society, ECS, states that these provisions have to be interpreted in a strict manner and should not serve as ways to exclude some contracts or situations from the protective provisions, to the detriment of authors and performers.</p> <p>  It is a concern to us, and a growing legal and reputational risk to the audiovisual sector, that Irish actors are being contracted on lesser terms and conditions than their international colleagues, as well as being denied their copyright, even though both Irish and international performers are being part-funded by section 481 taxpayer investment.  To this end, section 481 must ensure that the Copyright and Related Rights Act and the EU copyright directive are implemented in full, that all agreements and contracts comply with the legislation protecting the rights of the artist, that there is greater transparency with regard to the assignment of performers&rsquo; property rights and their value to the end user as required by the Article 19 of the EU directive, and that indigenous Irish performers are engaged on terms and conditions equal to and not less than any other performer who qualifies under section 481.  These steps will ensure the performer will have some protection within the negotiating process.</p> <p>  One of the motivations behind section 481 is the creation of quality employment.</p><p>The Olsberg report on the film industry states: "Economic net benefit is a more comprehensive measurement than fiscal net benefit as it recognises that governments do not invest to benefit their treasuries, but rather on behalf of all citizens as a means to raise standards of living."  Section 481 must respect the rights of citizens protected under the copyright legislation and ensure that all performers share in the success of the industry in order that their incomes are increased and more of them enter the tax net.  Section 481 must ensure that all creatives thereby benefit from a rise in their standard of living and the creation of sustainable careers in an otherwise precarious environment.</p></speech>

We have already had quite an interesting debate.  It is great to have the witnesses here.</p> <p>  Regarding the point Mr. O'Brien made that the real value is not at the point of production but in the copyright and intellectual property that is created, I asked the following question of the previous panel but I want to talk to the witnesses before us about it as well.  According to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, "enforcement of an ... [intellectual property protection] is essential in order to preserve the legal validity of your IP rights, prevent infringement in order to avoid wholesale damage to you and your goods/service including loss of the goodwill and reputation and to seek compensation for actual damage caused."  Is the State failing in its obligations to protect the IP, or intellectual property, rights of all the parties involved in bringing a film or TV show to the screen?</p></speech>

We do not have a great reputation, I am afraid, for individual copyright and the protection of individuals' copyright.  We are more concerned with the copyright of large industry than, say, my particular copyright or the copyright of individual performers.  We do not have a great reputation in that field at all.</p></speech>

That is despite the main source of funding for Irish film and TV production having come through Screen Ireland, which has loaned a lot of money to filmmakers over many years.  How are we performing in respect of promoting competition and supporting those up-and-coming players?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.146" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#L00800"><p>There are two things.  First, you have to be very protective of where you invest the money.  It is quite understandable that you need reputable players, but when someone like a young filmmaker or a young writer comes along and has an idea, how do you invest in that idea and make sure that the person holds onto those rights or, if a new company is emerging, how do you make sure he or she has the opportunity to avoid having to give his or her rights away in order to access the funding available through the established companies?  We have a system that has been honed over, say, the past 25 years, and I am around long enough to have seen and to describe how the change has occurred.  There are about five or six major players and they are safe hands, as far as you are concerned, and you ensure that people have to give their rights to those players, but the question is how those rights are assigned.  If those players have all the power, they have the ability to make sure that the assignment of rights is not necessarily fair.  We have that problem and that imbalance, which was part of what the European copyright directive deliberately set out to change.  That directive was designed to recognise that individual performers and individual writers, when going to major production houses, do not have the leverage to create a fair environment for themselves.</p></speech>

That is interesting.</p><p>A number of years ago, quite serious claims Mel Gibson made were reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  The article stated that &quot;a production company attempted to defraud Ireland's tax authorities&quot;.  I am not making any claim in respect of that particular issue.  It was just something that involved the particular film.  In general, however, do the witnesses think the relief could have been used or was used at any point for aggressive tax avoidance?  Again, I am not referring to anyone in particular.</p></speech>

In any organisation where funding is available - and this goes right up and down any sort of funding, not just film funding - there will always be people who will attempt to take advantage of it.  We have to try to legislate and work against that.  By the way, Equity supports section 481.  Where the Government does something to try to increase the standard of living of its people, as the Olsberg report states, rather than necessarily adding to its coffers, there are people who will be in a position to control how those revenues go.  In the arts, in particular, because the most important asset to an artist is his or her copyright and intellectual property, there will always be that imbalance.  Then there is the ability of people in power to believe that they are doing right whereas they could actually be damaging the reputation and the government support.  We want to try to make sure that that is worked out.  Yes, there is a possibility.  I am not saying the practice is rampant, but in all government-supported industries, not just the film industry, we have a record of that going back.  We have to be careful, however.</p></speech>

If Ms Quinn wishes to comment, these questions are directed at both witnesses.  I will ask my final question and then the witnesses can both come in.  Ms Quinn may wish to respond on one of the other questions.</p> <p>  I note that Mr. O'Brien says he is not against section 481.  I would be interested in hearing who he thinks is the main beneficiary of it and who bears the biggest cost at the moment and how he feels it should actually work, that is, who the beneficiary should be and who should bear the main cost.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.152" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#L01400"><p>The answer to that is that we all should be the beneficiaries, but we are not at the moment.  I started my career 50 years ago.  I saw an Ireland where if I met somebody from the crew boasting that there was one film in Ardmore last year and that he or she worked on it, that was a bonus year, a bumper year, for people.  The growth in the past 25 or 30 years is down to the stimulus the Government has given.  I have not seen an increase in the quality of life of the performers or the crew to a great degree, and that is down to negotiations and a lot of other factors.  We work extraordinarily hard.  People see the red carpet.  They do not see the hard work, the 5 a.m. calls, the long hours and the 11-hour days.  They do not see all the work that goes into creating those 90 minutes on the screen.  Everybody should benefit.</p> <p>  Now, when I say the real wealth does not exist at the point of production, that is where the hard work exists.  The real wealth exists in the distribution globally.  You can have a &euro;1 million, &euro;10 million or &euro;100 million financial bomb in a certain location, but the real wealth then lies in the &euro;800 million, &euro;900 million or &euro;1 billion in revenue that is generated from that.  If we had, as our colleagues in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England and in the US and Canada have, a proportionate remuneration, as stated in the EU directive, from those revenue streams making their way back to us, we would all benefit from the success of the industry.  We need to have two sectors here.  We have the point of production, where we need fair play, fair hours and the working time Act.  Then we have the copyright Act.  That is the part where actors make their living, and that has been denied to Irish actors.  I cannot say, therefore, that everybody is benefiting equally.</p></speech>

We must also, however, have due regard to the sustainability of the industry.  Within that comes a requirement to make the industry sustainable for all stakeholders, including those workers who participate within it.</p><p>Currently, that is not always the case, which is regrettable.  It is about sustainability of the industry and sustainability for all.  We need to have due regard to the maximisation of taxpayers' investment.  We are all taxpayers and we all have a vested interest in ensuring we maximise that investment, for obvious reasons.</p><p> The third point, from my perspective, is we need to ensure there are quality jobs within the industry.  There are a number of hallmarks of quality jobs but, sadly, at present some of those hallmarks are not visible to us and certainly not enjoyed by our members.  It is a dynamic industry and section 481 plays a significant part in attracting interest on the island of Ireland, but we see absolutely no reason that our members should have to work for lesser terms and conditions than our colleagues in the Six Counties.  If performers and crew are performing to the same standard, then we believe the rate of pay should reflect that.  We welcome further scrutiny of section 481, its criteria and compliance with it because in order for the industry to benefit in its totality from that section it has to ensure that all stakeholders benefit.</p><p> I am not suggesting for a moment that every stakeholder would benefit equally but they should benefit proportionally.  If we can do that, then our members will believe that our industry will be the richer for that and sustainability will automatically be achieved because it will continue to be a vibrant industry where we can hold our head up and say it is sustainable, and we see the benefit of section 481 and of taxpayers' money.  The true measure of that will be the quality of jobs within the industry for performers and crew alike.  The only true measurement of that is how our members fare.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped that what they described will be an eye-opener for people.  We all agree, as they do, that we want to see continued State support for film, the arts and culture but we want it to benefit performers, actors and crews.  They are telling us that support is not doing as it should in respect of that.</p> <p>  To put it bluntly, and I asked this at a previous meeting, would the representatives agree we are in breach of the legislation regarding copyright?  The way in which it is now being operated by producers means that we are quite simply in breach of copyright legislation and the similar directives from which that legislation flows - the witnesses can probably clarify that.  There is a problem here with legal compliance, which is then seriously disadvantaging - I could probably use stronger words - performers from getting the value of the work they have done.  One question I have in that regard is to ask the Irish Equity representatives to spell out the buy-out contract business and the pressure its members are put under to get work that means they have to, in many cases, in effect sign away their rights to their intellectual property, and the value of their performances as tied up in copyright and intellectual property.  I suspect many people do not know this.  Maybe they could elaborate a little on that point.  I have a couple of other questions but maybe they could start with that.</p> <p>  Related to that, what do they think those working in the UK or other jurisdictions think about the conditions Irish Equity members have to endure here?  Are they shocked when they encounter what is going on for its members here?</p></speech>

I have worked in Los Angeles, other parts of America, London and all over England.  When I mention the type of contracts we sign here, there is an audible gasp from my acting colleagues in those countries.  They are genuinely concerned that the sort of buy-out contract that exists here is allowed to exist.  In the US, the industry is the success it is because there was a tough union that fought for the exploitation rights of its performers, and went on strike for those rights through the years, when those things were easier to do.  They went on strike and they fought for those rights.  It was the same in the UK.  Up to a point in Ireland, we were mimicking what was going in the UK because I also worked under that regime as regards film contracts.  People there are actually shocked.  I will reference one sentence in an agreement without identifying anyone because it appears across a tranche of contracts for actors.  It states that it is an agreement that is not subject to the jurisdiction of any guild, labour or collective bargaining unit agreement, and covers the engagement of the artist by the producer of the film for the compensation set forth with said compensation being inclusive of all buy-outs in all media now known or hereafter devised in all territories in perpetuity.</p> <p>  For an agreed figure, an actor will get a fee that is broken down into two sections.  One section is the performance fee, which is what the actor gets for turning up, creating the performance and doing the job at God knows what hour and in what location.  It is done, made and recorded.  There is then what is called a usage fee, which is made up of various percentages for the different platforms that exist.  It sounds complicated but it is not.  It involves taking 280% and adding that.  If an actor's performance fee is &euro;100, then another &euro;280 is added and that fee becomes &euro;380.  People think an actor is making that for a day's work but the trick is to divide it by 50 because that is the number of years actors own that property.  It is vested in the performer for 50 years.  It then begins to break down quite a lot.  That fee is for all the platforms.  If we then take every single DVD sale for a year, and everything right down, including all the downloads, all the sales to television, all the programmes on American and UK television and all the European television stations, etc., that contract has bought all those rights for &euro;380, or &euro;600, &euro;500 or &euro;700.  Once it is a buy-out, it does not matter what other calculations are put on it.  There is a ten year buy-out and a buy-out in perpetuity.  Once there is a buy-out, there is no variability allowed in what actors get for the exploitation of their work, and where no variability exists there can be no proportionality.  It used to be equitable remuneration but none of that can exist for actors.</p> <p>  I will leave the details vague, but I looked at a very large production that received quite a large amount of money from the taxpayer and broke it down in that way.  The performance fee broke down to &euro;394.73 for a week.  That was a 55-hour week, however, so it worked out at approximately &euro;7.17 per hour for those performers.  The usage fee was &euro;1,105 for a buy-out in perpetuity.  When we start to break it down over 50 years, etc., it ends up at 42 cent a week for everything globally, including all the DVD sales, all the television transmissions, all the streaming platforms and everything else.  It does not matter where it is sold; that is what the actor gets.  It is contained within that &euro;1,000 so it can never get better but can only get smaller.  A ruling was made a long time ago that I read on a lawyer's website - unfortunately, I read these things instead of scripts now - which stated that any contract that does not have a variable component to it cannot therefore allow equitable remuneration to take place.  That is the phrasing from the copyright Act.  There is a section that actually covers performance rights within the legislation.</p> <p>  What an actor is given is a document that says the actor agrees that is what is in this contract is proportionate and adequate.  An actor will sign that and sign away all his or her rights without fully understanding what they are and what value they have.</p><p>There is a whole generation of actors coming up in Ireland who have never seen a residual payment of a structured nature in their contract.  That is a loss to our community.  From that point of view, the Olsberg report is failing because it is not raising the standard of living within the cultural community.  This is the biggest investment by the State in our industry and in the lives of actors.</p><p> I know actors who say they will not work on a film because they cannot afford it.  It used to be that we would not do theatre work because we could not afford it and film was our saviour, but now we cannot afford it.  That is the situation we are in.  I hope that helps to explain it.</p></speech>

It is a very stark picture and rather a depressing one, with all of this public money going in.  I will fire a few more questions at Mr. O'Brien before my time runs out and I hope he can come back on them, and I know Ms Quinn also wants to come in.  I understood from hearing what was said earlier that one contrast is that if someone is working on a film in Ireland just for a few days, they might then be laid off and they would have to go back on social welfare, and they might then come in for another few days and go back on social welfare again, whereas in the UK, people actually get paid throughout the period.  That seems like a big contrast and perhaps Mr. O'Brien can spell out that.</p> <p>  Second, what happens to an actor who says, &ldquo;I do not want to sign the buy-out contract&rdquo;?  When they do sign it, who ends up with the value of their intellectual property?  Who walks off with it?  The DAC ceases to exist after a year, so who actually goes off with all the money?  As well as the actors getting back some of the money they should be getting, should the State be getting back some of that money because of its investment through section 481?  Who actually gets it?</p> <p>  Irish Equity mentioned in its longer submission that there was potential abuse of tax credits through a range of practices, including internal pricing and artificially depressed income strategies, which sounds pretty ominous.  The witnesses might spell out what that means.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to signing on and signing off.  The UK film industry has what is called a guaranteed period of work, which is an actor's first core period of work.  If actors have a six-week job on a film, they may be booked from 1 January right through to the middle of February, where the first week is a full week and they get paid for that, and in the second week they might do three days and they get paid for that.  In the third week, they might just do one day.  It has been worked out that someone might not survive with what he or she is going to get for one day, so there is a negotiated supplemental payment that applies to the week where the person works only one day, because he or she is losing out on potential signing-on days.  There may also be a week where the person does not work, and there is a supplemental payment for that.</p> <p>  What the film company is doing is engaging and employing someone for the full length, from week one of the actor&rsquo;s first call until the last week of the first call.  It is divided into seven-day periods and, for example, the first seven-day period could start on Wednesday and finish on a Wednesday, and they work it that way.  With good scheduling, it works for the producer and if the scheduling is loose but they still need you for the film, it works for you.  What that does is it prevents the producer&rsquo;s scheduling needs being subsidised again by social welfare, and it also means the actor will be engaged and employed for a longer period.  The supplemental payments are not much more than, say, whatever the actor&rsquo;s negotiated minimum performance rate would be.  That is sometimes capped, so it is not a huge amount but is enough to be a bit more than the social welfare.  That means the actor will have six weeks of contributions rather than broken contributions of maybe one day a week, or whatever.  That benefits the State because the State is not subsidising the scheduling needs of the production or the television series and it is taking people away from that, so that is a good thing.  It benefits the performer later on because he or she will have those credits.</p> <p>  As to who owns the rights, that is the $64 million question.  When I sign my rights into the DAC, there is no written information for me as to where they go, and they could go anywhere because rights can be assigned anywhere.  It is just a line on a page that all rights are assigned to this company, and the company can assign it on and on.  It is generally an end-user who will get it.  In the case of the big streaming companies, they want all of the rights, even from the producers, so that is a difficult area.  We are both suffering there.  It is just that we are suffering a bit more when the producers are doing it to us.</p> <p>  As to what happens to the rights, they have a value, as I said, and whoever owns them, that is where the revenue stream will go.  It says in the copyright Act that the benefit of those rights goes to whoever they are assigned to, so how they are assigned is important.  Therefore, at the contract level, it has to be stated, &ldquo;If this much is made, a percentage is coming back here, and there will be so many transmissions on television&rdquo; and so on.  All of those are worked into the document that should be the basis of the film agreement or television agreement and the industry agreement.  As to what happens to the rights, as I said, I do not know.</p></speech>

I had asked what happens to actors and performers who do not want to sign a buy-out contract?  How likely are they to get work if they were to say something like that?  I asked the question about something in the executive summary of Irish Equity's main submission which our committee should certainly take very seriously.  It pointed out that the risks with section 481 include potential abuse of the tax credit through a range of practices, including internal pricing and artificially depressed income strategies.  That sounds quite ominous.  It made similar references to problems with the entire DAC structure and a potential for abuse within the DAC structure.  I would like to get elaboration on that.</p></speech>

He asked what happens to workers or performers who do not sign the contract.  The likelihood is that they will lose the opportunity of that employment should they fail to sign on the dotted line.  That is the sad reality of the situation, I am reliably informed by our members.</p> <p>  Rightly or wrongly our members are of the view that the directive as it currently exists does not provide the full protections that it might.  They have that view because the buy-out in Ireland is the norm whereas the intention of the directive is that the buy-out would be the exception rather than the rule.  Article 19 covers transparency.  Regrettably, we are not able to say whether the remuneration is fair, equitable and proportionate because we simply do not have the level of transparency to be able to answer that question.  However, people are being asked in some cases to irrevocably sign away their rights for the privilege of working.</p></speech>

I will initially ask two questions together.  What are the strengths and weaknesses of the section 481 tax credit?  Beside section 481, what other changes are necessary in a budgetary context within the industry?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#Q00700"><p>The strength of section 481 is that it provides the biggest investment in the cultural sector in Ireland.  It is very important to all our crews, animators and actors who get work.  That is the strength.  It also has a very significant soft diplomatic benefit to Ireland because foreign producers and actors like to come here.  It spreads the name of Ireland all around.  As I said in my opening statement, there is a reputational risk.  We have a great reputation for caring about our artists, writers etc.  However, when issues are mentioned about the engagement of artists and the protection of their rights, people abroad may say, "Now we have a problem."  Our reputation is tarnished by not allowing our actors to be treated equally on the open market, as every other performer is.  That is one of the weaknesses.</p> <p>  The strength is that it provides employment.  We just need to make sure that it is, as the legislation states, quality employment, that it is sustainable and that it raises everybody's standard of living.  That is what we need to strengthen.  We do that by applying the legislation rigorously.  As stated in the EU directive, there must be no deviation from the protection for performers in office.  Those are the weaknesses.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what we need to do from a budgetary point of view.  We have suggested it.  The legislation is there and it needs to be applied.</p><p>I want to say this.  I am speaking as president of a union, Equity, but this does not only apply to members of the union.  It is not about that because it does not say that proportionate remuneration must go to members of Irish Equity.  This is about the rights of Irish citizens.  They are the people who are investing in the film industry and their return must be the quality employment.  They must ensure that we will not lose our talent by going abroad constantly.  We are told we have to look to Los Angeles and we have to look to London.  We can look to here.  We have a beating heart of creativity and we must protect that within this industry.  If one sucks it dry, there is no industry; there is just a shell.  We have to put that dignity of fair employment back into the heart of that industry.  That is what I would suggest.  The legislation is there; apply it.</p></speech>

What kind of changes and how specifically might they be supported?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.174" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#R00300"><p>First of all, the producers are looking for some more leeway within the grant.  That is important.  We would have to look at how we protect - I will go back to the copyright legislation - because that is the value or the gold.  That has to bring revenue streams that are going on locally back into this jurisdiction because it has its own wall that has been built around it and revenue streams are diverted everywhere except to here.</p> <p>  In doing what we suggest, it means that the investment is not attached to any local company.  It is attached to the film itself and to those revenue streams.  One has to make sure that even where producers would have such revenue streams, any copyright they have which is raised through the investment of section 481 must come back to this jurisdiction and has to be registered here.  Those would increase the value to the State and to the cultural sector.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Michelle Quinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#R00500"><p>If I could interject in relation to the benefits of section 481, it undoubtedly supports the industry in terms of tax concessions and we welcome that.  The downside is that it needs to be sustainable for everyone and currently the performers and crew are not benefiting to the extent they should in relation to sustainability.  Clearly, if a person is not able to survive within the industry in terms of earnings, in reality, it is not sustainable for him or her.  That is a real concern for me.</p> <p>  In relation to what we can do on the budgetary front, greater scrutiny of compliance with the criteria of section 481 would help considerably to ensure a more level playing field in the first instance.  It would also reduce the risk of reputational damage.</p> <p>  In relation to the taxpayer, if the directive on copyright and buy-out was being used as the exception rather than the rule, as, we believe, was intended by the directive, that would also maximise investment for the taxpayer because it would bring somewhere in the region of 500 to 1,000 people into the tax net who are not currently within it because they do not have earnings to justify their inclusion.  It would also reduce or remove the need for reliance on additional social welfare payments for people within the industry.  There would be a win-win situation for the taxpayer and the industry in terms of sustainability for all stakeholders and this would ensure a standard of living for the performers and crew that is proportionate to what they bring to the industry.</p></speech>

I also thank the committee for dealing with this issue.</p> <p>  I understand that Irish Equity supports section 481, albeit with a significant number of caveats.  Anybody listening in on this would have significant worries and caveats in relation to section 481.  In fairness, Mr. O'Brien largely dealt with the issue of copyright.  Ms Quinn backed him up in the sense that if one does not sign, one does not get working.  That is hardly fair.  Obviously, legislation seems to be the only means of dealing with a proper protection from the point of view that the directive is not sufficiently strong to cut the mustard.</p> <p>  If we could deal with section 481, something Mr. O'Brien said that we dealt with to an extent previously is the possibility of, for the want of a better term, fraud and the need to curtail this.  Mr. O'Brien might give a general outline in that regard.  Also, a good point made was that we are talking about securing the taxpayers' investment where people understand that to provide a return.  It is not only a working sustainable industry and we are talking about intellectual property and a net result in some cases which will have a valuable stream of revenue.  It would make sense, if the State invested, that it also got moneys back.  These could be moneys that are used to make the overall industry more sustainable and to ensure we have an adequate supply of actors and crew who are looked after properly.  We will not be able to produce many great films if we do not have those two anyway.</p></speech>

I am not saying anybody is doing anything criminal, illegal or anything like that, but there is a stretch on how one costs things, how one values them and how they give a return.  There is a phrase in the accounting world where there is accountancy and then there is Hollywood accounting.  The joke goes - I forget which writer said it - that the most creative aspect of the film industry is, in fact, the accounting.  One has to be very careful in anything that one supports with other people's money.  I believe I am speaking not only on behalf of actors but on behalf of the taxpayers because, as I said, it is their investment.  It does not belong to the producers or to the actors; it belongs to us, the taxpayers.  We have to be satisfied that all legislation is spot on and everything is valued correctly.  If one has a multiplicity of DAC companies springing up and then ending, one does not know where any of those assets are going and that is where one gets the possible suppression of value.</p> <p>  The big suppression of value is in the value of the performers and that has gone on for 30 years.  For example, I worked on an American contract in 2006 and I am still adding $3,000 a year to my tax return here in Ireland because the revenue comes in to this jurisdiction to me.  The Olsberg report does not state we want to measure fiscal improvements.  It wants to look at the net benefit.  If one has actors earning those residual payments and they are protected, they are taxed here in this jurisdiction.  If you protect all creators of copyright, and copyright goes across everybody, not only performers but also our writers, the screenwriters should be getting this.  The cinematographers, producers and directors all have an intellectual investment in the industry.  We also have to make sure of it for our own cultural sector, the Irish film industry itself, not the service industry to the big global streaming networks and the big US studios.  It is a great benefit to them and that is a great boon to us.  We have to make sure that we get our share of the global revenue streams of that.  That is how it works.</p><p>It means there is a raising of standards of living and the actor is not constantly dependent on handouts.  I mentioned the excellent basic income scheme.  There is more dignity to an actor getting a cheque through the door as validation for his work than having to depend on something given to him because he is so poor.  It gives dignity back to the actor and that is lacking at the moment.  There is a huge lack of dignity at the core of this industry.  I hope that helps to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question and helps him to understand.</p></speech>

For that intellectual investment, it is about ensuring intellectual payment for the likes of Mr. O'Brien, as well as for the taxpayer, rather than the money going into a DAC, the DAC disappearing and the value being owned by an entity we are not sure of.  We should make sure we do the due diligence so actors are looked after, as well as the taxpayer, and ensure we have a sustainable industry with the money we are putting in.</p></speech>

On any suggestion of impropriety, we are not suggesting that is reflective of the industry.

It is really worthwhile.  I welcome the use of the word "sustainability" because part of the reason we are having these sessions is that we want to see in this country an ecosystem of Irish talent that upholds a self-sustaining industry involving Irish writers, Irish actors and the whole gamut of skills.</p> <p>  It strikes me from the conversation today that it is not just contracts and tax but also work, training and a huge spectrum of stuff included under section 481.  We talk a great deal about oversight at this committee.  What would Irish Equity identify as the key bodies in industry oversight if checks and balances were to be taken on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022100500002#S00800"><p>We touched on that in our submission.  If Revenue is involved, we should have a contact for Revenue because the industry is financially complex and at times there is a misunderstanding as to its purpose.  Is it for profit for a handful of privately-owned SMEs or is it for what it is supposed to be for, which is to stimulate employment, growth and expertise?</p> <p>  Valuing of property is something that should interest Revenue.  Many years ago I had a conversation with an actor who said &ldquo;Gerry, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind paying loads of tax.  Could you imagine what I&rsquo;d be earning?&rdquo;  If that sort of value is put back into individuals in our industry and community, then we should have a liaison with Revenue because that is the body putting money in on behalf of the taxpayer.</p> <p>  On training and infrastructure, there is an over-reliance on cheap labour using interns and trainees, and that can overpopulate a situation.  We have to get back to the balance.  One of the great things I had as a young actor was working with older actors who were hugely experienced.  That is where I gained most of my experience.  It is the same for crews working in a specific area like film because there are nuances to what they do.  They say such a person is a carpenter but a carpenter for a house has different skills to a guy building a set for a film.  It has to be ensured experience is married to upcoming writers, directors, performers, carpenters, crew and electricians, so they all benefit from the experience.  The over-reliance on trainees, interns, etc.,  is something we should watch and be careful of.</p></speech>

There is a strong desire among our members, whether in film and entertainment as crew, performers, etc., to do right by the industry in the most honest terms; there is a corresponding desire for the industry to do right by our members.</p> <p>  A mechanism we could use going forward is a stakeholder forum where we would legitimately look at how we collectively as stakeholders in the industry can extract more benefit from section 481 across the board.  There is a fruitful and worthwhile discussion to be had, although a hard discussion is needed concerning putting in additional protections to ensure the maximum benefit from the section for taxpayers, workers and other stakeholders.  I would welcome that opportunity if it arose.</p></speech>

It should have happened but never did and we are the worse for it.  It should happen as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  The DAC structure seems incredibly problematic.  They are like mushrooms jumping up and down.  They appear, disappear and make the whole thing opaque.  You do not know where your intellectual property rights are gone.  Nobody quite knows who the employer is.  Nobody wants a cent less going into film; in fact, I think we want all the money going into section 481 and more to go into stimulating the sort of industry witnesses have described and would like to see, with dignity for all involved and experience, gelling into a growing and developing industry.  It seems to me the DAC structure and the way we are funding via section 481 militate against that.  If there were a model that had the same amount or more but that did not go through this opaque, complex structure and was done in another way, maybe more directly funded, might that not be better?  Connected to that, would we learn a bit from talking directly to film producers?  We have never had a chance to talk to them in all of this.

We would welcome any mechanism other than the current one, as long as it brings more transparency, accountability and equal treatment of all stakeholders.  If that means that we have to look at a new model, then it is within the gift of a stakeholder group or forum to do just that and I would welcome that opportunity.  As to where that conversation might take us, it is up to the parties and the stakeholders within that forum to determine the destination but we would certainly wish to be part of the journey.  We have a responsibility to the taxpayer, to our members and to the industry to do nothing less than a thorough piece of work on how we make 481 even better than it is currently.  If we collectively achieve that for the industry, that will be a good day's work.</p></speech>

The 481 system was simply a tool of convenience really.  It worked for a period but we are now seeing the problems in it.  We did not look too far down the road initially but it actually prevents the provisions of article 19 on transparency, which is demanded by the EU directive, from occurring.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is quite right that the DAC disappears and there is no tracking.  I spoke to my friends in England who had a similar incident with what they call special purpose vehicle, SPV, company that closed down.  They lost all of the deeds of title to where the rights went but they managed to reopen it.  The DAC was not just gone; they managed to reinvigorate it and got their settlement for the actors.  It was quite a substantial settlement and it was agreed on the steps of the court because they did not want us to pursue where the DAC had gone.  It is a flawed tool and it was a tool of convenience.  I agree that we could probably look at a better structure but it is the only one we have now.  To mitigate it, we simply have to go back to legislation and make sure that the EU directive on transparency applies to the DAC at the point where it is being wound up.  We have to know where everything is going.  It has to be presented to us in writing.</p></speech>

The Irish contribution to the conference over the course of its year-long proceedings was significant and influential and I would like to thank this committee for all of its work, the Oireachtas Members who took part in the conference plenary sessions, including Deputies Richmond and &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, and the members of the public, civil society and political parties in Ireland who engaged.  <br/><br/>The final conference report sets out 49 proposals for consideration based on over 320 interesting and innovative measures and recommendations debated during the conference and spanning virtually the entire spectrum of EU activity.  EU leaders briefly discussed the results of the conference at the June European Council, noting the proposals and recommendations and requesting each institution to follow up in accordance with its own competences.  Since the final report was published, both the European Council and the Commission have published assessments on the proposals and have expressed the view that the vast majority of the proposals can be implemented, if agreed, through existing policies without the need to reopen the European treaties. <br/><br/>Arising from its assessment, the European Commission intends to implement some of the recommendations within the framework of the Commission work programme for 2023 and President von der Leyen outlined the Commission&rsquo;s intentions in her State of the Union address to the European Parliament last month.  A number of Commission proposals for the year ahead stem directly from conference recommendations including, for example, a new initiative on mental health, revision of animal welfare legislation, a legislative proposal for a European disability card and a raw materials Act, among others.  President von der Leyen also outlined Commission plans to make greater use of citizens&rsquo; panels in the legislative process, primarily as a sounding board for future proposals. <br/><br/>The European Parliament, for its part, also adopted a resolution last June calling for the convening of a convention in order to follow up on conference recommendations and proposing a number of treaty amendments, primarily in relation to providing for greater use of qualified majority voting, QMV, in decision making.  On the basis of advice provided by the Council's legal services, a further resolution will require to be adopted by the European Parliament formally setting out any precise amendments being proposed to the treaties and which have been formally adopted and approved by the Parliament&rsquo;s constitutional affairs committee. <br/><br/>The Council, for its own part, has now begun its assessment of the conference proposals and recommendations, with an initial discussion at the informal General Affairs Council in Prague in July and again at last month&rsquo;s General Affairs Council in Brussels.  For the moment, most Council members concur with our analysis that the EU&rsquo;s immediate focus should centre on progressing those proposals, constituting approximately 95% of the conference recommendations, which can be realised within the parameters of the existing treaty framework.  Discussion has also begun within the Council on some of the more difficult recommendations arising from the conference process, including in the area of voting and decision-making, while the Czech Presidency has also been canvassing views on whether there is support within the Council for the convening of a convention to initiate a process of treaty change. <br/><br/>Addressing this latter issue first, committee members will be aware that President von der Leyen, in her State of the Union address, lent the Commission&rsquo;s support to the calls for a convention.  Nationally, the Taoiseach, when addressing the European Parliament in June, said that the Government remains open to the possibility of treaty change if this proves necessary but for the moment believes, like most others in the Council, that the initial emphasis should be on implementing the vast majority of conference recommendations which can be done so within the existing treaty framework. <br/><br/>On the call for greater use of QMV, this is an issue which already commanded much attention during conference proceedings as it is clearly highly relevant in terms of any consideration of how to improve both the effectiveness of EU decision making and its standing as an international actor.  Some member states have already indicated that they are open to the possibility of making greater use of QMV, particularly in relation to areas such as Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP.  From discussions to date within the Council, the majority of member states, and particularly smaller member states, would be more cautious about any proposal to make greater use of QMV. <br/><br/>Nationally, a cross-government exercise overseen by the Department of Foreign Affairs is now under way in which Departments are submitting their views on the numerous conference proposals and recommendations relevant to their area.  While our overall position on this issue still remains to be formalised, it is fair to say that there would be some considerable hesitancy about any greater use of QMV, particularly in areas such as the CFSP or in relation to taxation issues.  The possibility for greater use of QMV is one which already exists within the treaties in the form of a quite extensive series of <i>passerelle</i>or bridge clauses already provided for.  It is likely that much of the focus in Council discussions in the coming months will centre on these <i>passerelle</i>clauses and whether there might be a willingness to make greater use of these provisions, which could be done within the existing treaty framework. <br/><br/>Turning to the work of the General Affairs Council, in which I know Members take an interest, I represented Ireland at its last meeting on 20 September in Brussels.  Our main item of discussion was preparation for the European Council meeting on 20 and 21 October where the focus will be very much on the immediate challenges of Ukraine, energy and the overall economic situation.  We also received updates from the Czech Presidency on its priorities for its presidency and from Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efovi on the current state of EU-UK relations, which I will be happy to address separately at this meeting.  We also discussed the 2022 strategic foresight report and the Commission&rsquo;s letter of intent which will help in the preparation of the 2023 Commission work programme.  Finally, the Council held its annual and important horizontal discussion on rule of law focusing on judicial independence and media pluralism.  <br/><br/>T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta, m&aacute;s mian leis na comhalta&iacute;, ceisteanna a th&oacute;g&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I am sure he will join me in expressing sympathy to the family of Mr. Rory Mason from Dunboyne who was tragically killed while fighting for Ukraine last month.  I listened to the tribute paid by his father this morning.  He said that Rory had a deep sense of right and wrong and an inability to turn the other way.  He was obviously a very admirable young man.  We should pay tribute to him and extend our sincere sympathy to his family.</p> <p>  On the Conference on the Future of Europe, the Minister has moved the debate on as regards the convention on treaty change with his comments this morning.  There are calls to look at switching from unanimity to QMV, strengthening EU competencies in health and energy, incorporating the pillar of social rights into the treaties and providing the European Parliament with a right of legislative initiative.  I also note the Minister of State's comments that the General Affairs Council considered that 95% of the conference proposals can be implemented without treaty change.  What the Minister of State has outlined here is a cautious approach to treaty change.  While Ireland is certainly open to such change, it needs to be proven that it is necessary.  We need to consider it carefully because it may require a referendum if there is to be treaty change.  I recall listening to a discussion recently at a European Movement Ireland event, where the Taoiseach gave an address to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Ireland's referendum on accession to the European Union.  He was asked a question about treaty change and he said that if member states are objecting, they are doing so for very valid national reasons on many occasions.  He said it would be far preferable to get a consensus on these issues and generally speaking, consensus can be arrived at.  The way the European Union does its business is a bit cumbersome and it is not pretty but eventually, consensus is arrived at.  I agree with the Minister of State's comments here this morning.  Am I right in saying that the Irish would be open to treaty change but quite cautious and that it is not an immediate priority?  </p> <p>  Citizens' panels were another issue that arose from the Conference on the Future of Europe.  What is Ireland's position on citizens' panels?  Are we open to that concept of participatory democracy and so on?  Is that something we will be pushing at EU level?</p></speech>

I read what his dad said - it was lovely.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is providing consular assistance.  The family has asked for privacy, so I had better leave it at that.  They are going through a difficult period and they have my deepest sympathies.  May he rest in peace.<br/><br/>Regarding treaty change, the Deputy has essentially set out our position, but I do not sense much appetite for it around the table at European meetings.  It is not on colleagues' immediate agenda overall.  The Taoiseach has stated that he is open to it, particularly in terms of a health competence, but everyone who is open to it has a different reason.  Most would probably agree with expanding health competence provided it was suitable, but others have different priorities.  There is much more discussion of the <i>passerelle</i>clauses in the treaties, so I urge the committee to examine those.  We are examining them and I believe it is on them that there will be discussion.  People feel that treaty change would require a great deal of work.  For example, we would not be the only country that would need to hold a referendum.  Most people are framing the difficulties and administrative issues in reaching consensus at the European table in terms of enlargement.  They are not saying that it is something that needs to be done urgently to stop a current problem.<br/><br/>To those who find this position difficult or believe that we should be getting rid of vetoes or using more qualified majority voting, unanimity is important.  It protects national interests, but it also protects European interests.  When dealing with important issues that we need consensus on, the EU can speak with a greater voice when all of its members come together.  Look at what we have already achieved with unanimity.  We achieved a massive recovery fund post Brexit and we have had to work via consensus on the issue of vaccines.  We have achieved a significant amount.  Take the sanctions package as an example.  A point I make repeatedly is that it is always difficult to negotiate a sanctions package.  Through unanimity, though, we have achieved a great deal in that regard.  Ireland has always been at the forefront of trying to get the maximum possible sanctions.  There was speculation last week about the EU being divided and breaking up because of the package of sanctions on Russia.  As we have seen from yesterday and today, the negotiations are still ongoing, but it certainly looks like ambassadors will be able to agree another package of sanctions on Russia unanimously.<br/><br/>Unanimity has achieved a great deal for us and we should not dismiss it.  We protect our national interests.  It is not just Ireland that has specific national interests.  Every member state of the EU has particular interests that are important to it - quirks in terms of its membership or something that other people do not understand or do not face as issues themselves.  We must ensure that the democratic legitimacy of the EU is to the fore.  We have done that successfully so far.<br/><br/>Citizens' panels can be a good idea.  It is fair to say that other member states view the Irish citizens' assembly as the way to go.  The two main reasons for this are that our assemblies are usually on specific topics and they are informed by experts.  A general citizens' panel would be a waste, but if we had panels on specific topics that we might otherwise struggle for consensus on, they would work well.  They would have to be informed by experts.  We are open to the idea of panels.  The Irish example is one that the other member states want to follow.</p></speech>

The Minister of State was very engaged, and not just from an Irish point of view.  He attended many of the meetings.  We shared flights and the odd coffee during the process.</p> <p>  I am taken by how 95% of the recommendations can already be implemented without even considering treaty change.  Something that struck me was that, be it through the work of the working groups or committees within the conference or through plenary, so many of the issues that were cited were ones that the EU was already working on more broadly.  This pointed out the communications deficit and was nothing new.  As I have said a million times, the EU has been great for quite some time in paying people who give out about it, such as Mr. Nigel Farage, but perhaps not so great in focusing on what it is doing and how people can engage with the process.  I was taken by the citizens' panels and the number of people who travelled to various parts of the EU, including Strasbourg.  People gave up their weekends to go to Strasbourg for four days and engage with the panels.  They deserve a great deal of respect because their contributions were valid.</p> <p>  Despite the difficulties that Covid presented, the exercise that was the Conference on the Future of Europe was the real lesson.  How can we have more of these conferences and how do we use this exercise to feed into the European decision-making process?  We are unique.  We are right on the westerly edge of the EU and, generally, our MEPs come home every week.  Our Commissioner has been home a great deal in recent months, as have other Irish figures at European level.  There has been engagement by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  That is not necessarily the case in member states with list systems where MEPs only return to their homes for green weeks.  How do we communicate that these exercises are happening?  Perhaps the lesson is that these exercises are not happening quickly enough or that people are not feeling their impact.</p> <p>  This brings me to the debate on treaty change and, more specifically, QMV.  The Minister of State mentioned that we would not be the only member state that would require a referendum if there was treaty change.  Is there any other member state that has an automatic requirement?  The Danes have usually reached back to that.  QMV is discussed at the level of high politics.  It is the major topic of debate in the institutional discussion, particularly at Council level, but are we explaining to people how this issue makes a difference to their lives?  My take-away from the conference is that many issues that are important at European level get taken away into the world of acronyms and so on and information about how they make people's lives better and why it is important that we are part of the EU get lost on the journey.  We might discuss whether we need to consider QMV or how important QMV would be in agreeing sanctions, but is it the greatest issue for European citizens?</p> <p>  I will conclude with a question on the European Council, as the Minister of State and I could speak for hours on the Conference on the Future of Europe if we were given latitude to do so.  That would even be before we involved Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; - that would be another ten hours.  Given what was put together for Brexit and Covid, what preliminary discussions have there been on European-level financial packages to support member states, including Ireland but most likely those in the east of the EU, in dealing with the challenges that the looming winter will bring due to the impact of Russia's war in Ukraine?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022100500002#D00400"><p>Regarding the conference, the Commission and the Council have published a list of conclusions and how they can be implemented.  I assume that their documents are publicly available.  They go issue by issue and set out how the recommendations can be implemented.</p> <p>  For some people, it is always someone else's responsibility, but it is all of our responsibility to highlight the good things that the EU does.  There are certain things that can immediately be attached to the EU, for example, vaccines.  We need to do more of that with climate change.  I know some young people who have the Interrail card.  Aside from everything else that the EU does, that card is good and tangible.  If we do not speak about democracy and the benefits of that democracy, including the democracy that is the EU, then we will allow other people to say otherwise.</p> <p>  The Commission is examining this matter.  It had been handling some of the issues that were raised, so it was astonished that people did not know that.  That has been a major lesson for the Commission.  It will have to get better at communicating some of what it is doing.  That requires an educated citizenry.  Thank God, we have that here in Ireland.  More and more kids are learning about European issues in school.</p><p>We have our Blue Star programme in schools.  We also have civic, social and political education, CSPE, as part of the general curriculum for children.  That is also important and we all have a responsibility in this area.  </p><p> On qualified majority voting, it is hard to tell people what the real difference would be in their lives if this were to come about.  We spent a lot of time dealing with this and my impression is that most countries do not wish to spend a lot of time dealing with it and navel-gazing.  As I said, we have achieved many practical outcomes through consensus in recent years.  Where concerns have been expressed to me, they have been in the context of enlargement.  We are keen on enlargement.  Other countries have expressed a concern that perhaps decision-making could become unwieldy.  Again, we have a great deal of work to do on enlargement and our objective as a Government is to get these countries into the Union when they are ready and to help them to get ready to do so.  We can consider having an institutional debate during that process, but that is not our number one priority.</p><p> There is a lot going on in energy.  It is important to remember what has happened already.  With all these rows, such as why we are not bringing in a windfall tax, etc., which was going on for weeks, we brought in that windfall tax last Friday and hardly a word was said about it.  It is worth recalling what the Government did at EU level in conjunction with other European governments last Friday.  Where large financial gains have been made by energy companies on what are called inframarginal rents, which are, essentially, non-gas electricity supplies, there will be a solidarity contribution on those profits.  A solidarity levy will be placed on the fossil fuel sector as well.  Work will also be done in the area of electricity demand reduction.  People laugh when it is said that we need to reduce demand, but this is just a fact.  We need to do this and there are ways of doing it, especially at peak times.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities will be working on this also to help us get through this winter.  We achieved a significant amount last Friday in introducing a windfall tax.  Shell has now asked the British Government to do something similar.  The European Union has done this and we have done it together.</p><p> It is worth recalling when we have done these very positive things as governments working together.  In this case, it just involved the governments working together under this particular provision of the treaty and not the European Parliament, but generally the Parliament would also be involved.  This is a good development.  It is like everything else in that when there is a problem, we never hear the end of it, and then little is said when there is a solution.  Perhaps it is only us who do not talk enough about these kinds of developments.  This is not the entire solution but it is certainly a large part of it.</p><p> The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has estimated that between &euro;1 billion and &euro;2 billion will accrue to the Government.  This will be redirected into ensuring that we are energy secure and that energy is affordable in the coming months.  A great deal of other work is also ongoing.  I can talk about that as well if the committee wishes.</p></speech>

Everyone was very taken with his father's tribute this morning.  In fairness, he involved himself in a fight that was not his and he paid the ultimate price.</p> <p>  We discussed some of these points in the context of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  That was definitely a process that improved as it went.  It started with many flaws.  As with politics in general, some people are still on the periphery and well removed from politics at a European level.  Work needs to be done on this.  As I said, that is the case across the board.</p> <p>  In fairness, the Minister of State has answered some of the questions I was going to ask.  Regarding citizens' involvement, there was probably a need for a greater level of conversation on what Europe as a whole and the individual institutions were doing and to get into the ins and outs of issues.  The issue of qualified majority voting versus unanimity seemed to come up in the sense that people saw everything very simply as Hungary being the problem and that we could not have it holding things up.  Even where there is not a Union-level competence, such as in health, it was still able to organise the buying of vaccines as a bloc.  That showed that the opt-in system has been working.  The Minister of State said several times that the problem with democracy is that it can take a long time to come up with deals but that is the reality.  We have all seen the alternative, and it is not a place we want to go.  This needs to be considered.  It is understandable that the focus of citizens has sometimes gone in this direction, based on almost every issue being dealt with as if it were a silo.</p> <p>  Regarding the issue of energy security, the Minister of State is obviously involved in conversations at a higher level than any of us.  I accept what he said regarding the EU having begun actions in this regard, including the solidarity tax, etc., but it is necessary to go further.  Where does the Minister of State believe these endeavours can go in respect of dealing with the entire energy market?  I accept there are difficulties in bringing about change and there can be unintended consequences.  We have all seen the idea put into action where Europe can act as a collective in buying as a bloc.  Everyone sees the sense in doing that.  On another aspect now in the public domain in the context of security issues, I refer to our protection of critical infrastructure and the conversations under way in this regard in Europe.  We are in the age of hybrid warfare.  The concept of security and what that looks like has changed.</p> <p>  I also wish to hear the Minister of State's view concerning the age-old question of our relationship with our nearest neighbour.  The British Government now has its own economic issues.  The language it is using has improved regarding possible deals and perhaps we will be able to get movement on the protocol.  The protocol Bill is still in play, however, and we need to deal with that issue in and of itself.  A conversation needs to be had with unionism from the perspective of the protocol being the only show in town and of streamlining what needs to be done in this regard.  Succour must not be provided, though, to those at the extreme end who may be looking for something that is not a possibility.  Will we get a decent level of movement not only on the protocol but also on the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 and the amnesty legislation?  I think that is enough questions.</p></speech>

People do talk about Hungary, but we have achieved a lot with which Hungary has agreed.  It vetoed the taxation proposal that came up at OECD level, for example, but the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has said he is confident we will be able to resolve that issue.  Even with unanimity being a requirement, we can achieve a great deal.  We speak more strongly to the world when we speak together.  In some cases, the idea of having a vote and that there would even be a qualified majority in favour and a minority against a proposal could weaken our position.  We are not rushing out the door on QMV for that reason, and I do not think we ever have, especially on foreign policy matters.  Even though Ireland is very much in the mainstream of European foreign policy, it has never occurred to us to use our veto on any proposal put before the European Council or Foreign Affairs Council on foreign policy matters.  We are in the mainstream and our foreign policy is based on democracy, respect for human rights and on the principles of the UN Charter.  These are pretty normal foreign policy principles for democratic countries.  This is the way the EU works.  Nothing at the EU level has ever threatened our foreign policy.  In fact, it has only added to it.  Equally, I think we have added to foreign policy at EU level as well.  When we have unanimity it makes us work harder and speak more strongly.</p> <p> On energy security, I already spoke about what might be called the windfall tax that has been brought in.  I am glad it has been.</p><p>There is work continuing on common purchasing, which would effectively mean price caps, and that work is happening at European level but also at global level, particularly on oil.  The only issue that Ireland has about energy at the moment is energy security.  We produce a small amount of gas ourselves and we do not produce any oil so, first and foremost, we have to make sure we get that product to the island, which is very important.  Our interconnection with Britain and then on to Norway is very important and the proposed interconnector to France, which is effectively under way, is also very important.  What is also important is that we continue with our renewable energy ambitions so we can become more energy self-sufficient and possibly become an energy exporter.</p><p> In terms of what might be happening at European level on block purchasing, we would be very happy to leave that to the Commission and it is best if it is done from that level.  Different letters were circulated last week among member states on this issue but it is much more complicated than signing letters.  We have to make sure we have security of supply.  As I said, there is Ireland, Britain and Norway and the issue of ending dependence on Russia.  We have to make sure we can keep that energy coming.  Ireland is not part of the main European grid and that further complicates matters for us.  We are keeping an eye on this and we are very happy for the Commission to take the lead on this, which it has done very successfully in other contexts.  However, even the Commission would say that the issue is extremely complex, although it is working very hard on it.</p><p> On the protection of critical infrastructure, I would have to defer to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Department of Defence on that.  I am not sure I can really add to that.  However, in terms of our neutrality, I would say there is no pressure from anybody at the European table in terms of our non-membership of military alliances.  Again, this is who we are, and every country has something that shows who they are.  People can have different views and I have no problem with that but, as a nation, this is not something we are proposing to change.  The Taoiseach has spoken about a possible citizens&rsquo; assembly to discuss it but we do not have detailed proposals on that or any Government decision.  It is certainly not something one would find at European level, particularly among the member states, in terms of asking why we are not a member of NATO.  Nobody has ever said that.</p><p> As to our nearest neighbour, the mood music is excellent at the moment.  We have had really good engagement between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Liz Truss, and it was noted that we were the only country where both the Head of State and the Prime Minister were invited to the funeral.  The Irish people and the Irish State showed incredible deference at the time of the funeral of Her Majesty and I think that really helped.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has had very good engagement with both the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Cleverly, and the Secretary of State, Mr. Heaton-Harris.  By the way, we all know our counterparts very well from before, which is very useful.  I will be speaking to my counterpart, who is the Minister, Mr. Leo Docherty, tomorrow, and we are all in regular touch with Vice-President &Scaron;efovi.  The mood music is really good.  We appreciate what Steve Baker said at the weekend and he seemed to appreciate what I said on BBC the day before yesterday, judging by his comments.</p><p> That is very good but the challenge now is to move the discussions on at a technical level.  The political atmosphere is very good but the technical people, the officials who look at all of these highly detailed issues about customs, checks, state aid and VAT, have to be given a mandate by the politicians to move the thing on.  That is where things fell down before in that there had at times been a very good atmosphere between the politicians, but then we find that when the officials get to talk, not very much happens.  Nonetheless, there are things happening and there are technical talks starting this week.  The Commission and the British authorities have been in regular discussion this week about scheduling them.  We think the focus needs to be to ensure that those officials are empowered to have real discussions that can bring the outcome that people and businesses in Northern Ireland will overwhelmingly support, that is, what we see as a jointly agreed outcome that provides the certainty they need to maximise the opportunities offered by the protocol.  I am a confident that we can come to an arrangement that will satisfy everybody but we need to come to that arrangement as soon as possible.</p></speech>

First, I want to associate myself with the remarks made by other members in regard to the sad death of Rory Mason.</p><p>I will be covering some ground that has already been touched upon.  I want to ask three questions of the Minister.  First, there has been a lot of focus and debate on QMV.  I would be interested in coming at it from a different angle by asking the Minister of State, from his own experience in Council, whether an issue ever arose where something that was really desirable was not attainable because of a veto.  The way we work in Ireland, with multi-party Governments being the norm nowadays, is that technically there is a vote at Cabinet but, in my experience, there is never a vote at Cabinet because, by necessity, you have to bring everybody with you.  I think that is the way the European Council works as well.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's take on that because the one thing we do not want is, by some majoritarianism, to leave somebody feeling wounded or excluded.  For that reason, I would be supportive of the <i>status quo</i>.</p><p>My second question is in regard to the positive actions that the European Union takes.  The Minister of State is right that there is often a focus on the things that are not being done, and the very positive things that are being done are not always focused upon.  For example, the acquisition of vaccines during the Covid crisis was a successful undertaking, as well as the support by means of the provision of PPE and other equipment.  In the energy crisis we are facing, there are two elements for Ireland.  One is obviously the cost element to be borne by our citizens and by industry, and the Government has done a good lot to address that insofar as it can.  I would be interested in the other side of it, from a European perspective, and that is Ireland's sustainability in acquiring energy.  As I indicated, I understand that the Commission, certainly the Commission President, is anxious for a common purchasing arrangement so there is not the perverse and disruptive bidding between member states for energy, particularly after the winter, given that storage for this winter is reasonably adequate.  What happens next year to ensure we do not have individual member states bidding up the price and literally freezing other member states out of energy?  Where are we in terms of that common approach?</p><p>From an Irish perspective, the Minister of State rightly said that we are on the periphery.  We have about a quarter of our gas from the Corrib field and three quarters comes through Britain.  Ofgem said yesterday that there may be a critical balance this winter in gas supplies in Britain.  How does that impact on us since they supply us?  Have we had reassurances in regard to our supply if their own supply becomes critical?  It has been very clearly indicated by EirGrid and others that our energy supply this winter is on a knife edge.</p><p>My related question concerns the push to renewables.  The Minister of State referenced the notion that we need to be a net exporter of energy.  Obviously, the big investment and the enormous focus in the immediate horizon, that is, in the next 15 to 20 years, will be on offshore wind, but there really is very slow progress in Ireland in regard to getting that off the ground, if the Minister of State will pardon the phrase.  We have not designated a port to service it yet and the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, will not be taking applications until at least March of next year.  There just does not seem to be the urgency about it that would be in sync with the Minister of State's determination that we will be energy self-sufficient within a reasonable horizon.</p><p> My last question is about the coverage of Europe and European affairs.  We complain in this House that there is diminution of the coverage of the business of this House.  Certainly the detailed work of committees of the House is not covered very much.  There is talk of a second Chamber, which would dissipate coverage even more.  There is a perversity.  The more product, productivity and effort, the less coverage of it that is communicated.  I know from talking to Irish colleagues in the European Parliament that there is significant concern that there is virtually no coverage of the activities of the European Parliament, although it may generate 70% of what ultimately is Irish law.  A big part of advancing the principles of democracy and so on is to ensure they are communicated effectively because, quite frankly, they are not at the moment.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022100500002#G00200"><p>On the question about something really desirable that was not achieved because of a veto, it does sometimes happen that at the Foreign Affairs Council, there might be a statement on human rights violations in particular countries that is vetoed by one country.  What happens is that they do not hold a vote; they merely withdraw the proposal.  It just does not happen because one country has said "No".  That is its right.  With the vast majority of items that go through the Council of Ministers routinely, there would not necessarily be anything other than unanimity even with a range of ordinary directives and regulations.  What can happen during the negotiations is there might be a bloc or minority that might try to work for its particular agenda.  It might not stop it but it might try to change a law.  That can happen based on the numbers and we have seen it happen on a number of occasions.  At every Council meeting, they put the next item of legislation that needs to be passed on the agenda.  They have gone through all the discussions at departmental and Council level and the committee of permanent representatives to the EU, COREPER.  There is a technical vote at our Council.  They are all unanimous.  They would not necessarily require that.  It may be that countries that may have been opposed to them have got some changes to them.  Again, it is a process of negotiation.  It does happen at the Foreign Affairs Council.  In my experience over the past couple of years, the European Council has always tried to get a result and to bring people together.  If you look at the conditionality regulation, that was effectively on rule of law.  That was essentially decided at the European Council.  That required unanimity.  The deal done there was that we will hold off on implementation until Hungary and Poland take a challenge to the European Court of Justice so that was a bit of compromise.  They took the challenge.  We supported the Council and the decision against Hungary and Poland in that case.  The court ruled against them and now that is in place.  Again, unanimity achieved a lot in there even though it was messy and complex and did not satisfy everybody at the time.  It has definitely achieved a lot in my opinion.</p> <p>  Regarding some of the energy questions, I have to say that they would really be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  They are all European issues.  Some agreements between the EU and various entities such as Azerbaijan have been reached.  There is also an agreement with Israel.  Not all of them are to provide immediate relief.  The Commission is working on the overall package and we would be quite happy for it to do that once it takes everybody's circumstances into account.  It is something that needs the Commission to lead on.  Ultimately, that will be to our benefit.  </p> <p>  Having much more offshore wind is certainly our ambition and is very much part of our European obligations.  Listening to what Deputy Howlin said about the delays, I will make the point that when this Government came into office, there was no planning structure there.  The Maritime Area Planning Act was passed.  It was incredibly complex legislation.  It is now through and the other stuff is following on from that.  </p> <p>  Regarding coverage of politics, sometimes we have to make our own coverage but it is important that we have as many outlets as possible.  I know part of the Government is providing support to make sure outlets can provide the type of public service coverage they are required to, including through the licence fee, which has been there for decades.  That then imposes an obligation to the broadcaster that receives that, RT&Eacute;, and the general terms of licensing of broadcasting in this country require broadcast outlets to provide news coverage.  Some do it well, which I welcome.  I accept what the Deputy says but ironically, there are now more avenues to see what we are doing.  Anyone around the country can tune into this today.  They could not do that 20 years ago so there are more avenues.  Again, we all have to take responsibility but if we do not have information and knowledge out there about what is happening in the democracy, the democracy will die and we see that starting to happen in America in terms of local and state coverage.  It is very worrying and we definitely cannot allow that to happen here.  One of the important objectives of the European Commission and the European Union and one thing we discuss regularly at the Council is media freedom and plurality.  Making sure that is there is one of the things we are very concerned about because it is part of democracy and something we keep a very close eye on in all member states, particularly where it has been identified as an issue.  </p></speech>

Following on from Deputy Howlin's comments on how we engage better with communities and the public, I put down a question to the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, about a European affairs officer in each local authority and setting up a strategic policy committee, SPC, at local authority level so that people on the ground would be more in touch with what is actually happening at European level.  That does not seem to be his Department.  What sort of budget does the Minister of State get in the Department of Foreign Affairs for something like that?  Does he get anything?  What is the budget for European affairs in the Department of Foreign Affairs?  Is this something the Department could look into?</p> <p>  How should European governing bodies deal with a Eurosceptic leader in another EU country?  I know that before the Italian general election, Ursula von der Leyen made a comment that they had tools to deal with Italy if it went in a difficult direction.  What is the Minister of State's opinion on that top-down approach?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022100500002#G00400"><p>On a European affairs officer, I believe it should be a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and individual local authorities.  Some local authorities already have a European affairs officer and I think such a post would be very useful because there are funding opportunities available through various sources.  One of the things we are very keen is that at every level in this State, we would obtain as much European funding as we can.  Universities and third-level institutes are very good at getting research funding so it is undoubtedly the case that local authorities should have more expertise and some of them have while others are really pushing the European links.  Limerick is one example.  There are European-orientated funding programmes such as the PEACEPLUS programme, which is partly funded by the EU but also by ourselves and the UK Government.  Border counties can benefit from that.  I am certainly more than happy to work to ensure we can spread this out around the country.</p> <p>  We had a very small budget for publicising or promoting the EU.  We received a substantial increase for next year in the budget.  I will get Senator Keogan the exact figure in due course but it has been substantially increased.  This was very important for us in terms of the EU50 programme.  I even saw one Deputy criticising advertisements - I do not know who was putting up the advertisements as I do not think it was us - because they were talking about Europe, so we will do that and be criticised for it.  I launched an advertising campaign recently at relatively low cost to promote the idea of Irish people working in European institutions because over the next three years, we are going to have a 35% reduction in the number of Irish people working in European institutions.</p><p>Therefore, I encourage the committee to join us in encouraging our excellent young graduates to work in the European institutions.  That is another facet of our promotion.  </p><p> On dealing with elected people and President von der Leyen&rsquo;s comments about the Italian election, quite frankly, the European Commission has tools to deal with all of us if we fall below basic principles of rule of law and democracy.  At the Council meeting that I attend, we regularly have discussions on what is called the Commission&rsquo;s annual rule of law report - in fact, we had one only last month.  We take turns answering questions from colleagues about the rule of law in our country.  In the past, I have answered questions about some issues, particularly around judicial appointments, for example, and what we are doing with the judicial appointments Bill and reforms to the Defamation Act etc.  Colleagues will ask questions about that and I ask questions of other colleagues.  We sort of hold one another to account as to what we are all doing.  It is not about particular countries, rather, it is about what we are all doing.  Though it is, in some cases, about particular countries because there are certainly concerns and procedures in place in relation particularly to the system of judicial appointments in Poland and basic issues of democracy in Hungary as well.  There are Article 7 proceedings, as they are known, that have been going on for some time.  They would require many member states to support them to move them on and they have not moved on.  We generally just take stock of where things are.  We try to discuss these issues publicly and directly with our colleagues.  I had a meeting with my Hungarian colleague on the margins of the last Council meeting in Brussels, where I expressed concerns, but also said that we want Hungary to get European funding once it complies with the conditions attached to it.  </p><p> Regarding the Italian elections, that is a matter for the Italian people.  They will have a prime minister and I am certainly not going to prejudge what she does.  It is ultimately the coalition.  It is always important to remember that in Italy, they generally have coalitions and never one party that dominates everything.  They are elected by the people and we will deal with them.  If there are any issues with regard to rule of law in any member state, the Commission certainly has the tools to deal with them.</p></speech>

We were all very taken with the sentiments that his dad expressed in the tribute we heard earlier today.</p> <p>  As I said, the world has changed considerably over the last period and we are all having very different conversations and worries that we would have a number of years ago.  I refer to interaction with other European countries and their views at this point in time.  I know that every second commentator believes they are a serious military strategist at this stage, but it does not look like it is going particularly well for Vladimir Putin in the field.  That is why we have to get that energy piece correct, because it is one of the things that he has in the sense of the possibility of economic carnage throughout the western world and particularly Europe.  However, obviously, there are fears related to some of the threats that have been made, for example, even relating to the annexation of those areas that, from Putin&rsquo;s point of view, he can determine as being part of Russian territory.  In addition, there is that wider threat of tactical nuclear weapons being put in the field.  Some commentators said that could be a considerable number of steps away, even if he was to consider it, however, there might be the possibility of testing nuclear of weapons or something from a point of view of upping the game.  This is all very frightening and I accept that there are limits to what the Minister of State can comment on.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the rule of law question.  I ask about those particular interactions and where the conversation is between the European Commission and Hungary.  Where are relationships at the minute, particularly with Poland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022100500002#H00300"><p>On Russia, I will not give a running commentary on military matters; that is not within my expertise.  On this so-called annexation of Ukrainian territory, we categorically condemn what Putin announced - that Russia could in any way annex part of the territory of Ukraine.  This has no basis whatsoever in law and it does not actually even reflect what the people of those regions want for themselves.  The sham referendums that were conducted in occupied Ukrainian territory by Russia and its proxies were illegal and illegitimate.  They were not even referendums at all, if one looks at what happened on the ground.  It is a further ploy to undermine Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity and to try to justify Russia&rsquo;s totally unjustified and illegal war.  It was an escalation.  Ireland will never recognise the claims over the regions.  We remain steadfast in our support of the people of Ukraine.  Why are we fully in support of Ukraine?  Because the annexation of Ukraine&rsquo;s territory was a total violation of the principles of the UN Charter and of all basic international law.  Russia has to end its aggression immediately and withdraw all forces from the territory of Ukraine.</p> <p>  We condemn the use of nuclear weapons.  Any nuclear weapons would result in devastating consequences for everybody.  Nuclear threats should not happen.  Russia previously agreed with other nuclear powers that nuclear war can never be won and should never be fought.  We have consistently condemned Russia&rsquo;s action at the Security Council and we called for that council to continue its responsibilities of the maintenance of international peace and security.  What we do at the UN and what we do in terms of nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation is the continuum of a long tradition of Irish foreign policy.  Frank Aiken, former Minister for Foreign Affairs, was central to efforts to reduce nuclear proliferation around the world and eliminate it.  This is part of our proud tradition.  </p> <p>  I was very pleased to meet the Ukrainian MP, Kira Rudik, on Friday.  We have had a lot of contacts with counterparts.  She expressed her extreme gratitude to the Irish people, which I think she did in the media as well, for everything that we have done.  She told me of a Ukrainian refugee who took her aside when she was here and said, &ldquo;Kira, you would not believe how good they are&rdquo;.  I thought that was such a lovely thing for someone to say and how it was true.  She also thanked teachers as well.  There are more than 10,000 Ukrainian children now in Irish schools.  They have been doing incredible work.  We will continue to engage with Ukraine to help it in whatever way we can.</p> <p>  On budget conditionality, particularly in respect of Hungary, the Commission made a proposal on 18 September for implementing a budget that would be basically a suspension of cohesion funding to Hungary under our budget conditionality regulation.  Essentially, there would be conditions that Hungary will have to comply with to receive funding.  In the period ahead, we are engaging with our fellow EU member states to get a consensus on this.  We have met the Hungarian Government.  I met its representatives last month and they told me they are committed to complying with the conditions.  We welcome what they are saying but obviously we have to see this and make sure that Hungary complies with conditions.  We have continued concerns regarding rule of law in Hungary.  We were fully engaged in all of the Council discussions that will ultimately determine whether EU funding is withdrawn pursuant to the mechanism, in light of what they actually do.  Hungary essentially was given one month to comply with the Commission decision.  It was looking for an extension, which would mean two months, and, quite frankly, I did not have a huge difficulty with that.  That is on cohesion funding.</p> <p>  On the recovery and resilience programme, the Commission has not agreed anything with Hungary yet.  We hope that it will.  We believe in this recovery funding across Europe.  We also know that Irish companies probably disproportionately benefit from European funding, even if it spent it on the member states because we are an exporting country that works abroad.  However, if funding is agreed with Hungary, we have to make sure that there are effective anti-corruption safeguards to guarantee the sound management of what is European money and our money as well, as we are a net contributor.</p><p> We welcome the recent agreement between Poland and the Commission on milestones around the rule of law.  Poland has taken steps on its judicial disciplinary regime in the context of the Commission approving its recovery and resilience fund.  We definitely want ongoing dialogue between Poland and the European Commission on the implementation of those milestones as well as wider issues.  The whole issue of judicial independence and respect for the European Court of Justice is not just important for us.  In my opinion, it is very important for any business that is operating in Poland, which is a country that is very committed to our European Single Market.  That market is very important to Poland and it wants to make sure there are no question marks whatsoever over that.  It has been working quite well with the Commission on this.  We welcome and support that.  We also recognise the amount that Poland is doing for Ukrainian refugees, in particular, which is very good, and the pressure that its Government is under.  We are working very closely with Poland on issues surrounding Ukraine on a number of fronts.</p></speech>

I know we are coming towards the end of the meeting.  I spoke at a seminar this week on media plurality and media freedom.  One of the issues that came up as a real concern was the potential for external actors, including state actors, to interfere with the next European elections.

Are mechanisms and processes in train to protect the integrity of the upcoming European elections?</p></speech>

One of the things we picked up on when we went to Romania and Moldova was a clear message coming from politicians that because of the war they are now getting attention they were not getting previously.  Is attention to eastern bloc countries something Ms Collins believes was missing prior to the war?  I know that she was quite proactive in her previous role as ambassador to Finland.  I met her there and much good work is going on in Finland.  It is not right to collectively build a fence around all eastern bloc countries but the sense we got from Romania - Deputy Howlin was there as well and Deputies &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Haughey were on a recent trip to Georgia - was that because of the war it is now getting attention.  Is that something Europe is conscious of?  Did we miss a beat up to that?  Do we concentrate too much on the western side?</p> <p>  I have spoken to the Spanish ambassador in the recent past and there is a sense we are not doing enough for the southern Mediterranean.  Is there a periphery-core issue?  We all live through it in this country, where because we on the periphery we sometimes feel we do not get the same attention as others.  Is that a thing?  I wanted to send back that message.  That is why we will continue as a committee to focus on Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and the Balkan states.  A representative appeared before this committee, Mrs. Eli Bojadjieska Ristovski, on behalf of North Macedonia.  As a committee, we will continue to use our influence, presence and industry to try to build on those connections because at present Europe is very driven and very anxious to ensure accession for the Balkan states, in addition to looking at a roadmap for the likes of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.  It would be interesting to hear both the Minister of State and Ms Collins's opinions on that. </p></speech>

We have had a good meeting with her here.  We opened the embassy in Ukraine in August of last year before anyone was talking about the war.  I met the Moldovan foreign minister in December last year and was very glad to do that.  I personally have text numbers and contacts for many politicians in North Macedonia because in my time as Minister of State I have built up those contacts.</p></speech>

The Minister was in Romania and Moldova and we have engaged very heavily with them.  For example, my predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, did a tour of the western Balkans, as I did.  Next week, I will sit down with the Albanian Prime Minister, Edi Rama.  We have different formats at European level.  For example, the Taoiseach sits at the Nordic-Baltic round table so there is a very close connection there.  We also have a Nordic strategy and work very closely with the Baltic countries, in particular.  We work with different countries on different issues.  There are countries in the rule of law group and the Single Market group, and there is a Hanseatic group of finance ministers as well.  It depends on different countries.</p> <p>  There are some countries where we could do a lot more.  We have had good visits to Slovakia, which is a country that is so like-minded with us it is incredible.  A delegation from the Oireachtas was in Slovakia recently, which was very welcome.  We are always trying to do more and to engage more.  I listen to what the committee has to say.  I strongly encourage Oireachtas committees to continue those visits that this committee has been doing post Covid.  That is very welcome.  These countries love to see us coming and have a great fondness for Ireland.  Many of those countries look to us and look to our success in the EU.  We are one of the few EU countries with an embassy in every single member state.  That really gives us significant heft because if something happens in Bulgaria, for example, we have somebody on the ground who can tell us what is happening.  Not every member state has that.  In Slovakia, quite a few European member states do not have embassies.  That became apparent when I was there.  We are always trying to engage with other countries.</p> <p>  I will say that on Brexit, every single one of the EU member states, east and west, gave us extraordinary solidarity and continue to do so.  We are grateful for that.  Definitely, we can always get to know them better.</p></speech>

It is not a criticism of what we are doing as a country.  It was an observation made by many people about Europe, not about Ireland.  That was the sense we got.  I do not think I am talking out of line when I say that is what we picked up.  At the end of the day, there is a massive focus on that region now.  There is now a pathway for Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.  It is all good.  The committee wanted to alert the Minister of State to the fact that we will continue to do that.</p> <p>  Beimid ag bogadh ar aghaidh leis an obair at&aacute; i gceist le t&iacute;ortha na mBalc&aacute;n, an Mhacad&oacute;in Thuaidh, an Chosaiv, an Alb&aacute;in, an tSeirbia agus Montain&eacute;agr&oacute;, agus beimid ag amharc ar an obair at&aacute; i gceist leis an &Uacute;cr&aacute;in, an Mhold&oacute;iv agus an tSeoirsia fosta.

I thank the committee for its invitation.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Brendan McVeigh and Ms Sin&eacute;ad Reynolds from the Department of Finance.<br/><br/>International standards in respect of anti-money laundering are set and monitored by the Financial Action Task Force, FATF.  FATF is an intergovernmental body with 39 members, including Ireland, and a large number of observers and associate members.  Over 200 countries commit to implementing its standards.<br/><br/>EU standards generally reflect those of FATF and are currently set out in the fourth anti-money laundering directive of 2015, as updated by the fifth directive in 2018.  Ireland is bound by these directives and implements them through the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  That Act has been amended several times, most recently in 2021.<br/><br/>A politically exposed person, PEP, is defined by FATF as &quot;an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function&quot;.  FATF states:</p> <blockquote> 	Due to their position and influence, it is recognised that many PEPs are in positions that potentially can be abused for the purpose of committing money laundering (ML) offences and related predicate offences, including corruption and bribery, as well as conducting activity related to terrorist financing. </blockquote> <p>FATF emphasises that PEP status is intended to apply higher vigilance rather than suggesting that individuals are involved in suspicious activity.<br/><br/>FATF first issued requirements covering foreign PEPs and their family members and close associates in 2003.  In 2012 FATF expanded these requirements to domestic PEPs in line with the United Nations Convention against Corruption.<br/><br/>EU requirements for PEPs are now set out in Articles 20 to 23 of the fourth directive, which broadened the application of the EU regime to include domestic PEPs.  It came into force in Ireland in 2018.  The definition of &quot;politically exposed person&quot; in the directive specifies several categories of PEP, including, for example, Heads of State, members of parliament, members of the governing bodies of political parties, supreme court judges, ambassadors and others.  This definition is open: while the categories stated must be included, other persons may also be included on the basis of their holding a prominent public function.<br/><br/>Relevant entities - for example, financial institutions - are then obliged, first, to have in place appropriate procedures to determine whether a customer or the beneficial owner of the customer is a PEP and, second, to apply enhanced due diligence to business relationships with PEPs, including obtaining senior management approval for establishing or continuing business relationships; taking adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds involved in relationships or transactions; and conducting enhanced ongoing monitoring of those business relationships.  These measures also apply to family members or persons known to be close associates of politically exposed persons.<br/><br/>The Central Bank of Ireland publishes guidance on PEPs for financial institutions.  This guidance is available on the Central Bank's website.  Notably, it provides:</p> <blockquote> 	Firms should take adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds which are to be used in the business relationship in order to satisfy themselves that they do not handle the proceeds of corruption or other criminal activity.<br /><br />The measures which Firms should take to establish a PEP's source of wealth and source of funds will depend on the degree of risk associated with the business relationship.  Firms should verify the source of wealth and the source of funds based on reliable and independent data, documents or information.<br /><br />When determining the source of wealth and source of funds, Firms should, at least consider:<br /><br />- The activities that have generated the total net worth of the customer ...; and<br /><br />- The origin and the means of transfer for funds that are involved in the transaction. </blockquote> <p>In July 2021 the European Commission published a detailed legislative proposal to replace the fourth directive.  That proposal includes replacing the existing directive-based system with a combination of directives and regulations, with a &quot;single rulebook&quot; implemented via a regulation which would be directly applicable across the European Union.  That rulebook would largely supersede the national provisions I have set out, which are likely to be repealed as part of the transposition.  A new European Union authority, the anti-money laundering authority, AMLA, would lead AML regulation across the bloc.  The package remains under negotiation and is handled at ECOFIN.  Colleagues in the Department of Finance lead on those negotiations and can address questions the committee may have about the broader package.  While the package itself is very substantial and will significantly affect how AML regulation is implemented, the specific requirements set out on PEPs in Articles 32 to 36 of the proposed regulation, as published, are broadly similar to those currently in place.  AMLA is tasked with issuing guidelines on assessing the levels of risk associated with particular categories of politically exposed persons, their family members or persons known to be close associates.<br/><br/>The regulation also reaffirms that the requirements relating to PEPs and their family members and close associates are of a preventative, not criminal, nature and should not be interpreted as stigmatising PEPs as being involved in criminal activity.  Refusing a business relationship with a person simply on the basis of his or her being identified as a PEP would clearly be contrary to the spirit of the regime.<br/><br/>I am conscious that, with the time available, I have only scratched the surface.  I am, of course, happy to answer members' queries in more detail.</p></speech>

In this era of transparency, I should announce at the outset that I, like everyone else on this committee, am a politically exposed person.

There are several elements that have different timelines associated with them.  The primary transposition was through the 2021 amending Act.  A separate statutory instrument in respect of the beneficial ownership trusts was introduced in April 2021.  The Act was commenced in April 2021 as well.  Then there have been further measures in respect of the Central Bank account registry, which has been put in place since.</p></speech>

It is slightly tricky in that, while the fourth directive replaced the third directive, the third directive was transposed by the 2010 Act and that, in order to transpose the fourth directive, we did not replace the 2010 Act but, rather, amended it.  The 2010 Act is therefore the primary legislation on PEPs.</p></speech>

I would have thought it is important for financial institutions and for State bodies to be aware of whether the people who are on the boards or are managing them are PEPs.  It seems to me that there is no certainty as to whether they are or they are not.</p></speech>

It is not necessarily a black and white question of whether someone is a PEP and therefore enhanced due diligence should be applied.  It is rather a case that if a person is holding a position which is, by its nature, high risk, then there is an obligation on a bank to take appropriate and proportionate steps in response to that.  We can become very focused on whether someone falls into a PEP bracket or not.  It is more that, for each client relationship across all of money laundering, not just in respect of PEPs, a risk-based approach should be taken.  The risk associated with the person should then be identified and further due diligence measures taken, if necessary.</p> <p>  On the guidance on this, provision 37(12) was actually added in the 2021 legislation.  We have been conscious that, soon after that legislation was enacted, the sixth package was published.  We are conscious of not putting in place something that will not last so that if, as is highly likely, the Irish rule book is replaced by a cross-European rule book, we want to have something in position that is consistent with the direction of travel.  It is something we have been conscious of the European developments on.  The worst thing we could do would be to wade into definitions, guidance and practices on a firm-by-firm basis for perhaps two or three years before it all changes again on a European level.</p></speech>

I would also say that it is that broader process of risk evaluation that should happen for all customers.  It is not a black and white case of somebody being in one case and having no requirements and in another case having very onerous requirements.  A risk-based approach should be taken to what the relationship is and what documentary requirements are necessary.  Ms McVeigh may want to come in.</p></speech>

Specifically, the European Commission has said that no member state should be overly prescriptive because, as Mr. Bruen said, goal posts change and each institution has to be able to set its own risk appetite.  Just this morning, in an experts group meeting, the Commission let us all know that the 27 member states have now come back with their own lists, guidelines and views on what a PEP is.  The Commission had hoped to do that job earlier as part of the new package and rule book.  They had hoped to consolidate lists across member states to provide pan-European guidance on what a PEP is, but it has not done it yet.  The Commission told us this morning that it is now in the process of doing that.  It has admitted that it has been a very difficult process.  Different member states have different views about what a PEP is and what an associate of a PEP is, but it is there now.  The next step will be for the Commission to analyse that and then, under the directives, namely Article 28, I think, endorse it and give its view on what a PEP is, based on the feedback from member states.  The Commission hopes to issue a consolidated list - in the context of guidelines - about what a PEP will be by the end of the year.  There will be a pan-EU basis for it.</p></speech>

I would have thought, from the perspective of those children, that it would be fairer if there was certainly brought to this, so that people know when they are becoming customers of a bank that they have to fill out a specific form as to whether or not they are the child of a PEP which, under law, they are required to be categorised as.

I used to work in banking and we had to do a course in PEP and anti-money laundering every year, so we could continue working in the bank.  It is very important.  I know some people have other opinions, but I am one of those people who is in favour of keeping a keen eye on politically exposed persons.  It is very important.</p> <p>  I have three questions about how things are dealt with in different ways.  Obviously, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies provide a kind of anonymised way of making payments.  They inhabit a weird space where they are not money, in the sense of being issued by a central authority, but they can be used for making certain transactions and sometime that can also be for illicit purposes.  They can also be exchanged into other financial assets.  How do we deal with the risk of money laundering when it comes to the likes of cryptocurrencies, specifically regarding PEPs?</p></speech>

A regulation, called the markets in crypto assets, MiCA, regulation, is in trilogues at the moment.  It is about to be adopted.  It sets out a supervisory regime for the transfer of crypto assets.  There is no question about it - we have raised this repeatedly at EU level and we have regular discussions with the bank about it - but it is virtually impossible to screen adequately for crypto transfers.  By its very nature crytpo is not supposed to indicate that anything is particularly secretive, but it is meant to indicate that it is confidential.  That is the distinction that those who trade in crypto try to make.  That means that by its nature it is difficult to regulate.  The MiCA regulation will try to bring some regulatory and supervisory framework for those types of transfers.  The question of how exactly we can bring some level of transparency to crypto comes up daily in the EU negotiations, although it flies in the face of what crypto is about.</p></speech>

Many things in finance can be quite opaque but specifically that.  It must be fascinating to be involved in that and in trying to figure out how it could be done.  Obviously those who engage with cryptocurrency might not find that, but as someone who does not, I think it is very interesting.</p> <p>  Another opaque question I will ask involves a hypothetical scenario.  If someone wanted to corrupt the political system or was trying to corrupt me and decided to do a direct transfer to me, it would obviously trigger some suspicion.  What if they placed the funds in a shell company owned by a legal trust, of which I, as a politician, was a beneficiary?  I understand that trusts are required to register with the Central Register of Beneficial Ownership of Trusts, CRBOT, but if they did not, how would one be able to out?</p></speech>

We have had multiple negotiations and discussions over the past two years with the Commission about trusts and about the fact that, by their very nature, it is difficult to get to the beneficial ownership of trusts.  Also in a common law country like Ireland, a trust can be established tomorrow morning in the D&aacute;il.  If someone sets up a tea club in the D&aacute;il, that is a trust.  Never mind shell companies; it is something as simple at that.  To try to understand who is the beneficial owner of that trust is difficult.  Anyone who benefits from that tea club is a beneficial owner.  Many trusts are established in Ireland, and in common law countries in particular, unknown to the trustees at that, it is a significant fly in the ointment of the BO framework.  The Commission has become more sympathetic to our position on that in the past six months of the negotiations under the new package, but it has not been rectified.  I am not sure how it can be fixed in a common law country where trusts are so widely used.</p></speech>

The trust and company service providers, the people who manage it on an industrial scale, are subject to their own regulatory obligation, as is the legal profession.  Obligations exists about knowing the customer.  As Ms McVeigh said, a trust can be set up very easily and almost unintentionally but where it is falling into a pattern, or into the sort of numbers that would be involved in large-scale corruption, money laundering, etc., other people would almost inevitably be involved in those situations.  It touches on the crypto question.  Sometimes the underlying transactions cannot be regulated but the companies which are facilitating them can be.  That all arises in the area of the commercial asset service provider provisions in the 2021 Act and how we deal with trust and company service providers and with the legal profession.</p></speech>

With any company, the use of nominee shareholders and nominee directors circumvents transparency of beneficial ownership.  Under company law and governance rules, the veil cannot be easily lifted in relation to those individuals, but certainly FATF, and perhaps the EU package, is bringing forward proposals to address that.  The section 110s are quite substantial users of nominee arrangements.  It is good to be aware of what the problems are but the only way to deal with them is on that pan-EU basis because-----</p></speech>

I am interested to see how that will develop.  The whole concept of trustees and beneficial owners is that a trustee does not have to be the beneficial owner.  The trustee is more an agent.  If registering a trustee rather than a beneficial owner, is that something that could be tightened up?</p></speech>

When the Commission first came forward with proposals for the definition of a beneficial owner, we found that problematic because it deemed the trustee to be the beneficial owner.  We had to point this out as it was not very sophisticated in its knowledge of common law systems and how trusts work.  It had deemed trustees to be beneficial owners and we had to point out that was not possible.  The definition of a beneficial owner is under discussion at the moment in the package.  We have managed to get quite a lot of amendments made to the draft package to make how trusts work clearer.  That will also include the definition of beneficial owners of trusts.  That is being addressed at the moment.</p></speech>

We have had a lot of discussions with the EU about what a beneficial owner is and that it is not just the beneficiary of a trust but it is also who controls, because control is also a form of ownership.  We have been looking at that very closely but in terms of trusts, we have explained what a trustee is.  In terms of nominees, one of the current proposals being discussed is that perhaps if it is a nominee who is acting for a trust, that would be noted in the trust's register.  At least we will know how much activity is being carried out by a nominee rather than by a beneficiary or a trustee.</p> <p>  The aim of this new package is to gain clarity on exactly who owns what not just in a trust but across all entities.  In terms of trusts, yes, there will be, we hope, a lot more clarity but also practical clarity.  It will not be legislation for legislation's sake it will make a difference and get to the bottom of who benefits from what.  As Ms McVeigh said,  it is very difficult.  One has to balance this right under corporate law to use a nominee.  We cannot lift that veil so one has to get creative to see how one can get around it.  Trusts have been a sticky issue the whole way through this package but it looks likely that we will settle on a practical, enforceable arrangement.</p></speech>

There is a plenary twice a year, so FATF will put forward proposals for recommendation at plenary.  Then they are decided by the member states there.

The directive is always developed in what are called the experts' group meetings and that is where, as I said, draft proposals are put together.  There is no question but that FATF is highly persuasive on that.  Those proposals, in the same way as any directive is put together, are considered in the experts' group.  By the time a final draft package is put together you get into Council working party meetings, so the Council has an involvement at that point before and then you go to trilogues of the Parliament as well and then the directive, whatever the final consensus is, is adopted.</p></speech>

It appears to me there is an involvement of elected public representatives, be they ministers or Members of the European Parliament, at a high level but at the level many of these recommendations come from, there is very little political input.  By political input I mean that sometimes when you are sitting around the table with officials and politicians you tend to be able to find an area the officials have perhaps overlooked or maybe one the politicians do not understand and out of the conversation comes clarity.</p></speech>

When you have an EU directive being transposed it is in the fog of this House and it gets transposed.  Where it all comes from nobody knows, believe it or not, in this House.  I will not say no one but there are quite a number of people, including myself, who would like to get back to the origin of this idea.  I would like to understand how it arrives at a point where it is being transposed without that much scrutiny in this House.</p></speech>

If you look back at how a directive is developed, there is always going to be compromise in that.  It is not always going to be what is necessarily in Ireland's best interests.  There is going to be that when it comes to transposition.  The only time transposition comes into play anyway is with a directive and the PEPs will be in a regulation, actually, so there will be no discretion with it.  There is flexibility with the transposition of a directive, as I am sure the Chairman knows.  There might be something that sets out why a given member state, including Ireland, would transpose in a certain way but as I said, that is a negotiation itself in the development of the directive itself.  I can only speak from Ireland's point of view and from my time being involved in this, but there may be something particularly controversial we think Ireland is going to have to get into a big compromise on, like for instance when we were pushing very hard back with the Commission in development of the trusts beneficial ownership framework.  We pushed extremely hard at the highest levels of the Commission to get something in place there that would suit Ireland.  We certainly would speak to the Minister and set out very clearly for them why we think we need to do this but the Minister takes the decision if we are going to go back into any kind of dispute, let us call it, with other member states or with the Commission on those provisions.</p></speech>

Maybe the best thing to do is get to the issues within all of this now that I know it is dealt with in the main by senior civil servants at European level.

I was speaking to my colleague about this just before we came in.  Ireland is a very small country and because the framework for PEPs also includes associates of PEPs, when the Chairman talks about middle management in the Civil Service, they are going to be an associate of a PEP.  In a small country like this, this is going to be something that affects absolutely everybody.</p></speech>

I have had Members of the Houses come to me to say their staff, their children have gone for loans and mortgages in the normal practice of day-to-day life and once it is discovered they are a PEP, they are then put through a different approval process.</p><p>They feel that is highly invasive to their children's lives and I can understand that.  Other Members have come to me to say that in transferring money from a regular account into a current account, the transaction is often held up because the financial institution is trying to get in touch with the PEP.  There is a clear question as to where they got the money but it might be part of their salary being transferred to their current account.  While they are waiting for that to happen, particularly in these times of financial pressures, their direct debits may be stopped and all sorts of things may happen.</p><p> The consequences of the actions taken by civil servants and politicians in regard to the politically exposed person issue trickle down to family members and people who do not even consider themselves associates of a PEP.  It is causing an awful lot of difficulty for families.  It may be a civil servant whose son or daughter applies for a mortgage and suddenly has to fill out another 20 pages.  There is also the grey area, which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan referred to, whereby there is not enough definition of what a PEP is, what the Central Bank should do or how it should be interpreted down the line at the coalface.  There are consequences of this for Ireland and, as Ms McVeigh rightly said, this is a small country and we all will be PEPs.  It is strangling the ability of ordinary family members going about their lives in a normal, standard way, without feeling they are some sort of criminal or that there is some doubt about their character.</p><p> I accept why Ms McVeigh made the point she did - it was made for perfectly legitimate reasons - but we should not drag all those people into this, where they do not want to be.  They do not want to be near politics.  They have a regular life, and it has been irregularised by virtue of the fact they are impacted on by this type of legislation.  It is my concern that, in some way, they should be separate.  I am talking about people who have absolutely no worries.  They are not concerned about anything and they just want to get on with their life.  They probably despise the fact a member of their family is a politician and would like to distance themselves a little bit from it.  That is a fact in Irish life.  Those family members will then say, "Look at what you got me into here; I have another 20 pages to fill out."  Surely at ministerial level or high Civil Service level, there has to be an injection of common sense into the thought process on this before we all get strangled in something unintentionally, but that is what is happening.</p></speech>

Insofar as these issues are there, they are coming to the fore now.  I have sat in EU meetings where every member state has raised the issue of family members and associates, what constitutes both those things and how far we should go.  This issue is not just local to Ireland; all member states are feeling the pain of this.  The consensus seems to be that in a balance of interests, family members and associates have to be included.  My sense of it, although it is only my sense, is that means that enhanced due diligence, which is what we are talking about here, is going to become more the norm.  It will not just be experienced by, for instance, as the Chairman said, potentially the child of a politician.  I think it will become more the norm for everybody.</p></speech>

As I said, we are still in the negotiating phase and all member states are feeling this pain.  Fingers have been so badly burned, by various money laundering scandals and the collapse of the financial system several years ago, that the risk appetite is very low.  I can speak only about financial institutions but this applies across the board and is not just about banks.  The risk appetite is now so low, and banks have to take their own decisions in regard to the customers and business relationships they will take on, that they will not take a lot of risk on it.</p></speech>

On the other side of this, there is all the legislation we are discussing, which can be simply imposed in member states without due consideration for the honesty of family members who are caught up in this.  I would prefer if the EU directive stated that everyone is in this and outlined how we are going to proceed.  I do not wish to be categorised - I say this to our guest from the Department of Justice - under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) (Amendment) Act 2010.  It should be taken out of that and imposed directly and rigidly on politicians, but we should be told it is about that.  I should not be linked to that legislation.  I am not a terrorist and I do not launder money.</p> <p>  I am only outlining what has been said to me by Members of this House.  Others are quite afraid to say it for fear it might be interpreted as them having concerns.  Some members of this committee are sitting around the table and I am sure the other members are listening to the debate in their rooms, and I can explain why they are listening.  They are afraid to say it themselves in case they are misrepresented.  Therefore, because of the way this whole saga has been set up, it is back to officials saying they will not accept the consensus and that, perhaps, politicians should be rigidly examined and scrutinised.  I accept all that - in fact, I would want it - but I do not believe it should extend to my family members, and there are others who feel the same.</p> <p>  Is a drug dealer a politically exposed person?  He or she would have the wherewithal to buy political favouritism.</p></speech>

Officials know my son and daughter but they do not know the drug dealer.  It is weighted in such a way that makes it very strange for those who come under the legislation or the EU directive to accept it.  I do not accept it.  I accept the principle of what our guests are trying to do but I do not accept the way this is being addressed.</p><p>I am asking you as the officials who are central to this within the EU - and I am taking it up politically with the Minister - to look at this or give voice to the concern of honest individuals who are in parliaments everywhere.  This is a further indication to those who cynically look at politicians and say they must be up to something because they are being dealt with under the money laundering and terrorist financing Act.  The Department official said earlier that it is not meant to do that.  This, however, is the consequence and this is what happens.</p><p> I have been a practising politician for a long time.  I am annoyed with the EU and the way it is doing this.  I am annoyed with our own MEPs because when I put it to them they said that they did not vote for it, when actually they did.  They did not even know that they did.  The sad thing about it is how all of these different EU directives find their way into Irish legislation without the due diligence of public representatives.  I not blaming the officials but I am just interested in this whole position.  I recall a very senior politician taking me to task in this House over what I had said about how politically exposed persons were being treated.  He told me I was wrong.  In fact, not only was I right, but it has since been compounded by other missiles that come in our direction from the European Union on this issue.  As I said, I will take it up politically.  These are the reasons the departmental officials are here - not to hold them to account, but simply for me to get to where this began, how it is all coming into operation and why it is like this.</p><p> I saw an article recently from a particular part of the financial sector that was giving its interpretation of what a politically exposed person is and what should be done.  If I were to boil it down, I would say that the article said to be careful, to treat all of them with suspicion and, if they are politically exposed persons, to examine them at every quarter and make sure they are okay.  When one goes into one's local credit union for a loan, it is not dealt with by the credit committee - it is dealt with by the board.  One does not have to fill out one sheet; one must fill out 20 sheets.  This is the consequence of the decisions that are being made over there.  I want to catch the baddies just as much as the officials who are present do.  I want to take the risk out of the financial institutions just as much as they do.  I want to see those institutions scrutinised, perhaps a lot more than the officials do.  I want to see them put in their place.  At the same time, I do not believe that those of us who represent the public should be treated like this.  I do not believe that family members should have to bear the consequences of their family member being a politically exposed person, a civil servant or whatever it might be.  We have to be careful about these things.  I am delighted that the officials are here before the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.464" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022100500002#H00200"><p>I agree entirely with the Chairman.  I was one of the first people in this House to take issue with this directive.  Other colleagues at the time said they did not know about this directive.  They did not know about it, but it is there.  I find it unfair because those who fall into this category, such as politicians and their families and associates, are treated more stringently and aggressively than a person who is not deemed to be politically exposed although he or she may be interested in politics as well.  What kind of politics can one be associated with without being accused of being politically exposed?  Are there any such politics?  I assume the answer is "No".</p> <p>  I presume that the financial institutions, as the Chairman has said, have a lot of control now and by comparison the political institutions do not have as much.  As time follows, the political institutions are on a losing game and the financial institutions are gaining.  I do not accept that and I will always fight against it, as the Chairman has done.  I opposed it from the beginning.  There are people who did not know they were voting in favour of it.  It is a weakness of the European Union that legislation can be introduced in this fashion without some discussion beforehand and without some way of seeing if it complies with our Constitution.  The basis of our Constitution is that everybody is innocent until proven guilty.  In this particular case, however, all of those who are politically exposed are potentially guilty and must prove their innocence.  This is in stark variation with our Constitution.  I believe this must be dealt with at a much higher level.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that the officials have said that the European courts can deal with this and have dealt with this, and that they have dealt with a lot of other extreme cases also.  It would appear that a citizen of this State who happens to be a public representative will be under suspicion no matter what happens - the Chairman has referred to this, quite correctly - and a person who is a relative, a friend or an associate of a public representative is on to something as well.  That kind of allegation has often been made around the House, as we know, when one party or another wants to land a slur on somebody else.  The matter under discussion today, however, is in the real world.  To presume that we are potentially guilty of something is, to my mind, a violation of our rights and a handing over of citizens' rights to financial institutions.  I do not need to be encouraged to talk about financial institutions because, like the Chairman, I have engaged with and opposed many of them.  Some of them are good to deal with and some of them are not.  Some of them are secretive.  Some of them ignore public representatives, some of them challenge public representatives, and some of them clearly indicate that they do not give a damn about public representatives.  They are their own bosses, and they are quite happy in that position.</p></speech>

It is not something I oppose lightly.  I opposed it from the beginning.  Family members opposed it too.  They feel that they should not be accused because somebody in a high vaulted tower accuses me, for example.  I do not encourage and I do not involve myself in any kind of financial manipulation.  If anyone wants to accuse me of that, let them come forward or leave it.</p> <p>  On the question, I accept what the officials are saying with regard to the reasons for it.  There are reasons for everything and there are ways and means of dealing with issues.  Like the Chairman, I do not happen to agree with the application of this particular rule as it is, just as I did not agree with the GDPR.  I opposed that from the beginning on the basis that I was an elected public representative, elected by the people in a way that does not apply in most other EU countries, which is the single transferable vote.  This does not require me getting permission from anybody to rise on their behalf or against them.  There is a distinct difference in the way governments and people look at this in other countries.  In other countries there are people who hold public office who are never elected anywhere.  They could be associates of anything.  They were never elected anywhere by anybody.  They now have the same powers that we have.  By "we", I mean elected public representatives.  They do not have to admit anything, they do not have to do anything, and they just serve their time.  Some of them get into some funny scrapes from time to time.  Do not forget, however, that they were never elected.</p><p>In the heel of the hunt I would like more of an explanation as to why it is thought that politicians have to be treated in a different way as politically exposed.  Lots of other people are politically exposed by virtue of whom they associate with one way or another.  Nobody has applied any kind of restriction on their behaviour as has been the case with politicians in this country.  I am willing to hear from anybody</p></speech>

There is no insinuation of guilt in respect of being deemed a PEP.  It is about preventative measures; that is number one.  I feel the pain because I hear this even from colleagues.  I have been lucky that I have not had to experience it yet.  I have not had to do anything with my bank in quite a while other than day-to-day business, but I do hear from colleagues who are experiencing this pain so I do get it.  I also hear from EU colleagues that this is a pain felt everywhere.  There has been consensus across the EU that this is necessary to protect the integrity of the financial system and, indeed, the broader economies of member states.  The Deputy has inferred several times maybe that directives are reached in a somewhat obscure way but they are not.  I have said repeatedly, and I have also said it in relation to FATF.  We get mandates from the elected Minister regarding any controversial measures that are going into directives, and we are open to scrutiny by the Parliament here to come in and discuss anything in a draft directive or draft package of any nature.  Ultimately, it is elected representatives in the European Parliament who sign off on these directives, who signed off on the previous five AML directives, and who will be involved in the sign-off for the new package and new rule book, which is both directives and regulations. We deal with parliamentarians in Europe who are constantly asking what is this or that.  Commissioner McGuinness is very hands-on because with the Commission seat she holds she has a very strong interest in what is being developed in this package.  It would not be factual to say that elected representatives are not effectively the sign-off and the ultimate authority as to what goes into a directive at EU level.</p></speech>

There are Members of the D&aacute;il who have highlighted that particular aspect of this to me, and have said that when they were approached to invest in a company and went about doing it, there was no doubt created over them except that they were stopped for further scrutiny and, therefore, could not reach the deadlines for investing.  Afterwards their colleagues asked them what the story was with their interest and they had to explain how they had just found out they were a politically exposed person.  One of the secretaries in Leinster House, and it was not known until it happened to her, rightly told all of her colleagues that they are all politically exposed persons, and she was treated poorly by the bank.  I do not think that is in the spirit of this directive, but yet that is what is happening.</p></speech>

There is nothing in the directive or the 2010 Act that provides a basis for a bank or another designated person to refuse to do a transaction based on somebody being a PEP.

There have been noises. We have heard about that, but we have no evidence of that.  I spoke with the Central Bank before I came today, and they are telling me that only one institution so far, which they have not named as we should not know that, has so far had pushback with one customer regarding the enhanced due diligence measures that bank has requested and put in place for that particular customer who, I understand, was a so-called PEP.  That is as much as we are hearing.  We are hearing of aggravation and irritation that this new regime is in place, but there has not been any significant pushback according to the Central Bank in relation to financial institutions.</p></speech>

We want to get this right, but the consequence of the decisions to date are such that they create fear regarding the description of a PEP, what people think of PEPs within banks and just with what is going on generally.  The banks do not want the scrutiny and they do not want too many of these accounts; they prefer not to have them.  That is the reality.  That is the consequence of the decisions that have been made.  The decisions and the directives are affecting people's lives in a way perhaps that was not intended and, therefore there is an obligation on all of us to take that unintended consequence and to deal with it in whatever way this new single rule book is going to say.  It is probably going to take the worst-case scenario and build rules around that rather than acknowledge that not every PEP is a criminal.</p></speech>

The new rule book is about all AML rules.  Their basic premise is about taking a risk-based approach to all types of transactions.</p><p>What is also so entrenched in that framework is KYC, or "know your customer".  It is not something, in terms of what the institutions are doing now, that is specifically focused on politically exposed persons.  It is focused on the general anti-money-laundering rules and, unfortunately, those rules have resulted in banks and other institutions having a much lower risk appetite now for fear of any kind of money laundering activity.  That is not something they are saying is necessarily just focused on politically exposed persons.  It is focused on every customer of those institutions.</p></speech>

That is something that myself and others have referred to in the past.  They are strict and ruthless in the way they handle the powers and information they have over individuals.  That would be justified on the basis that they need to know what people are doing but nobody knows what the banks are doing.  When the financial crash came, nobody knew what they were doing until it dawned on us all and fell on our doorsteps all at the one time.  The very fact that they do not seem to be in need of any kind of scrutiny other than to be able to say that politicians are dangerous and could do all kinds of things, so they want to make sure that does not happen.  If anybody else does it, the lending institutions have been economic with the application of the rules that are there to protect customers.  The conclusion that I come to in that regard is a serious one, which is the fact that customers do not matter anymore.  Anything is justified in achieving their results.  I am increasingly concerned about the extent to which they are open and willing to discuss matters with public representatives acting on behalf of the public.  While some are happy to do so, a minority of institutions refuse to engage.  They give no information, have no address, and will facilitate no meetings.  They say, "Send us the proposal and we will have a look at it".  That is very old fashioned law and it does not apply here yet.  The EU should be cautious about allowing those kinds of things to happen because, ultimately, it can turn people against the EU, rightly or wrongly.  I have said my piece on this many times before.  I do not like secrecy.</p></speech>

I also welcome from the Department of Health: Mr. Derek Tierney, assistant secretary in the health infrastructure division; and Mr. Eamonn Quinn, principal officer for major capital works.  I also welcome from the HSE: Mr. Martin McKeith, assistant lead director of the children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme.</p> <p>  All those in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against persons outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contributions, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I now invite Mr. Gunning to make his opening remarks on behalf of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.</p></speech>

I thank the committee members who visited the construction site in July and got a full tour.  It is an important opportunity to reconnect to the vision of what we are all trying to create together, namely, a child-centred world-class facility that will support excellence in paediatric healthcare.</p> <p>  Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director, has been with the project since 2009 and therefore through the detailed design phase of that.  Mr. Phelim Devine, project director, has been with the project since 2014.</p> <p>  I remind members we have already opened the Connolly and Tallaght outpatient and emergency care centres.</p> <p>  Even since members were on-site in July, we have made significant progress.  We have provided a set of images that show developments since then, including the biome that connects the two sides of the doughnut on top.  The rugby ball on top is now glazed.  We are working with the intensive care areas.  We are kitting out the operating theatres.  Work on the emergency department, imaging, critical care and therapy areas is progressing at pace.</p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, is also responsible for the equipping of the hospital.  I am glad to report we have made excellent progress in this area.  For example, we have now acquired all the imaging equipment - X-ray, CT and MRI.  All the equipment to be built into the fabric of the building has been procured.  Some purchase orders have been placed and some are being placed.  I am glad to report to the committee that the work on the integration of this equipment into the building is well advanced.</p> <p>  The first rooms in the hospital will be deemed to be fully completed by October of this year, according to the plan.  Some 4,600 spaces will be completed on a phased basis.</p><p>In terms of expenditure, the Government approved the investment of &euro;1.433 billion.  Let me bring that figure up to the end of August of this year.  The expenditure in the report here is &euro;1.13 billion.  That is the current situation. </p><p> Again, I would like to remind members of the committee that there were certain elements within the original Government approval and there were items outside it.  The biggest item that is currently on the table is inflation, but there were also items that had been excluded, such as regulatory change and the implications of the sectoral employment order.  However, as the contract has evolved, we have also increased significant costs, such as in defending the claims and in terms of the implementation of the recommendations of the PwC report from April 2019.  There are also ongoing costs related to Covid-19 and some costs related to Brexit.  We are fully engaged with all stakeholders in these particular matters and that dialogue continues.  </p><p> I will not spend much time on the wider construction sector challenges.  I am sure that committee members are well aware of the disruptions and the market shortages.  I guess that the main word is &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo;, referring to that caused by these particular issues.  We are seeking to engage with the contractor to manage those.  On the issue of claims, we have provided a table and we certainly can go through that, depending on what the committee would like to do.  We provided that to the committee in advance of the meeting, and I think that was yesterday.</p><p> In terms of the construction project timeline, the contractor is now reporting to us that substantial completion will be at the end of March 2024.  We are engaged in a constant ongoing review with the contractor on the programme, on the potential mitigation and on securing that date. </p><p> In conclusion, there are agreed and established governance structures around this programme and this project.  We are heavily engaged with both the HSE and the Department of Health, with the lead director of the HSE and with the national oversight group on all aspects of the project.  All parties remain committed to delivering substantial completion of the children's hospital within the shortest possible timeframe.  I would like to end this short contribution by saying that I again thank members of the committee for attending the hospital.  I extend an open invitation to them to come back and see the further progress.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.529" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Tierney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#B00300"><p>Like Mr. Gunning, we have submitted a statement.  I will not go through it all, and I will just draw on some key point just referencing back to the PwC report. I would like to also thank the committee for extending the invitation to the HSE.  In this regard, I welcome my colleague Mr. Martin McKeith, who is the assistant lead director for the children's hospital project and programme.</p> <p>  The HSE plays a vital role in the NCHI project.  This is reaffirmed by the role of the lead director emanating from the PwC report of 2019.  The new children's hospital on the shared campus at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital is a key enabler of a major reform programme and acute paediatric services, bringing together three children&rsquo;s&rsquo; hospitals into one and consolidating expertise, research and excellence to ensure the best outcomes for the sickest children of Ireland for generations to come.  It remains the most significant capital investment programme undertaken in the healthcare system in Ireland.  It is unlike anything that we have ever constructed before, providing 39 clinical specialties in one location, under one roof.  This will facilitate the provision of services on a national basis.</p> <p>  Within my statement, I set out some characteristics, as well as the scale of the project, and I do not intend to go through that.  I will just say that while 2021 saw significant progress on the exterior, the major focus now in 2022 is on continuing the internal fit-out, with the installation of joinery, such as the nursing stations and the plumbing of the en-suite bathrooms.  Those members who were on site, or who intend to visit in the coming weeks, or even indeed members of the public who have recently passed the site, will have noticed that the exterior scaffolding is coming down, the completion of glazing and that the external facade has been completed. </p> <p>  Earlier in the year, the building was connected to a permanent power supply.  The main glazed biome structure that encases the feature stairway and lifts is due to be completed in a matter of weeks.  It is truly incredible to see what has been delivered in terms of vision, scale, quality and enormity of effort by all the contractors involved under the stewardship of the development board.</p> <p>  Of course, as many of the members will be aware, the construction project is only one part of the three interrelated elements of the national children&rsquo;s programme for delivery of a new paediatric model of care.  The others are the ICT and electronic health record, on which I will give a brief update, and the operational integration of the three existing children's hospitals.  Earlier this year, the Government approved the business case for the new electronic health record system.  Contracts were signed with the vendor in August of 2022.  This represents the most extensive electronic health record, EHR, deployment in Ireland and it builds upon successful EHR programmes at our largest maternity hospitals in St. James's Hospital, which, by the end of 2022 will have reached 70% coverage of our maternity in newborns.  Recruitment of the project team to deploy the electronic health record project is under way, with 106 full-time equivalents being recruited as I speak.</p> <p>  While today's focus is on construction of the NCHI, I am also happy to confirm that the wider children's hospital programme is already delivering terms of the two new constructed satellite centres at Connolly and Tallaght.  These are open and they are delivering the new model of ambulatory care for children in the greater Dublin area. </p> <p>  Again, as Mr. Gunning outlined in his opening statement, in any project of this scale and ambition, there remain challenges to be mitigated and managed until completion.  The Department understands that of the 6,000 spaces that are currently under construction, the first of these will be completed in the coming weeks, ready for system commissioning.  The remaining 4,500 clinical rooms will fall on the detailed and planned sequence in the following months.  Later on, Mr. Devine will give an overview in terms of the intensity and detail within the commissioning programme.  While we are all focused on the capital project works and delivery, we are also focused on the outcomes that these will deliver as part of the wider programme.  That is that the children's hospital will deliver world-class facilities and a paediatric model of care that will improve and prioritise medical outcomes for the nation&rsquo;s sickest children, while bringing around transformational change to the delivery of healthcare for the children of Ireland for generations to come.  In other words, this is not a building for 20 or 50 years but, rather, one whose design and construction are being as future-proofed as possible.  It is a hospital for the next 100 years and it is one that can adapt as models of care and clinical practice evolve. </p> <p>  Again, I reiterate Mr. Gunning&rsquo;s invitation to any members of the committee who wish to visit or revisit the site to see its progress first hand.  I know that the development board would be happy to facilitate them with this.  It is only when you see the facility in person that you get a full appreciation of the vision, scale and difference that this new hospital will make for generations to come. </p></speech>

On behalf of all members, we found it interesting.  We got a sense of the scale of the operation that is going on there and particularly of the potential of the actual site itself.  I thank them for that.  Before bringing in the members, one of the big questions in the minds of many people who are watching this morning will be how much this will actually cost.  Do we have a sense of how much it will cost?  When will we see patients moving into the hospital?  The witnesses might walk us through those two points before we get into the nub of the meeting itself.  Does anyone want to kick off on those two points?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.531" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Gunning" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#B00500"><p>I can start on those.  As I mentioned in my comments, the substantial completion is set for March 2024.  That is what the contractor has confirmed to us.  There will of course be a period of commissioning to follow that by the hospital by Children's Health Ireland, CHI, which is the hospital operating entity.  My colleagues here can discuss that.</p> <p>  On the costs and to the ongoing analysis, as I have mentioned to the committee before, we have been and continue to analyse all the costs in this project.  There is a range of cost elements.  We have already signalled that the costs will increase, which is predominantly due to the fact that this is a prolonged programme.  We are looking at a 17-month extension of the programme beyond the contractual completion date.  It was due to complete in August 2022.  It was then extended to October 2022 because of Covid-19.  We are looking at an extension of that period and that will bring additional costs.  I can say to the committee that we are engaged in a detailed process with stakeholders, who are here today, in terms of the analysis and landing those costs in a particular way that we feel comfortable to share that with colleagues here and with the Government at the appropriate time.  </p></speech>

Will it be on a phased basis?  Will they wait until the hospital is completely finished or will they be moving in in phases?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.533" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Tierney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#B00700"><p>I might come in on that.  As Mr. Gunning said, the contractor&rsquo;s own programme is now suggesting a substantial completion date of March 2024.</p><p>That will be followed by at least a six-month commissioning programme.  Colleagues within the HSE and CHI are engaged in a commissioning programme.  There are probably two commissioning stages - a technical commissioning stage around bringing equipment online and services into use and then a period to integrate the services across the existing three hospitals on one site.  Those discussions are ongoing and will be largely informed by the progress of the construction programme.  I understand completely the desire for certainty but we are in uncertain times.  We have a contractor's programme that states a date and that is the date to which we are holding the contractor.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.535" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#C00200"><p>I apologise that was not possible for me to visit the hospital in July, as I had Covid around that time.  I did not think it would be a good time to visit a hospital when there was the possibility of spreading it.  I congratulate all involved, including the development board etc., for bringing to this stage a massive development of worldwide importance and on such a scale as to amaze me and everybody else who has seen it.</p> <p>  However, there is a necessity to reassure the public on an ongoing basis that the project is on target.  I accept there will be some overruns but for what it is worth, the theory abroad is the project has already gone three or four times over its original estimate, which is not the case.  Last night, the Minister for Finance gave the D&aacute;il a very strong report on the extent to which the resources are still in place that were in place to meet the original plan.  However, there is still a need to launch a major programme to ensure that the public knows that this is a massive project that is going beyond what we had thought of previously and has still not exhausted its budget and that any attempt by anybody to strip it down, cut it back or discontinue it is not in anybody's interest and certainly not in the interest of children throughout the country, their parents or paediatric medicine in Ireland.  I ask that such a programme be put in place.  Incidentally, I visited the site last Sunday and was most impressed with it.  If a single position can be adopted to dispel the myth that this is something that can be dissected, stripped down and rendered useless, it would be good because that would be an appalling thing to happen.  There are still people throughout this country running around on the basis that this project has exceeded its usefulness.  Are the witnesses aware of that?  Are we prepared to take measures that will counter that?  </p></speech>

We agree completely.  There is an ongoing stakeholder engagement programme.  We hear the Deputy.  We will underscore a unified communications programme and engage every relevant stakeholder, including members of the public, and bring some transparency regarding where we are.  This is a matter of when and not if.  It is about building public confidence and reassurance.  As my colleague said, we are at 78% progress completion on the construction side of it and have started to mobilise both the electronic held record and the integration of services on the services side.  Perhaps through working with this committee, we can bring forward our progress reports in due course.</p></speech>

What about a campaign to promote it because there are plenty of people willing to denigrate it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.538" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Tierney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#C00500"><p>That is a commitment we will give at this committee now.  We will work again with CHI to amplify the outcomes we expect the programme to deliver, as well the construction progress update.  If we look at progress to date through the two satellite centres, very clearly the opening of CHI Connolly outpatient and urgent care centre in July 2019 is already delivering on that vision.  I can give the Deputy some facts and I believe this is the level of detail he is looking to uncover.  Up to the end of August 2022, over 14,000 children had presented to CHI Connolly urgent care centre, which is an increase from 6,795 in 2020.  The current full year projected activity for 2022 is around 27,500 cases.  Up to the end of August 2022, 7,500 children attended their outpatient appointment at CHI Connolly and projected outpatient activity for 2022 is just 11,500.  CHI Connolly commenced opening at weekends in March 2022, further improving paediatric urgent care services for the greater Dublin area.  Currently 75% of children attending are seen and treated within three hours.  We can also confirm that additional X-ray and ultrasound activity is being undertaken by radiographers in CHI Connolly, which has the additional benefit of freeing up some capacity within CHI Crumlin and CHI Temple as we head into the winter season.  CHI Connolly has provided invaluable physical capacity for several waiting list drives positively impacting on waiting times in the specialties of allergy, gastrointestinal and ultrasound diagnostics.  I draw out these points to reaffirm the Deputy's comments that the paediatric model of care is currently delivering, notwithstanding that we are progressing completion of the site at St. James's.  I agree with the Deputy that it is important to communicate more with the public and our stakeholders to show we are already starting to derive benefits even though we are 80% complete on the campus at St. James's.  I can also give an update on Tallaght, given that it has been open just over a year.  I can provide the committee with a note after the meeting.  We will look to underscore more communications in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.539" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#C00600"><p>A progress report to show the success, benefits and positive side of the project, as opposed to what many people want to show as a negative side is very important.  Is there anything of concern that Mr. Tierney might like to share with the committee regarding the project at this time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.540" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Tierney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#C00700"><p>As I said in my opening remarks, we live in uncertain times across all walks of life.  The health sector and this programme are not immune.  Everybody is craving certainty, which we do not have at this time.  We have been through a period of very volatile trade markets where we have seen material increases in costs in respect of timber and steel but at this point in the project, that risk is largely mitigated against, given progress.  We are seeing an impact on supply chains and trade chains through increased energy costs and increased disruption.  We are just under 80% through the construction programme and those risks are mitigating but there is still volatility in our construction sector and global markets on which we rely.  Notwithstanding that BAM is a tier 1 construction company and has reach into global supply chains, we must remain concerned as a project sponsor and a project funder but we are working very closely through the HSE, the board and CHI to get certainty on programme assurance.  At the moment, we are holding the contractor to account through the board in terms of achieving substantial completion in March 2024.  I can assure the Deputy that the Department and the board are taking every step possible to mitigate against risks to that construction programme.</p></speech>

Doing so on a building site makes it all the more difficult.</p><p>I congratulate them on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.543" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#D00200"><p>I welcome our guests.  When we hear about the national children&rsquo;s hospital and when it is talked about in the media, the issues of costs and the timeline inevitably dominate, and I think our guests will accept the reasons for that.  There have been cost overruns, it is an expensive project and there is no certainty yet on the timeline for when it will be opened to deliver the services people need.  Nevertheless, this is a massive project and the scale of what it will do for children's healthcare cannot be understated.  It will be a world-class centre for the treatment of children and for training and education.  I would love to get more detail and have a full session of this committee to focus on the additional capacity that will come and the healthcare changes that will arise out of this hospital.  If I get a chance, I will ask some of those questions, but we need to get as much clarity as possible on some of the other issues.</p> <p>  I acknowledge Mr. Gunning will not be able to give us definitive costs, as he pointed out in his opening statement.  We were here 15 months ago and no matter how many times we ask the question, we are not going to get the answer.  Even so, he might be able to shed some light on what he said in his opening statement.  He stated that the Government has approved a capital investment of &euro;1.433 billion and that expenditure up to the end of August had amounted to &euro;1.13 billion.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

As we know, claims are still being examined and so on.  Are we likely to exceed the &euro;1.43 billion figure?  I accept he will not be able to give us a specific figure but, in his view, given where we are, is it likely that figure will be exceeded?  Can Mr. Gunning at least give us that information?</p></speech>

As we look at the programme and the 17-month extension, the additional cost will bring us beyond that sum.  We are working closely with our colleagues here to scrutinise, analyse and land that additional cost to the two substantial companies-----</p></speech>

There is going to be additional cost and that will land when it lands.  That is my response.  I have to be very careful in what I say here, as the Deputy indicated.  I have responsibilities that require me not, in any sense, to damage our legal ability to defend this contract or our negotiating ability.  I appreciate the Deputy's acknowledgement of that-----</p></speech>

He mentioned claims defences, the implementation of the Committee of Public Accounts recommendations and costs relating to Covid and Brexit.  I assume some of those additional costs have been borne.</p></speech>

With tender price inflation, up to 4% is taken by the contractor.</p></speech>

The average tender price inflation in 2019 was 6.67% and that resulted in a payment to the contractor for inflation of &euro;1.77 million.  In 2020, while inflation was 2.48%, the formula is a compound formula, so the net rate levied in that period was 1.15%, which yielded a payment to the contractor of just under &euro;1.5 million.  In 2021, inflation shot up to 10.24%, which, again on a compounded basis, equated to 7.39%, yielding a payment of just under &euro;18 million.  All those figures include VAT.</p> <p>  We have run an analysis of this year's payment and we assume the rate will be approximately 10%, which on a compounded basis becomes nearly 13.4%, meaning a payment to the contractor, including VAT, of about &euro;30 million for 2022.  The total payments to the contractor for inflation amount to about &euro;50 million so far, including VAT.  As I said, these were outside the &euro;1.433 billion figure.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Gunning outline, in simple terms, how many claims have been made, or at least notified, and how many are outstanding?

If we start with 1,623 claims, the number of claims substantiated, whereby the contractor has to give us a written explanation of what it is, is 1,296.  Of the 1,296, the ER has determined 1,131.  The contractor value that the contractor was looking for associated with that figure was &euro;503 million.  The employer&rsquo;s representative, that is, the independent entity that reviews these claims and determines them, has stated the contractor is entitled to &euro;9 million of that &euro;503 million.

With any site that becomes available as a result of the existing service being relocated or deemed unnecessary, there is a consideration around the reuse of that site.  We currently have no definitive plans for the sites at Crumlin or Temple Street but I will provide a note to the Deputy in respect of some considerations that are at play.</p></speech>

I had a discussion with the head of CHI about the Crumlin site.  There was some talk of that possibly being used for nursing accommodation.  We know that the cost of living in Dublin for nurses is profound.  If a process is being put in place to look at the two sites for a change of use, it would be useful for this committee to engage with that process.  I am sure members of the committee have many ideas.  I hope that is something Mr. Tierney can take with him to the Department.</p> <p>  I wish everybody well.  Notwithstanding all the issues around costs and timelines and frustrations that we cannot get answers, we all accept that when the hospital is built, it will be a fantastic addition to children's health in Ireland.</p></speech>

I would like to return to the table of claims we were talking about a few minutes ago and to clarify the situation.  The number of claims determined by the employer's representative, ER, was 1,131.  Determined claims that are disputed and referred to the project board amounted to 989.  Does that imply that the difference of 142 between those two figures are claims that have been resolved?</p></speech>

It is not necessarily clear whether the contractor intends to refer those to dispute resolution or not.  There is a question mark over the difference between those two numbers.

There is a process.  However, currently, and since May last year, the parties, namely, the NPHDB and the contractor, BAM, have been working in a detailed engagement process around the project.  As part of that engagement, we have agreed a moratorium on disputes.  While claims are still received, we have agreed to park the disputes process on a temporary basis to allow the teams on both sides to focus on the important work of getting the hospital finished as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I met senior executives from BAM last Thursday.  I meet them on a monthly basis and often at times between those discussions.  It is fair to say, and we have heard this from the most senior levels of BAM, that all parties are committed to getting this hospital open as soon as possible.  It is fair to say that there is the project of getting the hospital done and then there are the other aspects around commercial matters on which we are working in parallel.

With all due respect, that is not normally the way big projects work.  The development board does not want to find itself in a position where it is over a barrel in respect of the opening of the hospital because of the enormous number of disputes that have been parked and remain to be resolved.  A difficult situation will arise because those disputes have not been resolved at the point when the hospital is due to open.  Can Mr. Tierney outline what is the Department's view of this strategy?</p></speech>

Both the contractor and the board have entitlements under the current contract.  That is a fact.  The contractor is exercising its rights.  The board is doing the same is in protecting the State's position.  Mr. Gunning was making the point that the moratorium freed up capacity to concentrate on the construction progress.  While we have experienced delays, real and achievable progress is being made on the ground.  The moratorium is designed to take away the distraction of being embroiled in claims management and difficult claims discussions with the contractor.  It has freed up capacity and allowed the project to progress.  I take the Deputy's point that it does not give us any visibility in respect of cost certainty now.  However, that is the nature of these kinds of contracts.  Clause 10 of the public works contract sets up the contract in that way.</p></speech>

As an organisation, a funder or a sponsor, we have no control over that.  The process is outlined in the public works contract we are currently administering.  It would be better to resolve matters before we get to conciliation or the High Court but we have no control over that.

It is a magnificent development on a scale unlike any other public building in this country.  I have no doubt it will be fantastic when it finally opens.

The technical commissioning precedes March 2024.  On that date, the technical commissioning will be complete, and all the systems and everything will be working.  It is then handed over to Children's Health Ireland, which will conduct the operational commissioning of the hospital, including the integration the Deputy talked about.</p></speech>

There are costs to do with claims.  For example, there are a number of Covid claims the contractor has put in that will have to be resolved.  There is the resolution of the sums that were provisional at the time the contract was signed that will have to be finalised.  There is the additional cost for the running of the development board and the design teams.  As we are now going beyond August 2022, there will be additional costs and we need to cover all of those.  Those are a number of the cost items.</p></speech>

I met some of them when we visited the site.  I was very struck by it and had long and interesting conversations with Mr. Gunning and the project manager.  I get the uniqueness of the site.  For members of the public who might be watching, I was very struck by the fact that, if I interpreted it correctly, if this was a house-building project, normally a contractor has all the space around the house in which to work and the rest of it.  However, this project has the footprint of the hospital and everything has to take place within it because everything else is built around it.  That imposes additional costs.  I understand that it is a pretty unique project.  I am aware that it is a cutting edge project, not just from a medical and children's health perspective, but from an architectural perspective.  I am also aware that it is so unique and cutting edge that it is being visited and international inquiries are coming in about the development of it.  These are all very positive things.  We await the completion of the hospital.</p> <p>  In layman's terms, and I am not trying to belittle this, I could not help thinking of Dermot Bannon who presents "Room to Improve".  Every time he revisits a site there is an additional expense and the quantity surveyor is tearing his or her hair out.  We are trying to account for taxpayers' money to some degree.  What is the difference between this process and a much more minor process in trying to quantify how much this project will cost in the end?  What kind of processes are there to determine that and to determine the impact of things like inflation on it?  These are the kind of normal things that come into any building project.  Someone sits down and says that inflation will severely impact this.  At some stage, we will know what the final bill is.</p> <p>  The witnesses must have some sense of what the final bill will be, with some of the things coming in.  If they were to quantify it, and let us get it out now, can they give us even a ballpark figure?  I ask for this is in part because, like many infrastructural projects that get to a certain stage, the public resigns itself to some degree to overrun costs when it begins to see a project materialise.  It happened with the Luas, the Dublin Port tunnel and terminal 2 at Dublin Airport.  People then say, "This is almost here.  We just have to get on with it."  Do we have a ballpark or some kind of figure that we can land on regarding the overall cost?</p></speech>

A great deal of analysis has been going on.  I have appeared before this committee a number of times and given various guidance regarding our processes that are in place, and that seek to land that particular point of what exactly the cost will be to bring us to substantial completion.  That work continues.  I was invited earlier, before the Deputy arrived, to volunteer the same information.  I indicated that I was not in a position and was not willing to do that.

There is very little concrete left for us to pour.  It is only needed for the external works.  The frame is complete and everything is complete in the building.  Concrete is needed for just a few foundations and a little external works for bus shelters or play structures and so on.  It is a very small amount.  We are still awaiting the detail on that 10% and how it will apply.  When we know what that is, we will carry out a review of what the impact will be but we do not expect it to be-----</p></speech>

Certainly, it is open and it is performing.  We are already delivering.  I can confirm, for the record, that the outpatient emergency care centre in Tallaght, currently in its first year of operation, has provided at least just under 3,000 additional outpatient appointments.  We have seen just over 25,000 emergency care presentations between January and September of this year.  The number of outpatient appointments has been increasing throughout 2022, as four new paediatric consultants took up posts throughout the year, with the final appointee having taken up their post.</p> <p>  I can also confirm that Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, CHI, Tallaght accommodates the existing children&rsquo;s emergency care unit relocated from the adult hospital and will expand outpatient services to children and young people from Dublin south west, south city and the surrounding areas of Kildare and Wicklow.</p> <p>  I was struck by Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s comments earlier on.  We committed to build a stronger communications campaign around how we are performing both in Tallaght and Connolly, even as we are nearing completion of construction on St. James&rsquo;s campus.</p></speech>

The overspend on the budget was pretty much associated with additional investment at the Tallaght University Hospital campus, which we had to upgrade infrastructure to support the outpatient emergency care centre.</p></speech>

As others have said, I was hugely impressed with the scale and size and what the project can and will be.  As I said at the committee previously, a picture paints 1,000 words, and a site visit paints another 1,000 or 10,000.  Well done to all involved.  I am proud to part of the Government that sanctioned this and got it moving.  There was much talk for many years on the delivery of this project.</p> <p>  Others have touched on the disputes.  We were given the example that Covid was one of the reasons.  Can the witnesses tell us the highest value of an individual claim?  During Covid, how long was the construction of the facility shut down?  Was the company in receipt of the State supports that were provided at the time, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and all of that?</p></speech>

The Senator may remember there was a situation where the contractor was very slow to come back to work after that period, but eventually coming back perhaps a month after the approved period.  The Senator can probably imagine there are claims in and around that and there are claims for additional delays and costs associated with, shall we say, restarting post-Covid shutdown.  That is the subject of a number of claims and ongoing dialogue.</p> <p>  On how I would characterise the claims, they are predominantly for what are called &ldquo;extensions of time&rdquo;, which is the contractor is claiming delay for various reasons.  I will not go into the exact numbers, but ten claims account for 80% of the entire quantum claimed.  That is where the primary focus is from the development board&rsquo;s point of view on the big money side of things.</p> <p>  On whether BAM was involved in various Government schemes, that is not within our remit.  That is a separate issue between BAM and Government.  I am not aware of the details of that so I cannot comment on that.  However, I presume, like many companies, it continued.  Certainly, while the site was closed, the back office work of BAM continued - the procurement and all of the activities happened, other than having workers on-site.  </p> <p>  BAM did an excellent job of managing the return to work and all the Covid and health protocols.  It was a very good example of how to do it properly.  I know we have our differences on things, but I would like to acknowledge its excellent work in that particular area.</p></speech>

The contractor does not get any additional money under the contract for that delay, however, they get a day-for-day.  While the Government mandated close down was happening, it was allowed to extend the contract by that period.  It did not get any payment for the site works at that time.</p></speech>

Deputy Cullinane asked the question of when procedures will take place.  I think it was said during the tour that the busiest time in the existing children hospitals would be the winter period.  I am not sure whether it is the post-Christmas winter period in particular.  Therefore, in terms of the transfer of patients, it would not be during that period and would be perhaps later on in the spring or summer.  Could Mr. Tierney confirm that?  The question was asked when the facility would be up and running.</p></speech>

International recruitment is necessary and there are huge recruitment challenges in all areas of the country.  The lack of accommodation will, we hope, change over the coming years but in a capital city with an influx of people, it would make perfect sense to look at accommodation options.</p> <p>  On inflation, there will have been forward buying of materials and so on.

It treats it in a particular way.  It is a lagging indicator for the previous year.  It looks at three different scores of inflation.  Three measures are taken from three different institutions to come up with an average, which is applied retrospectively.  There are opportunities for the contractor to optimise and buy forward, where possible.  The reality, however, in the construction sector today is that there are material shortages, whether they are Covid related or Brexit related or due to the additional costs of transport and logistics.  These are all matters that are landing.  While people might have the best intentions to plan ahead, there is a lot of uncertainty and turbulence in that particular sector currently.</p></speech>

There are also IT hubs and so on.  There are 36,000 data points that must be threaded from IT rooms that are 90 m apart.  There are hundreds of kilometres of cable in the building.  Every data point is, on average, 70 m of cable.  That is 70 m by 36,000 just for data cabling, and another 56,000 building management system points, BMS, that monitor how the building behaves, including temperature and the opening and closing of windows.  The electrical installation is vast.  As part of future proofing the hospital and making it world class, we have interwoven all of that data cabling so that, God forbid, if anything were to happen to one of the intensive care hubs in the future, the hospital could quickly switch over to a second one.  We have full resilience built in with regard to data cabling.  There is also full resilience built into the back-up generation.  The main distribution boards and sub-distribution boards all have A&amp;B.</p></speech>

I return to the issue of staffing when the hospital opens.  Taking the hospitals all the staff are going to come from, can we get a breakdown of the current make-up of staff in the existing hospitals who will be moving to the new children's hospital?  The officials may not be able to give it to me today but could we have that broken down by nursing staff, care assistants, junior doctors and consultants so we can get an idea of the total number that will now be moving to this site when it is fully finished?</p></speech>

Going back over what other people have raised about accommodation, it is a huge challenge.  I know of people who worked in the UK, and at every hospital they went to, there was accommodation available to them, and that was more than 20 or 25 years ago.  We have done nothing on that.  With the colleges we are beginning to get it right with student accommodation, but it is 20 or 25 years too late.  Do we need to start building this issue into healthcare planning?  It is not just about beds in the hospital.  We have very many junior doctors who have six- or 12-month contracts, and it is likewise with nurses.  They need training and to move from hospital to hospital.  Do we now need to change policy in this area, especially in the major cities like Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway?  Do we need to do a lot more planning in that area?</p></speech>

It would need to be done now rather than when the hospital opens, because if we want to give the best to the staff and to retain them, then this is going to be a challenge.  The rental costs in Dublin, Cork and all the other cities are a challenge.  Is now not the time to have a careful plan on this?  We have a two-year timeframe in which to look at this so we can ensure we hold on to the staff we have, who are very dedicated and committed as well.</p></speech>

If they have a five-year contract, they are doing a year in Cork, two or three years in Dublin and a year in Galway, and they are running into this kind of problem as well.

There has been huge patience and co-operation and the meeting should not go by without the officials addressing that and how it is going.  Consider the impact having a huge building site on your doorstep would have in the form of noise levels and everything else.</p> <p>  I have a couple of other points.  I do not understand the compound rate.  Maybe there is a simpler term or maybe the officials could send us a note.  I do not know about the people at home but I did not understand that and I assume many people listening would not either.  It is important we as legislators know how that actually works.</p> <p>  The fitting-out of the hospital was mentioned and I raised during the visit the issue of the 60 ICU beds.  On the basis of a growing population and so on, are there sufficient beds within the national children's hospital?  We have not built it yet and we are talking about whether there is enough space in it for that and whether there is flexibility within the site if we wanted to put additional beds there.  I asked that on the day and people were saying it was sufficient.  Is it?</p></speech>

There has been much engagement with the residents through the residents' project monitoring committee, which was set up by the development board in co-operation with the local residents.  It is also a good opportunity to point out the community benefit fund that was put in place by BAM.  Contributions go to local charities and activities from the project to try to ensure there is a value-add in the local area from the fact the project is continuing.  There are also the efforts to ensure and try to drive employment within the project and ultimately the hospital for the local community in this new hospital which is quite significant on the skyline.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to do that.</p> <p>  On the compound, there is an appendix to the contract that has it.  We will share that calculation with the committee and do so shortly.  I ask Dr. Curtis to deal with the question on ICU beds and that particular issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.724" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Emma Curtis" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#J02400"><p>I thank Mr. Gunning.  When the healthcare planning happened, it took into account current service provision and unmet need, that is, the limitations of current infrastructure and what you might optimally have in a new environment.  It also looked at Central Statistics Office, CSO, population data up to 2041.  It also looked at developments in paediatric care and what it was felt was coming down the line.  The other piece that was useful was the HSE had commissioned a review of intensive care services.  That was carried out by an intensivist from SickKids in Toronto.  That was also useful and informative because that had been a review of paediatric intensive care services and where they needed to go.  Given all that, the decision was made that 60 intensive care beds were likely to meet future need.  Obviously however, medicine progresses and a new initiative in the new hospital is a neonatal intensive care department that is separate to paediatric intensive care.  We currently look after sick neonates but they are looked after within paediatric intensive care.</p><p>The future hospital, however, will have an 18-bed neonatal ICU unit.  One thing that is evident is that year-on-year there is an increase, and a very welcome one, in the survival of very premature infants.  These children are vulnerable, however, and often have medical and surgical comorbidities.  Therefore, the plan was that 60% should meet our needs.  This would not be with full occupancy.  The projected occupancy of ICU is 75%, whereas that of standard bed units is 85%.  Obviously, we do plan for some spare capacity, but we planned a greater spare capacity in the ICU because it is a limited resource.  The plan is that this would be sufficient.  In the design of the hospital, though, the ICU occupies two-thirds of the large hot block.  I may not be exactly precise about that two-thirds estimation, but at the other side of the building there is an extensive piece of soft area, which is currently designated for workspaces.  Therefore, there is an obvious expansion capacity within the current building design, should that be required in future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.726" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#K00200"><p>In a post-pandemic context, we all realise the importance of ICU beds.  It is good to know we have this type of flexibility, because who knows what we may be facing in future?  Another small aspect in the overall context, but a major one for the patients going into the facility, is that I am conscious it is an all-Ireland facility.  In this context, accommodation for nurses was mentioned.  There are also facilities to allow parents to stay in situations where children may be seriously ill.  There is a major challenge, however, with hotel beds.  I have come across people looking after loved ones in hospital who were sleeping in their cars.  I refer to the cost of parking as well.  This is not just an issue in the context of parents going to the hospital but also for the staff coming from other hospitals.  Has this aspect been explored?</p> <p>  On the additional footfall that will be going into the hospital, and the associated requirement for additional buses and extra Luas trams, in the overall context of how people will be able to get to and from the site, have discussions in this regard been ongoing?  We would like to think so.  Is part of the plan concerned with how it will be possible to get people in and out of the hospital in a safe and orderly manner?  I refer to those people who will be working in and visiting the hospital, as well as the patients who will be using it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.727" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phelim Devine" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#K00300"><p>I will take this question.  On the accommodation aspect, a 52-bed family accommodation unit is to be built outside the hospital.  It will be adjacent and linked through the basement.  This is a separate procurement and we are working closely with the HSE in this regard.  This contract will go to tender by the end of this year or early next year.  It will then take approximately 18 months to build.</p> <p>  Turning to mobility management, CHI and St. James's Hospital are working closely on this element.  There are other stakeholders on the campus, including the Blood Transfusion Board and Trinity College Dublin research facilities.  These are all part of a campus-wide mobility management plan.  This examines optimising public transportation, vehicular transportation, pedestrian and cycling routes into the campus.  We have taken the opportunity in the design of the hospital to provide 500 bicycle parking spaces, most of which are in a car park underground.  We also have optimised parking for patients and their families.  The 675 spaces we are providing are for patients and their families, which is about one and a half times the number of spaces available on the adult campus.  Therefore, as part of the EIS, we did a great deal of detailed work to ensure we have the right numbers of parking spaces.  This provision does not exist in the three hospitals now.  The committee will be aware that Temple Street hospital has no parking, while that at Crumlin hospital is limited.  We have now addressed this issue.</p> <p>  Equally, the NTA's roll-out of BusConnects, which will occur shortly, perhaps by next year, will mean many new buses will be coming onto the campus.  While from a vehicular perspective we have looked after all the patients and their families, we must also think about all the staff who will be working in St. James's Hospital and in the CHI when it opens.  We will be talking about 7,000 people at that stage.  Taking students into account as well, the overall total could be close to 9,000 people on campus.  Most of those will use public transport, cycle or walk, and some will drive.  Therefore, there is a joined-up, campus-wide approach to mobility management.</p></speech>

Since we have some time, I ask one of the witnesses to expand on this initiative and how it is going to operate.  Do we need to follow up with legislation in this regard?  How is this system going to develop?  I refer again to the idea of moving away from a paper-based system and this meaning it would be possible for people outside Dublin and in rural areas to have instant access to files.  On the basis that this is an all-Ireland facility, I refer to the connection that will exist in this regard as well.  This is one of the more exciting elements of the new children's hospital.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.729" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Tierney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#K00500"><p>On electronic health records, EHR, and as I said in my opening statement, CHI has now signed a contract with a vendor, Epic, and it is starting the deployment of an electronic health record system for the new children's hospital.  This ultimately means the delivery of a paediatric model of care in a paperless environment.  The deployment of EHR on the campus is not a first.  We have reached somewhere between 50% and 70% of deployment of electronic health records for national newborn and maternity systems.  We have also deployed electronic health records for the National Rehabilitation Hospital and the National Forensic Mental Health Service facility in Portrane.  We are also now considering how best to deploy electronic health records as we start to mobilise regional health areas.</p> <p>  How can we truly deliver integrated services from a community and an acute perspective?  How can we integrate these elements?  What will this mean for patients as they journey through the healthcare continuum?  There are issues and challenges, of course.  These have been well noted, and include legacy systems and fragmentation of systems.  The real challenge, however, concerns how we can integrate systems from a technical perspective.  We are now starting to turn our minds to consideration of what this level of capability means for our regional health areas.  Obviously, institutional and cultural issues will be encountered as we move from paper to electronic records.  The Government has approved the heads of a health information Bill to allow the Department to progress this process.  For the first time, this will provide absolute clarity around two purposes of information sharing.  The first would be deemed the primary purpose, and this refers to ensuring patients' data follow them.  This would be the case whether the healthcare setting concerned is private, public or community practice.  The proposed Bill will clarify patients' entitlement to their data and how they can receive them.  The second purpose, which is important from a health planning perspective, is to allow the use of patient data at an aggregate level to plan for future needs.  It will mean that as we are planning for our future health capacity and needs we will have data and evidence to give us insights regarding what we need to do, when and where.</p> <p>  Turning to the issue of the parking charge, the Minister has decided to cap the daily parking charge at &euro;10.  We are working with the HSE to see how we can best institute this charge in the context of a procurement process to engage a provider to run and manage this contract on behalf of the State.</p> <p>  I turn now to the last element of the question and I will add to Mr. Devine's commentary on transport planning.  Regarding how staff and patients access the existing campus, there are already strong links between St. James's Hospital and the NTA, through engagement with Dublin Bus and the operator of the Luas, concerning how to best match transport capacity to the needs of the campus.  CHI is also active in this discussion in the context of understanding what it means in terms of being able to rely on public transport to access the site.  Extensive parking is also being provided underground to facilitate parents as they arrive with children for treatment.  This is all part of a wider transport planning consideration.</p></speech>

I thank him for that.  I will return to the issue of the claims and seek more clarification from Mr. Gunning.  Before that, however, the only date referred to in the opening statement is given in the context where it is said it is hoped to achieve substantial completion, or that at least the contractor has signalled that it hopes there will be substantial completion, by March 2024, with a hand over then to CHI.  I would imagine, then, that it is anticipated that the hand over to CHI will happen sometime in mid-2024.  Is this the timeframe we are working towards?</p><p>I know there is a period of commissioning but in terms of the handover, are we talking about 2024?</p></speech>

Our intention is to bring forward the engagement with CHI so that the substantial completion and the handover happen at the same time.  That will optimise things and lead into the operational commissioning, which is the CHI's responsibility.</p></speech>

I am not sure if Mr. Tierney or Mr. Gunning can answer this.  There are 989 claims still outstanding, in whatever form they are outstanding, and there may well be more High Court challenges as well.  As Mr. Gunning articulated earlier, there is a suspension of the process of dealing with those claims.  Do all of those claims have to be completely done and dusted before the handover or is it possible that there will be outstanding claims even after the hospital is handed over?</p></speech>

It is the case, then, that all of these disputes, and the additional cost that may be associated with them, could go on for months, if not years, after the project is completed and the hospital is open and doing business.</p></speech>

Maybe it was just an omission, but it would have been better had he mentioned this in his statement.  He said that it was imperative that the NPHDB evaluates each claim and robustly defends those it considers not to be justified, which is fair enough.  He also said that there was a comprehensive process in place for the assessment of claims submitted by the contractor.  What he did not say in his opening statement is that the process is currently suspended.</p></speech>

Immediately after making that point, he then said that robustly defending claims is both time-consuming and costly.  I understand why the board has sought a pausing of the claims process.  It wants to concentrate, with the contractor, on getting the hospital built and there is an element of wisdom in that.  However, Mr. Gunning did say that the process of defending claims is both time-consuming and costly and that is the point I am making.  When we are talking about the final cost of the national children's hospital, given everything I have just said, it will be long after the hospital is built before we get to a final cost.  If he is agreeing that it is time-consuming and the board has put the process on hold, then even after the handover in March 2024, we are still going to have some of those claims potentially, if not probably, not dealt with.  Is it the case that it could be years before we have a final cost?</p></speech>

Deputy Shortall raised this issue earlier as well.  If it is a time-consuming process, then it would be good for us to have some sense as to when that process will resume.

People will be a bit surprised to hear that long after the hospital is opened and providing services, we are still likely to be locked into a process of contractual disputes around costs.  It is accepted that the costs will probably be in excess of the &euro;1.4 billion that the Minister has outlined but our job is to hold the Minister to account and the Minister's job is to ensure that we have cost control because ultimately, if there are additional costs, the taxpayer has to pay for them.  There is no indication here as to what the amount will be or how long it is going to take.  It will surprise people that long after the hospital is built, we are still likely to be locked in disputes, High Court challenges and cost differences.  I accept that Mr. Gunning cannot tell us when that is going to be resolved but I suspect - and I do not think I will be proved wrong - that we are talking about years rather than months.</p></speech>

Approximately 1,000 claims are outstanding at the moment and the estimated cost of those is &euro;500 million.  Mr. Gunning said that ten claims account for 80% of that value, or approximately &euro;400 million, as of now.  What is the likely impact of inflation on those?  Are they fixed figures or are they likely to be impacted by inflation when the final reckoning comes?</p></speech>

The contractor could reformulate some of those claims as time progresses.  That option is available but inflation is addressed within a separate clause in the contract relating to the main expenditure that we anticipate.  It could happen but what we will need to guard against is any element of double payment for inflation to the contractor.</p></speech>

As for inflation, it will be our responsibility when each individual claim comes to dispute resolution, whether it is conciliation or otherwise, to put forward our case regarding inflation.

While the contractor has valued just over 1,000 of its 1,200 claims at &euro;500 million, the board has valued those at &euro;7.5 million.  There is a balance to be struck here between what the contractor is claiming an entitlement to and where the board has landed as a position.  That is the state we are operating within on behalf of the taxpayer.  The board has a responsibility to get the best value in its engagement with the contractor.  We have two positions.  That is the reality of the commercial engagement that is ongoing at this moment.  All I can say is that if and when there is clarity on a outturn on the construction contract, we will be going back to Government.  There are no two ways about it.  We have an approved sanction for the figure of &euro;1.143 billion.  If the costs rise beyond that, we will be obliged to go back to the Government to seek an increase.  </p></speech>

I raised this at our visit, and I was told that they were aware that there is a big area around Drumcondra, Marino and out to Glasnevin, where parents find it difficult to access one of the urgent care units and that consideration was being given to a further unit.  Can the Department of Health confirm that it is involved in that?</p> <p>  As a related issue, what is the situation as regards the Temple Street building?  For non-serious conditions, such as sports injuries, scalds, and that type of thing, parents on the northside of Dublin are used to jumping on the bus with their child or jumping into a car and going to Temple Street.  You are talking about people going to Connolly or to Crumlin, which is certainly not convenient for many people.  What is the plan for the Temple Street building?  Is it a possibility for a further urgent care unit?  </p></speech>

My colleague, Mr. McKeith, has confirmed that there is an ongoing engagement between the HSE and CHI to look at both Crumlin and Temple Street in the context of future uses, whether that is a need for accommodation or, as the Deputy said, whether there is another need to provide healthcare services.  However, no definitive use case has been defined.  We might provide a note on some of those considerations.</p><p>In the context of general transport planning, I understand the concern the Deputy raises.  We can engage with the HSE and the NTA to see if we can reach any solution or agreement on that.  Again, that would be primarily a matter for the NTA working with Dublin Bus and other transport providers in terms of existing links.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to understand where BusConnects fits in within that.</p></speech>

In other words, if claims amounted to 5% of the final figure of &euro;82.5 million, we could correlate that, potentially, to the total overrun cost for the NCH, giving an overrun cost of in or around 5%?</p></speech>

First, all of the three projects are bespoke projects and sit on three different host campuses.  Second, the satellite centre projects - the outpatient and emergency care centres - are less complex projects and we had two different procurement models.  I would not use a percentage on one to work out a percentage on the other.  They have to stand alone.</p></speech>

BAM is claiming &euro;503 million and the independent employer's representative has valued BAM's claims at &euro;9 million.  When we offset from that the savings and the employer's claims of approximately &euro;5.5 million, the net change to the contract as of today - the additional cost to the State - is &euro;7.5 million on the &euro;880 million contract.  That is the best indication we can give currently.  We cannot give assurance that some of these big claims will not land in BAM's favour, but we are doing everything we can to defend against those claims.  I give that assurance.</p></speech>

Mr. Gunning has a background in business.  I think it was in Hewlett-Packard.  Let us go back to our room to improve analogy.  If Mr. Gunning was before Hewlett-Packard's board, the chairman would insist on a final figure.  Has the Secretary General of the Department looked for a final figure?  Has Mr. Gunning had conversations with the Secretary General and the Minister that he is unable to have with us for reasons of commercial sensitivity?  Would that be a reasonable thing to do for the moment?  The Minister has to provide the budget.  I presume at some stage the Minister or the Secretary General has asked what the bottom line is and how much the State is likely to have to commit here if this is not a bottomless pit.  Have those conversations been had?  I imagine in the context of a company like Hewlett-Packard Mr. Gunning would have faced requests to cut various areas because the company would not go over its budget.  I would welcome a general answer to that.</p></speech>

Deputy Lahart may remember that we have provided scenarios and updates to our stakeholders, formerly shareholders, right back to January 2021.  We have been engaged in a very intensive process of continuing to update, refine and work to try to quantify and scrutinise each and every one of those cost elements.  We are getting to the point where we are able to call it, as Deputy Lahart says we will have been asked to do.  I have not had a discussion with the Secretary General for some time.  Our day-to-day activities within the development board are with the stakeholders - the people who are here beside us.  We are the team that is working this cost forecast for this project through to substantial completion.</p> <p>  Going back to my public company days, the key issues in any project are cost, scope and timeline.  They are all related.  We have the scope nailed down.  We are attempting to nail down the timeline, but we have had some movement in the timeline, mostly for reasons outside of the contractors' control in terms of the headwinds they have faced.  We are trying to tie down these variables and once we do that, we can give a very definitive picture in terms of the potential costs for this project, within a reasonable plus or minus.  We are approaching that point.  We are not there yet but we are arriving at that point.  That dialogue is very intensive between us at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.831" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#N02900"><p>I was very impressed with the BAM personnel we met, not just from a professional perspective but that many of them have bought in to the project emotionally.  That is important to state.  I know the new national maternity hospital is probably not going to be as bespoke, but what would Mr. Tierney say if he met the board and was asked for advice on his experience of dealing with pretty significant projects?  The reason I ask is that I was a public representative, a councillor, in the years after 1999 when motorway projects began.  Companies drove a coach and four through local authorities and the State and there were incredible cost overruns.  These companies were experts at making claims.  The Government got caught out until 2002 or 2003 when it brought in fixed terms and penalties if projects were not delivered on time.</p><p>What we had then was a plethora of contracts that were delivered ahead of time and below the original contracted price.  What has been learned from this?  I get the bespoke nature of it.  We cannot underestimate Covid and the materials cost inflation - maybe someone will be able to account for that - but it appears from the headlines that the cost will exceed expectations.  If I understood the CEO correctly, the excess cost right now is &euro;9 million in claims.  That is a big sum but it seems that a tight game is being played in the overall cost of it if some of that has been due to court decisions and if those decisions land your way, as was said.  The figure we are dealing with is between &euro;9 million and &euro;500 million, which is a big gulf.</p></speech>

In my response to Deputy Shortall, I said that the public spending code has been adapted to take on board the journey and the learnings.  In the case of any project over &euro;100 million, as it goes through a gated process from outline through to post-market engagement, there is now an obligation to layer in an external insurance review at two of the gates.  Every project over &euro;100 million is now subject to a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform process, which it calls a major projects advisory group.  That seeks to remove as much uncertainty as possible as a project travels through the public spending code to the point of contract award.  Full and 100% certainty will never be achieved because that is the nature of the market we engage with and of construction projects over &euro;100 million, but the key learning and what it seeks to do is get as much certainty as possible before we commit to contract.  We are tied to public works contracts and they are on a fixed price, lump sum and time-bound basis.  That is under review by the Office of Government Procurement under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We await the outcome of that review in terms of that contract form and how we might use it in the context of future developments, whether it is the national maternity hospital, the construction of elective care centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway or future projects over &euro;100 million.</p></speech>

I thank all our guests.  The national children's hospital is an important subject.  Construction of this hospital has been an ongoing issue in recent decades and it will finally take place.  I visited the site a number of months ago along with a number of other Deputies and Senators and it is extremely impressive.  When it is finished it will be a major asset to our public health system.  Notwithstanding that, there is one big cloud over the whole construction and there is no getting away from the question of cost.  I know all our guests have mentioned cost but it staggers the mind how this has spiralled out of control.  In 2014 the original cost of the construction of the national children's hospital was &euro;800 million, in 2018 that was quantified to &euro;1.4 billion, in 2022 it is &euro;1.7 billion and I am guessing that the cost will definitely go over &euro;2 billion.  All the indications are that it will go over that &euro;2 billion mark, which is an extraordinary amount of money for a hospital.</p> <p>  I do not know if the witnesses can answer the following question definitively: how did people get this so wrong?  How did they get the cost so wrong for the construction?  We all know construction prices can go over budget over time.  We all understand that and Covid was thrown into the environment as well but how could a company get it so wrong?  Was it self-inflicted or were the players in the ongoing construction of this project completely unprofessional?  How did it go so wrong in the cost?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-05a.848" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Gunning" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022100500002#O01700"><p>I want to reset and make sure we are all dealing with the same set of facts.  The approved investment by Government from the end of 2018 for this project is &euro;1.433 billion.  That includes the construction contract, which is the BAM works and it includes the additional costs of the development board, the design team and other related charges which come in.  Of that &euro;1.433 billion, as of right now &euro;1.13 billion has been spent.  We are still below the Government approval, therefore, but there are cost pressures on that.  I do not mean to be reminding the Deputy of the following point but outside of that approval there were already a number of items that were not given definitive quanta within that &euro;1.433 billion approval.  We had items outside of that, such as inflation, which we have talked about already and which we can go through again.  There was the cost of defending the claims, which was significant, and there were additional costs due to Covid and Brexit.  There would have been some change in cost due to regulatory change of the design but not much.  That is the position and the major contributor to the cost increase as we look forward is delay.  The contract is in delay and a lot of discussion can be had on that.</p><p>Certainly, there is no doubt that the current construction environment and current set of uncertainties with regard to what Brexit, Covid-19 and other aspects have inflicted on the contract are significant.  That will all be fought out as to who has to pay for that in the conciliation and dispute resolution and possibly the High Court.  As I have already summarised, at the moment, we see we are responsible for &euro;9 million of that &euro;500 million or so of the costs.  Where we are responsible and the contractor has an entitlement, we have paid that money, as we are required to do.  That is the actual position.</p><p> As I mentioned earlier, as we look forward, there is a process ongoing to look at those additional costs, primarily the ones due to prolongation and how those will be quantified and then ultimately approved for additional capital approval by the Government.  That is where things stand currently.</p></speech>

The &euro;1.43 billion is the Government-approved capital budget.  Over and above that, there is another &euro;300 million to bring the entire programme to &euro;1.73 billion.  The &euro;300 million is to allow integration and mobilisation of the services side.  A lot of figures are being used so I just want to bring clarity to the relationship between the &euro;1.433 billion, which is for the works only and as my colleague said, within that Government-approved budget of &euro;1.433 billion, there are items to which the contractor is entitled and external factors are now adding pressure to that.  Over and above the &euro;1.433 billion, there is an additional allowance to allow mobilisation of services.  It is important for anybody watching to understand that relationship.</p></speech>

Obviously, if we look at the commentary around this, particularly this year, all indications are that it will.  There is a big question mark on this.  Is it plausible that this construction could go to the &euro;2 billion mark given all the mitigating circumstances that are involved with this?  We all understand they are highly challenging.  However, is there a possibility that this could actually go well beyond the figures Mr. Tierney just mentioned?</p></speech>

That is not news today; that was a stated fact approximately four months ago.  I am not going to answer that question definitively for the very reason that the board is engaged in a live commercial environment with the contractor.  The contractor has a position on what his entitlement is and the board has equally taken a position on what that is.  I do not want to get into a discussion around setting a precedent or giving any signal in terms of a definitive costs.  I do not think that would be wise for the Exchequer at this stage.</p></speech>

Both Tallaght and Connolly hospitals are finished and up and running and doing very well.  Looking outside of Dublin, because all the focus with regard to children's healthcare has been very much about Dublin, we have now got planning permission for the paediatric unit in Cork.  Where are we with regard to going forward with the project in Cork now?  While the focus has been totally on Dublin, there are 731,000 people now living in the Cork and Kerry region alone.  There has been a huge growth of population in Cork over the last ten or 15 years.  Is Cork now going to be put on the back burner for another ten years?  Can we get a definitive timeline for when we can move forward with the project in Cork?</p></speech>

The answer is that we recognise the Dublin-centric model, which the Deputy mentioned, but that has been on the basis that we are developing a unique hospital on a national all-island basis, as has been referred to by some members of the committee.  That is necessarily developing a hospital for the whole of Ireland and all the children of Ireland on 39 clinical specialties.  Supporting mechanisms have been put in place in terms of the models of care for the satellite centres.  The Deputy is quite right that there is a need and demand around the country, not just in the Cork region but elsewhere in the country in terms of delivering a pediatric model of care.  Much work is ongoing in terms of scoping that out and speccing out what that pediatric model of care looks like as it links into the central hub around the new children's hospital.</p></speech>

The problem we now have with the pediatric unit in Cork is that it is no longer adequate for the population in the area.  We have got planning permission.  The issue is not that we need to get planning and do a design.  That is all done.  All the homework is done.  The question now is when we can put it on the list for moving forward to construction stage.</p></speech>

As the Deputy pointed out, the design piece and planning permission are in place.  As my colleague, Mr. Tierney, pointed out, however, there is a new updated public spending code requirement in terms of a phase of decision gates to move through.  I am aware that a strategic assessment report is being developed at the moment and that is the first point in the public spending code cycle for the development of any new major infrastructural investment.  That process is being moved through.</p> <p>  I would not like to prejudice today the outcome of those gates and processes.  As I understand it, however, the first rung of that ladder is under way.  The Department has not received that strategic assessment report yet.  The fact that such an advanced design is in place and that they have gone for planning permission is very encouraging in terms of the homework.</p></speech>

What I am saying is that more and more people are being referred to a central hub when, in fact, we should be able to care for them in the hospital in Cork.</p></speech>

Again, it is about growth in population, not only in Cork but in the entire Munster region.  More and more referrals are being made to Dublin because of the fact that we are not developing outside of Dublin.  We are putting &euro;2 billion, in real terms, into the development of paediatric facilities in Dublin and we are doing nothing outside of Dublin.  That needs to be dealt with.</p></speech>

The witnesses must know they are close to being out through the gap when they start fielding questions about what happens after this project is completed and when Cork and other regions will be looked after.  I kind of articulated that at the start.  There is a question of what if something goes wrong now; one of those unforeseen things.  This is probably one of the easier sessions the witnesses have had before this committee, which I think is because the public are beginning to see it just as we have seen it.  Mr. Devine mentioned a project with 4,400 rooms.</p></speech>

The project is over the hill in that sense but that is not a cause for complacency.  There are still difficult questions to answer.  I will not congratulate the board yet but I think its representatives have handled themselves reasonably well today.  There may be people in the media or other commentators who do not agree.</p><p>The witnesses have a big responsibility in developing the site.  The visit to the site helped to join many of the dots and gave me an overall impression.  I do not know where a project manager starts work every morning on a project of this scale.  It is truly phenomenal.  There must be a couple of thousand miles of cables in the building.</p><p> When Tallaght University Hospital was finally opened it was so long overdue that it was discovered many of the required utilities in it did not fit because they had all changed in the intervening period.  Nothing like that has happened with this project, has it?</p></speech>

We spoke earlier about future-proofing the hospital so that nothing would come at us from left field.  We believe we have a good balance.  We have just finished full procurement of the very sophisticated hospital equipment.  There was a real balance to be struck between making sure we had it procured on time to properly integrate it in the hospital and not in any way impact the construction works and getting the best equipment for the children of Ireland.  I believe we have achieved this.  I am glad to say that for all the equipment we purchased we had fantastic vendors involved.  We have had a very successful outcome on purchasing this sophisticated equipment.  The clinicians are very happy.</p></speech>

At the start of this year, the Government published the Harnessing Digital framework, which is about leveraging digital to make the economy more resilient and take every opportunity.  In 2020 or 2021, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer published new guidance for public sector entities on leveraging cloud.  It is being mainstreamed.  In this development and other projects I am working on, we see, even in the HSE, a move to cloud because it provides resilience.  I am not sure it is a barrier.  In the HSE and in this programme, we are leveraging cloud as we build the digital capability in the provision of paediatric services.  Generally, leveraging digital throughout the health service-----</p></speech>

I thank the representatives from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, the Department of Health and the HSE for their assistance to the committee on this important matter.  This has been a good engagement.  For people listening at home, many questions have been answered.  There are still questions, particularly on the cost.  Previous meetings have been focused on the cost and claims.  In fairness to members there is no point in pursuing these if we cannot get the answers.  This is why people moved on to other issues.  The meeting has been very useful.</p> <p>  I wish the witnesses well with the project.  It is very important for the Irish people.  There has been some discussion about the lack of investment in other regions.  This hospital is for people on the whole of the island.  We need to keep stressing that it is for everyone and not for one region.  It is based in Dublin but it is for children all over Ireland and that is very important.  At some stage, we may take up the invitation to visit the project again as such visits give us a sense of how it is moving forward.  I visited the campus in Tallaght.  It is forward-looking and positive work is going on.  It is delivering for children, which is the most important thing.  I wish the witnesses well in their important work.</p></speech>
