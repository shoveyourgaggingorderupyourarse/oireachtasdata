He is joined by Ms Niamh Donegan, senior auditor.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Pat Deering and David Cullinane.</p> <p>  Are the minutes of 4 April 2019 agreed? Agreed.  There are no matters arising.</p> <p>  We shall proceed to correspondence.  There are three categories.  Category A consists of the opening statements and documents in connection with today's meeting.  No. 2095 A, from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, contains a number of briefing documents for today's meeting.  Is it agreed to note and publish it?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2100 A, from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is Ms Colette Drinan's opening statement for today's meeting.  Is it agreed to note and publish it?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2096 A is the opening statement from Professor Chris Fitzpatrick, dated 9 April 2019, for today's meeting.  Is it agreed to note it and publish it?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 2097 A and 2098 A, from Central Statistics Office, comprise the briefing document and opening statement for today's meeting.  Is it agreed to note and publish them?  Agreed.</p> <p>  On correspondence category B, we held over No. 2073 B on the last day for discussion.  We agreed to note it and publish it at that stage.  It relates to Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB.  We have written directly to the Department.  I propose that we wait to see its response and that of KWETB before taking any further action.  We will consider the replies from both organisations when we get them.</p></speech>

I took the trouble to read it.  We cannot get into the minutiae but it highlights the nature of governance and the gaps if what is in the letter is accurate, notwithstanding that representatives of the board were before us and the direction from the Department of Education and Skills.  While we cannot get into the minutiae, the response of the Department will be very significant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041100002#B00400"><p>That is good.  I saw an article in one of the Sunday newspapers about the 2018 financial statements.  We will consider all those matters when they come before us in due course.  The statements would not be audited by this stage.</p><p>The next item is No.<b></b>2083B, from Ms Jennifer Wiley, HEO, seafood policy and management division, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, providing an explanation for the delay in laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas the 2017 annual reports for the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board and the Marine Institute within the required three months, as per the circular 7/2015 of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We will note and publish this.</p><p><b></b>No. 2086B, dated 3 April 2019, is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It provides information requested by the committee on the annual assessment from June 2018 submitted by the Department of Health; the review of Ireland's capital management system; clarification regarding the use of two-stage contracting processes; a note on the water supply project; and the business case for the N6 Galway city ring road, as requested by the committee.  We will note and publish it.  Do members have any comments to make on it?</p></speech>

I would like an opportunity to revert to it at some time in a general way in regard to how business cases are made.  It is dated 17 November 2017.</p><p>I tried to get this before and I welcome that it is now on public record.  Perhaps with the Chairman's indulgence I will come back to it some time, but not today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041100002#C00200"><p>Absolutely.  We will be looking at capital projects and if it falls easily under that heading when we come to discuss capital projects, then we will do that.</p> <p>  We will also write back on this.  Perhaps we were not specific enough.  We asked for details on the comprehensive appraisal with regard to budgeted projects.  In our letter we also asked for details on how the costs estimations could be improved.  There was a long list of good intentions supplied in the document but they are all in the future.  We want to see timescales.  We will write back seeking specific timescales on the second question.</p> <p>  One issue we did not address in our letter to the Secretary General, which I would like be addressed at this stage, is the whole question of value for money, which was not mentioned anywhere in the document.  Perhaps we did not specifically ask this but while it is fine to talk about cost appraisals, we need to know the assessment process as to whether a project meets the value for money criteria, which is a basic requirement for major projects.  We want a detailed note of how that happened and how it is integrated into the approval process for any major projects.</p> <p>  We also had clarification on the use of the two-stage contracting process and any derogation from lump sum contracts or common standard contracts since 2011.  There is a list of 12 or 13 items that got a derogation from the lump sum contracts or were two-stage contracting processes.  This will be noted and published.  If anyone wants to follow that up then please do so.  We will come back to this topic as part of our overall look at capital projects.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2087B from Mr. Maurice Quinn provides information requested by the committee regarding expenditure on ships for the Naval Service.  This reply is on foot of correspondence from a member of the public who queried such expenditure in light of perceived issues regarding recruitment.  The Secretary General provides information regarding recruitment in 2018 and so far this year.  We will note and publish that response.  There is a lot of interesting information included about ships being retired that are more than 35 years of age, and other information on the Naval Service being obliged to commission a number of new ships in light of other ships being decommissioned, including on the time it takes to deal with this.  This letter will be noted and published.  It will be of interest to some people.</p> <p>  No. 2091B is from Commissioner Mark O'Mahoney at the Tax Appeals Commission, responding to our request for further information regarding appeals that are closed.  The committee had asked for details on those appeals.  The commission points out that the request should be directed to the Revenue Commissioners.  The committee will write to the Revenue Commissioners requesting the details on those cases that were before the Tax Appeals Commission that are either closed or have been withdrawn.  A large amount of money is involved in many of the cases we highlighted.  We are concerned about what was the final outcome for the taxpayer.  We will ask the Revenue Commissioners to give the committee a note on that.  It is up to Revenue to calculate that figure.  The Tax Appeals Commission makes the overall decision but it is up to Revenue to do the sums afterwards.  Am I right in this?</p></speech>

There are some very substantial cases there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041100002#C00600"><p>We will write to the Revenue Commissioners.  Obviously they will not identify any particular case but if large cases that were before the Tax Appeals Commission have since been closed then it saves work for the Tax Appeals Commission if it does not have to deal with them.  That in its own right is good.  In light of that we will ask the commission to give us an estimate of the value of the cases currently remaining.  We were speaking of &euro;1.6 billion figure at one stage with a potential tax payment &euro;1.1 billion but if a lot of those cases have been disposed of, then some of them may already have been paid or in some cases due refunds.  We will ask the commission to give us an up-to-date figure.  We had asked for the ten most recent or current high-value cases before it but we will now ask for the total quantum of cases currently on its files.  It would be interesting to see if there has been movement on that.</p> <p>  No. 2092, received from Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, Health Service Executive, dated 27 March, relates to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  The correspondence contains one very interesting item that people may be surprised to note.  The committee will bring in the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and a date has been set for this to be on the work programme, which we will come to in a moment.  In light of the PricewaterhouseCoopers', PwC, report published this week on the cost escalation that will be a very important meeting, and we will also discuss that in due course.</p> <p>  The cover note to the document the committee has been given says the correspondence deals with the consideration of the delivery options for phase B of the new children's hospital.  It includes a detailed document that details the options going forward by the HSE.  This was probably dealt with in November of last year before the decision was made by the Government.  The document lists the three options for completing phase B: instruct BAM, the main contractor; instruct a new main contractor; or instruct a management contractor.  The document includes a detailed assessment of the objectives and risks on each of the options.  This document was prepared last autumn and a paragraph on its third page struck me immediately.  It states "The HSE, at the request of the Department of Health, has sought input from a range of advisors including PwC and Alan Moore (Director of Strategic Capital Development in Northern Ireland), who have met with members of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the project delivery team, to inform their views on these questions."  It is the first time I have spotted it but perhaps others have seen it before now.  It appears to me that we have a situation where the Department of Health is telling us that PwC was one of its advisers last November or December in the decision on which option to choose.  PwC was also appointed to do the cost escalation report, published in recent days at a cost of approximately &euro;500,000 to the taxpayer.</p> <p>  The issue of conflict of interest in respect of PwC was raised extensively at the commencement of that process.  They assured us that there was no conflict of interest with regard to BAM, the HSE or the board.  At the time we asked how PwC could be invited to carry out that work without it going through a procurement process at that stage.  They gave us a valid answer that it was already on the list of consultants that could be called on at any time based on a pre-tendering framework.  That is fine but now we see that "The HSE, at the request of the Department of Health, has sought input from a range of advisors including PwC".  These are the words of the HSE in relation to this decision.  I want a detailed explanation, immediately and within 24 hours, from the Secretary General.  This story will have to be resolved within 24 hours.  People, including journalists, will be asking how is it that PwC was involved in the decision process looking at how the project would go forward into phase B, and yet was also commissioned to carry out the costs escalation report that was published yesterday.  I do not know how this has arisen.  I am going on the HSE document.</p> <p>  This is a separate issue from the Mazars report that was prepared for the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on preliminary observations in relation to the construction capital cost escalation of the national children's hospital, issued on 17 December 2018.  PwC was involved in the process in or around November 2018.  A Mazars report on cost escalation was issued in December.  The HSE then commissioned PwC to do another cost escalation report early this year, at another cost to the taxpayer.  This was all in the process of how the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board arrived at its internal report, dated 28 November 2018, entitled Process to Guaranteed Maximum Price: Working Together for our Children.  We need clarification of the statement by the HSE that PwC were involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041100002#C00700"><p>I am glad the Chairman raised it.  I did not read the report.  I just glanced at it today and saw that.  I had it marked.  I brought in the report with me.  It is not up for discussion today but I am glad the Chairman raised it because it ties in with the conclusions made.  It seems to me that PwC was never asked to make conclusions.  It was given terms of reference to look at governance and other matters, on which it made recommendations.</p><p>On page 8 the word "conclusion" jumps off the page.  I wonder about it as I do not see it relating to the terms of reference.  What is particularly interesting is that at the bottom they say, "At this point, taking any alternative course of action other than continuing would in all likelihood result in significant delay".  They conclude that one should not go a different route, but that had been decided in the document to which the Chairman referred with input from them at that point.  That is a serious issue.   I agree with the Chairman.  I do not know if that conclusion should be there in the first place but it is a very different forum or may be the next time we discuss it.  Certainly, they are reinforcing what they had apparently said when they gave advice, subject to reading the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041100002#D00200"><p>We will ask for clarification of that.  Our concern here is that PwC was, on a <i>prima facie</i>case, apparently involved in the decision-making process and was then the body called in to examine the cost escalation arising in part from that decision-making process.  I do not understand it and the public does not understand it.  We need immediate clarification of that matter today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041100002#D00300"><p>It is the standard approach.  We set out to do reviews to arrive at a prescribed outcome.  That is why PwC, with the best of respect to its standing in the world as a great accountancy firm, had no place doing this review.  Of their own accord, they have decided to stick in at the end a conclusion that says, "By the way, we were right all along".  That underpins the waste of &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000 in the first instance and affects the entire credibility of the rest of the report.</p></speech>

I use the word "if".  It is not just PwC, it is the entire management of this project in the HSE.</p></speech>

I want that message to go to the HSE point of contact on the role of PwC and clarification of the matters I have just raised.  Why was PwC commissioned to carry out the cost review process?

We want an emailed answer to that before the meeting is concluded today.  The HSE knows the answer and can reply within an hour.  There will be phone calls from lots of people seeking that answer and we want it in writing here today.  We will check progress on that at the break shortly to ensure the HSE gets us a reply immediately.</p> <p>  We move on to correspondence in category C.  No. 1875, dated 22 January 2019, was received from one of the witnesses who attended our meeting in private session on 22 January regarding the University of Limerick.  We note it formally at this stage.  It is agreed but it is not for publication.</p> <p>  No. 2088, dated 30 March, is from an individual on behalf of a residents' association in Tipperary requesting the committee to investigate the maladministration by Tipperary County Council on collecting financial contributions due under a grant of planning permission in 2000 and subsequent planning permissions.  The matter is clearly not within the remit of the committee and the correspondence encloses a letter stating that a complaint has been made to the Ombudsman.  I propose to advise the correspondent that he may also wish to bring the matter to the attention of the local government audit service.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2089 is correspondence from Tadhg Daly, chief executive officer of Nursing Homes Ireland, dated 5 April, inquiring about a review of our system for setting nursing home prices under the nursing home support scheme.  Mr. Daly states that the review was due in 2017 and that in its periodic report published last December, the committee recommended that the National Treatment Purchase Fund's review of its pricing mechanism should be concluded and published not later than the end of March 2019.  I propose that we request an immediate update from the National Treatment Purchase Fund regarding the review.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item No. 2090 is correspondence from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien dated 5 April on the PwC report which we have just mentioned.  The document has been published and was circulated yesterday to all members.  That concludes correspondence.</p></speech>

There is a clear audit opinion but attention is drawn to the college's disclosure that it was not fully in compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and that action is being taken to address this.  The college incurred a deficit for the year of &euro;444,000 and had an accumulated deficit of &euro;1 million at the end of 2017.  We note that.

It normally has its accounts for 2018 finalised by June or thereabouts so that will be an opportunity for the new chief executive, Paul Reid, to come in.  Mr. Reid was not chief executive at the time but the HSE did not have a full-time chief executive for almost 12 months so it is important that we have a new person appointed.  He will have a lot of catching up to do to be ready for that meeting.  He appeared before this committee when he was in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform so I am sure he will acquit himself well on the day.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well in a very important task.  The next item is-----</p></speech>

We will also deal with the Houses of the Oireachtas Appropriation Accounts for 2018 some time before the summer recess.  Regarding next week's meeting, can members indicate now or send an email by tomorrow regarding any particular information relating to the EPA accounts on which they would like further briefing so that it can be included in the briefing document?

The EPA has responsibility for this and there has been an inquiry into it.  The outworking of the matter was not very satisfactory.  Obviously, it has been in the news in recent times because of the possible embargo on the owner but it is about looking about how that is handled, finance and the EPA's oversight of an entity of that nature.

The EPA provided a note on Aughinish.  There is a question of accountability in the context of whether there was an incident involving pollution or the clean up of the site.  A note was provided but I would ask the EPA to expand on that because I am not sure that the information provided was sufficient.  We regularly receive briefing notes in respect of landfill sites and places such as Avoca.  There are significant implications for the public purse.</p></speech>

At least those two items do not need to be carried forward because they have both been dealt with.  The next item is any other business.</p></speech>

I do not like to be in conflict with the Chairman, who is very fair and very good to us all.  His is a difficult job at times.  I got an opportunity last week to mention that I needed to raise this matter with the Chairman before the meeting.  I put a series of questions on the record that were relevant to the Irish Prison Service.  Off the record, I informed everybody present that I was about to do this.  If people could understand, they would give me a bit of latitude.  I knew we were dealing with the Vote that is primarily of concern to the Department of Justice and Equality but, as often happens, one uses the opportunity if one can to raise some other issues.  It was the first opportunity we had with the Irish Prison Service being before the committee and the response that was given to it in writing on 7 February so I did what I did.  I took legal advice on the framing of questions and explained to the witnesses in advance that while I appreciated that I might not have the relevant expertise or that the relevant line managers were not with us, it would be perfectly fine for those answers to be given in writing after the fact.  We proceeded along those lines.</p> <p>  I must put on record a couple of things said by the Chairman.  I do not like to be in conflict with him but as this happened in public session, I would like it to be clarified.  The Chairman stated that they were questions and issues raised by me as one of 13 members of this committee and that it was not a request from the Committee of Public Accounts until such time as the committee agreed to put the questions.  The Chairman later stated that it was not a request from the Committee of Public Accounts, that the committee had not yet decided what questions to put to the witness and that it was a request from one member and was not representative of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Later still, the Chairman stated that the member was not speaking for the committee but was speaking for himself and that it would be up to the committee to decide whether it wanted to put those questions to the witness.</p> <p>  That obviously causes a problem.  I am a member of the committee, as nominated by my party and formally selected by the Committee of Selection of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  To the best of my knowledge, and I have taken legal advice, I broke no Standing Order last week and raised no issue regarding parliamentary privilege.  To the best of my knowledge, the committee is the forum and the members ask the questions.  If the committee collectively decides to make a recommendation, that is certainly a committee decision but I know of no Standing Order that requires the unanimous agreement of the other 12 members as to the providence, validity or content of the question of one member, so that is a problem.</p><p>Will the Chairman respond to that?  As far as I am concerned, the Prison Service is included in the justice Vote.  While I appreciate that the subject of the meeting was the core justice Vote, digression to other matters relevant to that Department or Vote is reasonable and probably happens at every meeting.  In addition, it may be argued that at least some, if not all, the matters I raised last week could fall under the remit of the internal audit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  In any event, it did not depart from the practice of the past.  Would the Chairman like to retract the unilateral instruction to the witness to the effect that he did not have to answer any questions, and the implication that my questions had to be affirmed, approved or checked by the committee as a whole?  I will reserve my right to petition the Committee on Procedure about the matter.  While I do not wish to be in conflict with the Chairman, the statements are of a serious nature.</p><p> I accept that my style of questioning may irk many people, such as fellow Members, the media and witnesses at times, but that is a separate matter which can, as long as I follow the rules, be adjudicated by the people of Sligo-Leitrim in due course.  Nevertheless, the content, questions and quotes I have read directly from the transcript of last week's meeting seemed to undermine severely my position as a member of the committee.  Suggesting that I was effectively a lone soldier who had gone rogue and asked irrelevant, inappropriate questions that required the approval of the other 12 members of the committee went beyond what I believe would be reasonably permitted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.69" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041100002#F00200"><p>I wish to provide clarification on the serious issues for the benefit of the Deputy.  During the meeting, I listened carefully to his contribution and there was nothing wrong whatsoever with his style.  It was a cogently presented set of remarks and questions.  We can agree everything that was asked related to the remit of the Prison Service.</p> <p>  As Chairman, I came to the view that some of the remarks that were made related to behaviour that may have involved criminality.  I felt that it was my duty as the Chairman of a committee, and as an individual, that if remarks relating to potential criminality were highlighted to me, they should be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I stated last week that the entire transcript, including the issues raised by the Deputy, needed to be investigated in respect of criminality, such as theft of State property and other items, within the Prison Service.  I stated I would send the transcript to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which I did via the superintendent in Pearse Street, which is the division of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which Leinster House is based.  I have carried out, therefore, what I indicated at the meeting that I would.</p> <p>  All committees are conducted through the Chairperson.  All questions are put through the Chairperson, who, in turn, puts them to the witnesses.  That is a well-established principle.  To allow for free-flowing meetings, I regularly let people ask and answer questions directly but it is always understood that the questions are put through the Chairperson.  Under Standing Orders, it is the duty of the Chairperson to chair the meeting and all questions are asked through him or her.  When issues were raised by a member with me as Chairman, I made an early judgment that some of the issues involved criminal activity.  I had a simple choice.  I could have put the questions to the Accounting Officer, who would follow them up and revert in due course to the committee, or, if I considered the matters to be very serious, I could decide to put the questions directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its investigation.  I chose the latter option.  Due to the nature of what was said, I felt that it would be more appropriate if some of the remarks were forwarded to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its consideration and for any action it may or may not choose to take, rather than ignoring the potential criminality that was highlighted during the meeting and, as if nothing had happened, putting it to the witness as a routine question to be considered.  As will have been seen at every meeting of the committee, members raise issues and ask questions and I invariably ask witnesses to respond directly to the committee in respect of the matter in order that the answer will be conveyed to the rest of the committee.  I make the request on behalf of the committee.  When I say it is a decision of the committee, I am making that decision, as Chairman, on behalf of the committee.  It is not the case that the other members must vet anyone's questions.</p> <p>  To clarify the matter, I will read aloud a sentence that I read every morning at every meeting and that I will have to read three times later in the meeting because there are three witnesses.  I state: "If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence."  That is the established process in the Oireachtas.  If a witness is directed by a committee to cease giving evidence, he or she must do so.  In practical terms, if the witness is requested to cease giving evidence, the request will be made by the Chairperson on behalf of the committee.  Even though we state the committee can instruct a witness to cease giving evidence, the Chairperson, in fact, issues the instruction on behalf of the committee.  When I stated at the previous meeting that it would be a matter for the committee to decide, I did not intend in any way to imply that members could veto other members' questions.  As I make clear at every meeting, I, as Chairman, will make a ruling on behalf of the committee as to whether questions or answers are appropriate.  I can give a warning accordingly, which is what I did at the previous meeting.  In my role as Chairman, I indicated I was not willing to allow that question to be put through me to an Accounting Officer when, due to the seriousness of the matter, I would convey those questions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for consideration, which is what happened.  Until I, on behalf of the committee, decide that the questions should be put to the Accounting Officer, they will not be.  When I referred to the committee, it reflected the language used in the House.  I refer back to the remarks that I will make three times later in the meeting.  The instruction about the committee potentially asking someone to cease giving evidence means, in practice, that the Chairperson can issue such an instruction.  That is how I interpreted it.  I did not mean the individual members of the committee but rather that if I, as Chairman, wished to conduct a meeting in such a way and decided, on behalf of the committee, that those questions should not be put to the Accounting Officer, I would convey them to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the basis for my decision and I am fully satisfied with the correctness of my approach.</p></speech>

There is no issue with sending the transcript to the Garda and, in fact, I support it.  That has nothing to do with it.  The issue of a witness being told to stop giving evidence for fear of having qualified privilege only is also a separate issue.  On three occasions, however, the Chairman stated I was acting alone, not as a member of the committee, that the questions were not posed by the Committee of Public Accounts and that, therefore, the witness did not need to answer them.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.72" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041100002#F00500"><p>I think the Chairman was wrong in that regard.  He stated there may have been criminality, which is true, but the committee's line authority in this instance is the Accounting Officer of the Prison Service.  That is the equivalent of a Secretary General in this matter.</p><p>The Chairman's actions have given abdication to the people who respond to us to look into matters.  It may well be there are no issues of criminality.  It was perfectly reasonable to put to the Accounting Officer if he or the Prison Service are aware of A, B, C, D, E, F and G and if not, can they carry out the necessary inquiries.  That was what was on each of my questions, as this will show.</p><p> The other implication of what the Chairman is saying is that if it is case that it may end up with criminality being highlighted as a result of some of these questions, that means that in effect he is narrowing the scope of this committee.  What happens if we want to ask questions under the Competition Act, the Criminal Justice Act, the Companies Act, the Health and Safety Act or the Tax Acts, all of which could have implications in criminality?</p><p> What happened last week was perfectly within the Chairman&rsquo;s remit.  As I said, I hate to be in any sort of conflict with the Chair.  However, my entitlement as a committee member to put questions to an Accounting Officer was effectively removed.  It is there in writing three times last week.  It is nothing personal, Chairman.  We are best friends outside the ring.  You are an excellent Chair.  However, that totally disenfranchised my position last week.</p><p> The Chairman said the content was perfectly fine.  He said the rules were not broken but then you decided that, although I am full member of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Secretary General and Accounting Officer relevant to this area would not answer these questions.  Instead, we will kick it out to the Garda in the Phoenix Park.  I agree it should carry out its investigations as well.  However, to suggest the Department of Justice and Equality does not have a role is incredible.</p><p> If this were to stand as a precedent, we would not be allowed to ask questions in here.  There is the potential for criminality in many of the issues discussed here and in many of the questions put.  Again, I made no accusations against individuals, anybody identifiable or anything like that.  Process, procedures, institutions and the need prudence demands for investigations to be carried out are fine.  If the Chairman's answer stands and, more particularly, if the transcript for last week stands, I have no other option but to petition the Committee on Procedure to make a ruling on this.</p></speech>

That is in order.  The committee will want to review the discussion here today.  If I am wrong on this, the committee can tell me.  However my view, like in my opening comment, is that when witnesses are here, all questions and answers are through the Chair.  There is no vetting by any member of another member's questions.  The Chair has authority to make a ruling that, to put a question to an Accounting Officer, it comes through the Chair or say to an Accounting Officer that he or she will not answer that question.  I have had to say it to Accounting Officers on previous occasions that a question will not be answered on the day.  I have instructed Accounting Officers on previous occasions not to answer a question that a member may have raised but that I felt, as Chairman, was not appropriate.</p> <p>  I made the decision on the day as Chairperson, chairing the meeting on behalf of the committee.  It was not the committee that was not putting your questions.  It was me, as Chairman of the committee, acting on behalf of the committee.  I used the reference I read out earlier in relation to witnesses as a parallel.  It was not a direct comparison.  It is an example to show that when we refer to the committee, making a statement about some evidence, which, in practice, it is done by the Chair on behalf of the committee.  It is not all members of the committee have to agree.  In practice, it means the Chair has to do it.  If the Oireachtas&rsquo;s instruction to every committee is that the Chair has no authority to do that unless the full committee makes a decision, that is fine.  If that changes the rules for every Chair of every committee, that is fine.  I will follow that rule.</p> <p>  In the meantime, the questions, as always, are put through the Chair.  I took my decision as Chair not to allow those questions be put through me to the Accounting Officer.  I made the decision and wanted those questions to be sent to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is what I did.  That is my position.  We have both indicated our positions on it.  I have no problem with some higher committee in this establishment ruling on these matters.  It will not be a matter specific to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It will be a matter relating to the role of all chairmen of all Oireachtas committees.  If clarification is required, I welcome that.  Whatever the outcome of that process is, every other committee Chair and I will take note of that decision.</p></speech>

It totally undermines my position as a committee member.  I am sorry that is the case.  I will take advice as to what I will do next.

I came in and asked in the best possible way and without remotely identifying anyone or pointing any fingers to see if we could get some of these matters investigated.  Instead, we said it was nothing to do with the Prison Service or Department of Justice and Equality and decided to send it to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I want to reiterate the point because it can be significant.  I am clear that the Deputy identified nobody here and I am satisfied that the remarks he made here could not have led to anyone being identifiable.  However, I am quite sure that it is reasonable to say that because of what he put on the record, those people could be identifiable within the Prison Service by other serving staff.  They could well have known who the Deputy was talking about.  It could impinge on their good name if they could be identified within the Prison Service based on the information put on the record here.  I wanted to avoid that.  That is why I sent it to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

As matters stand, for the record, my work last week was futile because the relevant Accounting Officer was told not to answer any of my questions as it was up to the committee.

I clarify that it was never my intention that the other members had to vet individuals.  As Chairman, however, I have often told Accounting Officers not to answer a particular question.  I have said it before and may have to say it again.  I made that decision on the day based on what I felt were very strong suggestions of criminal activity.  As Chairman, I am not happy to chair any meeting anywhere in the country, even in my constituency, if allegations are suggested and I do nothing about it.  My job was to report it to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is what I did.  There, the matter rests.  If there is a follow up from any committee, I will welcome clarification.</p></speech>

I am not here legally; I am here as a Deputy and member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Kerins case has been misused.  We are perfectly entitled to ask questions as long as we do not go beyond our remit.  The Supreme Court was particularly careful in highlighting the distinction between the D&aacute;il, the courts and so on.  Chairs are coming under very difficult pressure which is not appropriate and in no way relates to the judgment.  It is something we should come back to.  Witnesses are free to come in and leave.  The position was the same before and after the High Court and Supreme Court cases.  They are free to come in and they are free to leave and we are free to ask questions.  If witnesses choose not to respond, that tells us something.  I will leave it at that but we should come back to it because I am tired of listening to the misinterpretation.</p></speech>

After the last High Court ruling, there was a useful briefing meeting for the Working Group of Committee Chairmen.  All of the Chairmen in attendance felt that it was a major issue that the questioning had not been in line with the written invitation to the witness.  I made the point that committee members, including me, never see invitations to witnesses.  In other words, it is not just the politicians but also Oireachtas procedures and terms of reference as to what can be asked that need improvement.  This is a broad issue across the Houses and is not for us alone.  It was accepted by every Chairman and Vice Chairman present that they never saw invitations, yet the outcome of the group's consideration was that the questions were not in line with the invitation issued by officialdom in this building, which had not been passed to the relevant committee.</p></speech>

The first is the 2017 Appropriation Accounts, Vote 4 - Central Statistics Office.  The second is Vote 8 - Comptroller and Auditor General.  We want to complete both sessions before the voting block at approximately 1 p.m.  Members and witnesses will be pleased to hear that we are allocating one hour and 15 minutes to this session.  The second session will cover the same period.  Immediately after lunch, we will have a final session with Professor Chris Fitzpatrick on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  That will be after the voting session.</p><p>The first session today is to discuss the Vote of the Central Statistics Office.  I welcome from the CSO Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton, director general, Ms Maria Hurley, Ms Jennifer Banim and Mr. Richard McMahon.  This is Mr. Dalton's first appearance before the committee.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee - that means me, as Chairman, acting on behalf of the committee - to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee should refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>I ask Mr. McCarthy, Comptroller and Auditor General, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Appropriations-in-aid were &euro;1.5 million, resulting in net voted expenditure of &euro;44.7 million.  The surplus for surrender at year-end was &euro;3.9 million.</p> <p>  Members will note that the gross expenditure in 2017 was some &euro;30 million less than in 2016.  The difference is mainly due to the additional costs incurred by the CSO in carrying out the five-yearly census of population in 2016.</p> <p>  The appropriation account is presented under a single programme entitled Delivery of Annual Statistical Programme.  An analysis of the expenditure is given in note 3 under standard administrative headings used in appropriation accounts.  This also includes explanations for significant variances in spending on individual subheads relative to the amount provided.  I issued a clear audit opinion on the appropriation account and there were no matters that I considered required reporting to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

I am joined by several colleagues.  Maria Hurley is assistant director general with responsibility for the corporate affairs directorate, which includes the finance, governance and human resources functions.  Jennifer Banim is assistant director general of the economic statistics directorate.  Richard McMahon is assistant director general of the social and demography directorate.  I propose to briefly outline the role of the Central Statistics Office as well as our strategy and achievements during 2017.  I will also give an overview of the CSO 2017 appropriation account and outline CSO expenditure in 2017.</p> <p>  The CSO is Ireland's national statistical institute and is responsible for the production and oversight of the production of all official statistics for Ireland.  The CSO is an independent office of the Civil Service under the aegis of the Taoiseach.  The role of the director general of the CSO is prescribed in the Statistics Act 1993, which provides that the officeholder acts independently and exercises sole responsibility in professional statistical matters, including statistical methodology, professional standards, timing and content of statistical releases and methods of dissemination.</p> <p>  The National Statistics Board, with the agreement of the Taoiseach, has the general function of guiding the overall strategic direction of the CSO.  This independent position reflects international best practice for the organisation of official statistics.  The functions of the CSO, as set out in the Statistics Act, include "the collection, compilation, extraction and dissemination for statistical purposes of information relating to economic, social and general activities and conditions in the State."  This mandate was broadened under EU Regulation No. 223/2009, which makes the CSO director general responsible for the co-ordination and oversight of the quality of all European official statistics compiled by public authorities in Ireland.  Confidence in the quality and independence of official statistics is crucial as this information serves as an objective input to policy development, oversight and governance at national and international levels.</p> <p>  Under EU regulation, each member state was invited to commit to improve or maintain the conditions for the implementation of the European statistics code of practice via a commitment on confidence.  In May 2017, the Government adopted a commitment on confidence in statistics.  In signing this declaration, the Government reaffirmed the CSO's independence, impartiality and commitment to quality.</p> <p>  From a governance and planning perspective, good policies start with good data.  Good data are the lifeblood of decision-making and the basis for accountability.  The role of the CSO is to make sense of data by providing high quality statistics, independent insight and information for effective debate and decision-making across government, business and society.  The work we do creates good quality statistics that help people to understand the changes taking place in Ireland's economy and society.</p> <p>  The key deliverables and objectives for the CSO are informed by national and European policy.  The CSO delivers a demanding and growing statistical work programme each year.  In 2017, a total of 345 electronic releases and publications were published, including 13 outputs on census 2016.  We are currently preparing for the next census in 2021.  In addition to electronic releases and publications, the CSO transmits data to EUROSTAT, the Central Bank, the European Central Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Health Organization, among others.</p> <p>  The European statistical system has a significant impact on the work of the CSO.  Approximately 73% of the statistics we produced in 2017 were required under EU statistical legislation.  The CSO is an active member of the European statistical system and is centrally involved in key committees and executive bodies across a range of domains.</p> <p>  We delivered across all our strategic aims in 2017.  Alongside our 2017 statistical work programme, we completed the census 2016 project during 2017, producing some new style results publications and more than 30 individual infographics to support the communication of key releases.  We published the first estimate of GNI*.  This is a modified indicator of the overall size or level of the economy.  We also published a modified total domestic demand indicator that focuses on activity within the Irish economy.  This is designed to exclude significant globalisation effects that disproportionately affect the Irish economic results.</p> <p>  We established the Irish statistical system co-ordination directorate, which is leading on key strategic issues such as the development of the national data infrastructure and the co-ordination of professional statistical services to the broader Irish public system.  We continued to explore the use of secondary and blended data sources to compile new analysis, progressing the evolution of official statistics through the use of emerging data resources while focusing on burden reduction for respondents.</p><p>We introduced a more cost-effective data collection methodology in our household survey domain, namely, computer assisted telephone interviewing, which has afforded respondents a greater degree of flexibility in the manner in which they engage with the office and support our field force in concentrating its efforts on respondent recruitment in an environment of persistently falling response rates. </p><p> The CSO ran the Civil Service employee engagement survey in 2017, which operated across the entire Civil Service under action 25 of the Civil Service renewal plan and provided important insights into the experiences and opinions of those working in the Civil Service.  The results were compiled by the office before being supplied to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for analysis and publication and the resulting outputs were used to inform further development towards the reform of the Civil Service.  We capitalised on new approaches to communication and user engagement by developing a new style of infographic and developing user applications on Brexit, house prices and the consumer price index among others.  </p><p> The CSO also improved access to data for researchers by launching a remote access to microdata solution for researchers in 2017, significantly improving data security.  From an internal statistical quality perspective, during 2017 the CSO continued its investment in the new quality and methodology support function, headed by a senior statistician and tasked with underpinning the CSO's efforts to consistently refine its approach to quality management in official statistics and its commitment to continuous methodological improvement.  Overall, 2017 was a year of transition for the CSO, maintaining the historic focus on the systematic production of key economic and social indicators, while striving to broaden the focus and reach of official statistics to a more mainstream audience in response to the public demand for access to impartial and high-quality data to inform evaluation and decision making. </p><p> The net outturn for the CSO in 2017 was &euro;44.727 million against an estimate provision of &euro;48.584 million.  This lower than anticipated expenditure resulted in a surrender of &euro;3.856 million back to the Exchequer at the end of December 2017.  The bulk of the saving related to expenditure on salaries, wages and allowances that are payable to permanent staff assigned to the office.  The 2017 appropriation account was audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p> I will briefly outline the office&rsquo;s expenditure in 2017.  First, with respect to salaries, the bulk of the office's expenditure is expended on salaries, wages and allowances that are paid to permanent staff assigned to the CSO.  In 2017, this expenditure amounted to &euro;36.080 million against an estimate of &euro;38.983 million.  Savings of &euro;2.903 million were realised.  The estimate allocation was based on staff numbers of 755 but the actual number serving throughout the year was lower at 736.  This was mainly due to difficulties and delays in the filling of vacancies at statistician level and in IT technical grades during the year. </p><p> With respect to other non-pay, in line with other Votes, the CSO has several non-pay administrative subheads: A(ii) travel and subsistence; A(iii) training and development and incidental expenses; A(iv) postal and telecommunications services; A(v) office equipment and external IT services; A(vi) office premises expenses; A(vii) consultancy services and value for money and policy reviews; and A(viii) collection of statistics.  Non-pay administrative expenditure of the office in 2017 amounted to &euro;10.189 million against an estimate of &euro;10.989 million.  Savings of &euro;800,000 were returned to the Exchequer.   The detail of this expenditure is set out in appendix A, which has been circulated to the committee. </p><p> Our strategic goals were captured in our statement of strategy 2016 to 2019, which was published in late 2016.  In this, we said that we aim to turn data and statistics into information and knowledge for all; to increase the use of secondary data sources; to continue to build the capacity of our people; to modernise our statistical processes and systems, and to co-ordinate, oversee and assure the quality of all official statistics produced in Ireland.  The CSO is operating in an increasingly challenging environment.  We are experiencing growing user demand, both nationally and from Europe, where EUROSTAT and the European Central Bank are the two main sources.  The CSO is increasingly being asked to take on new survey work or to incorporate existing studies into its programme of official statistics, as can be seen by the recent announcement to embed the Growing Up in Ireland survey from 2023 and the decision to task the CSO with conducting a new sexual violence survey, a modern successor to the 2002 SAVI report.  </p><p> The complexity of the world we are trying to measure is also increasing with emerging issues such as globalisation and digitalisation, which result in complex economic transactions necessitating sophisticated analysis to decipher.  We are experiencing transformational change in the range and complexity of the data sources available to describe our economy and our society.  We are witnessing the use of statistics and data by a growing variety of stakeholders, sometimes with agenda-driven emphasis.  We are experiencing growing levels of scrutiny of data to ascertain its reliability, accuracy and veracity.  In this environment, the CSO is responding by maintaining a focus on its important heritage of impartiality and objectivity in the formulation of transparently produced, accurate and reliable official statistics, while exploring the boundaries of technology, data sources and statistical methods and techniques to persistently enhance the quality and insight afforded by our outputs.  To do this, we are committed to building an innovative, agile and high-performing organisation to fully exploit the potential of the data and technological revolutions.  Our aim is to deliver a broader range of high-quality information on societal and economic change for Ireland, which is demonstrably independent and without bias, and which can withstand scrutiny as regards data sources, statistical methodology and the impartiality of its compilers.  In so doing, we can support the process of guiding Ireland&rsquo;s future development for the benefit of all our citizens.  That concludes my statement.  I thank the members for their attention.  My colleagues and I are happy to take any questions they have to offer.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the important role the CSO plays, as stated by Mr. Dalton, with respect to statistics, information and data.  I note at national level CSO official statistics inform decision making across a range of areas, including construction, health, welfare, environment and the economy and at European level they provide an accurate picture of Ireland's economic and social performance and enable comparison between Ireland and other countries.  The CSO is playing a very important role in that respect.  I want to ask Mr. Dalton how we are doing economically in the context of Europe, how will we fare in the next few years and in the context of Brexit, the elephant in the room and what is on everyone's lips, what effect does he envisage it will have on our economy and on our future dealings with Europe?</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, the most recent set of figures show that our economy on a GDP basis is growing at 6.7% but as we know the GDP figures have an impact.  Globalisation impacts those figures.  We have now produced a broader range of stations and GNI* is one of those where we net out the impact of globalisation and modify domestic demand, personal consumption and expenditure.  When we consider those indicators it is clear that the domestic economy is growing in the order of about 4%, which is consistent with what we are seeing in the labour market.</p> <p>  In terms of the future, as the Deputy will be aware, the CSO does not forecast.  We are a little bit boring.  We advise what has happened and what the current situation is.  Forecasts and predictions of the future rest with the research community and economists so that is not really our bailiwick.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned Brexit.  Obviously, it is relevant to us, particularly around the collection of statistics and especially trade data.  As I presume the Deputy will have heard from previous witnesses, if and when the UK leave the European Union the collection of trade data will move from what is called Intrastat to Extrastat but we are prepared for that.  It will mean a change in the data source but we will still have data to compile the trade data.  As for the impact of Brexit, I do not know of anybody who is able to accurately predict what the fallout will be.</p></speech>

The year 2016 was an atypical one because it was a census year.  As the Deputy will be aware, for the census of population, we recruit a significant number of staff for a short period of time.</p><p>Throughout 2017, staff were redeployed out of the CSO.  This is the normal cyclical change in the number of staff in the CSO.  In the period up to a census year, we build up and in the year after the census, we begin to lose staff.  If I talk about our core numbers, excluding census, the underlying direction of travel for staffing numbers in the CSO is in an upward direction.  Part of the problem we have had, which I alluded to in my report, is that the type of skill sets for which we are looking in particular involve data analysts and those on the IT or technology front.

There is a significant number of organisations in Ireland that are recruiting graduates on the data analytics front.  Statisticians are essentially data analysts.  There are also growing demands for data analysts across the public service so it is a far more crowded labour market than was the case previously.  We are doing our best.  A competition is under way with over 200 applicants.  We will be running interviews in the next period of time.  We will put a panel in place and try to bring in as many of those statisticians and data analysts as we can.</p></speech>

We are well resourced.  The Deputy can see that we have the money.  The problem is more about getting the staff.  We have changed our approach to the recruitment of statisticians.  We are running those competitions ourselves now, which has proved far more successful over the past couple of iterations.  The technology side will also be difficult.  The technology is almost more difficult than the data analytical side.  We are experiencing more difficulties in getting the technological staff we need.  As the Deputy is aware, the nature of the skill sets in technology changes very quickly as technology develops so that might be the area where we have some issues.  I am quite confident on the data analytical side that we will get the staff.</p></speech>

I note the CSO suspended publishing statistics from PULSE in 2014 and resumed publishing statistics from it in 2017.  On its website, the CSO states that:</p><blockquote>The CSO recognises that the deferral of these important statistics results in an information gap and is a source of frustration to users.  The CSO has taken the decision to resume publication of Recorded Crime statistics under a new category &quot;Under Reservation&quot;.  </blockquote> <p>I want to ask Mr. Dalton about this category.  The CSO suspended publication of PULSE statistics because of question marks about the system and then started publishing them again in 2017 under a category entitled &quot;Under Reservation&quot;.  Will Mr. Dalton explain what this category means?</p></speech>

The quarterly data we publish relates to recorded crime and the only source of recorded crime statistics is PULSE.  The Deputy will be aware of the issues that have arisen with the underlying quality of some of the data on the PULSE system.  Most recently, there were questions around homicide statistics but there have other areas as well.  We suspended publication because we felt we could not stand over the statistics back in 2014.  We suspended a second time in 2016.  Even when we were publishing, we were adding heavy caveats so if one looked at the release even back at that time-----</p></speech>

There were issues with classification of certain crimes.  Some crimes were not classified in the right category.  There were some cases where crimes were not captured on PULSE at all.  There were some duplication issues.  There was no clarity on the application of the crime recording rules.  The crime recording rules effectively constitute a manual that provides absolute clarity.  They are supposed to provide clarity on how any particular crime is supposed to be accounted for in a recorded crime system like PULSE.  Obviously, they have these crime recording rules in other jurisdictions.  We are working continuously with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to try to improve the quality of its data for its purposes first of all because it needs good quality data from PULSE for its own reasons.  Then we would become downstream beneficiaries.  One of the things we are working on in particular involves the crime recording rules.  We are trying to encourage them and we will work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop this crime recording rules document.</p> <p>  There are two other things we want An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do.  We want it to introduce a formal quality management framework.  The quality division in the CSO has met An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to explain what the quality management framework would be like and to outline how it might go about improving the quality of the data on PULSE over time.  Finally, we really feel it is important that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appoints a single person at a very senior level to take point on data-related issues.  At the minute, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has an interim chief data officer.  I think the intention is make that a permanent post.  This is incredibly important for us but it is important that this role be at a very senior level in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that the person can influence the development and the move towards improving crime data.  </p> <p>  Under reservation is a term used by EUROSTAT for government finance statistics.  If EUROSTAT has a concern about a country's government finance statistics, it can put this reservation on the data.  What it effectively means is that there are concerns about the data and EUROSTAT cannot fully stand over the data.  We were left in this situation where there was a vacuum.  Our concern is that vacuums normally get filled with anecdotal information or poor quality or subjective data.  The longer a vacuum is left, the greater the risk that this occurs so we took the decision to resume publication but we needed to be clear with users that there was an issue with the data.  That is why we put in the classification "Under Reservation".</p> <p>  What we have also done to help users is produce three quality reports on the data coming from PULSE.  We try to give a clear signal to users that the figures on a certain classification coming from PULSE may well be an understatement, for example, burglaries.  We give a clear statement in the quality report as to our assessment of the accuracy of the particular statistic on whichever part or type of crime it is.  We could have left a vacuum and said we were not going to publish but we felt transparency was important.  It is the best data that can be published right now.</p></speech>

It looks like there are deficiencies in the entire system and that PULSE is not up to scratch.  We have been talking about this since 2014.  Should a new system be put in place?  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and PULSE are the most important elements for law in this country.  Is PULSE outdated?

I will elaborate on some of the problems with the PULSE system.  There are probably four main types of problems.  The first relates to the difference between the number of crimes that are reported and, subsequently, the percentage of those crimes that are actually recorded on PULSE.</p><p>Another problem was with the completeness of the recording of the details of crime, for example, the relationship between the victim and the offender, which is important information in terms of crimes like domestic abuse, and the motive of the crime, which is important information in terms of hate and discrimination crimes.  The timeliness of the recording of crimes was also a problem.</p><p> Our quality reviews have undertaken in-depth studies of these quality characteristics.  It is important to note that we have seen some improvement between the first and third quality reports and that the PULSE system is being adapted by the Garda to address some of the issues raised in the quality reports.  However, significant gaps still exist.  Until those gaps and problems are-----</p></speech>

Rather, the issue is what is going into the system.  This relates to one of our key recommendations, namely, the importance of creating the criminal recording rules document.  If there was clarity in document form about how different crimes should be recorded and that document was made available to everyone who had to input the data, one would introduce a systematic way of consistently capturing types of information.  The problem is that there is not really clarity at the moment and no document is in use.  This is why we have prioritised this document as one of the three actions that we want to push with the Garda.  We have been clear.  We are working with the Garda and are being open and transparent with it about what we view as the quality issues.  We have also been open and clear with it about what we see as the solutions.  Of course, we are not criminologists.  Our focus is on trying to help the Garda improve its data.  The key point is that it needs to improve the quality of its PULSE data for its own purposes first.  If it does so, then that will have a benefit for the Garda and the recording of crime statistics.</p></speech>

It has to do with clarity around the rules.  For example, when the CSO compiles statistics, we must use manuals and clear guidelines, which come from EUROSTAT.  Every member state must compile statistics in the same way.  My point in this instance is that there is not enough clarity around the crime recording rules.  Therefore, it becomes difficult for members of the Garda who are trying to put data into the PULSE system to do so in a consistent way across the regions.</p></speech>

It is good to see gender representation.  I quoted the CSO's opening statement yesterday: "good policies start with good data" and "Good data is the lifeblood of decision making and the basis for accountability."  The CSO is the most important organisation or body to appear before us.  In a time of post-truths and fake news, we must be able to rely on statistical information.  An intelligent Government should form policy using statistical information.  I will base my questions on that idea, so I will ask the witnesses to bear with me.  The witnesses also stated that they aimed to turn statistics into information and knowledge for all.  That is very good.</p> <p>  The CSO is before us with its accounts and no issues have been raised in that regard, so I will zone in on the risk register.  If we cannot believe statistics, we are in serious trouble.  I will revert to the Garda issue in a minute.  Regarding the CSO's own risk register, what risks has it identified to assure the public that the quality of its work is further above par than any other organisation?</p></speech>

Of our budget, 78% is attributable to wages and salaries.  We do not have a programme budget, only an administrative one.  We put the risks across three fronts - financial, statistical and technological.  The types of risk we have identified relate to ensuring that we have a budget that supports our corporate objective of providing data for decision makers and for accountability.  We always concentrate on ensuring that we have the appropriate funding in place.</p></speech>

It is not limiting our ability too much at the moment because many of these posts are roles designed to help us meet new demands such as the Growing Up in Ireland survey and the sexual violence survey.  We are also trying to continually exploit administrative data, in other words data held by Government bodies, and we are also seeking to exploit big data.  These vacancies are slowing down the speed at which we can progress some of these corporate issues.  We have a broad range of recruitment competitions under way in the CSO across all grades.  We have been filling posts right since the end of last year.  We have a figure in mind and we are trying to fill 75 posts between now and the end of this year in a broad range of grades and skill sets.</p></speech>

Let me go back to what was stated about the CSO saving money on consultants.   I am always delighted when we save money on consultants, bearing in mind that we have the consultants for the national children's hospital beside us here.  The CSO saved money and then it went back and carried out an employee engagement survey in 2017.  I like to see that.  I often think it is possible to find much more money if people on the ground are listened to.  I state that given my 17 years at local level.  We could have avoided many problems if that had been done.  What feedback has come from staff within the CSO and been listened to and heard to improve the organisation's service?  What help is given to staff to upskill given the CSO has vacancies?  What has been learned in general from that engagement with employees?  Please do not tell me what has been done with all departments.  I am just interested in the witnesses' department.</p></speech>

We expect to be in the field next year with a pilot.  International best practice is to conduct a pilot, so our intention is to be in the field with a pilot in the summer months of 2020, ideally.  Our hope then is to be in field with the live survey in the summer of 2021.  We do not want to undertake a survey of this nature in the dark winter months.  That is also the guidance internationally.  We are now engaging with a broad range of users.  Our staff were in the UK last week meeting expects including Professor Liz Kelly and Professor Sylvia Walton.  We are trying to set up a meeting with Professor Hannah McGee to learn from the experience of the first SAVI report back in 2002.</p><p>We also had engagement with the broader range of stakeholders to outline what we are planning to do, and we will be setting up a stakeholder group to start that engagement process towards the design of the questionnaire, the design of the samples and so on.

We have never had a greater body of data available to us and the ability to manipulate it because, obviously, we have IT systems that allow us to do that.  At the same, we have bigger traffic jams, a shortage of school places, schools in the wrong places at the wrong time and a housing mismatch.  If it does anything, this highlights that we are not using some of material we should be using in an effective way to deal with these issues.  However, the information is there.  I cannot resist saying that because it drives me nuts.</p> <p>  In regard to the PULSE system, the old adage "rubbish in, rubbish out" comes to mind, in that, if the material is not inputted and catalogued correctly, it will not give accurate results.  At the moment, how confident is the CSO in the Garda statistics?  Are there flaws in the PULSE system in addition to the personnel input?</p></speech>

To be honest, it would have been impossible for the CSO to identify the issues the inspectorate report came up with because we would not have had access to the data required to get into that level of detail, and we would never have been in a position to get the access to the information that was required to unearth those issues.  We do now, however, because, subsequently, following on from all of the engagement with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, garda&iacute; now make all information available to us to assess the quality of Garda data accurately.</p></speech>

It is a recognised issue.  It can be quite difficult to get the necessary information on the recorded crime statistics from what is a system that is designed for administrative purposes rather than for statistical purposes.  We are not necessarily an outlier.  It is definitely an issue in the UK as well, as far as I am aware.</p></speech>

One part refers to "System Health Accounts".  If the witnesses do not have the answer now, they can send it on to the committee.  There is a timescale of a year and a half, or 78 weeks.  What are those statistics and why does it take a year and a half to get them?  Surely the CSO should be more worried about that.</p></speech>

Primarily, they are exclusively administrative data sources, so these would be data that are made available from the administrative system.

They are very important statistics and it is relatively new for the CSO to be publishing them in the format they are currently going out in, with additional detail.  It is about what is spent on health, who is spending it and where it is being spent.  They are a very valuable set of tables for health policymakers and decision-makers in that space.  As Mr. Dalton said, they are produced from a blend of data, primarily data from the HSE.</p><p>We also do some collection from private health providers and we use other administrative data for estimating out-of-pocket expenditure on health.  We are trying to really show the broad expenditure on health.  Timeliness is an issue.  We have worked on it and we have tried to improve it.  We have brought it back and it is a focus for improving that timeliness even more so.</p></speech>

It is county incomes and value added across the counties.  The figures are benchmarked against our regular annual production cycle.  In June 2019 we will be producing definitive figures for 2018 and then we work on from that on things like the county incomes and the value added.  What we have done in the last iterations of those county incomes, in acknowledgement of the fact that they are important to people to have up-to-date data, is we have put in provision for very preliminary estimates for the latest year, if I can put it that way.  So when we are going out we put in the latest year as well in there.  Just as the Chairman said, people need more timely data on it.  For the annual data it can be difficult to get the sources, but we can always do something on partial sources and we do that where we can.</p></speech>

We had a process for it and we went through it.  We can send it on because all the documentation and all our thinking are publicly available on the Internet.  Some of the issues that were borderline or on-balance issues on Irish Water are still being thrashed out at the different technical groups in EUROSTAT.  There are a number of states that agree with our interpretation; EUROSTAT has its interpretation and other member states have different interpretations again.  What I would say is that some of the fundamentals that classification decision raised still rumble on.  I would still say that on the process, on our interpretation of the process, what we did we did absolutely by the book and by the rules.  That is the way we have to do it.</p></speech>

If one is constructing a business case that one is going to be building out and if it is going to be very close to the margins, if I can call it, around the rules around these decisions, the likelihood is that a prudent decision would mean that the classification would be on balance sheet.  It is very difficult in these, what are called, <i>ex ante</i>classifications.</p></speech>

It is under reservation and it is a very serious matter.  We have heard the Policing Authority report today.  In that context, when will the reservation be lifted?  What are the criteria for lifting the reservation?</p> <p>  I presume the CSO did not seek to do the SAVI report.  Following pressure the Government took a policy decision to do it.  What expertise does the CSO have in that regard?  I am concerned about the date.  I realise it has to be done right.  I read it at the time.</p><p>A feature that jumped out besides the prevalence of the violence was the therapeutic nature of the way the research was carried out.  Follow-up research was done and, because of the sensitive way it was carried out, it was found to be extremely therapeutic.  Men and women reported stuff they had never reported before on a telephone.  Could Mr. Dalton refer to that type of qualitative research and expertise?</p><p> I have a practical question on the islands.  I was reading something for tomorrow on the Aran Islands.  Many of the CSO's figures were very helpful but I understand it does not give a statistical breakdown island by island.  Is that the case?</p><p> My last question is on staff, the importance of the CSO, and risks.  Having sat here for two and a half years, I believe we learn most from staff if we listen to them and if what is required is in place.  On the last occasion Mr. Dalton spoke to the staff - I refer to the questionnaire - what issues arose and how is he dealing with them?  How is he dealing with recruitment issues and in-service building up of skills when there are difficulties outside?  Those are questions but I would like the witnesses to start with the easy ones, on the criteria and the islands.</p></speech>

If one is producing data from a sample survey, one cannot drill down.  As the Deputy knows from the labour force survey, we cannot produce statistics below regional level because, as one drills down through a sample, the coefficient of variation or sampling error becomes a factor.  In other words, the quality deteriorates.  One cannot always produce data for small areas.  What we are doing about this is increasingly using administrative data to allow us to produce more refined statistical outputs.</p></speech>

Secondary sources are basically data held by Departments, Civil Service bodies, local authorities and public service bodies.  We have a legal right of access to those data.  We can integrate them and provide new statistical analysis.  One sees a lot of that.  Almost 55% of all CSO outputs now incorporate what we call blended administrative data.  It involves administrative data linked with other administrative data, or administrative data linked with statistical data.  We are continually moving in that direction.</p> <p>  Does Ms Hurley want to say something about staffing and risk?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Hurley" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041100002#R02400"><p>On the first topic, to offer the Deputy some reassurance regarding vacancies we will provide her with a detailed breakdown.  In broad terms, it is important to understand that more than half of our medium-term vacancies relate to specialist technology posts.  One of the greatest difficulties we have had in this regard concerns the lack of availability of panels of staff ready to be appointed and the necessity, in some cases, to run tailored competitions.</p> <p>  On the statistical side, we run statistical competitions every year.  It happened last year that our full panel of statisticians was exhausted by the autumn.  Therefore, it is only vacancies that have crystallised on the statistical side since the autumn that continue into to this year.  Added to that, it is important to note that, because we supply statisticians for secondment to the wider statistical system, we have a constant catalogue of requests coming in for statisticians to send on secondment.  That has also created backlogs.</p> <p>  Turning to the other dimension, concerning risk management and the extent to which we engage with staff, whether it be through the Civil Service employee engagement survey, CSEES, or other channels, we have already published our action plan further to the CSEES survey.  The action plan was developed in consultation with colleagues from across the organisation.  There are now active working groups considering what actions are required to give effect to the objectives set out in the action plan.  A key channel in the delivery of those actions is our engagement and innovation board, which is a long-standing structure in the CSO.  It is a cross-staffing grade structure specifically targeted at affording a discussion forum for matters affecting staff in all areas of the business, both statistical and administrative.</p> <p>  The engagement and innovation board is just one of the forums we use to engage with staff.  We have grade-based forums, a senior management group forum, a general management form, and grade-based forms for all the administrative grades.  At present, we are in the process of completing a significant round of consultations in the preparation of the CSO people strategy to take us forward for the next several years in respect of the supports we are putting in place to develop our staff in terms of their technical skills and aptitude to deliver the supports required for the business and also to enable them to fulfil their full potential.  I will follow up in writing with further detail, as the Deputy requested.  I hope, however, my answer gives some illustration of the extensive variety of consultations and forums that are available to enable the flow of information in both directions across the entire organisation.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General, Seamus McCarthy, is the auditor for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He is accompanied by Mr. Bernard Barron, partner with Mazars, which carries out the audit on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I think it is the first time the Committee of Public Accounts has examined the financial statements of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in over 20 years.  While many people will not remember that, we have a policy of trying to cover as many Votes as possible every year, which is why we are here today.  We are also joined by Ms Colette Drinan, who is the Accounting Officer of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, although some people think it is Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Andrew Harkness, director of audit, and Ms Mairead Leyden, senior auditor.</p><p>I remind witnesses and members to turn off their mobile telephones or switch them to airplane mode.</p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee, through me as Chairperson, to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

Legally, the office is part of the Civil Service and is funded through Vote 8.  As the Constitution requires that I must audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas, specific arrangements have to be put in place to facilitate this being done in an independent fashion.</p> <p>  First, it should be noted that Ms Drinan, as secretary, is the administrative head of the office, with responsibility for operations and ensuring good value delivery of the service.  This is in addition to her responsibility as a director of audit for delivery of a portfolio of audits and reports.  As Accounting Officer, she controls the annual Estimate and the office&rsquo;s spending, and is responsible for submitting the appropriation account.</p> <p>  Second, I appoint a competitively procured, private sector auditor to carry out the audit of the appropriation account on my behalf, and to report to me on the results of the audit.  The contract for the audit is currently with Mazars.  The objective of the audit is the same as for all other appropriation account audits and the audit approach is similar to that carried out by my office for all other Votes.  I rely on the certificate and report of Mazars as the basis for presentation of my own certificate, and the auditor&rsquo;s certificate is presented with my own to the Oireachtas.  Consequently, I am accompanied for this session by Mr. Bernard Barron, a partner at Mazars, who leads the audit for the company. </p> <p>  Due to the requirement under auditing standards to rotate responsibility for particular audits, I appointed Ms Drinan to her current portfolio in January of this year.  She replaced Mr. Harkness on that portfolio, and also as secretary of the office and as Accounting Officer.  Mr. Harkness had fulfilled that role for just over six years and members will note that he signed off on the 2017 appropriation account.  He, too, is in attendance.</p> <p>  The office&rsquo;s appropriation account records gross expenditure of &euro;11.9 million in 2017, representing an increase of around 3% on the 2016 expenditure.  The bulk of the expenditure each year is on salaries.  Non-Exchequer receipts into the Vote amounted to just under &euro;6 million in 2017.  This mainly comprised receipts of fees charged by the office for non-Vote financial audits carried out by the office.  The office&rsquo;s policy, as agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is full recovery of the costs incurred on non-Vote audits over a three-year cycle.  Fees are not charged for Vote audits or audits of the finance and Revenue accounts, or in respect of any reporting work undertaken.  As a result of the recovery of fees and some other appropriations-in-aid, the net expenditure on the Vote in 2017 was just under &euro;6 million.  The surplus for surrender at the year end was &euro;978,000.  I am glad to report that the office received a clear audit opinion and there were no matters arising from the audit that I or Mazars considered required reporting to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. </p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Andrew Harkness, director of audit and previous Accounting Officer, and Ms Mairead Leyden, senior auditor.  I would like to offer some background information before looking at the specifics of the 2017 appropriation account.</p> <p>  The committee is, of course, very familiar with the work of the office, which is to assist the Comptroller and Auditor General in the exercise of his statutory functions.  In his opening statement, the Comptroller and Auditor General set out the distinction between his constitutional role and the role of the office, and my role as Accounting Officer.  When I became Accounting Officer in January, I took on responsibility for the administrative operations of the office.  As such, I am responsible for ensuring that adequate financial management and internal control systems are in place to support the proper administration of the office in an economical and efficient manner. </p> <p>  The office&rsquo;s approved staff complement is 178.  As at 31 March 2019, the office had 159 full-time equivalent members of staff and 19 vacancies.  We have recently completed a trainee auditor recruitment process, resulting in a panel of 29, and consequently the number of vacancies is expected to be reduced significantly in the coming weeks.  The current staff are distributed across three functional areas.  Nearly three quarters of the staff work on financial audit, 15% work on examination reporting, while 12% work on support services. </p></speech>

Is that special reports?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.405" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Colette Drinan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041100002#S00900"><p>Yes.  It is performance audit.</p><p>Financial audit involves the annual financial audits of almost 290 clients.  All financial audit staff from the auditor grade upwards are qualified accountants.  Audits are carried out in accordance with international standards on auditing.  To manage peaks in demand during the calendar year the office contracts out a number of these financial audits annually.  A key objective of the office is to advance the timeliness of the completion of financial audits.  The committee will be aware of the progress made on this over recent years.  At the end of 2018, eight sets of financial statements relating to 2017 or earlier years had not been certified.  This compares with 13 arrears for 2017.</p><p> The output of the reporting programme comprises the report on the accounts of the public services, which issues at the end of September each year, and special reports.  In 2018, a total of 29 reports were issued.  This was made up of 22 chapters in the report on the accounts of the public services and seven special reports.  The figure compares with 26 reports issued in 2017, made up of 24 chapters and two special reports.</p><p> Support services comprise a number of business units covering human resources, finance, information technology, good practice, business improvement, training and development and corporate services.</p><p> I will now set out the financial position.  In 2017, the office operated an administrative gross budget of &euro;12.64 million, nearly 82% of which was allocated to salaries.  During 2017, actual expenditure was approximately &euro;11.9 million, which was &euro;720,000 or 6% below budget.  This was primarily due to savings of approximately &euro;500,000 in salaries.  There was a further saving of &euro;291,000 in subhead A7 because our requirement for external assistance for examinations was less than budgeted for.</p><p> On the receipts side, audit fee income was up by over &euro;300,000, reflecting the earlier completion of the audit programme.  This trend continued in 2018.  The savings in salaries have arisen mainly due to turnover of staff and the carrying of unfilled vacancies.  Vacancies arise due to staff departing and due to an increase in the overall staff complement in recent years.  There is currently a shortage of qualified accountants in the Irish market as a result of the recovery in the economy.  This has created a demand for experienced accountants and we see the impact of this on our turnover rates.  We recruit actively.  In the past three years we have made 125 staff appointments, including 64 recruits at entry level.  The environment continues to be challenging and we keep this issue under constant review.</p><p> This is a brief overview of the office and its work.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for their attention and I welcome the opportunity to engage further on specific queries that committee members may have.</p></speech>

The deputation is very welcome.  Ms Drinan described how different types of work are required to be done.  There are mandatory audits and this work is constitutionally provided for.  That is not where we will see the staff shortages showing up if they exist.  We will see staff shortages showing up where there is opportunity cost.  I presume that is where there is a degree of discretion.  What does not get done as a consequence of staff shortages?  Is the number significant?</p></speech>

It is not a question of vacancies sitting in particular areas that are not filled.  The vacancies are distributed.  Deputy Murphy is right about the statutory audit work.  A programme is in place and it has to be delivered.  The consequence of vacancies in that area would impact on the timeliness of the delivery of the financial audit.  We look at how to manage that.  We are keenly aware of the need to produce the financial statements and get certification as soon as possible.  The area that probably tends to suffer is more on the performance audit side.</p></speech>

Ms Drinan has made it clear that the cost of the audit is not on the entity that has been audited.  Yet, it is clear that there are problems in those particular ones.

Obviously, it has an impact on the plan for how staff were to be deployed.  If staff need to take longer on a particular client, then it will have a knock-on impact for the rest of the audit programme.  In those situations we look at the amount that we will charge the client.  We consider whether it is appropriate in those circumstances to add an additional fee to reflect the fact that the audit took longer than originally envisaged.</p></speech>

One relates to where short-term vacancies arise because of departures.  We would look to get contractors in on short-term contracts while we are looking to fill the posts permanently.  Committee members will see from the information I sent that the number of contractors and the amount we have spent on contractors has reduced significantly.

This is true when we contract out audits as well.  The price can vary from year to year, depending on how busy potential contractors are.  If they have more scope, they are willing to price very competitively, and in that instance it can represent good value.  It is hard to get a long-term value for money comparison done.  It varies.</p></speech>

In that context, we rolled over the contract we had in place until we had a better sense of what exactly we wanted to replace the contract with.  Those services are being tendered for at the moment.  We have moved to a shared service model with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  We came online there in December 2018 and on foot of that we have gone to the market for residual services we need.</p></speech>

Although 75% may be routine audits, people may pay more attention to special projects and special works.  That is an observation more than anything else.  I am sure the witnesses would not disagree with it.  Ms Drinan referred to contracting out and mentioned that it is done by local union agreement.  Is that specific to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General or is the office part of a public service-wide agreement?</p></speech>

My guess of &euro;100,000 was a low estimate.  I ask that question in order to make people aware that organisations such as the NTMA and the HSE pay the largest fees to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  It was stated that the target of the office is to get all audits completed within 12 months of their year-end and that it takes approximately three months to get them in.  In my opinion, the office should target getting audits cleared within three months of being submitted.  I acknowledge that there is a 12-month target, but getting audited accounts for a previous year in November or December may be too late.  In the long term, the office should try to clear the audits within three months.  I acknowledge that the appropriation accounts were finished by the end of September.  In an ideal world, some of the big accounts would be cleared more quickly.  I acknowledge that accounts of organisations such as the NTMA and the HSE will be in in the summer but it would be great if all of the accounts could be smartened up in that way.  It is probably an issue of resources as much as anything else.</p></speech>

If even the appropriation accounts could be published separately from the report, it would give us more scope.  There is a kind of anomalous situation whereby we publish financial statements for 25 Departments.  No other state auditor is required to do that.  Rather, the entities publish their own financial statements.  The legislative framework under which we operate creates these large, lumpy deliveries which we must make.</p></speech>

It need not be put up on the screen.  On page 13 there is a figure showing the uncertified accounts at the end of the year.  I am not referring to the appropriation accounts but, rather, the performance report 2018.  The witnesses are familiar with it.  In 2013 and 2014, there were approximately 60 uncertified accounts, whereas last year there were only eight such accounts.  That is a remarkable improvement from the committee's objective point of view.  I acknowledge that the high-value accounts were always completed but it is good to see that we are down to only eight uncertified accounts.  They are a tiny percentage of the 60 accounts that were in that category a few short years ago.</p> <p>  On management letters, I will explain to those watching the proceedings the difference between issues that must be reported on the statement of internal control and those that are only included in the management letter.  How does the office decide the category into which such issues fall?  How is it decided which is public and which is private?</p></speech>

I am required by law to report on material matters.  Generally, where we identify losses that have occurred, we ensure that they are reported publicly.  Where we see a weakness in controls, there is an opportunity for management to fix those and those tend to be the kind of things that would go into a management letter.</p></speech>

At our meeting last week, we agreed to invite Professor Chris Fitzpatrick to attend this meeting following his correspondence with the committee regarding the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's financial statements for 2017.  I welcome Professor Fitzpatrick, who is a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital and a clinical professor with the UCD school of medicine.  He is also one of the authors of the report Putting Children First - Proposal for a Word Class Tri-located National Paediatric Hospital, which was circulated to members for information.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and people in the Public Gallery to turn their mobile phones off or to place them in flight mode.  I advise Professor Fitzpatrick that, by virtue section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if he is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and he continues to so do, he is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded that Professor Fitzpatrick is here on a voluntary basis to inform our examination of the financial statements as part of our work looking at the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board financial statements.  They are also reminded of the provision in Standing Orders to the effect that the committee should refrain from inquiring into any merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policy.  Our focus is on whether proper financial public procedures have been followed and whether value for money has been achieved by the work of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to date.</p><p>I propose that, following Professor Fitzpatrick's opening remarks, we have a round of clarifying questions from the members present.  Members can indicate when they want to speak.  I call on Professor Fitzpatrick to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am here today in a personal capacity.  I am also representing the children with the highest mortality rates in the State - the 200 or so critically ill newborn infants who, every year, within hours of birth, are separated from their mothers and transported in ambulances between the Dublin maternity hospitals and the children's hospitals in Crumlin and Temple Street and for whom nothing will change in this hazardous journey when the national children's hospital is built.  These are babies who are diagnosed before birth with life-threatening conditions and, of the 600 newborn babies who are transferred between hospitals in the State, these are the 200 who are most likely to die.</p> <p>  Best international practice dictates that these very high-risk babies are delivered in a co-located maternity hospital and, after initial stabilisation, immediately transferred across an internal link corridor to a tertiary children's hospital.  This model of care is supported and endorsed by the medical director of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.</p></speech>

It is also of the utmost importance that these critically ill babies are cared for close to their mothers during the most vulnerable period of their lives and that mothers are not kept apart from their sick babies, stressed and worried on the post-natal wards of maternity hospitals in different parts of the city.  I hope, by coming here today, that the committee will strongly recommend that the best interests of these critically ill babies, who have mortality rates between 5% and almost 20%, are addressed as a matter of priority for financial reasons, as this is the Committee of Public Accounts, but also, more importantly, for medical and compassionate reasons.  If we are building the most expensive hospital in the world, these babies need to be looked after.<br/><br/>By way of background, in November 2012, the then Minister for Health and current Senator, Dr. James Reilly, announced that the national paediatric hospital was to be developed on the current site at St. James's Hospital.  There was no reference to when a maternity hospital might be built although there was an aspiration to do so.  In October 2014, the then Minister for Health and current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, suggested that a planning application be submitted for a maternity hospital alongside the children's hospital.  This was not done.<br/><br/>A document supplied by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to the Committee of Public Accounts in January states, in reference to St. James's, that it is not known when or if it is certain that a maternity building will be constructed.  It is also of note that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's PowerPoint presentation to the Committee of Public Accounts on 31 January last contained not a single reference to maternity co-location.  It is fair to state that there is widespread scepticism that maternity co-location will happen unless it starts soon.<br/><br/>Why come before the Committee on Pubic Accounts?  The State is building the most expensive hospital in the world, namely, the national children's hospital.  It is intended that a maternity hospital will be built beside it in the interests of critically ill babies.  If a maternity hospital can never be built on this site or if, when the national children's hospital is built, there is simply no room left for such a facility, then the State will have built the most expensive hospital in the world on the wrong site.  This would be both a financial and medical catastrophe.<br/><br/>Although PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, did not mention it, it should also be noted that the original cost estimates for the development of the national children's hospital, including a basement car park as cited by St. James's Hospital in April 2012 to the all important Dolphin review, was &euro;297.75 million.  In the same submission, it was also stated that, &quot;The site proposed has very limited decanting requirements and thereby prompt access to site for development commencement (&amp;lt; 6 months).&quot;<font color="#4F4F4F">  </font>Importantly, this proposal also contained a co-located maternity hospital of 42,000 sq. m.<br/><br/>There are certainly issues of concern as to how back-of-the-envelope financial calculations, assertions about easy site clearance and the availability of a very generous footprint for a maternity hospital, which seems to have evaporated, became the shaky foundations for the construction of the most expensive hospital in the world, the national children's hospital.  Added to this remains the intrigue surrounding reports in the media of a last-minute switch of sites by the Government.  Lessons also need to be learned from this.  With projected costs in excess of &euro;1.73 billion, a completion date now reset at 2023 and no sign of a co-located maternity hospital, the committee will agree that there is a need to think more carefully about what we are doing on this site, not just continuing blindly as though there are not very serious issues to deal with and not just believing everything that we are being told.<br/><br/>As I see it, there are two options for the current crisis relating to funding and maternity co-location.  One is to stop the current development and relocate to Connolly Hospital.  The advantages of Connolly Hospital are well known when it comes to construction methodology, space, nationwide access and the opportunity to co-locate the Rotunda Hospital.  The analysis of this option, however, must take into consideration the money spent, or lost, on the St. James's site to date, expenditure on the satellite centre at Connolly, estimated contractual liabilities and legal costs resulting from stopping the development of St. James's Hospital and the need to significantly upgrade the adult services in Connolly to the levels of St. James's Hospital, the Mater Hospital or St. Vincent's University Hospital to support the co-location of a maternity hospital and paediatric hospital.  That would be an enormous strategic and financial undertaking, which is often not factored into the equation, and also the long delay that would happen in that case.<br/><br/>At a pragmatic level, the project at St. James's Hospital, the site of which I visited last night, is probably past its tipping point.  In addition, there appears to be limited public support to stop and start again for the third time.  The political consequences of changing the site are considerable.  There are certainly no votes in stopping this building.<br/><br/>The other option is to continue with the development on the current site.  This should only continue if there is evidence that the overall projected costs can be properly estimated and are affordable; in other words, that there are no unknown unknowns, that the proper governance and cost control structures are put in place and that the recommendations of the PwC report are implemented.  The overall cost must also include a maternity hospital, which should have been included from the start and the current site must be stress tested, in the same way that PwC stress tested the finances, to ensure that it can accommodate a maternity hospital, the Coombe, and that the co-location of the latter is, in accordance with Government policy, now prioritised among other planned projects on a very busy St. James's Hospital site and included in the national capital plan, with a short timeline for delivery and ring-fenced funding.  It is of note now that St. James's Hospital is planning to build a cancer hospital.</p><p>This is a site that does not stand still, it is the busiest hospital in the State.  It needs to be prioritised that a maternity hospital is developed on this site if it is to happen at all.</p><p> Taking all this into consideration, I propose that this co-location of the maternity service on the St. James's campus be accelerated while, at the same, time fulfilling the ambitions of the national women and infants healthcare programme run by the HSE and Department of Health in respect of women's healthcare needs.  This proposal involves the transfer of maternity services only from the Coombe to St. James's Hospital.  The Coombe Hospital caters for both gynaecology services and maternity services.  It has the largest gynaecology service in the State.  It exists on 5.5 acres or 17,500 m2.  The site currently earmarked for the maternity hospital at St. James's is 3 acres, so there is an issue about fitting onto the site.  The way I propose that this be done is to move the maternity service but to retain the large gynaecology service on its current site in the context of an integrated campus.  This would allow the development of a benign gynaecology services as well as the national cervical screening laboratory services on the present Coombe site.  Any investment in that site would be future-proofed.  The reconfiguration of the services would also liberate space on the site which could be used to fund the co-location.</p><p> This would result in a faster tri-location, for less and on a smaller footprint and with considerably less campus disruption.  I will not give ballpark figures or back-of-the-envelope calculations but this would cost a minimal amount in comparison with the amount that has been squandered on the St. James's Hospital site.  This would develop an integrated campus across two sites.</p><p> Over the past week, "Liveline" has heard how the maternity services over the years have failed mothers and babies, how clinicians have failed at times to listen and to act with compassion and how things need to improve.  I am not sure what it takes for politicians to also listen and make decisions based on medical evidence and compassion as well as economics.  We do not want to be told in years to come how when we had the chance to do what was right, that we failed to respond to the critical needs of the most vulnerable children in the State and their mothers.  This is not a legacy that any Government or supply party in opposition in a confidence and supply agreement would want to leave behind.  </p><p> Critically ill babies should not be made to suffer because of poor decision-making at the start of this project and reckless spending since it commenced.  In the end, we bailed out the banks.  Babies and children are far more important than banks.  We need to bail out this hospital.  We need to build a maternity hospital as quickly as possible.  If that means going to the European Investment Bank, EIB, for another extension on a loan, so be it.  We also need to learn from our mistakes, including the mistakes that were made by the Dolphin review and that were made at the origin of this decision.  We must take account of our actions.  This is now a beleaguered project and we need to rediscover the vision that inspired us to bring three different types of hospitals together and to make it into a truly world-class centre.  There is no option but to make it work.</p></speech>

I read his letter asking to come in and it encouraged me to invite him.  He has made a number of comments, apart from rediscovering the vision.  He said mistakes were made and it is certainly not the best site.  Even if we park that, the most important issue is to look at the site to see a maternity hospital can be built.  That is fundamental to the success of the tri-location.</p></speech>

Those who object to the site do so for many reasons.  The key objection at the present time relates to the absence of maternity co-location.  Other reasons are cited including cost, nationwide access, expansion capability and space, but the key issue is the absence of a maternity hospital co-location.  That is what will stop it being a world-class centre.  My argument is that if we are building the most expensive hospital in the world, and calling it a centre of excellence, and if it is going to be a world-class hospital, it should not exclude those babies who have the highest mortality rates, the children who need to have access to this.</p> <p>  The other issue in respect of Connolly Hospital is its range of specialty expertise in the context of its academic prowess.  St. James's Hospital, the Mater and St. Vincent's Hospital are at a different level in the support they would provide to a co-locating maternity hospital, and to a co-locating paediatric hospital.  Academically, and in terms of its medical specialties, St. James's hospital is the right site.  There was no ideal site for this.  We put in a proposal which was short-listed to the final three.  It was an imaginative proposal but the decision has been made.  There were flaws in how that decision was made but the one issue that will convert much of the angst, frustration and criticism of this site is to somehow ascertain whether it can accommodate a maternity hospital, which I believe it can.  There is a way of establishing flexible arrangements between the Coombe and St. James's Hospital can be achieved, and we should go ahead and do it.  Everyone would row in behind that.</p> <p>  There has been a lot of criticism of the project and the wow factor that should pertain to this hospital has been lost.  It needs to be rediscovered and we need to work together to make it happen.  My concern is that St. James's Hospital is a busy site academically and clinically.  It is fanciful to think that a space can be held or sterilised for five or ten years and then made available.  I am also concerned that if it goes on for years, some 200 babies annually will not have access to this hospital.  This figure will increase with increasing pre-natal diagnosis.  The Coombe is also seeing referrals from the North of Ireland.  This hospital will have a referral basis from the whole island of Ireland.  A lot of babies will lose out on this.  We need to get the co-location.  People are looking at the finances but somebody needs to look at the site and reassure everyone the maternity hospital will go in there.  It should be put in the capital plan with the design started now, whether it is done back-to-back or some works can be started in advance, but it should be prioritised in relation to St. James Hospital and the capital plan.  It currently exists nowhere.</p></speech>

According to an <i>Irish Times </i>editorial, there is a need to address cancer issues in the hospital, which is the largest cancer hospital in the State.  That site has a maximum capacity.  What one would not want to happen is that in 2023, when the doors of the new paediatric hospital open, that there will be no space for a maternity hospital.  That is why I believe the space should be identified, along with planning, decanting and demolition issues, and that process should start now.  The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Health, asked for a planning application to be submitted at the same time for the children's hospital and the maternity hospital.  I am not certain why that did not happen.  It may have been because after the Mater site had failed planning, that were it made any more complex, it could fail planning again but it is time to grasp the nettle.  There is a total lack of credibility and trust on this.  Those of us who work on the front line in relation to babies feel that we have been sidelined regarding the patients whom we feel are important.<br/><br/>There is a way of dealing with this.  It is too late to stop the project.  Academically and in terms of the specialties, St. James's is the best place and we must make it work.  Regarding the space available and what it would entail in co-locating onto that site, flexibility could be put into place that would allow this to happen sooner rather than later.  The message needs to go out to all those who genuinely object to the site because of the absence of co-location that this is now a Government priority.<br/><br/>I am reluctant to throw out figures because I have seen back-of-the-envelope calculations before which were widely out of range.  The St. Vincent's Hospital project is now at approximately &euro;300 million, whereas it began at &euro;150 million.  It is more than 45,000 m<sup>2</sup>.</p></speech>

Our paths have crossed and I alerted the committee that we know each other to an extent.  I thank Professor Fitzpatrick for the time he served as master of the Coombe hospital.  It is something people do and it is not often recognised.  It is a very important role and I have told the health committee previously that I am a big fan of the mastership model of care.  Professor Fitzpatrick will know that I have experience of having a child in a Dublin hospital who had to be transferred for the reasons Professor Fitzpatrick outlined.  The child was taken from me at birth and brought to Crumlin hospital.  That is not much of an effort when one is in Dublin and people might say, "what about it?".  However, Professor Fitzpatrick knows the risks involved in such transfers as well as the knock-on effects of having a child, handing it over to somebody else in a different hospital and being left alone.  It is not something people think about until they are in that situation.  The figures are stark that in that transfer period bad things can happen and children's lives are lost.</p> <p>  Before becoming involved in politics I was initially not in favour of the St. James's site but I bought into the idea based on the concept of the tri-location of an adult hospital, a paediatric hospital and a maternity hospital on the same site, supported by the sub-specialties Professor Fitzpatrick has discussed.  My argument for supporting the site diminishes, however, if there is no chance of a maternity hospital on site.  It is critical that a maternity hospital be on the site and I thank Professor Fitzpatrick for his clear argument today that it must happen and that it must start now so it is ready and fit for purpose as well as ticking the boxes for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and all that was planned from the start.  It is not the right site if there is no maternity hospital because that was one of the fundamental reasons for putting it there.</p> <p>  The cancer unit on the site concerns me.  In St. James's Hospital and through the cancer strategy we have very good survival rates for cancer now, and I will be discussing this later in the D&aacute;il.  If there is a space there for the cancer unit does Professor Fitzpatrick think it could be put somewhere else?  If he were to juggle the cancer unit and the maternity hospital, he appears to be saying today that the maternity hospital should get priority.</p></speech>

I would not wish to second guess or somehow inhibit the development of cancer services in St. James's Hospital.  I am a patient in St. James's Hospital as well, where I am very well looked after.  I believe it is possible to do all these things.  St. James's Hospital has a can do attitude.  It does things and is a very ambitious hospital.  I am saying that in that ambition we must make certain that there is a protected space, and the way to protect the space is to start doing something about it now and not to wait.  Basically, it would be a travesty of everything that has happened in this regard to find out a couple of years hence that we could not get planning for a hospital that should have been built at the start.  The flawed decision was not to put in a dual application at the start and have a co-build.  I believe we should examine how the fastest build can be achieved, what the site is, what the specification is and issues regarding access, but this work should start now.  The work must be funded because obviously we require experts to help us with it.  That process can start.</p> <p>  In terms of neonatal transport, we have a wonderful neonatal transport service.  However, it is recognised that babies decompensate during transport.  Certainly, the model of care that is recommended by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is that babies who have critical illnesses and pre-identified problems and who need to be transferred to a paediatric hospital ideally should go across a corridor rather than in an ambulance.  The term "world class" has often been bandied about in regard to this hospital, as well as its expense.  It behoves us to do it right and not find ourselves short changed.  Much of the criticism regarding this site relates to the absence of maternity co-location and a disbelief and lack of trust that it might happen.  I was speaking about this in 2006, 2012 and subsequently, but nothing has happened.  It is time to act.</p> <p>  I do not know if the Committee of Public Accounts can recommend or what authority it has in this regard.  I appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health previously and I should have walked out asking for something.  I am asking for the strongest recommendation that the Committee of Public Accounts can give to accelerate the co-location of a maternity hospital on the St. James's Hospital site.  That would mean it would have been worthwhile for me to have appeared before the committee in that regard.  I do not know whether that is possible.  I like the consensus politics we have here at present when one considers what is happening abroad, and I believe there is a consensus on the fact that there is a need for a maternity hospital there.</p> <p>  On the issue of the site, if we were to do it all again we might do it differently, but we are where we are on this.  I believe people want to work together and that they will contribute.  I will contribute whatever I can to it.  I have been critical of this for a long period of time.  Medicine is like politics in that one gets things done through compromise.  We must compromise on this and consider what the important thing is, which is a maternity hospital on that site.  If the committee can do anything to get it there quickly, I would be very grateful.</p></speech>

I am also a member of the health committee.  We have the maternity strategy and I am aware that Professor Fitzpatrick and many of his colleagues had an input into that.  One of the criticisms of the maternity strategy was that it separated obstetrics and gynaecology.  It is the separation of having babies and just being a woman, in layman's terms.  There are many Cinderellas in politics but gynaecology, as we have seen from the massive waiting lists, is often a Cinderella because women will put up with things where other people would not.  In terms of Professor Fitzpatrick's idea of leaving gynaecology in the Coombe and moving births onto the St. James's site, I am concerned that we would have a clinic or a building that might not be fit for purpose.  Not being a doctor, is there an issue there in respect of quality?  By practising operations and doing procedures one gets better, but if one separates obstetrics and gynaecology does one damage the level of expertise or the quality of care?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.552" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Chris Fitzpatrick" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041100002#OO00700"><p>It is a valid question.  I do not believe so.  The issue with benign gynaecology is that it is deprioritised in the general hospitals.  It is very difficult.  A percentage of women with symptoms that are suggestive of benign disease will actually have an occult cancer.  Where women have, for example, problems with menstrual dysfunction and are on a waiting list to go into a maternity hospital or a general hospital, unfortunately a small percentage of them may change from pre-cancer conditions to cancer conditions because there is such a long delay in evaluating them, which is a tragedy.  The issue is the model of care we need for gynaecology care.  I am looking at the development of an integrated campus.  It is not that what would happen in the Coombe would be very different from what happens in St. James's.  The distance between our hospital and St. James's Hospital is less than the distance across St. James's Hospital.  Our vision is that over time this part of Dublin, and a great deal of spin-off development will happen with the paediatric hospital coming into it, will be a medical quarter and over 20 to 40 years both hospitals will grow together.</p> <p>  There are governance issues to be addressed, but the main thing is to focus on patient outcomes, quality of care, access and choice.  There is a wonderful opportunity to develop a customised gynaecology centre, an ambulatory centre, where women would have a range of treatments that are very difficult to access now.  The Coombe hospital currently has a submission with the HSE to develop a new day care centre to cater for all women's reproductive needs, in terms of a one-stop-shop with en suite scanning and so forth and procedures on the day of presentation.</p><p>That is a wonderful model.  It does not necessarily sit well in a cancer hospital.  The spatial organisation of a hospital has to be flexible and allow for a configuration of services in the right spaces.  Regarding space, if we moved our maternity hospital to St. James's Hospital, we would retain our gynaecology services as an integrated service across both sites.  What is currently needed in Dublin and in our hospital group network is ready access to day-case, ambulatory and short-stay gynaecology surgery.  Not only would that be possible in St. James's Hospital, it could be integrated with what is happening in Tallaght University Hospital, Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise and Naas General Hospital.  That would allow a network of care, not segregated but integrated.</p><p> I have seen issues around staff flexibility, concerning new contracts for nurses and midwives and how people work across sites.  I would like the Committee of Public Accounts and the Government to give impetus to prioritising the development of women's healthcare services and the co-location of a maternity hospital on the site of St. James's Hospital.  I am concerned with space, money, and providing the best possible access.  We can be flexible in how we could do that.  It would not be a segregated service, but an integrated one.  </p></speech>

However, I am also considering the site.  Sometimes there is a compromise.  Parking, access and traffic in the area are all considerations.  We would have to consider how that would work.  Our proposal for the national children's hospital was a two-site single campus solution, with the children's hospital to be developed in a site beside St. James's Hospital.  The vision was that the whole campus would work as a single campus.  I am concerned with what works.  The really important thing is to start to make it happen.  These are the questions we need to ask.  We need support from HSE estates and we need a design team.  We need to start planning this hospital now.  I have asked whether work could be done in advance, simultaneously to what is happening in the national children's hospital or back-to-back, but this needs to happen.  There must be a very strong message from the Government saying that the money will be found.  The problem with the overspend is that it will hit lots of things that are on the list to be done.  It could affect the co-location of the Coombe and St. James's Hospital.  Things are going to be cut because of the money lost in the national children's hospital project, and that is one of them.  That would be regrettable.  It would fulfil Deputy O'Connell's worst fears in that this would not end up being the hospital we planned.  It would be a very bad legacy for politics and for medicine.</p></speech>

I have written about this before.  This was played out as a competition between various institutions to acquire the national children's hospital.  Acquiring the national children's hospital would bring such kudos and status to a hospital that it would become the de facto national adult hospital.  There are several issues.  We were emerging from a recession so perhaps money was an issue.  The decision was made after a failed planning application to build on the Mater Hospital site.  Members may remember the visual imagery.  It was a very imaginative, almost surreal hospital in terms of magnitude.  When this was played out for a second time six years later, there was a fear that if the proposal for the St. James's Hospital site was overly complex it might fail to get planning permission.  That rang an alarm bell for me.  We needed to prove that we could build both hospitals on that site.</p> <p>  Moreover, it is a very busy site.  Obviously-----</p></speech>

From our point of view, they are the children with the greatest need.  Because of their fragility we felt the greatest commitment to advocating for them.  The number of children is small but the consequences of excluding them from this iconic trilocation are not.  I also refer to the exclusion of mothers.  We are very conscious of the fact that mothers now need access to adult sub-specialty services because of increasing risk, co-morbidities and body mass indices, BMIs.  This is needed for mothers and particularly for babies.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach asked for an application for a co-build in 2014.  That did not happen.  We can revisit the history and note that deadlines were missed and calculations were erroneous.  Starting from this point however, I would love for the committee to make a recommendation in its meeting with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  The board's PowerPoint presentations to this committee mentioned wider community spin-offs, such as raising educational aspirations in the community, benefit to businesses in the community and employment and training opportunities.  However there was not one mention of the Coombe or of babies, and we are down the road from that hospital.  To me, that symbolised the way babies and maternity hospitals were excluded from the process. As a maternity hospital, we do not have the same political clout and influence as the bigger hospitals.  I think that is the case for all maternity hospitals.  However, at the present time there is a willingness to make this work. </p></speech>

We all agree with it.  We have gone around in circles about this hospital for the guts of 20 years.  There was controversy about the Mater Hospital, we looked at a site in Crumlin and then we came to St. James's Hospital.  Many are still of the opinion that it should not be on any of those sites, but in a new greenfield site or outside Connolly Hospital.  Building on a greenfield site would avoid all the problems that we have in fitting into the St. James's Hospital site.  It would be a lot cheaper to build on a new site than to go in with bulldozers and starting on a brownfield site.</p> <p>  Is it bad planning?  The Taoiseach said in 2014 that we should have trilocation.  That should be our ambition; to have a general hospital, a children's hospital and a maternity hospital together, a corridor away from one another.  One could open a door and go from one to the other instead of trying to transport patients across Dublin in an emergency, or in my constituents' case, all the way from Waterford or Kilkenny.  What Professor Fitzpatrick is saying makes sense.  He has covered this already, but why are we only now talking about the third part of the trilocation project?  Why was a maternity hospital not part of the recent planning for the national children's hospital?</p> <p>  I refer to the overspend.  We do not have the remit to make the recommendations Professor Fitzpatrick seeks.  This is the Committee of Public Accounts.  We follow the money when it is spent and make sure it is spent correctly.  We cannot recommend how money is spent.  That is not our remit.</p><p>We cannot tell the Government what to do, what decisions to make on policies or how to spend money.  It is our job to ensure money is spent to the taxpayers' benefit and value for money is achieved.  </p><p> On the site, is it large enough to facilitate the three hospitals and all of the associated facilities such as parking?  I am aware of the rail connection, but last week I read an article in one of the newspapers regarding the problems experienced by a man from rural Ireland trying to get into St. James's Hospital.  People are experiencing problems accessing the St. James's site even before the children's hospital has been built there or consideration given to the location of the maternity hospital there.  When all of that work is completed there will be even bigger problems in this area in terms of traffic congestion and parking.  The ambition is positive but is it possible to have all three facilities at this location?  There are many professionals in this country.  Why was the survey not undertaken before the JCBs were allowed on site?  The cost of the national children's hospital has increased from &euro;600 million to &euro;1.7 million and may increase further.  Is this another case of bad planning?  Was there no proper analysis of the site in its totality?  It is frustrating and annoying to hear that there may not be room for the maternity hospital on this site.  Is the lack of available space for a maternity hospital at this location going to be talked about for the next three years?</p></speech>

It needs to be stress tested.  We are where we are on this issue.  PwC did not refer back to the original decision.  I would go back to the original decision, namely, the submission of St. James's Hospital to build a hospital at a cost of &euro;297 million plus, to have a massive maternity hospital space there and to have site clearance in six months.  That was the foundation document for the acquisition of the national children's hospital.  The due diligence on how that was examined leads-----</p></speech>

Pragmatically, it is just too late to stop it now.  I do not think there is a political will to do it or a will among the public to do it.  The other issue is there is no ideal site.  A greenfield site sounds fantastic but to make that into the type of location on which one wants to locate the national children's hospital, a maternity hospital that is delivering the highest risk babies in the State and adult services of the magnitude of St. James's Hospital, the Mater hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital-----</p></speech>

Medically, it would not work.  Space-wise, co-location-wise in terms of how to do it and access-wise, it works.  That is the issue.  What weighted the decision strongly in relation to St. James's Hospital is the fact that it is the largest adult hospital in the State and that cannot be undermined.  It is also the largest academic hospital in the State and that cannot be undermined.  In terms of what I would do, I would turn it on its head.  The decision is made.  We are now well into the project and massive excavation has been carried out.  The site should be stress tested now to ensure a maternity hospital can be co-located on it.  The money that this will cost is small fry given all the money that has been wasted.  We need to be absolutely certain that a maternity hospital can be provided on the site and then do it as quickly as possible.  There would be issues in terms of access and parking but the bottom line is the medicine and care that would be provided would be at the level that we aspire to.  It is a compromise.  If  the choice is access and double parking versus having the best people in the best place providing the best service I would put up with double parking.  That is not, I suppose, ideal, but this in the end is a compromise.  We have started it and I think it is too late to stop.  I want to make absolutely certain that a maternity hospital is provided.  I am looking at flexible ways this could be done in terms of space, cost and delivery.  If the remit of the committee is to ensure that money is spent appropriately, expenditure should not continue on this site with the expectation that it is going to deliver a maternity hospital if it cannot be proven that it will.  That work needs to start now otherwise value for money will not be achieved and a fortune will be wasted on this project only to find out that it has not delivered what it set out to deliver.  </p> <p>  I share the committee's concerns.  I have been neutral on the location of this hospital and I have advocated that it should go to Connolly Hospital when there were issues with space and access.  We are where we are and we need to deliver this hospital.  We need to bring people together to solve the problems that exist and accelerate the solution.  In the end, if the maternity hospital, the children's hospital, the adult hospital, the training, the teaching, the education and the innovation are there, all of which one wants in a brilliant health care centre, that could be the best thing in the world.  There may be a payoff in terms of access and parking but those issues could be sorted out in time.  Cities evolve and space around hospitals evolves.  Transport will evolve in terms of what is happening at the present time.  </p> <p>  I appeal to the committee to somehow put babies back in the frame in relation to this.</p></speech>

The initial expressions of interest in the children's hospital in 2006 favoured its location on an adult hospital site.  Shortly after, due to representation by the children's hospitals and by the maternity hospitals, that was opened to include the provision of a maternity hospital.  In regard to the Mater project, it was a tri-location of the Mater hospital, the children's hospital and the Rotunda Hospital.  In regard to the St. James's Hospital project, it was the Coombe, St. James's Hospital and the children's hospital.  Every adult hospital that pitched to have the children's hospital on its site emphasised the importance of having a maternity hospital there.  The St. James's Hospital pitch for it included space for a maternity hospital with a footprint that would deliver a hospital of 42,000 sq. m., which was significant.  It was an important issue.  The reason it was not included in the planning permission at that time was, perhaps, cost and a little bit of fear in relation to making it too complex.  The Coombe does not have the same punching power as the adult hospitals.  It is their site and the Coombe is moving on-site and so we do not have control over what is happening.  Unfortunately, despite our very good relationship with St. James's Hospital I think we were sidelined in relation to it and sidelined also by politicians.  The problem with this project is that there are so many recriminations in relation to it.  The past is the past and we need to learn from the experience.  We need to bring people together to sort this out.</p></speech>

It is in private ownership.  I believe it is earmarked for housing development.  It was a wonderful site that was available at the time.  However, because it was a distance from St. James's Hospital, we said it was not ideal, but in terms of Blanchardstown and St. James's hospitals, there was a choice and there were options.  The issue is that if it had been built there, the hospital would be built now because there was a very low planning risk with it and ease of access onto it.  At that time, the purchase of the land would have been very reasonable.  We could have had the paediatric hospital there and it would only have occupied 60% of the footprint, so there was a lot of room for other development on the site.  Our understanding was that the decision was changed at the last minute, and that is what was reported.  That was certainly the feedback we got  through the grapevine on it, but that is history.

They have their babies in the Coombe and then they are stabilised and transferred to Crumlin.  We are the closest hospital to Crumlin and we will be the closest hospital to the paediatric hospital in St. James's, and we are saying that distance is too long for those very fragile, critically ill babies.  There are other non-cardiac conditions - babies can have lung disorders etc. - that have the same requirement.  Those babies identified before delivery would come onto the site of a maternity hospital on that campus, be pre-identified, the mothers would have their babies there and then would be wheeled across a corridor to access all the services.  This is the model of care the members of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, when one meets them, including the medical director, are espousing.  They say that that is what they want.  Their brief is to build the children's hospital.  They will say, "Our brief is not to build a maternity hospital."  The members have seen what happened in respect of this project.  There was a children's group, a National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, HSE estates, the Department of Health, and many other people looking at this development and things falling in between them.  What we want is a person to take a decision to say this hospital goes onto this site.  It is a priority.  There are other hospitals that need to be moved.  There is the Rotunda and Limerick hospitals and there are elective hospitals to be built, but the paediatric hospital is the number one development and it will not deliver the goods and it will not save babies from these dangerous ambulance journeys.  In terms of the record, the transfers have been very good but babies do not arrive in the shape they should in circumstances like that.  I do not know what the Committee of Public Accounts can do in respect of that, but in terms of money alone, we could have built a hospital on the wrong site because we cannot put in a maternity hospital.</p></speech>

I refer to the particularly unfortunate circumstances.  There are babies born with conditions we have not diagnosed who are remote from Dublin and who have to be transferred to Dublin, and the outcome for those babies would be grave.  There are very considerable advantages to being born in Dublin because the distances are short.  We have a wonderful neonatal transport team with experts who will stabilise babies and transfer.  In terms of bad outcomes during the transfer, they are few or rare.  In terms of what happens, the baby goes into the ambulance in one condition and comes out in a different condition.  It is not the ideal form of transport.  There will be babies born in the Rotunda Hospital who will require transfer to the national maternity hospital, but with increased availability of prenatal scans, we will be looking to minimise the chance of a baby that has a serious abnormality being born in the wrong place.  These are not universally diagnosed conditions but it is to maximise the outcome for these babies.</p><p>There are very premature babies that we know about because we expect them to be born and they need concentration in intensive care units because they are high risk, having gut surgery, for example.  Centralising the services for critically ill babies into one unit will maximise outcomes.</p></speech>

Cancer services are only one part of its specialist services.  Our concern is that because it has so many other sub-specialties that it wants to advance, and it is an academic hospital, space for such a hospital is a priority.  Since we are not a co-build and we are not looking for planning permission, there is a real financial risk that, in five years' time, the space will be gone and what was built, with nearly &euro;2 billion spent, was the wrong hospital on the wrong site because it was not a tri-located hospital.  The only positive thing that will emerge out of the current crisis is that people need to think and ascertain if a maternity hospital can be put there, which I think can be done, and then to make it happen.  If that was the outcome of this costing crisis and the issue of maternity co-location coming in, it would be the silver lining that we have needed for this big cloud.  This hospital should have a "wow" factor about it and we should be really proud of it.  How it is portrayed in the media, how people look at it, and the recriminations with regard to how it went completely out of control, need to be reined back in.  I have been very critical of it but I am coming here in a spirit of compromise to say that I will be happy to work with the development board in any way to try to make this happen.</p></speech>

I would be fully supportive of that.  With regard to medical politics, hospitals are in competition with each other, but I think the maternity hospitals are mutually supportive.  I would want to see that happen.  The conditions at the National Maternity Hospital required it to be relocated.  We see what money has been squandered.  I do not think that is somehow undermining the fact that a second maternity hospital is needed.  There is not a week in which the maternity hospitals are not in the High Court or the news.  That is somewhat due to a legacy of underinvestment in them.  I fully support Holles Street's development.  It is at quite a distance from the national children's hospital.  We are the closest hospital.  It is supposed to be a Government priority.  I think it needs to be done.  There are other hospitals, including the Rotunda and Limerick, but prioritisation needs to be given and work needs to commence.  The top priority project for this State is to build the children's hospital.  The project could become a legacy of failure and disappointment if it does not deliver what it set out to deliver.  I emphasise that what happens elsewhere does not concern me.  What happens with regard to this does.</p></speech>

The problem is that all three have been operating above capacity for a long time.  Not only are they maternity hospitals, they are neonatal centres and gynaecology hospitals.  Where the three need to be has already been decided.  One is to be in St. Vincent's.  That was the neatest fit because of the fact that St. Vincent's was never going to have the paediatric hospital.  When the Mater was the designated site for the children's hospital, the Rotunda was to move to the Mater.  Since the site changed, the Rotunda is now instead to move to Connolly hospital.  Three hospitals are needed in Dublin.  I do not think we could ever get to the stage where we could rationalise them down to two.  We support what is happening in the other two hospitals.  The critical thing is that the big project is the children's hospital.  One cannot build a hospital that does not deliver what one sets out to deliver, especially if one spends more money on it than on any hospital in the world.  This will be a spectacular example of failure if a maternity hospital is not put there.  It is time now to get that work done.  The financial piece has been done but this is equally important and feeds into the finances too.  The money that this will cost is insignificant in the context of what has been wasted to date on it.</p></speech>

In international terms, the statistics from the maternity services in Dublin and elsewhere in Ireland are exceptionally good, although there are obviously cases where adverse circumstances happened that, looking back, could have been avoided.  One of the things we have been very concerned about over a long period of time is the resourcing of the maternity hospitals.  I cannot remember how many reports came out when I was master of the hospital which made recommendations for co-location, recommendations in terms of staff, recommendations in terms of infrastructure, etc., but very few of them were delivered.  We have a women and infants healthcare programme, which is still cash strapped.  We have the lowest number of obstetricians in the OECD.  These are issues that need to be addressed, but I think front-loading the maternity services with money improves outcome, improves quality of care and reduces adverse outcomes, and in reducing adverse outcomes, it reduces medical legal claims.  In terms of escalating medical legal claims, the way around that is to front-load investment into the service, and that, in a sense, would minimise risk.  The answer is "Yes" in terms of the development of new hospitals and new models of care and improving staffing levels and attracting people back from abroad who have gone away to train because they are looking at our maternity hospitals and are saying that they will not come back from Toronto or Sydney because they are working in state-of-the-art, tri-located centres.  Why would they come back?  </p> <p>  There may be difficulties recruiting people to work in the children's hospital, because they have seen a hospital mired in controversy.  To get the best and the brightest to come back to this country to work in our maternity and paediatric services, we need to deliver to them what they require in terms of infrastructure.  That is for the mothers and babies, not for the staff.</p></speech>

We have been dealing with the State Claims Agency and there is about &euro;2 billion in cases there relating to medical negligence, the vast majority of which relate to obstetrics.  In view of this conversation, we will send the transcript to the State Claims Agency and see if it can respond.  We have asked it for a breakdown of that on a hospital-by-hospital basis, but it is reluctant to do that because it might give a hospital a bad name if it is hit by five or six serious claims worth &euro;50 million.  In terms of reducing claims and providing a better service, there is information in the system that people do not want released for other purposes, but that would be a valuable source of information to help people make important decisions in this regard.  Ultimately, prevention of some of these serious incidents is the best outcome for everyone, with no legal and medical bills coming five or six years down the road.</p></speech>

It is very active in the relationship with the hospital on risk minimisation and improving quality of care.  We get a lot of feedback from the State Claims Agency in relation to our services and dealing with risk as well.  It would be very proactive in that regard.</p></speech>

It makes sense to do it this way.  If there is anything they would prefer to answer in private, we will go into private session.  I apologise but I will have to leave to speak for ten minutes at some stage during the session.  It will probably be during the private session.  Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan will, I believe, need to leave shortly afterwards.  Unfortunately, that is the nature of these sittings.  Quite a few members are missing.  I apologise for that, but our guests are very welcome.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and persons in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.  Members are requested to ensure that, for the duration of the meeting, their mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to aeroplane, safe or flight mode, depending on the device.  It is not sufficient for members just to put their phones on silent mode as this will maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p><p>I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Again, Ms Thompson and Mr. Brecknell are warmly welcome.</p></speech>

As I am sure members will be aware, the purpose of the commission is to represent the interests of victims and survivors of the Troubles.  Part of my legislative duty - and it is one of the best parts - is that I convene a forum of victims and survivors who help make sure that victims themselves are at the heart of legislation and policy in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.  This is the second time I have addressed this committee, and this meeting is timely both in the context of our policy advice and suggestions to the Government of Ireland regarding the consultation on dealing with the past, but also in the context of EU exit and on the ongoing implementation of the PEACE IV programme in Northern Ireland.  I would like to start by providing some brief commentary on these important developments, particularly regarding legacy-related matters.</p> <p>  Members of the committee will be very aware that the Good Friday Agreement made a commitment to remember and care for those who were harmed during the Troubles.</p><p>It is my belief that there has been a number of very substantial attempts over the years to address the harm that was done but that so far the legislation we need on both sides of the Border has failed to be agreed and failed to be passed to address the needs of victims and survivors.  The fact is, as we sit here today, that bereaved families who wish to access judicial processes, who come from every part of society, from across the United Kingdom, Ireland and beyond, are told they must wait decades, if at all, before they can get access to investigations, to justice, to information about the death of people they loved, and to acknowledgement of the harm they suffered.  That has a growing cost.  It has a cost to families and people in terms of their belief that the state they live in cares what happened to them, in terms of their faith in government and justice organisations, and in terms of the communities&rsquo; faith in justice organisations, particularly in Northern Ireland.</p><p> Judicial reviews and legal actions have also got a high financial cost and the irony is that &pound;30 million a year was spent for decades on dealing with legacy in ways that did not work and fighting judicial reviews and actions.  It is more expensive to do nothing and to continue as we are than it would be to introduce new mechanisms that would have a better chance of delivering for victims and survivors.  It is almost universally accepted that the current system in Northern Ireland and beyond is not equipped to address the situation.  It was not designed to do so, and the cost of this failure is evident at many levels.  For individuals, families and communities across these islands who are impacted there is still acute pain and loss and that is now accompanied by a strong sense that those who are empowered to address their issues have chosen to ignore them for decades.  That is why dealing with the legacy of the past cannot be achieved by measures which fail to fully address the many complex and difficult issues.</p><p> It is also very clear that in the context of high levels of disillusionment and low levels of trust which exist across different political constituencies in Northern Ireland and in Ireland that any approach must be balanced, it must be transparent, it must operate within the law and it must be victim centred.  People who have suffered harm have waited too long for effective organisations to address their needs.</p><p> In relation to legacy and the recent consultation, in May 2018 the UK Government published its consultation paper addressing the legacy of Northern Ireland's past.  It set out draft legislation for implementing the historical investigations unit, HIA, the oral history archive, OHA, the independent commission for information retrieval and the implementation and reconciliation group.  There were 18,000 responses to that consultation, and as we still await its outcome victims and survivors continue to be frustrated by the failure to deliver on those legacy mechanisms.  While recognising that these delays have a link to the current political impasse I would still strongly impress on all our political representatives the need to agree proposals to deal with the past.  People have waited too long.</p><p> I wish to reflect on some changes which I believe could make these proposals more victim centred and inclusive but, in spite of anything one might say about the current proposals that they can be improved and should be improved, the need to find a new way forward is unarguable.  There is really no good case for continuing to deal with these matters in the way they are currently dealt with.  In January 2019 I offered this advice to the UK Government and it set out the commission's views on the basis of extensive consultation on the four proposals.</p><p> For the first time my policy advice paper also provides comments for consideration by the Irish Government on how to ensure that the needs of victims and survivors are met in the Republic of Ireland.  When talking to people affected by the conflict across the United Kingdom and Ireland it is clear that their experience and needs are very much the same.  I believe these need should be addressed in an inclusive way and that choices and options which are open to those who live in Northern Ireland should also be open to those who live elsewhere.  That is why, for the first time, I have shared my advice and made proposals to the Government of Ireland.</p><p> The recommendations in my policy advice have been made after extensive engagement with the victims and survivors forum, with individual victims and survivors, strategic partners, elected representatives, policy makers and organisations funded to deliver services as well as wider civic society.  That has taken place across the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.  The advice I am giving to both Governments also is guided by five key principles agreed by the victims and survivors forum.  The first is co-design and collaboration.  If one is going to do something to address the needs of people who have been harmed, one must do it in a spirit of co-design with those people.  For example, I have recommended that a victims and survivors steering group be part of mechanisms to investigate.  I give information to families and in every part of these proposals I have suggested greater engagement of victims and survivors in the design.  They must be victim centred and victim led.  That means the needs, interest, views and wishes of individual victims and survivors takes priority.  For example, in relation to each of these institutions I have talked about the need for advocacy and support to enable people to make the choices that are right for them and to enable them to be supported and to be advocated for.</p><p> The third principle I look for is inclusivity.  Many people have been excluded from the scope of these proposals and that includes people who lost people they loved outside of Northern Ireland, in the Republic of Ireland, across the UK and elsewhere.  There is a sense of isolation and inequality felt by those victims who often experience a low level of access to support, and a lower access to justice in some cases than those elsewhere.</p><p> It is absolutely critical that whatever we do is done in a way which is independent and impartial.  Trust is paramount and it is at a very low level for victims and survivors for very understandable reasons.  That is true across the UK and for those people to whom I have spoken in the Republic of Ireland.  For example, on the part of both Governments, there are concerns that some matters may be redacted on the basis of national security.  In addition, for both Governments there is a real need to make sure that any institutions therefore are as transparent as they can be, robust in terms of having appeal mechanisms against redaction and that families are given the absolute maximum explanation and access to information and can see that that is happening.  That matters wherever people live and wherever the bereavement took place.  All mechanisms must be fit for purpose so, for example, timeframes and funding have to be realistic.  There is no point doing things and then not funding them properly.  We have had decades of experience of that.  It creates disillusionment and distrust.</p><p> In relation to more general issues in addressing legacy, in the Northern Ireland Office, NIO, consultation the Secretary of State has clearly detailed that, first and foremost, they must meet the needs of victims and survivors.  They must seek to promote reconciliation and they must reflect broad political consensus.  I welcome those broad principles.  However, while I am of the view that these proposals currently are the best opportunity we have, there are significant changes that need to be made to address the principles I have outlined.  The purpose of historical investigations should not be defined narrowly in terms of the numbers of prosecutions.  That is not primarily what the investigations need to deliver.  What matters to people is evident from previous and ongoing investigations, that is, that new information and evidence can be uncovered and that families who want answers can be better served than they have been, even if the evidence is likely in many cases to be insufficient to secure a conviction.  The critical issues for many families and communities as well are access to information about the circumstances leading to the death of people they loved and acknowledgement of the harm that has been done to them.  I have sought in my advice to draw out what the implications of that should be and what the focus on family should look like for the objectives, the structure, the staffing and the processes of historical investigations.</p><p>This is not a normal investigation.  It is not just about getting convictions and it is worth doing even if convictions are going to be very few and far between.</p><p> It is often pointed out that different people have different wishes and needs and therefore it is right that the proposed package of measures offers choices and options to individuals and families but, however, these choices and options must be accompanied by support and information so people can make the decisions that are right for them.  That would mean the people who want information can be given the best opportunity they have, but at the same time those who do not want information, of whom there are many, and there are some in every family, are not routinely delivered with packages of information they do not want.  It is important that there is an intelligent and informed way of communicating with families.  Advocacy services are critical for people when they engage with legacy institutions.  My recommendations seek to ensure that all of the institutions build in links to what currently exists in the way of advocacy and enhancement of that to meet new demands.</p><p> There are 47 recommendations and I do not propose to go right through them, but there are some broad areas with specific reference to the Government of Ireland.   In the case of historical investigations, I have requested that the Irish Government establish a mechanism whereby Troubles-related deaths which happened in the Republic are investigated.  I know the scope of the current proposal relates only to deaths that occur in Northern Ireland, but I have talked to people who lost loved ones within this country and they feel just the same.  There should never be a two-tier approach.  One cannot have a hierarchy based on location in terms of how people access truth and justice.  It is my strong submission that there needs to be a new mechanism here as well to investigate outstanding Troubles-related deaths.</p><p> I have also heard from bereaved families in Ireland and across the UK whose access to both civil and criminal justice processes is dependent on the close collaboration between justice organisations in different jurisdictions.  I welcome the development of legislation by the Irish Government to facilitate exchange of information for legacy inquests.  I believe that new organisations will need to work very effectively and share information across jurisdictions if they are going to build trust and to deliver what can be delivered to victims and survivors.</p><p> For both Governments there are issues regarding information considered as sensitive regarding national security.  There is also a need for both Governments to establish fully transparent and accountable processes for determining what information can be withheld or should be withheld on those grounds.  Victims and survivors across the UK and Ireland, for very understandable reasons, feel that both Governments could use redaction on the grounds of national security as a cloak behind which to hide unpalatable facts.  Whether that perception is accurate or not, it is entirely understandable if there is not as transparent a process as is achievable.</p><p> On the independent commission for information retrieval, which is based on the treaty between the UK and Irish Governments and is accessible to people across both jurisdictions, I have recommended that they should have a victims and survivors steering group in the same way as I have recommended the historical investigations process.  It is just as important that there is an intelligent, informed approach based on consultation with victims and survivors about how this institution engages with families, how it seeks to inform its deliverables on the basis of what families want.  It is very important that in deciding what questions should be asked, information retrieval is led by the wishes of victims and survivors.  Anything given through an information retrieval process can be structured in individual cases around the questions families have to ask, so engaging with families in an inclusive way and basing the work of the institution on families&rsquo; wishes is the best way for it to deliver what it can deliver.</p><p> I have also recommended that there would be a proactive outreach strategy because to be inclusive, people have to know one exists.  If information retrieval is something that many people do not know exists, then they cannot use it, so inclusivity means outreach and communication.  I have recommended that an appeals process similar to that of the historical investigations unit should be put in place if there is any decision to redact information on national security grounds.</p><p> I recognise that the danger of information leaking between information retrieval and investigations is a real danger which must be removed.  At the same time, the obvious answer of sequencing one then the other is not necessarily a very victim-friendly answer.  There will be people and families who may already feel they have got as much as they can get from an investigative process and they may want to move forward into information retrieval.  Telling them they have another decade to wait may be time that they do not have.  It is important that in seeking to solve those design problems, there is extensive consultation with victims and survivors and perhaps even consideration of giving some ability to families to choose the route they go down when time is short.</p><p> Another key issue to be addressed, in particular in relation to information retrieval, is the impact of incomplete or incorrect information.  I have met and talked to people who have been given information which has then turned out not to be correct, which is worse than being given nothing.</p><p> The oral history archive is an incredibly important proposal for something which can capture narratives and grow understanding in a way that can help build reconciliation as well as giving people the right to have their experiences acknowledged, heard and recorded.  It is important that it is done in an inclusive way.  I reiterate a point I have made previously, namely, that it cannot be something that sits in a building somewhere.  It must be based on outreach.  It cannot be inclusive unless it is communicated properly and contributed to in a bottom-up way by different communities.  It is also important that nobody thinks they are excluded from it by having signed the Official Secrets Act, for example.  Those things need to be dealt with to do that in an inclusive way.  This is about growing reconciliation so something that captures narratives in a way that grows understanding is incredibly important to that.</p><p> The legislative proposals on the implementation and reconciliation group are incredibly thin and yet the basic idea of it, what is at the heart of the mechanism, is probably the most important of all.  If it is to be about acknowledgement and capturing what comes out of the other processes in a way that helps people move on, then it must be independent of political interference.  The way it is proposed at the moment, which is almost a kind of d'Hondt process where people can get elected onto it at the proposal of a political party and withdrawn by a political party without any reason given will not grow its ability to deliver a composite independent narrative based on the information coming into it.  For it to achieve its purpose, it is important that there are clear criteria for the nomination of an individual to that group, and that there would be an equally clear basis on which someone can be removed from it, and that its purpose in terms of giving acknowledgement to those who suffered needs to be more strongly built into the way it is put together.  That can be on an individual or much more societal level.</p><p> There are other issues to consider, which in the interests of time I will not go into in detail.  In relation to accessing services here in Ireland and in other parts of the UK and Great Britain, outside Northern Ireland, it is welcome that we have funding under PEACE IV, which is now starting to deliver health and well-being services to people who have not had it before, but if we are going to properly deal with people's needs and if we are going to do that in the context of properly dealing with difficult issues in the past then there is going to be a growing need, for a while, for advocacy, support, health and well-being and mental health services.</p><p> In relation to mental health in particular, the growth of the regional trauma network is incredibly important.  It is something that has been very slow because of the difficulty of getting policy progressed and funding in the current absence of the assembly in Northern Ireland.  However, it is beginning to be developed and it will be operational within the next year and it is needed as much in Ireland as it is in Northern Ireland, in particular in relation to the current proposals.</p><p>I strongly suggest that the committee look at how health in the North and in Ireland can work together on this critically important area of mental health and trauma that is related to the Troubles.  Given the scale and complexity of the mental health legacy of the Troubles, it is very important that people have access to high-quality services and mental health services which are nuanced to an understanding of Troubles related trauma.</p><p> Above all, it is important to remember that the aim of addressing legacy must be to build a better future.  At a civic and a political level there continues to be a war of words about the harm inflicted on different individuals and different communities during the Troubles.  This in itself is often to the detriment of those who suffered.  My recommendations, therefore, seek to ensure that the combined impact of this package is to offer what is achievable in terms of truth, justice, acknowledgement and reparation to people who were harmed and to do this in a way that is victim centred, respectful and inclusive of all those who suffered.  The proposed mechanisms are designed to address the outstanding impact of the conflict on the people, communities and institutions of Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK and in Ireland.  It is a difficult process which is uncomfortable for all, but it needs to be uncomfortable for all to deliver the outcomes which have been sought.  Without these difficult conversations, the Civil Service in Northern Ireland will continue to be anchored to a trauma and division which the Troubles wrought.  Twenty-one years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the broad shape of these measures seems to me to be what we have come back to time and, again and it is the best chance we have of dealing with the outstanding, unfinished business.  Although these proposals can be improved and require some changes, they are still a basis on which we can improve the well-being of victims and survivors and build a better and more reconciled society for all.</p><p> I thank members for their time.  I am very happy to take questions.</p></speech>

The Chairman has to leave before I do.  Listening to Ms Thompson and reading the policy paper, my immediate reaction is, &ldquo;If only she were the Minister for justice for Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic.&rdquo;  What she says is just so practical and common sense and it is what we hear from the victims, or in my case Justice for the Forgotten.  I chair that group, as the Chairman did before me.  What Ms Thompson says is just so true to their story, their experience and what they have been looking for.  Twenty-one years since the Good Friday Agreement, they are waiting 45 years now, or 46 this year.  It is incredible.</p> <p>  Reading through the policy paper, one thing that really struck me was the statement that in the policy sphere &ldquo;it is paramount that information is not seen to be withheld by any government or institution&rdquo;.  We know the blocks from the British Government on that information, even refusing to hand it to an independent international judicial figure.  The paper also refers to an entitlement to justice &ldquo;regardless of where a death happened&rdquo;.  There is a feeling that the Troubles related deaths that occurred in the Republic are not seen to be as important or to have the same parity as those that occurred in Northern Ireland.  The paper also states: &ldquo;It is imperative that both the UK and Irish governments provide the necessary resources to allow all conflict related deaths to be fully investigated.&rdquo;  This is what the families and the victims have been looking for.  We have had questions here with our Ministers and meetings on a historical investigations unit, HIU, in the Republic and they always say no, that it is not part of the agreement.  Will the witnesses &ndash; whoever wants to answer the question &ndash; see this happening in order that there is that parity?</p> <p>  Regarding amnesties, we know there are different views as to whether we should draw a line under everything and go for information retrieval and not look for anything else.  How should these two be balanced?  A lot of costs will be involved in much of what Ms Thompson says.  Is she confident that these costs can be met?  The witnesses have had discussions with our Government.  Will they tell us how confident they are that the Government is taking seriously their recommendations and, equally, those of other authorities?</p></speech>

I would like to talk about amnesty and the statute of limitations and a little about costs as well.  I guess we have both had conversations with Ireland&rsquo;s Government, so perhaps we can both talk about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.673" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Bracknell" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019041100002#E00400"><p>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan knows my feelings on whether there should be a HIU or some sort of HIU-type process south of the Border.  I attend the same meetings to which she has referred.  Whenever we in the victims&rsquo; forum have had discussions on dealing with the past, the point we have all made is that everyone should be treated equally.  It does not matter where the harm happened or who inflicted it.  Equal treatment is what is most important.  As the proposals stand, people who were bereaved or injured south of the Border and people who were bereaved or injured in Britain do not avail of a similar package in respect of investigations.  That is the information that has to be addressed which we in the Victims and Survivors Forum passed on up to Ms Thompson.  It is good to see it in her proposals here.  The point is that if this is not done, it creates a hierarchy of victims.  Our ask today is that this committee exercise whatever influence it can on the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of the Taoiseach and tell them they have to put in place something south of the Border that is on a parallel with the HIU in the North.  We recently met the Garda Commissioner and his point basically was that this is Government policy.  The only people who can change that are in the Government.  Therefore, whatever can be done from within this committee and whatever other committees there are is important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.674" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Judith Thompson" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019041100002#E00500"><p>Regarding the issue of an amnesty, it does not matter whether I talk to people in Ireland, the United Kingdom or other parts of Great Britain, I do not for the most part meet victims and survivors who want there to be an amnesty.  I meet many people who say prosecutions are not that important to them, but that is different from saying there should be no attempt to uncover the truth of what happened.  It does not matter whether one talks to soldiers&rsquo; families &ndash; soldiers were often killed &ndash; or to people who died at the hands of the army.  None of these people wants to be told that the way to draw a line under this is to bury it.  That is what they have been told already and it just feels like a lack of acknowledgement that what happened mattered.  The point is that to move on, to draw that line, information needs to be given to those who want it and there must be an acknowledgement at a much more civic level of the wrong and the harm that was done.  That is how one draws a line and moves on.  One does not do so by suppressing investigation.  I think everyone in this room is very familiar with the arguments about the legality of an amnesty.  It is very clear.  It can be legal if it is universal for all parties to the conflict and is accompanied by an information retrieval process.  That is not the conversation I hear happening.  What I hear is a conversation about whether this person or that person should not be pursued or held accountable.  I am afraid that uncomfortable accountability is part of this process.  It is not about pillorying individuals who are elderly now, no matter who they are, but it is about saying harm happened and that people who were harmed and who want information are entitled to it, regardless of what happens to the person who caused that harm.  At the end of the day, under the law, there should be a fair, impartial, competent investigation into somebody&rsquo;s death.  That is all people are looking for.</p> <p>  The terms of the Good Friday Agreement, as people in this room are very aware, still apply.  They apply to everyone, including soldiers.  No one will do more than two years in prison, even if they were convicted, and the likelihood of anyone being convicted is pretty low.</p><p>What is important is access to information and an acknowledgement.  Talking about amnesties is a distraction in providing it and in moving on.  It is not lawful to provide for amnesties in the way in which it is often proposed to provide for them and I do not believe it would meet the needs of victims and survivors or society more generally in dealing with the past in a way that would allow people to draw a line and move on.  That is my take on the question of amnesties.</p><p> On costs, yes, this would be expensive, but I ask the committee to consider adding up what it is now costing to do nothing.  We are not doing anything.  Certainly, in the United Kingdom there are repeated legal actions and mounting costs arising from judicial reviews.  We finally have funding to properly equip coroners&rsquo; courts to deal with a backlog of 50 cases.  We also have a legacy investigation branch within the Police Service of Northern Ireland which is neither equipped nor constructed in a way which enables it to have the confidence of the public and the courts in doing its job, but it is still costing money to run it.  In 2013 the criminal justice inspectorate produced a report in which it added up what it thought was the cost of dealing with the past in Northern Ireland.  It stated the figure was &pound;30 million a year.  I think those costs have gone up, not down, and we have been spending this money for decades, but it should not be about money.  However, if we are going to talk about it, I ask the committee to consider adding up the cost of what we are now doing and set it against how the money could be spent better.  I argue that we need to do different things to deal with the past in terms of justice, as well as spending more on mental health, advocacy and support services for victims and survivors.  The long-term results would be much better for people, families, victims and survivors and, naturally, communities and civic society also.</p><p> Regarding conversations with the Government, we are delighted to be here.  In the consultation we were certainly helpfully assisted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We also worked with Justice for the Forgotten in contacting people, as well as with Austin Stack and others connected with him to get people together, but the proof of the pudding will be in what is implemented.  I know that there is ongoing work on legislation to enable information to be passed between jurisdictions on civil matters, but more is needed.  As Mr. Bracknell described, there is a need for a counterpart to this investigative unit working here.  I have had the same conversation with families in Birmingham.  There is a need for something to happen in parts of the United Kingdom also.  People who have been left wanting for decades do not expect the system that has failed to deliver to date to do better for them next time and why should they?</p></speech>

It is on days like today that my belief in politics is restored.  The first thing I want to say is that this report should be delivered to each and every one of the victims and survivors.  Sometimes I think, although this is a live broadcast, we are talking to ourselves.  If the report was delivered to the victims and survivors, it would certainly give me some faith that some progress had been made.  The old adage that justice delayed is justice denied is so true.  I have said at a number of committee meetings that if one were not told who was making the presentation and from which side of the divide someone was from, one would not know because the problems were the same.  We are dealing with legacy issues, whether it be the Kingsmill massacre; the Miami Showband; individuals such as Terence McKeever; the Ludlow family; or the disappeared, including Captain Robert Nairac or, as I have mentioned before at meetings of the committee, Eugene Simons and Gerard Evans, of whose disappearance very close to where I live I am intimately aware.  Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan and others can speak about the Dundalk, Monaghan and Dublin bombings.  The reality is, judging from my engagement with the people affected and many others who have come before the committee, they hear the talk but want us to walk the walk.  What the delegates have said very eloquently encapsulates an awful lot.  I think Ms Thompson said she speaks to the Governments.  We are being asked to put whatever pressure we can on the Department of Justice and Equality and other Departments, but I do not think it is a question of exerting pressure.  The document will help to clear the air and deal with the lack of faith in the systems, North and South, on I commend Ms Thompson.</p> <p>  I refer, in particular, to the issue raised by Ms Thompson of the legacy of the past in the context of justice and truth and specifically an amnesty, an issue which has been discussed in the past few minutes.  My experience which is not necessary the same as that of Ms Thompson is that people just want closure, regardless of whether it means looking for a court case and a conviction.  In the main, I have found that all people want is the truth.  Ms Thompson referred to mental health and the trauma suffered.  In the case of many of the incidents with which I have dealt, whether they involve individuals or larger numbers, it is beyond belief that people are still suffering.  We all grieve, but we do not do so when we do not know why somebody suffered.  I become slightly emotional when I talk about this issue.  Again, having lived on the Border and seen the trauma suffered on both sides, I do not care who the people are; they are entitled to a conclusion.</p> <p>  I suppose I am making statements more than asking questions, but Ms Thompson has issued a report which, as I said, needs to be properly circulated.  I was a member of a local authority for 25 years and have been a Member of the D&aacute;il for almost four.  We have received promises, but the day for promises from both sides is over.  How can we, collectively, get people to realise the legacy issues probably have the most impact in bringing about closure to what has gone on on this island for far too long?  The delegates are talking to us; we are talking to the Department and meeting people, yet there does not seem to be any joined-up thinking.  We can blame either side, but, ultimately, the administration, be it from a Southern, Northern or British perspective, needs to put its foot on the accelerator to bring about closure, be it for good or bad, for the families of the victims.  It cannot just be soundbites.  I meet people daily.  I have mentioned the Ludlow family others who say all we do here is talk.  It is action that we need.</p></speech>

If I walked past Mr. Bracknell outside and did not speak to him, I apologise.  I thank Ms Thompson for her opening remarks.</p><p>There is a lot in here.  The witnesses have spoken about meeting representatives of the Government and the Department of foreign affairs.  Have they met with the Taoiseach or Deputy Coveney?  If the policy is going to change it is people like that who are going to have to change it.  At what level have they met with people within the Government?  It is important that they are brought into the process.  I agree with Deputies Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan and Breathnach that there is a lot of common sense in what the witnesses have said.  We would appreciate that change in policy.  There are victims right across these islands and survivors.  While the Dublin-Monaghan bombings understandably get a lot of attention, there were bombings in Cavan as well and families bereaved and children who died as a result of that.  The pain of those families is the exact same as that of Jonathan Parry.  Anybody who has lost a loved one knows what it feels like to be a victim.  To that end is there any progress on the definition?  As to the recent revelations around some of what happened in the North and the impact on victims, could the witnesses talk about how people are feeling as a result of that?  It is interesting what they say about the Government using redaction on the grounds of national security.  We have long held that view.  I have been to coroners&rsquo; courts for inquests where it is clear that that is happening.  When we talk about the financial cost of inquests, they would not be as expensive if the British Government did not spend as much money trying to keep the truth from the families.  After more than 25 years we recently had the case of the Mallon family finally get to the inquest stage.  The coroner basically said that no evidence of collusion was found.  In his opening remarks he described the litany of attempts that were made to either destroy that evidence or to hide it.  So while no evidence was found understandably because it was all gotten rid of, there was a family who came through the inquest after decades of waiting only to feel probably worse than they did before they went into it.  So there is an awful lot of pain and hurt out there.  I recognise that.  We have all been through the conflict.   I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2013 as a result of it so there are a lot of damaged people out there.  I am glad that mental health featured so heavily in the report.  We have to look at the wider societal issues, the impact that we have, both on prescribed drugs, on suicide rates and all of that.  There is still an awful lot of hurt.  If it is not tackled and dealt with properly then that hurt will continue to be generational and that pain will be felt for years to come.  I thank the witnesses for coming and for giving us their time.</p></speech>

Dramatic events that happened within families have not been talked about for years then suddenly a grandparent dies and it all comes back to people and they have that opportunity to talk where they had not talked before.  We have to be very cognisant of what is actually happening there.  We often hear regarding the likes of mental health and the health budget for the North, that it has to be an line with health budgets within the other parts of the UK.  That takes away from the fact that we actually went through 25 to 30 years of conflict.  One can call it a conflict or the Troubles.  To me it does not matter what one calls it.  At the end of the day it was an abnormal way of living for 25 to 30 years.  Therefore, that has to have a knock-on effect.  We have to acknowledge that knock-on effect.  Whether that is putting money into the regional trauma network which I think is the best way of moving forward.  We have had discussions with the people who are doing that.  Sorry, when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I meant within the victims&rsquo; forum.  From that perspective that has to be dealt with.</p> <p>As regards getting the Governments involved, unfortunately Deputy Breathnach is right - a lot of people pay lip service to these issues.  That is not good enough because it is actually something that has impacted massively on people&rsquo;s lives, whether they live south of the Border or north of the Border or as I said earlier, whether they live in Great Britain. It is not about money.  It should not be about money.   If money needs to be found to build a nuclear power station it can be found.  If it needs to be found to fight a war somewhere it can be found.  For me personally that is not an issue.  What is important is that we actually start to deal with this.  It is 21 years on as everyone said yesterday from the Good Friday Agreement.  We do not have many opportunities left.  We have gone through numerous different consultations, Eames-Bradley and even before that.  There is nothing new in the Stormont House Agreement proposals that were not in Eames-Bradley.  We lost ten to 12 years there.  We have to do it now.  I do not want to make this personal, but my mother is 86 years of age.  Thank God she is in the fullness of her health but there are other people who are not.  We cannot allow this to drag on for another generation.  I do want my children having to deal with what I have dealt with.  I know I am personalising that but I am only personalising it to make that point that we should not allow this to move on to another generation.</p></speech>

That was so powerful from victims and families.  The testimony that they all gave.  It is great that it is coming to Dublin so people here can have a chance to see it.  To me it was the power of drama to tell a story in a way that reports do not tell.  So congratulations to them on their acting.</p></speech>

It is important to actually notice and realise that there are other ways of telling the story.  It does not have to be part of the criminal justice system.  To be honest I found that out by being involved in that process.  It was a nerve-wracking process from the start but the point about it is there are other ways of doing things.  We should not always look to the criminal justice system because in most jurisdictions the criminal justice system has not worked for people.  It has definitely not worked for people regarding the Troubles or the conflict.  So we do need to look at different ways of dealing with our past and getting a sense of empathy for each other which I think is sometimes lost and sometimes missing.</p></speech>

To pick up on on the points around transparency and national security, it is not that people are telling me they do not believe there is such a thing as information which could leave people&rsquo;s lives at risk or in danger.  It is that they need to trust that that is genuinely and only the grounds on which things have been held.  So the answers to that situation have to be about robust appeal and maximum transparency.  That is an issue for both the Government of Ireland and the Government of the UK.</p></speech>

I understand why that is difficult for some people and I do not think it is a perfect definition.  However, I do not know what a perfect definition would look like.  I do not think a conversation about who should be excluded from consideration of their pain is a healthy one to have as a way of dealing with the past.</p></speech>

Thank you so much.  The work that you are doing is phenomenal.  With this committee I went up to the Ballymurphy inquest.  I have to be honest, what I saw that day was one of the most moving experiences I have ever had.   When families were there in the court they were hearing testimonies and the emotion really impacted on all of the committee that were there that day.  It impacted us all so much.  Alan spoke about how a play can tell stories.  That for me told the reality of the story.  I actually believe that day I saw healing for the families.  That is what really moved me .  For the next generation, for the children of those families and the healing for them even though some of them were not even alive it has a meaning for their brothers and fathers.</p><p>It was so moving.  That is the reality of the situation for the families, for the victims and the survivors.  I totally agree with Michelle when she says everybody has been impacted in some way.  I would have travelled up during the conflict as a child going through Belfast up to Antrim.  To go from Dublin in the 1960s and 1970s and to see the British army there is scary for a child.  People had to live in that environment.  That is the reality of living in a war environment.  Everybody has to be impacted by that, never knowing what is going to happen next.  Is a bomb going to go off?  Is there going to be a shooting?  Nobody knew so one is living in that PTSD environment and the impact of that.  That does come down through the generations.  There is no doubt about it.  We know of the huge number of suicides.  It has to be a priority.  If only the reality was out there from both Governments that this should be a priority, this has to be a priority because it will break that intergenerational trauma.  It will save money.  It will save the health service money.  It will save the mental health services money if they could just look at this whole issue and how important it is.  The witnesses have given a fantastic presentation today.  It was very clear.  They do great work.  We want to do our best to support them.  We are constantly having these discussions.  Michelle might have asked but I am not sure what your reply was about when you met with the T&aacute;naiste.  What was the feedback?  Do you think that it might be a priority or what is your thinking on that?</p></speech>

I think I have a meeting in the diary for next week as well.  I believe there is a good understanding of the issues.  I believe there is a sense of it being very difficult to move on.   I need to be more reassured that both Governments see this as something which is not only important but urgent and doable.</p></speech>

Without wanting to come back in, separate to that I omitted to say that I thought it is appropriate when we are dealing with the issue of the victims and survivors that this committee in whatever capacity would publicly call on those who have not returned the bodies of the disappeared, namely, Seamus Ruddy, Joe Lynskey and Robert Nairac, to provide any information.  The Commission for the retrieval of the disappeared is doing its very best.    However, without people coming forward with that information the issue of people not having closure remains.  It is incumbent on us to publicise the need for people to do that.  The fact that Brendan made reference to the fact that people are ageing.  People out there have information and it should be provided before it is too late.</p></speech>

It is acknowledging that something happened to someone.  Unfortunately not everyone will get the inquest or that level of acknowledgement and that public level of acknowledgement.  That does not mean to say that there should not be mechanisms put in place by both Governments that attempt to get that level of acknowledgement.  That is where the investigative body has the opportunity of actually looking at it and saying that if a family wants to engage with that sort of process, it is there for them.  Everything that can be done will be done to ensure that whatever information is available can be given to the families.  There are obviously the other mechanisms there as well.  The oral history archive gives the opportunity for families to tell their story and to document in some way what actually happened to the individual - who the individual was.  That is what gets lost in an awful lot of this &ndash; you are just another figure, you are just another statistic.  Unfortunately we talk about the 3,700 deaths but we do not talk about who those individuals were at times.  What is important out of any of this process is that we remember who those individuals were.  It is not just the people who died in high-profile incidents or who can campaign and have the power to campaign.  Everyone should be remembered.  There are lots of lost victims so to speak - people who are sitting at home very quietly who have massive issues.  They are the people that we need to be reaching out to.  That is what this whole process, the Stormont House Agreement legislation, all of that should be about reaching out to those individuals who have not come forward to date, who have unanswered questions.  The only way that can be done is if both Governments are prepared to grab the bull by the horns and actually do something positive about it, as opposed to just paying lip-service, which seems to be where it is at at the minute.  We met with the NIO a number of weeks ago.  It is still collating its response to the consultation.  How long does this go on?  We need to see some sort of action, not just from the British Government but also from the Irish Government.</p></speech>

We do need action and new institutions on both sides of the Border to deal with this.  There is everything that people in this room described in terms of ongoing pain, the impact on this generation, the impact on the next.  There is a mental health issue that needs to be taken very seriously on both sides of the Border.  There are justice issues which are very connected to that which need to be dealt with on both sides of the Border.  I thank you for your time and support today.</p></speech>

As a committee we have met with various victims groups.  They are not all the same.  Many of the people we have met are different.  They are all still hurting.  There is a commonality regarding a lot of the people.  They certainly want answers.  Some do not want to tie in with victims&rsquo; groups.  Some want to just deal with their own loss.  They have all appreciated the fact that if someone actually goes out and listens to them and to their story, that is a really essential part of it.  I know that is part of the oral history that you are proposing.  The committee really appreciates the time you have given to meet us.  I apologise again for the delay in the meeting starting.  Certainly your proposals on your submission here today will be part of our submission on this whole area.  Please feel welcome to keep in touch with the committee.

I will not go through the strategy for the rental sector or why we propose to regulate this area of the tourism market and will instead speak directly to the amendments.  The substantive amendment is amendment No. 182.  This amendment proposes the insertion of a new section 3A into the Planning and Development Act 2000 and it consists of a number of important provisions.  I propose to briefly outline these provisions, along with the related consequential amendments in the group, and then explain their overall intended effect.</p><p>Subsection (1) of new section 3A provides that the short-term letting of a house in a rent pressure zone, RPZ, is a material change of use in the house, thereby requiring planning permission, unless otherwise specifically exempted from this requirement.  Subsection (2) provides me, as Minister, with specific regulation making powers that will enable planning authorities to require persons involved in short-term letting in RPZs to provide specified information to their local planning authority.  Subsection (3) is closely related to subsection (2) and provides that the contravention of a requirement of such regulations will be an offence, subject to a summary fine of up to &euro;5,000, which is a class A offence.  Subsection (4) is important as it clarifies that the new provisions, which are focused on short-term letting, as defined, will not affect short-term lettings outside rent pressure zones and long-term lettings within rent pressure zones.  Subsection (5), which is central in understanding the core framework principles underpinning these proposals, sets out the necessary definitions for both short-term letting and rent pressures zones.  In this regard, &quot;short-term letting&quot; means the letting of a house or part of a house for any period not exceeding 14 days, while &quot;rent pressures zones&quot; means any area designated by me, as Minister, as a rent pressure zone under section 24A or 24B of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 188 are all consequential and technical amendments relating to the substantive short-term letting provisions I have just outlined.</p><p>Amendment No. 188 is a technical amendment to the Long Title of the Bill inserting a reference to short-term letting and the planning code.  The other two amendments to section 1 of the Bill are also technical in nature.  Amendment No. 1 amends the collective citation for the Residential Tenancies Act to exclude these short-term letting provisions from that Act, while amendment No. 2 inserts a collective citation for the Planning and Development Acts to include these new provisions.</p><p>I can discuss in greater detail the reasons for making these changes.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that we need to ensure short-term lettings are regulated and do not have a disproportionate impact on rental stock which is diminishing year on year.  This is part of a response to that problem but obviously not the whole response.</p> <p>  There are many accidental landlords who are renting out what was their principal private residence, perhaps a small apartment, and renting another home.  Even for tax treatment purposes, which is a different issue, and one that my party has been raising on a regular basis, they are disproportionately affected.  Will these measures have an impact on those who use a property that is not their second home but their principal private residence for short-term letting?</p><p>I am someone who bought an apartment in 2007 and had to move out of it due to family circumstances.  I am now renting somewhere else that is bigger.  There are lots of families in a similar position who could not afford to buy elsewhere.  Does the Minister see these regulations having any impact on such families?</p></speech>

In a rent pressure zone, it could not be a short-term letting but would have to go to a traditional long-term letting.  Outside of rent pressure zones, it would not have a material impact on a change of circumstances.</p></speech>

I refer to somebody who only owns one property and is renting it, which is the case for many accidental landlords.  They may have had to move out because of family circumstances and are renting a larger house because they cannot buy.  All of us know many of these people.  They own one property which they are renting but it might be done on a short-term basis.  They would not be affected by this.</p></speech>

This committee has argued for some time for the need to have good quality regulations of the short-term letting sector, not only because of the housing crisis but also because it is the proper thing to do for the sector overall to protect guests, hosts and the wider rental market.</p> <p>  I will set out my understanding of the Minister's amendments so that he may correct me if I am wrong on anything.  It is very important that people, whether currently engaged in short-term letting or interested in the issue, are very clear about what the amendments do.  I also have three very specific questions. </p> <p>  It is good that the legislation makes it very clear that these regulations apply only within the rent pressure zones.  Notwithstanding my criticism of the rent pressure zones, many of us have received representations from those who have short-term letting properties in tourist areas outside the rent pressure zones who were unsure where they fell.  It is important to be clear that if we pass these new rules, they will apply only in the rent pressure zones.  For those people who are engaged in peer-to-peer home sharing, either a room or an entire property, but for less than 90 days, there is really no change.  They will not have to apply for planning permission and they will have to do little beyond what they are currently doing.  Those who engage in peer-to-peer home sharing for more than 90 days will have to apply for planning permission.  While it is not in the legislation it is in the note which the Minister provided to the committee.  It is worth putting on the record that they would then be subject to a planning application.  Those planning fees are in the order of a few hundred euro, depending on the size of the property.  If it is their principal private residence, they will not be liable for water charges as commercial businesses are, so there is minimal cost involved, with the exception of the initial planning permission, whereas those who operate short-term lettings from second properties will have to apply for planning permission, and will be subject to commercial water charges as well as the planning permission requirement.  That is my understanding and I ask the Minister to correct me if I am mistaken on anything.   </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.721" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019041100002#E00900"><p>I refer to amendment No. 188 which relates to 14 days.  Let us take the example of someone with a house in Dublin.  They live in the house but their job takes them out of the country for three months in the year, which would not be an unusual arrangement.  Currently, for those three months, that person short-term lets the property to one, two or three hosts for the three months.  It is not a property that is available to the private rental market or that could have long-term letting but it can be used for short-term letting for those three months.  My one fear about the 14 days is that whereas today that homeowner can rent out their property as a short-term let to one guest for three months continuously, when this new regime comes in they will have to apply for planning permission.  One would expect that they would get it because it is not a property that could enter the rental market but they would then be restricted to only allowing a guest to stay for a maximum of 14 nights.  They could let it out for more than 90 days but it could not be to the same person for more than 14 nights.  This was the issue which arose previously at the briefing.  Will the Minister clarify if that is the case?  If it is, we need to look at some way of amending that.  If I get planning permission to allow me to rent out my property on a short let basis for three or four months of the year when I am not there because I am working abroad, it should make no difference whether it is let out continuousy to the same person for that period or to different people.</p> <p>  My second question relates to the current rules for planning enforcement.  If someone is in breach of planning permission today, and I make a complaint to the local authority, the local authority investigates.  However, if the breach was committed seven years ago there is essentially a statute of limitations, it is past and no action can be taken.  Deputy Pat Casey and myself have asked about this previously.  If the legislation as proposed is passed, and I had been engaged in short-term letting for eight years, can I circumvent the new rules because of the seven year statute of limitations that currently exists?  Clearly, there will not be a large number of those because short-term letting has become much more prevalent in recent years, but it is a concern that people could circumvent the new rules if they could prove they were trading for more than seven years as short-term lets.</p> <p>  Finally, the Minister is linking the short-term letting regulations to the rent pressure zones.  However, many members of the committee believe this sector should be regulated anyway.  When the rent pressure zones expire, and a sunset clause is built into them, does that mean these regulations automatically fall?  If the Government of the day was of a mind to keep the regulations, it would have to amend the legislation at that stage.  Has any thought been given to that?  While the initial impetus for us discussing the short-term letting was the rental crisis, this sector needs to be regulated, just like the private rental sector or the commercial rental sector.  What is the Minister's view on what will happen in relation to the amendments he proposes today when the RPZs expire?    </p></speech>

On the example of someone whose employment might take them out of the country for three months, they will be able to do up to 90 days without there being any problem for them because that will be allowed for the principal private residence, or if they wish, they could get involved in executive letting.  That can be handier than having to manage people coming in every three days.  People hire people to manage that as well but it does not prohibit them from having one person continuously for the 90 days.  That will be okay.   We will not put an extra burden on them that they must move tenants in and out every 14 days.</p></speech>

When they apply for the planning permission, if they get it, because they are only making the property available four months in the year and the local authority decides that is fine and gives them planning permission, can they let it out continuously to the same host for more than 14 nights even when they have the planning permission?</p></speech>

If they were worried about not being successful and getting permission, that person would have to turn to an executive-letting scenario which would still allow for beyond the 90 days because it is an executive let and is not captured by the legislation.</p></speech>

There is not a 14 day block restriction.  They could let out to somebody for 15 or 20 nights.</p></speech>

Even though we are changing the planning law now, if someone has established use over a seven year period and can prove that, under our planning laws that is an established use, we cannot go after them for enforcement purposes.  We believe that will be a relatively small number in the scheme of things but it is something we cannot change because that seven year period is hardwired into our planning laws.  However it speaks to the Deputy's third point which has also been raised by Deputy Casey several times in relation to the effective regulation of this sector.  </p> <p>  I am responsible for the planning Acts and can restrict the use of people's properties for short-term letting to get those properties back into use in the traditional rental market.</p><p>Since this version of the shared economy is disrupting traditional activities in so many ways when it comes to letting, it needs to be regulated.  This is a matter for the tourism authorities because it is a tourism activity.  I would have liked to have addressed both aspects at the same time.  That has not been possible.  I am proceeding with what I can control, namely, the planning Acts.  This will be good and we will do some good work but the Deputy is absolutely correct that if rent pressure zones fall away at the end of 2021, the measure in question will fall away also so the then Government will have to choose either to extend the period of application of the zones, in which case the measure will be extended, or to extend the measure in a way that does not link it to rent pressure zones.  It is my desire that, by that point, we will have moved to regulate the short-term letting sector as an element of the tourism economy.  That is how I see this going.  That is where it needs to go and that is what has happened in other countries.</p></speech>

With regard to the exemption, the Minister's answer was very clear so I have just one query.  The seven-year statute of limitations applies from the date of the breach to the date of discovery.  Strictly speaking, the properties we are talking about are not in breach of anything.  Is the Minister absolutely sure that the seven-year exemption would apply if those concerned could prove they were trading?  Surely it is from the day of the introduction of the regulations and this legislation becoming law that they would be in breach if they did not have the planning permission.  In order to have absolutely clarity, has this been checked with the Attorney General?  If not, could it be checked before Report Stage or consideration in the Seanad, just so we will be 100% clear?</p></speech>

My initial understanding was that someone would need to be in breach of the law for seven years from the changing of the law before becoming exempt.  It was then clarified to me that, in regard to the planning laws, if one can prove an established use, even though the law has changed, it gets one off the hook.  I will clarify it in writing because it is an important point.</p></speech>

I said I felt short-term letting was having an impact on the rental market.  I acknowledge, having come from the tourism industry, that the industry itself needs a certain amount of short-term letting.  A holistic approach is needed.</p> <p>  I do not know how many times I have spoken about short-term lettings.  I have spoken about this during private session, including today.  I am not disputing that the planning regulations are required but I feel the process is cumbersome and will bog down the planners in the local authorities.  At the first private meeting, I would look for clarification on what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said, that is, that when one establishes use for seven years, there is nothing the local authority can do about it.  One can then continue to use the property in that way.</p> <p>  Trying to find the properties in question and identify whether they have been in use for seven years will consume local authority time.  That is why I always felt we needed the measure in question but the more important regulatory aspect concerns the short-term letting platform.  I understand it is not in the Minister's brief but, in the longer term, the only way we can regulate the short-term letting platform is through the regulation of the platforms rather than through regulating property owners letting out their properties.</p> <p>  I have a few more points.  We are now saying that anybody who applies for planning permission for short-term rental of a property in a rent pressure zone will not get permission.  I come from the tourism sector so I am addressing both sides.  Within Dublin, there is a need for a certain amount of short-term letting for the tourism sector, but not to the extent evident at the moment.  Who decides the percentage and why somebody should be allowed to engage in short-term letting through a platform?</p> <p>  Does the Minister acknowledge my point that this is cumbersome legislation and that enforcement is expensive?  Through the regulation of the platforms, we could have controlled this more easily and quickly.  We could simply have stated, in the regulation on short-term letting platforms, that one cannot put a property on the platform unless one has a licence from one's local authority stating one has planning permission.  This would be instead of going through the cumbersome process of trying to prove the existence of unauthorised development in the face of owners saying they have been engaged in short-term letting for seven years.  We will end up going backwards and forwards.  We will end up with legal arguments and clogging up the whole system.  I suggest regulating short-term letting and stipulating in a regulation that one cannot put a property on a platform unless one has a licence from one's local authority stating one is approved.  This would be in addition to the planning process, which would not be ignored.  It would be a lot easier than using up resources of local authorities across every county involved.  We will end up with appeals and in courts and just get bogged down.  We will not achieve the success we all want to achieve.</p> <p>  Many in my constituency and the tourism sector were worried.  I acknowledge that this measure applies only to the rent pressure zones.  We must acknowledge that, even within those zones, the tourism sector will require a percentage for short-term lettings.  I refer to the old tradition of bed and breakfast, B&amp;B.  We are dealing with the modern version of what used to be a B&amp;B years ago.  How will a planner in Dublin City Council decide a certain property is really needed for tourism and is not having an impact?  Who will get the good news and the bad news?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.734" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019041100002#F00600"><p>To make a high-level point, we have to try to regulate the sector.  It is important that we do.  I have always said that going at it through the planning Acts is not perfect but it is a good approach.  It is necessary even if one is talking about regulating the sector in addition.  I will come back to why it is necessary.</p> <p>  Let us be very clear that this change will not affect those outside rent pressure zones.  If someone is engaged in short-term letting in Kerry, they may continue to do so because it is not a rent pressure zone.  Holiday homes will not be covered, as I stated.  The holiday home element of the tourism industry will not be affected by these changes.</p> <p>  Regulations are needed and are coming.  They are needed for a host of reasons, not just in connection with the number of properties available to rent in a city such as Dublin.  We have recently seen issues associated with hidden cameras.  Hoteliers will tell one about people staying in a home-share or short-term let not having the same rights or protections in law and not being assured of the same standards.  They will make all those points themselves.  They all lend themselves to a type of regulation of short-term letting that I agree with.  I use the platforms in question when I travel and have been open about that.  They are now a big part of our economy and the sector will grow.  I refer not only to letting but to other areas where the shared economy is now making inroads and disrupting traditional business models.</p> <p>  With regard to the practicality, I acknowledge that this will require more resources for planning authorities because we are asking them to take on a new function.  We are going to provide them with the resources to do that.  The activity is very transparent because the platforms are public.  That is how it works.  It cannot work unless it is very transparent.  It is very easy to ascertain, through public searching, what is going on in a given property.  Residents all know the short-term letting house on their road.  They see people coming in at certain times of the day or leaving at certain times of the night.  They will have the wheelie-case.  I do not believe it is a hidden activity.  It is happening right in front of us and that is why I believe regulation will not be as difficult as trying to discover whether someone's extension three roads into an estate actually complies with planning permission guidelines.</p><p>This will have an impact on the tourism industry in Dublin.  However, some short-term letting will continue because we have purpose built short-term letting accommodation.  A place in Temple Bar was built for that reason and got planning permission to do that.  There are also thousands more hotel beds being built.  The tourism industry is incredibly strong in this country and in Dublin, and if there is some displacement effect it is probably okay if it means people go to parts of the country outside Dublin to holiday and spend money.  While I am a member of the Government my responsibility is for housing.  We have a shortage in housing supply so I aim to use every tool available to me to get as many homes back into the traditional rental stock as I can.  That is what we are trying to do through the planning law.</p><p> This is enabling legislation.  The meat of it is in the guidelines which we will lay before the House and discuss shortly.  These changes give a mechanism in primary legislation, as we have a vehicle in the rent Bill, to allow us to get to the nub of what we are trying to do.  They will do the heavy lifting.  In the type of regulation the Deputy referred to he still discussed planning permission, regardless of whether he meant to do that.  When we go to regulation of short-term letting platforms it will still require some element of the planning system.  When we looked at what other cities have done, that has been used in some instances.  In an ideal world we would have both the changes to the planning law that I am proposing today and also regulation that would do more than just regulate the number of properties but would regulate how these properties are used.  At present, that type of regulation is left to the platforms.  Rights in terms of whether there was a breach of the agreement a person had in letting the property over a weekend fall to be remediated by the company, but there probably should be more robust regulations in law so people have rights outside of what the company says are their rights.</p></speech>

That is separate from what we were just discussing, which is the regulations the committee already has and which will be discussed next week.  Then it is my intention to formally lay them before the Houses in the first week of May after the Easter break.  That is where the meat of this is.  There is a wait of 21 days before they become law.  As a result of the delay, and I indicated this earlier, we are now looking at 1 July next for these becoming law.  It was previously indicated in October that it would be 1 June but to be fair to everyone there must be a period, once the law is passed, in which we can tell everyone in rent pressure zones that this change is coming.  Anybody who is in this sector knows this is happening.  I doubt that anybody can claim not to know, but to be fair I have pushed the date back by a month.</p></speech>

Is there a particular reason that the Minister decided on 14 days?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.745" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019041100002#G01100"><p>From the information we have retrieved, and we picked Dublin, typically most people visiting Dublin are coming on a city break for between three and five days.  However, people can holiday for a week and sometimes two weeks.  By going to 14 days we are preventing that activity from happening.  There are a number of other types of short-term stays which we would not wish to exclude, such as executive letting.  A company might control a couple of properties where the executives let them out.  A person coming to work in the company might arrive there and use it as a base for a number of weeks before he or she finds a home to rent for a year or two.  We also know from talking to people in the Department of Health that if somebody is undergoing a particular type of surgery, the person might have family come to live near the hospital where it is taking place.  The family might do that for three weeks, a month or longer.  We do not wish to exclude that.  Obviously, there is also the situation, which was flagged to us by the RTB, where somebody renovating a property might have to vacate it for a month or a longer period of time.  That must be allowed to occur.</p> <p>  The 14 days allows us to tackle short-term letting as we do not believe people are short-term letting for 15, 16  or 17 days, and if they are it must be 0.01% of activity, but it does not then unintentionally capture all those other lettings we want to allow to continue.</p></speech>

This measure applies inside the rent pressure zones.  Approximately one third of the city in which I live is in the rent pressure zone but the rest of it is not.  I am aware there are other elements of the legislation which will probably make it easier for places to get into the rent pressure zones due to the way the averaging will be done.  Does the Minister envisage problems in urban areas that are not in rent pressure zones but in which there is still a great deal of competition for rental properties, there is still a difficulty for people to rent privately and there is a shortage of accommodation?  I am thinking of the rest of Limerick, Waterford and other large towns around the country as well as places just outside the rent pressure zone in Dublin and neighbouring counties.  There could still be issues with a lack of available, affordable rental properties in those areas.  Has the Minister any plans in that regard?</p></speech>

It would be more difficult if we said this is the national law and left it up to each authority to decide whether there was significant pressure in that area because we would get too much inconsistency.  As we worked on it further with the Attorney General, we found we could not do that in any event.  We had to link it to something that was already evidence of significant pressure on rents and significant demand on accommodation, which is the rent pressure zones.  That is already in the law.  We are changing the qualifying criteria for them and doing other things.  We assume there will be more rent pressure zones so places such as Limerick, although I will not prejudge data and everything else-----</p></speech>

His predecessor said it would get in and it did not, so the Minister should not predict.</p></speech>

We saw hyperinflation in certain parts of the country but they were not going to be captured by rent pressure zones because the average rent in Dublin was racing ahead.  One would assume that if these changes are correct, other areas where there has been high inflation will be captured because the national rent will be tied to something different.</p> <p>  Again, this is not the perfect solution.  It is a good one.  One wants to get to the point where tourism short-term letting is a regulated activity as a tourism activity.  This is a planning measure, with regulations to regulate the planning aspect of it, to get the bulk of the properties back into use.  We believe it will be most of them.</p></speech>

Six month or 12 month reviews of any policy are a good idea to see how it is operating, as long as the data are available to make the review meaningful.  I have no problem with that.</p></speech>

In real terms, however, what decision making autonomy will the local authorities have?  Does the Minister see it, effectively, as a mechanism for a blanket refusal, with the Department saying it does not want the authority to grant any of these permissions?  That is the first question.  The reason I ask it is that within the RPZs in my area of Fingal, there are a number of rural villages where houses are let on a short-term basis for tourism.  Even within that RPZ, there are no pressures in those villages for rent yet they are important for tourism.</p><p> The Minister continually mentions Dublin.  Dublin is more than Dublin city, as he knows.  It is important to peripheral areas such as Fingal that people exiting Dublin Airport turn left as opposed to always going into the city for city breaks.  I have received specific representations from people concerned about the application of this provision within an RPZ area where there is no pressure as such on rental supply.  These small operations bring business to rural constituencies in Dublin.  In this regard, does Fingal County Council as the local authority have the autonomy to grant a licence for the short-term letting?  </p><p> The Minister mentioned that these regulations will come into effect from 1 July.  I understand the need for an appropriate lead-in period to allow people to get their houses in order.  I accept that we need to regulate short-term letting to ensure properties come back into stock but there are issues with the regulations that we need to do further work on.  Is there sufficient time for people to regularise their situations?  For example, in the case of an application made now for permission for a second property let the minimum processing time is eight weeks.  If this law comes into effect from 1 July will this permission be in breach of it?  In other words, having not had sufficient lead-in time in terms of the application, will the person be operating illegally?  If this Bill is passed by the D&aacute;il and Seanad in the next couple of weeks and is signed into law by the President on, say, 1 May, is there sufficient time for people to ensure they are not operating illegally through no fault of their own?</p></speech>

My responsibility and first concern is people living and working here.  A person returning to Dublin to trace relatives or whatever is welcome and we like that to happen but our primary concern is accommodating people living and working here.  Essentially, what we are talking about is a blanket refusal.  Good law allows for flexibility and exceptions.  For that reason, I do not favour mandatory minimums.  What we are providing for is blanket refusal but we have to allow local authorities to apply common sense.  People get so frustrated when we bring in laws that do not allow for the person on the ground with the knowledge to apply some common sense in his or her decision making powers without having the flexibility to abuse those powers.  In the regulations, we will allow for that common sense approach.  Essentially, we are taking a blanket approach unless it can be shown that there is scope to show some flexibility in a part of an RPZ area, of which there will be only a small number of instances.</p></speech>

I accept this will happen in only a small percentage of cases.  There are many viable businesses within RPZs in rural areas that will be affected by this provision.  For them, this discretion makes sense.  I agree with the Minister that the bulk of the applications should be refused but there are notable and significant exceptions where they should be allowed.</p></speech>

A landlord in an RPZ will not be allowed to let a second property on a short-term basis.  There may be one or two instances where that would not be appropriate and the guidelines will allow flexibility for the local authorities in that area.</p></speech>

I am not being unrealistic or unreasonable.  I am not talking about Temple Bar or bustling city centres where tourists are tripping over each other.   Rather, I am talking about places like Ballyboughal, Oldtown, Garristown.  The Minister needs to alloew th local authorities in the RPZs to use common sense, but which can be open to challenge.  In the case of applications for permission, it is a public process where people can make observations and objections.  I  find it unusual that the Minister would include in the Bill a section that allows for a planning application to be made in respect of which the position of the Department is a blanket refusal.  I do not think the Minister can do that.  There will be notable, significant exceptions.  I would see the vast majority of second properties coming back into stock.  I am speaking particularly of important tourist and accommodation hubs in rural areas in RPZs where there is no other accommodation.</p></speech>

I presume the guidance to the local authority is if a property is not a property that could enter into the long-term rental market it is open to consideration for planning permission.  I am clear on the broad blanket refusal for properties that are being commercially or fully let or second properties let on a short-term basis but cases such as the property of a person who is working abroad for four months of the year, which is not a property that can go into the long-term rental market, will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>I would not use the term "blanket refusal" in those cases.

I am trying to work this out.  If someone gets planning permission for short-term letting in respect of a second property that is not a principle residence, will a 14-day cap apply on those properties for individual guests?  Where will that restriction on the length of time a person can let a given unit apply?</p></speech>

We have a 90-day rule under which planning permission is required regardless of whether it is a person's principle private residence that is involved.  In the context of any short-term letting, I am trying to work out, in circumstances where someone gets planning permission - regardless of whether it is a principle private residence or a second property - if the impact of the 14-day definition is restrictive in terms of letting out that property to the same guest for more than 14 days.</p></speech>

We spend a lot of time in this committee talking about the need to regulate the platforms.  I do not have the same level of anxiety as Deputy Casey.  We can pass this legislation comfortably if we are of a mind to do so, and then go forward with broader regulations for short-term letting platforms.  It is really important to do that.  There is an array of information that platforms have which would be very important for local authorities in the enforcement of their planning function.  If there were a statutory obligation on the short-term letting platforms to share that information with local authorities, it would make the job of the latter much easier.  It would be a relatively easy thing to do.  Likewise, one of the concerns we expressed at this committee - it is contained in the report - relates to the need for the platforms to share that information with Revenue.  Again, it would make Revenue's job much easier in terms of tax compliance.  There is also the issue of platforms, either knowingly or unknowingly, advertising properties that are not in compliance with the law.  The advertising of properties for long-term letting that are substandard and do not meet regulation was debated in the Seanad yesterday.  We have a 90-day planning permission requirement in law.  If I am a host but I do not have planning permission and Airbnb knows that I am now letting my property out for more than 90 days, there should not only be a legal obligation on the host but also on the platform.  It should be sanctioned in cases where it is advertising properties that are not in line with the legislation.  Responsibility for those regulations should rest with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government because they are much more like the regulation of the private rental sector.  I am not seeking that those regulations be inserted into this Bill; that must be done as it is.  The regulations that I would like to see for the platforms have to be in that kind of space, and responsibility in that regard should lie with the Minister's Department.</p> <p>  Even in the context of an almost blanket refusal for non-principle residences in Dublin, a huge administrative burden will be placed on Dublin City Council and other councils.  I know that some organising work is already under way.  What information can the Minister provide in order to assure us that the local authorities, which will have to deal with this very significant administrative burden, will have all of the resources they need to deal with the applications so that there will be no delay?  Have additional resources been assigned?  Have the local authorities asked for additional resources?  Can the Minister share that information?  He announced last September that this would commence in June .  Is that still his intention, or does he now intend to alter the timeline given the delay in bringing forward the legislation today?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.791" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019041100002#J01700"><p>I agree with the Deputy's point about regulating the platforms.  If a company publishes content, it is responsible for that content.  If it is advertising something, it is, within specific parameters, responsible for that advertisement.  It might be difficult to find the person responsible for putting up fake photos, for example.  Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill in the Seanad speaks to that point.  We want to work through that to see how we can improve matters.  I do not disagree on that point at all.  I took a very comprehensive look at this when I came into the Department because it was one of the things we wanted to move quickly on.  If I could do more in terms of bringing the platforms in I would have done it, but this is a responsibility that will fall to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or perhaps the Department of Finance if the Deputy's suggestion about sharing information with Revenue is taken further.  Regularising the platforms is not something I can do.</p> <p>  On the issue of the administrative burden that local authorities will bear, we have been kicking around a couple of different ideas.  Dublin City Council developed its own proposals and did its own thinking on this.  Greater clarity will be available when we discuss this matter next week, because we will be talking about the substance of how this will be done in each local authority area.  This will become legally operable from 1 July for people in this sector, as I said earlier in public session, representing a move of one month compared to what was announced.  Anyone doing this as a business activity knows that this is coming.  This is being done to be absolutely certain that we can provide a period of advertising to make the requirements in rent pressure zones clear.  Rent pressure zones are only being finalised in legislation now, and this is where it is going to apply and where it is going to happen.  There can be no excuses for non-compliance from 1 July.</p></speech>

We have all provided examples of it.  The Minister has said that he will issue a blanket ban as a starting point.  In Wicklow there are three rental pressure zones, being Bray, Greystones and Wicklow town.  Wicklow is my local electoral area and I have my own business in Glendalough.  There are very few hotels in that area.  Even the hotel in the Wicklow town has been closed.  My hotel is in Glendalough, but it is the only significant hotel accommodation in my local electoral area.  Glendalough is the honeypot that keeps Wicklow going, and the tourism sector there requires Airbnb properties.  There are many such properties, and in Wicklow town, where there is now no hotel, they are the only option and the only way tourism can be sustained in the immediate future.</p> <p>  A developer in Wicklow County Council looking at the county development plan policy, which clearly states an aim to support tourism, will see an immediate contradiction.  Housing requirements dictate that we need properties too.  What is the decision going to be?  Who is making the call?</p><p>Knowing this area quite well, there is also a shortage of hotels in Greystones and Bray.  If everybody in Bray, Greystones and Wicklow who is currently operating a short-term letting platform has to apply for planning permission, I am not sure whether the resources are there in Wicklow to deal with that.  I do not know what level of communication there has been between the Department and Wicklow County Council with regard to this forthcoming regulation.  The same could perhaps be applied elsewhere.  It comes back to the tourism matter.  That is a practical example.</p></speech>

As we talk through the guidelines next week, we can get into that detail.  I am not trying to move off the question.  We are trying to provide the enabling legislation so that we can get into that detail next week.  There has to be some nuance in the guidelines, in what seems like an inherent contradiction of having blanket guidelines but with exceptions.  That is essentially because we want to make sure that people understand what is happening here.  The Deputy will know better than I how this will have an impact on the tourism industry in parts of Wicklow.  That is not my responsibility.  My first and foremost concern is people living and working in this country, and making sure that they have places to live that are secure and affordable.  That is my responsibility as the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I accept that we need to regulate the sector better and that that requires more than what I am doing.  What I am doing is not perfect; it is good.  It will get properties back for people who are struggling to find properties today at rents that they can afford.</p></speech>

As it happens, I commend the Minister.  I think it is quite a radical measure.  It is welcome.  I am not sure how many properties it will free up but it will certainly help, so fair play to the Minister.  My comment is on the Bill itself.  The Bill contains plans to impose administrative sanctions, carry out investigations of landlords, to extend notice periods, registration of landlords and tenancies, publication of determinations and so on.  They are all welcome and I will support the Bill.  I think this is also a missed opportunity to go further given the scale of the crisis that we are facing.  If it was me bringing forward this Bill, it would be called the residential tenancies (emergency measures) Bill and it would have more in it.  However much this Bill is a step forward, which it is, it will not address the crisis.  It may have some impact, which is to be welcomed, but it is not up to the scale of the crisis.  Most obviously, evictions are a major reason for the flow into homelessness and the Bill does not address that.  That is a missed opportunity.  We have amendments to that effect in different sections so I will not delay at this point.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to that.</p> <p>  Across the road from my constituency office in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is a block of apartments.

A vulture fund and property speculator got hold of it.  It first made attempts to ratchet up the rents by approximately 60%.  That was resisted by the tenants with our support.  It moved on after that to try to evict everybody on the basis of substantial refurbishment.  The residents resisted it.  That was successful.  It is good that they are still there but many of the residents were so worn down and traumatised by the experience that they just left.  Now there are just ten tenants in the place.  The big fear that they have, given the previous record of this property investor, is that once it drops to nine, they can move on, because sale is a grounds for eviction.  There are now, disgracefully, about nine units just sitting empty, but refurbishments are being done to allow the company to increase the rent and it will almost certainly sell it on.  People phone me every few weeks to say that something is happening and to ask whether they are facing eviction, because there have been two attempts to drive them out.  This Bill does not deal with that and it should.  That picture is replicated across the country.  I put that to the Minister.  I will not delay.  We will discuss some of these issues on an amendment-by-amendment basis further down the line but I think it is a missed opportunity and there is a failure to recognise the emergency situation that we are in.</p></speech>

I thank him for recognising some of the impact that it will make.  Putting something like "emergency" in the Title is tokenistic.  I do not think it is true that the Deputy would bring those proposals forward if he was Minister because they are not constitutional and they would not be retrospective, so he would not be able to do that.  It is important to recognise the help that this will give to people.  As for the example the Deputy cited, for instance, there is now a definition of substantial refurbishments within the Bill.  There is not a question of protracted engagement with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  It is clear-cut.  There are measures in section 34 relating to notices to the RTB and the rights that fall to the tenants if section 34 is not applied in the appropriate way.  The example that the Deputy cited will help people where it has not helped before.  I suppose that is why he is supporting the Bill.  I recognise that it does not go as far as he would like it to.  There are important constitutional considerations that I have to take on board that I believe the Deputy would have to take on board too if he was in this position.</p></speech>

When the number of residents drops to nine, which it will at some point, a vulture fund or property investor, whatever one calls it, which has a clear history of trying to drive those people out, will move.  It will sell it because that is what it does.  It will flip that property which has accumulated in value and it will evict those people.  The Minister's Bill does nothing to protect them when it happens.</p></speech>

It is important that, as much as possible, we speak to each amendment as we go through.  I am not criticising anybody but we only just got the amendments two days ago.  A number of us have gone through them but we must ensure we do not unintentionally skip over anything.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.816" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019041100002#L00700"><p>If it is amenable to the committee, I will start with amendment No. 3 and we can see how we go.  I will speak to related Government and Opposition amendments linked to student-specific accommodation as we come to them.  Amendment No. 3 and related Government amendments amend the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2016 to provide for its relevant obligations and rights to apply to tenancy and licence agreements in student-specific accommodation provided by public educational institutions or by private accommodation providers to both part-time and full-time students.  For example, the 4% per annum rent increase restriction in rent pressure zones, relevant termination provisions, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, dispute resolution procedures, tenancy and licence registration requirements, and the new RTB sanctioning regime for improper conduct will apply to the student-specific accommodation.</p><p>Amendment No. 3 amends section 3 of the Act of 2004.  Section 3 of the Act of 2004 sets out the dwellings, under tenancy, to which the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2016 apply.  Amendment No. 3 extends the application of the Acts to student-specific accommodation let under a tenancy that commences not earlier than one month after the commencement of this section of the Bill.</p><p>Under the proposed new section (3)(1A)(<i>a</i>) of the Act, every dwelling situated in a building or part of a building used for the sole purpose of providing residential accommodation under tenancy to students during academic terms will be covered by the Acts, regardless of whether that building is used for any other purpose outside of academic terms, such students can reside in the building outside of academic terms, or anyone other than a student, such as a caretaker, resides in the building provided, the residence in the building is for the purposes of providing residential accommodation to students during academic term times.  The amendment makes clear that the Acts do not apply to such a dwelling where an individual landlord resides, for example, in &quot;digs&quot;.  Generally, the Act does not apply to a dwelling within which the landlord also resides.  Under the proposed new section (3)(1A)(<i>b</i>), it is made clear that the application of the Acts to the student-specific accommodation sector will not affect regular dwellings, such as a house, where students reside under an existing or future tenancy.  Under the proposed new section (3)(1A)(<i>c</i>), the definition of &quot;dwelling&quot; under section 4 of the Act of 2004 is modified to make clear that student-specific accommodation can be self-contained but need not be self-contained.  This modification is necessary to reflect the nature of student-specific accommodation.</p><p>Under the proposed new section (3)(1A)(<i>d</i>), &quot;student&quot; is defined as a person registered as a student with relevant providers within the meaning of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012.  To be clear, as defined in other legislation, &quot;relevant provider&quot; is a &quot;previously established university&quot;, &quot;an educational institution established as a university under section 9 of the Act of 1997&quot;, &quot;a technological university&quot;, &quot;the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland&quot;, &quot;the Dublin Institute of Technology&quot;, &quot;a provider whose programme of education and training is validated under section 45&quot;, an &quot;awarding body under section 48&quot;, &quot;a provider to whom authority to make an award has been delegated under section 53&quot;, or &quot;a provider who is authorised to use the international education mark under section 61 other than a provider who is so authorised where that provider is also (<i>i</i>)<i></i>a provider referred to in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>g</i>), or (<i>ii</i>) a linked provider&quot;.  The term &quot;student&quot; covers part-time and full-time students.  English language education providers are not currently &quot;relevant providers&quot; under section 2 but will soon become relevant providers under the law.  Accordingly, their students who avail of student-specific accommodation under licence or tenancy will fall within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Acts.</p><p>A new subsection (7) is inserted into section 3 of the Act of 2004 to disapply a number of provisions of the Residential Tenancies Acts which are not appropriate to the student-specific sector.  The provisions disapplied from the student-specific accommodation sector include the following.  Section 16(k) is not relevant to student-specific accommodation tenancies as assignment and subletting is prohibited in that sector.  Section 16(n) is not relevant in the context of student-specific accommodation as a student has his or her own separate agreement with the provider.  Accordingly, a scenario cannot arise where the student is obliged to write to the provider notifying of the identity of residents.  Section 78(2) and (3) are not relevant in the context of student-specific accommodation as a student is prohibited from subletting or creating a sublicence.  Section 135, clause (II) of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (e) of subsection (4), is amended to modify the required content of the statement that issues by the RTB with its acknowledgement of an application to register a tenancy or licence in the student-specific accommodation sector.  That RTB statement will not be required to set out the security of tenure provisions under the Residential Tenancies Acts, as Part 4 does not apply in the student-specific accommodation sector.  Simply put, a student residing under tenancy in student-specific accommodation for longer than six months will not accrue the legal right to stay there for another 5.5 years.  The RTB statement will reflect that.</p><p>Sections 70, 71, 72, 73, 81, 185 and 186 will not apply to the student-specific accommodation as subletting and multiple tenancies do not apply in that sector.  The agreement between a student and a provider is made in the student&rsquo;s personal capacity.  Section 195 will not apply in the student-specific accommodation sector as proposed overholding under a fixed term tenancy cannot arise.  Students are required to vacate student-specific accommodation in accordance with the terms agreed with the provider.  Security of tenure provisions under Part 4 of the Act will not apply.  Schedule 1 of the Act does not apply to student-specific accommodation as subtenancies cannot occur.</p></speech>

I put on record my thanks to those student unions throughout the country, as well as the Union of Students in Ireland and others, for their input into this.  The committee worked in unison on this across parties.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il had a Bill on purpose-built student accommodation and bringing them under rent pressure zone and RTB provisions, as did Sinn F&eacute;in and others.  We engaged with the Minister and through the Chair to try to bring about a workable solution that would see an end to double-digit rent increases for students.  In some instances, they are the reason students have not been able to complete their college education.  We want to ensure people can have access to such education.</p> <p>  Much work has been done on licence to reside, and it is very significant.  It should make a significant impact.  I note the exemptions listed by the Minister, which make sense.  I have a question about on-campus accommodation.  Purpose-built student accommodation under the previous planning Act is defined.  That is welcome and it was in the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill.  This will also apply where colleges provide their own accommodation on campus.  Are there any nuances as to what applies to purpose-built accommodation that is either on or off campus?  Is there any difference?  We will wholeheartedly support the insertion of this section into the Act.  It is crucial that this legislation is passed so it can be in effect before the new college year starts in August and September.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.818" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019041100002#L00900"><p>It is worth noting it was almost a year ago this month that students from Dublin City University's Shanowen Court and then those in C&uacute;irt na Coiribe were hit with those 27% rent increases.  Like Deputy O'Brien, I pay tribute to the students who organised and mobilised on that issue.  They held sleep-outs and they protested in their colleges and here at Leinster House.  They met Deputies from almost all parties.  It is those students and their political activity that forced it on the agenda of this committee.  There was good bipartisan work by a range of members to put it on the Minister's agenda, and I acknowledge the Minister's openness in working out with those of us on the committee the best possible way of ensuring these students can be fully protected, particularly from excessive rent hikes.</p><p>It is a good example of what happens when young people become involved in politics, engage with the political system and politicians put aside party political differences and do the right thing.  When we pass the Bill, it will have a very beneficial impact on students in both private sector, purpose-built student accommodation and on-campus accommodation.</p><p> The Residential Tenancies Act is highly complex, which we knew when we were drafting our legislation.  The departmental staff have proposed good amendments that deal with the complexities of the Act well.  I wish to ask some clarifying questions in order that we will all be clear on the record.  Despite the word "tenancy" being used at the beginning of amendment No. 3, Part 4 of the Act, which concerns tenancy rights, will not apply in this case.  Student accommodation providers and students will continue to operate under licensing arrangements but they will protected by, for example, the rent pressure zones and other aspects of the Residential Tenancies Act which have not been excluded.</p><p> Yesterday, I had a good meeting with the Irish Universities Association, which manages approximately 15,000 units of on-campus accommodation, that is, bed spaces of accommodation.  It was a constructive engagement and the representatives were trying to get their heads around the Bill.  They asked a couple of questions, in respect of which I am interested in hearing responses.  Given that part of the universities' financing model to ensure that the student accommodation stacks up is what they do outside of term time, such as lettings for academic conferences and so on, none of that will change as a result of the Bill.  It purely governs the licensing arrangements with students for the purposes of student accommodation.  I assume, although the Minister might clarify, that the short-term letting regulations that we are passing will not have any impact on the bed spaces in the on-campus student-specific accommodation.  That is something we need to think about.  If it will have an impact, and if there are any issues with it, we might have to address that on Report Stage or when the Bill proceeds to the Seanad.  If it will not, it would be helpful if that were clarified.</p><p> An issue that arises for the university sector, as well as for the approved housing body sector, which we will address at a later stage, is the requirement that universities will have after the Bill is enacted to register those licences, or what are referred to as "tenancies" in the amendment.  Will the Minister provide some clarity on the requirement of the private and the university student-specific accommodation providers for registration, the cost thereof and the benefits of registering multiple tenancies at a discounted rate?  Was there was any consideration for treating universities like approved housing bodies, given that they are registered charities, and allowing them the lower rate of the registration fee, or was there a reason which prevented that?</p><p> My final question might be better directed at the RTB.  There is an administrative burden for student accommodation providers and the RTB.  Given that there are 15,000 bed spaces but that the leases are not necessarily all for nine months, as some will be for three or six months, will the Minister briefly talk us through his conversations with the RTB on how to minimise the administrative burden for both the providers and the RTB in order that bed spaces can be turned over as smoothly as possible?</p></speech>

Amendment No. 11 in my name is virtually the same as amendment No. 5 in the Minister's name.  I will not push my amendment.  In any event, I do not think any of us will want to push our own amendments because we want there to be a solution.  I pay tribute to the Union of Students in Ireland and the various student bodies, particularly that of Dublin City University, which travelled to the gates of Leinster House and raised the issue with us, following which much work has been done.  Students find it hard enough to manage and live, without being subjected to excessive rents, and the amendment will certainly ease the burden for them.</p> <p>  On the timing, I agree with Deputy Darragh O'Brien that the sooner we pass the Bill, the better, particularly as the new term will start in September or October.  In that regard, I am sure the students' unions will spread the message.  It is important that nobody signs up in advance to something above what is allowed given that people's rights will be protected when the legislation is enacted.  That probably cannot happen but the Minister might provide clarity in order to ensure that people do not end being covered by the legislation.  We cannot control the timing of the Bill because it must be progressed through the Upper House.  However, insofar as is possible, we will all co-operate to ensure that this measure and the others are in place to protect people, in this case students, as soon as possible.</p></speech>

We had a bit of fun over who could draft the best amendment and the officials came up trumps in that regard.  In the series of amendments that must be made to get the Bill right, they covered everything, which is great.  I also thank the students, although I think we must be careful about what political forces we have unleashed for the future.  The students came looking for something and succeeded comfortably.  Although it is a little late, unfortunately, they will have it for the next term.  I also thank the Minister of State with responsibility for third level education, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, for the role she played in respect of the Bill.</p> <p>  On-campus accommodation will be covered.  I do not recall the other question asked by Deputy Darragh O'Brien but I wrote down: "I do not think so."  What was the question?</p></speech>

There will not be any changes to the period of summer lettings.  The Bill will cover all types of accommodation.  Nevertheless, similar to the engagement that Deputy &Oacute; Broin had, I engaged with one of the universities.  As it transpires, the permission it received for its on-campus accommodation does not allow it to offer summer lettings.  That is an anomaly which means it cannot benefit from the types of lettings that others do in order to help subsidise student rent.  The law will apply evenly.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question, Part 4 will not apply and it is important to clarify that.  These clarifications are not for the benefit of students but rather they are technical clarifications for the universities.  The period outside term will not be covered and universities are free to engage in the activities in which they engage, provided they have permission to do so.  Short-term letting regulations will not have an impact on how they operate out of term.  On registration, we will address that later because some amendments relating to it have been tabled.  We have provided for a reduced cost, which will be &euro;40 per tenancy, while if there is a group of ten student licences or tenancies, the cost will be &euro;17 per student.</p></speech>

There will be an extra burden on the RTB, partly due to the extra money that will be received from the registration of the tenancies but that is being provided for in the extra 67% we allocated in budget 2019 as part of a change in the management programme.  We have done all this in lockstep with the RTB to ensure that it is aware of, and can manage, what is coming.  On what is coming and when, about which Deputy Jan O'Sullivan inquired, if we get our timing right, everyone will go off on their J1 visas, or whatever they do as students, knowing that this will be the law of the land when they return.  What will not be the law of the land on their return, however, are the registration changes, which will take effect in quarter 1 of 2020 because that will be when the RTB can accommodate annual registration of tenancies.  While the tenancies will still have to be registered, and that will not change, the annual registration, the new fees and so on will not kick in until quarter 1 of 2020.</p></speech>

We need to repeat that.  It does not apply to on-campus accommodation but, according to the RTB, private sector off-campus purpose-built student accommodation has the protection of the RPZs.  While the Government amendments clarify that, to make it crystal clear we should still encourage students to take those cases if they feel their rights are being infringed.</p></speech>

When debating the previous Residential Tenancies Bill, we highlighted many loopholes that existed.  We turned out to be right and at the time we were either dismissed or promised that they would be addressed in the future.  Those loopholes were subsequently exploited to the detriment of many people who were evicted or found themselves in difficulty because of loopholes in the previous Bill.  The Minister should take the opportunity to address any loopholes or grey areas that could allow landlords to evade their responsibilities or to act in a way that is detrimental to tenants, particularly in cases of receivership.  We should also cover all angles relating to students so that students can enjoy all the rights that tenants should enjoy.  That is the purpose of the amendment and I fail to understand why the Minister does not want to deal with that in the Bill because we do not know when the next Bill will be.</p></speech>

With respect to landlords and particularly the legal grey area, the general practice is for receivers or banks and funds that repossess properties to behave like landlords.  They accept the rent and that means there is a tacit acceptance that they are accepting the obligations of a landlord.  In general, they employ a property management company to meet them.  The problem is that it is the general practice but it is not codified in law.  There is an urgent need to ensure that the law is crystal clear when a bank, a receiver or a fund takes over a property from a landlord.  As more buy-to-let properties exit the market, some through repossessions, etc., this is urgent.  I know the Minister will not accept the amendment and I know nothing Deputy Boyd Barrett or I say will change his mind.  However, he needs to address the issue at some point.</p> <p>  There is one significant Part in the Residential Tenancies Act that should not apply to students.  They have appeared before the committee and told us they do not want Part 4 to apply to them.  Everything else, with the exception of subletting, which does not apply to students, will apply as a consequence of the Government amendment.  All the measures students have requested, including on rents and access to the RTB for disputes, are provided for.</p><p>Through the Deputy's amendment, we would end up giving students a set of legal rights that they neither want nor need in Part 4, which would complicate student accommodation.  Nonetheless, I want to insist that, with regard to the definition on landlords, at the earliest opportunity the Minister needs to come back to us with something because it is a pressing matter.</p></speech>

This amendment does not do that.  It is not that simple.  This is something that needs to be addressed and I want to address it.  However, given the purpose of this Bill, which was stated at the outset, it was not going to be an opportunity to do that, unfortunately.  When the Deputy looks at the complexity of what we are trying to do, it is not facilitated in this Bill and that amendment would not achieve it either.</p></speech>

To use exactly the same example that I used earlier, the tenants do not know who they are dealing with, given the place has been taken over by a fund, and they do not know if the place is changing hands.  One minute they are dealing with property agents or people employed by somebody who manages the place, but it is not clear.  They do not know who to go to when there are difficulties.  It is an unacceptable and stressful situation from the point of view of those tenants.  I fail to not understand why the Minister would not want to deal with that in this Bill.</p></speech>

I said at the outset last year that we were going to progress two rent Bills.  This first Bill is doing more than it was meant to in regard to the extension of RPZs, changing the qualifying criteria, and closing some perceived loopholes which, again, will benefit people who are letting from large institutional investors in many cases.  There is also what we are doing around short-term letting, the extended notice-to-quit period and section 34.  This Bill is doing many things it was not intended to do because of what was sought by the joint committee, as well as NGOs, people representing unions and everyone else.  While the Deputy might think a simple amendment like this would capture what he wants to capture, it would not.  It is far more complex than is being presented.  However, it is something I want to tackle.</p></speech>

Under amendment No. 53, section 66 of the Act has been modified to provide that the tenancy termination notice period for the student-specific accommodation sector must be at least 28 days.</p></speech>

To be clear, if a landlord of student accommodation was to attempt to terminate the licence in breach of that licence agreement, although not in breach of Part 4 tenancy rights, the student would still have the right to bring that type of case to the RTB.

I will also speak briefly to related Government and Opposition amendments in the grouping.</p> <p>  Section 12 amends section 134 of the Act of 2004 to require landlords to register their tenants on an annual basis with the RTB.  The aim is to gather accurate and detailed tenancy and rental data on an annual basis.  The key provision in amendment No. 73 requires that a tenancy related to student-specific accommodation commencing during the first three months of the application of the Act of 2004 to that sector must be registered with the RTB within four months of the tenancy's commencement.  Thereafter, registration will be required within one month of the commencement of the tenancy on a similar basis to all other tenancies under the Act.  The amendment is provided to facilitate the smooth integration of the student-specific accommodation sector into the RTB registration system.  Amendment No. 73 is the key amendment and amendments Nos. 75 and 76 are consequential and technical in nature.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 74 proposes to delete the timeframe of "within 1 month from each anniversary of the date of the commencement of the tenancy" for the purposes of annual tenancy registration obligations.  I cannot accept this amendment.  Annual registration must be timely and this timeframe corresponds with the timeframe for registration of a tenancy within one month of its commencement. </p></speech>

A consequential amendment is provided in the Bill to delete subsection 1 of section 135 as it is superfluous on foot of a move to annual registration.  Otherwise technical amendments are provided regarding the required content of the statement to be issued by the RTB with its acknowledgment to a landlord and tenant of an application to register a tenancy.</p> <p>  Government amendment No. 78 refines the language of section 13 of the Bill and provides that the RTB statement will now be required to set out that RTB registration fees are required upon tenancy commencement and annual registration thereafter.  Other consequential technical amendments relating to the statement are also provided on foot of the application to the Act of 2004 - the student-specific accommodation sector in particular - to reflect that the security of tenure provisions of Part 4 of the Act will not apply.  Simply put and as we have discussed, the Part 4 requirements under the 2004 Act do not apply to student-specific accommodation.  </p></speech>

For example, if one looks at websites today, one will see three, six or nine-month licences.  If I sign up to the September to December licence but renew that licence from January to three months after that or if I sign a licence from January to March and then opt in April to sign a new licence from April to June, how will that work?

The Bill amends the existing registration fees to reflect the new requirement to register tenancies on an annual basis.  These amendments to section 15 of the Bill are required on foot of the application of the Act to the student-specific accommodation sector.  The opportunity has been taken to better refine the text of section 137 of the 2004 Act.  The key changes are as follows.  Section 137(1) is amended to provide that following the move to annual registration, a fee of &euro;40 will apply to a tenancy registration upon commencement and on an annual basis thereafter.  The current registration fee is &euro;90 upon commencement of the tenancy.  The RTB will continue to have the power under section 138(1) of the Act to vary the registration fee in line with changes in the value of money.  The new section 137(1)(<i>b</i>) provides that the registration fee for the tenancy in the student-specific accommodation sector will be &euro;40 immediately from the application of the Act of 2004 to that sector, which is likely to predate the move to annual registration.  The registration fee relating to that sector will remain at &euro;40 following the general move to annual registration.</p><p>Section 137(4) of the 2004 Act, which deals with the single registration fee that applies where a landlord simultaneously applies to register up to ten tenancies in dwellings comprising the same property, for example, up to ten apartments in the same apartment block, is also amended.  In line with section 15 of the Bill, following the move to annual registration, the single registration fee payable in such circumstances will be &euro;170 both upon tenancy commencement and upon subsequent annual registrations.  The amendment applies a single fee for tenancy registrations in respect of student-specific accommodation tenancy registrations in such circumstances but immediately from the date of the application of the Act of 2004 to that sector.  As I have stated, this is likely to predate the general move to annual registration.  The single fee for tenancy registrations in such circumstances will not change for the student-specific sector upon the move to annual registration.</p><p>Government amendment No. 80 gets into late registration, which we might come to separately.  </p></speech>

Currently, under the Act, the late fee amounts to an extra &euro;90.  That is a doubling of the registration fee.  With the move to annual registration, the Bill provided for a late fee of a once-off extra &euro;20, that is, an extra 50% was added to the annual registration fee of &euro;40.  Upon reflection, following the discussion we had here, it is now proposed to more strongly incentivise compliance with the requirement to register tenancies with the RTB by applying a late fee of &euro;10 for every month or part thereof where registration remains outstanding.  That will continue and build and build.</p></speech>

This section deals with AHBs, upon which we have been touching.  Section 16 of the Bill amends section 137A of the 2004 Act, which provides for tenancy registration fees in respect of AHB tenancies.  The Bill amends the existing AHB registration fee to reflect the new requirement to register tenancies on an annual basis.  The Bill provides that an AHB tenancy registration fee will be just half the usual amount payable by private landlords.  These amendments to section 16 of the Bill propose to better refine the text of section 137A of the Act.  The key changes are as follows.  Section 137(1) of the Act is amended to provide that following the move to annual registration, a fee of &euro;20 will apply to a tenancy registration upon commencement and on an annual basis thereafter.  The current registration fee is &euro;90 upon commencement of the tenancy.  The RTB will continue to have the power under section 138(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Act to vary the registration fee in line with changes in the value of money.</p><p>Section 137A(4) of the Act deals with the single registration fee that applies where a landlord simultaneously applies to register up to ten tenancies.  In line with section 16 of the Bill, following the move to annual registration, the single registration fee payable in such circumstances will be &euro;85 both upon tenancy commencement and upon subsequent annual registrations.  </p><p>Section 137A(6) of the Act, which relates to the fee for late registration of an AHB tenancy, is being refined in line with section 16 of the Bill but with the following key difference.  Currently, under section 137A(6), the late fee in respect of AHB tenancy registration amounts to an extra &euro;20 for every month or part thereof during which the registration remains outstanding.  Under section 137A(7) of the Act, an overall cap of &euro;240 applies to the fee payable by an AHB to register a tenancy.  The fee of &euro;240 includes the original &euro;90 registration fee.</p><p>With the move to annual registration, the Bill provided for a once-off late fee of &euro;10, which is 50% of the annual registration fee of &euro;20, to be paid in addition to the annual fee.  On reflection and having received advice from the RTB, amendment No. 82 proposes to more strongly incentivise compliance by AHBs with the requirement to register tenancies by applying a late fee of &euro;5 for each month or part thereof that the registration remains outstanding.  A new subsection (2) to section 16 of the Bill will clarify in law that the fees for any registration that should have been made prior to these amendments to section 137A coming into force will be required to be paid in line with the existing registration fee structure, that is, &euro;90 per tenancy registration and &euro;20 per month if late, subject to an overall cap of &euro;240.  The other associated changes are of a consequential or technical nature or both.</p></speech>

I share the genuine concerns raised with me by the Irish Council for Social Housing on behalf of the approved housing bodies regarding the additional administrative work that will be required under the section.  I am not convinced that it will be as simple as pressing a button every year to renew the registration.  On the additional penalties for failing to re-register, a single registration should be required and perhaps the tenancy should be rolled on every five years, as was previously the case.  I do not agree with the proposed new section in its current form.  I understand the reasons for which the Minister may be proposing it, but I do not believe annual registration is required.</p><p>Obviously, there is a re-registration when a tenancy changes.  If a tenant of an approved housing body moves on, the tenancy will be re-registered.  AHBs are not-for-profit organisations which play a big part in the delivery of housing.  We should not make it any more difficult for them to operate in the sector.  From my experience as a Deputy and spokesperson on housing, it is not the approved housing bodies as landlords, <i>per se</i>, that are posing any of the difficulties we are trying to address within the Bill.  For that reason, the section may be unnecessary.  I am interested to hear the response of the Minister in that regard.  I will not flatly refuse to support the amendment but I would like to know how he thinks it would work for an organisation such as Cl&uacute;id, Tuath, any of the other big AHBs, or the smaller AHBs that are willing to get into the market.  There are currently approximately 260 AHBs in Ireland.  I am interested to hear the comments of the Minister.  I ask him to expand on why he and the Government believe that an annual registration for the sector is required.</p></speech>

I was torn on the amendment.  I am very sympathetic to the approved housing bodies, which have communicated with all members regarding the financial and administrative impact on them.  However, I have listened very carefully to the Residential Tenancies Board regarding the need for accurate annual information such that we can fully understand what is going on in the sector.  The reason I have decided to side with the RTB and the Minister on this issue is that even though a tenancy may be long term, the details of the tenancy such as the rent paid or the number of people per household may change, and that is very important information for us to have.  I would like that information to be readily available for the entire social housing sector, not just the approved housing body sector.  I will be supporting the amendment.</p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge that the Minister has made a concession to the approved housing body sector.  In the vast majority of cases, the cost of the annual registration will be &euro;8.50 rather than &euro;20, which is a significant reduction.</p> <p>  There are two issues on which I share the concerns of Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  The first is that the administrative process must be very straightforward.  I have spoken to the RTB on this issue and it outlined that, for example, in the case of a long-term social housing tenant there would be a detailed registration in year 1 and one could simply resubmit electronically with the click of a button on its online portal each year thereafter.  Unless there was a material change, all of the data would not have to be inputted again.  That is vital.  The approved housing body sector works down to the bone of the administrative margin it is given and we must insist that the process is made as easy as possible for the sector. </p> <p>  Another concern is that although the five or six large approved housing bodies have the capacity to deal with this measure, the many very small approved housing bodies, including some that built five or ten units in their local villages which are now managed by pensioners, may not have that capacity.  They are not professional organisations and it will be a significant struggle to make them aware of and have full understanding and knowledge of this issue.  There may be difficulties in terms of how the requirements are communicated, the engagement with the AHBs and in terms of the penalties.  I am thinking of a local Society of St. Vincent de Paul conference with three units in a small rural town, the governance of which is not at the level of that in the larger approved housing bodies.  Serious thought must be given to engaging with such bodies and ensuring that they do not end up in very difficult situations through no fault of their own.  I am not currently proposing an amendment to deal with that issue, but it is a matter on which the Minister should respond to the committee today or revert to it having consulted with the RTB and the Irish Council of Social Housing.  To use a phrase of which the Minister is fond, we must ensure that there are no unintended consequences for such very small voluntary approved housing bodies.</p></speech>

I understand that that is presumably the consideration of the Minister and echoed by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  However I have very serious concerns about the administrative capacity of approved housing bodies to deal with the proposed requirements.  The extra burden under the new section would dovetail with substantial additional burdens that are being placed generally on AHBs large and small.</p> <p>  In the past week or two, I came across a concrete example of how ill-equipped approved housing bodies are to deal with welfare issues, anti-social issues and complaints and so on about the quality of the accommodation.  The case to which I refer arose in a new approved housing body development in my area that came in under Part V.  AHBs do not have the administrative resources to deal with those issues.  This amendment would place a further administrative burden upon them.  Although I see the logic behind the amendment, I point out to the Minister that there is a real difficulty.  A general burden is being imposed on AHBs and they simply are not capable of dealing with it.  This amendment would add to that burden.  The inability of the AHBs to cope with the administrative burden will become more and more apparent because of the over-reliance on AHBs.</p> <p>  I do not understand what is the logic or criteria when deciding to give responsibility to develop a Part V social housing project to an AHB rather than the county council, which has more administrative capacity to deal with these issues.  The decisions seem completely arbitrary.  In my area, much of the Part V development seems to be going to AHBs, which do not have the capacity to cope.  This amendment will add to their burden.  I am raising a wider issue but it needs to be flagged.  Notwithstanding that there is a rationale for the amendment, it will add to the administrative burden on AHBs.  I would be interested to hear the comments of the Minister in that regard.</p></speech>

I support those who have said it has to be as simple as possible to reregister.  There was a time when Limerick County Council encouraged the small AHBs in villages to provide for elderly people with crescent-shaped places for the elderly in the village to live in and to receive support.  There are many such AHBs around the country but I do not know what management capacity they have.  I imagine that the bigger ones have better capacity.  I would like there to be a hand-holding approach, rather than a punitive approach, in cases where there are difficulties.  This may prove to be something that people will not succeed in complying with , even with the best will in the world.  The sector provides long-term homes for a large section of our population and when people get a tenancy from an AHB, they see it as their home for the rest of their life.  It is not like the volatile private rented sector, though we would also like people to think they could live in a privately rented place for the rest of their life.  I accept that there are efforts to deal with the financial cost and the administrative burden but my main suggestion is that there is understanding of the sector in respect of the difficulties it will undoubtedly have.  I am aware that this may not be possible in legislation but it is important that it is as easy as possible to do.</p></speech>

They will also make an annual return to the interim housing regulator.  I disagree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that larger housing bodies will automatically have the resources.  The projected cost of the new measures, and the additional annual requirements, is approximately &euro;500,000, which is &euro;5 million over ten years and is significant for a not-for-profit sector.  It is not as if these are not tracked or registered as things stand.  This is not the sector we were going to focus on as, to the best of my knowledge, it is a compliant sector and does not tend to generate many complaints.  The tenants are long-term tenants in the main, and 12-month roll-over leases are rare.</p> <p>  As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, these housing bodies seem to be the main vehicle for delivery of housing in the sector and we do not look for local authorities to register tenants annually.  AHB tenancies are effectively the same as they involve Cl&uacute;id, their tenants are on council waiting lists and they are housed in co-operation with the local authorities but we are considering placing a significant burden on them with this.  The market rent aspects of the legislation do not apply to the AHB sector so why do we need to have annual registration?  Would it not make sense to require them to make an initial registration and to reregister if there is a change of tenant or every five or seven years?   If we are not proceeding with the rent transparency register, capturing details for publication and to get a better picture of the situation is not relevant.  We will be placing a substantial financial burden on the sector.  There will be a need for extra resources and this will lead to extra costs.  St. Vincent de Paul Housing Trust in Malahide has small developments in the town and in Wexford.  Who will do the registration for them?  The Minister is also proposing doubling down on them by imposing penalties on what is a not-for-profit sector.  It is over the top and too onerous so I will have to oppose section 16.</p></speech>

They have an obligation to register tenancies with the RTB which requires paperwork for each tenant and is a burden for the volunteers who, in many cases, run these bodies.  It will take a few hours for this to be done for ten tenants but moving to annual registration does not meant they have to do all the work which they do in the first year again.  We are building a new piece of technology with the RTB for everything it does and we have stressed that we have to facilitate easy annual registration for everyone, particular for AHBs which often do not have a dedicated person to do this and which do not make the profits which a private landlord would make.</p> <p>  We have spoken about the need for the register to be consistent and complete.  As the Deputy knows, when one starts to interfere with different datasets and to have different application periods or time periods, it can skew information and not give an accurate picture.  A tenant might come in in the first year and be there for ten years but, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, the terms of a tenancy could change within that period and it is important for the RTB to have an idea of what is happening in this very important part of the rental market.  AHBs have to use the dispute mechanisms of the RTB when they have problems with tenants and an independent arbiter has to decide on the matter, and tenants also use the RTB for this purpose.  There needs to be a fee because the RTB needs to be funded in that way as well as through central Government, recognising the burden on the board of disputes between AHBs and their tenants.</p> <p>  These are very positive changes for AHBs because, under the current law, it costs &euro;90 to register a tenancy.  The current law exposes them to a liability of an additional &euro;375 if they are late in making a registration but from this point on, it will be &euro;8.50 per tenancy, which will be payable once a year.  I do not see that as overly burdensome from a financial point of view.  I recognise the issues from an administrative point of view and I have met with tier 1 AHBs in my own constituency who have made that point to me.  They stressed that they are volunteers and need things like a new freezer for a kitchen and they also have tax compliance requirements.  We are working with the RTB to make sure that reregistration is as simple as possible.  If the system is coherent it will be simple but if we start building a system that has to cater for different things in different ways, simplicity is not achieved and it becomes more burdensome and costly.  In light of the changes in the wider rental sector and the changes we are bringing in for the RTB, we see this as a positive change for AHBs.</p></speech>

I do not understand how he can say that this does not add to the administrative burden on AHBs in a situation where I would strongly argue they are already under-resourced from an administrative point of view.  They have said it themselves.  The AHB representatives have come before this committee and said there is a burden being imposed on them, and that was prior to this, for which they are not geared up.  </p><p> The Minister did not answer my question, and I am curious about this, as to the basis on which decisions are made that Part 5 tenancies, which are a significant part of the Government's plans to deliver social housing, be given to an AHB rather than taken on by the council.  Does the Minister issue guidelines on that?</p></speech>

I said that there is a burden in this and that we would make it as minimal as possible.  Given the changes in technology the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, is advancing, if it can be it will be a click button process.  That is vastly different from having to compile the paperwork for ten different tenants on an annual basis, which is not what we are talking about.  This is one of the first issues the Irish Council for Social Housing brought to my attention in one of my very first engagements as we talked about how we would work with the sector into the future.  The changes we are making around the financial costs are vast improvements to what they face today in terms of &euro;8.50 per tenancy.  It is recognising the issues they have raised with me.</p> <p>  Regarding Part 5 and allocation, I do not intend to get into that here.  I will try to stick to the Bill if I can because we have a lot to discuss.</p></speech>

The important point is that we can have an up to date and accurate picture of what is happening in our rental market, including what is happening in AHBs because they go through the RTB, unlike what happens in local authority housing.  That is what is required for annual registration of tenancies.  We want to make the process of re-registration as simple as possible for everyone where there has not been a significant change to the tenancy in the preceding 12-month period.  This is part of the change management programme we have with the RTB.  I refer to annual registration of tenancies, a new type of funding mechanism for the RTB as in the fee structure that I outlined for the other sectors of the rental market but which are greatly reduced for AHBs.</p></speech>

They already register with the RTB and they send an annual return to the interim housing regulator as well.  Our issue is the annualised nature of it.  It is too onerous for them, both in cost and in administration.  Allowing them to reregister when a tenancy change happens and giving them a potential five-year period would make much more sense for it, particularly as this sector is growing.</p></speech>

They have administrative and other paid staff and they are doing all of this.  If I worry, I worry about the tier 1 companies.  I am thinking off the top of my head of one of the tier 1 companies in my constituency, which is an old folks home with 15 or 16 tenants.  I will not say any more in case I identify them.  If this is done in the way we would like it to be done based on our conversations with the RTB, they will do their first registration, which is the paperwork, which they have to do anyway.  It was previously paperwork but it will now be with the new database.  It will then be as simple as going onto the website through a secure portal, if we can get this done in the right way.  We have given funding to the RTB to try to build the system.  Spending less than an hour verifying that the details are correct as per the previous year for the 15 tenants they have and then giving an authorisation either to debit from an account that has already been registered with the RTB or submit new details for the &euro;100 or so it would cost them in that situation is a burden.  It is something that has to be done but I do not believe it is overly burdensome given the information it will allow us to have in real time with the RTB, which will then be the independent regulator as we are building them out over this change management programme.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 8 seeks to insert a definition of &quot;deposit&quot; in the Residential Tenancies Act.  While the Act mentions deposits and imposes some obligations regarding them, it does not contain a definition.  This has allowed a lacuna to develop in regulation.</p><p>Amendment No. 9 on the regulation of deposits restricts the growing practice of landlords seeking two months in rent as a deposit along with the first month's rent.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this.  It is a sizable amount for any tenant to produce, and vulnerable, low-income tenants in particular.  <i>The Irish Times</i>and many other newspapers have reported that some of the country's largest private landlords are seeking two months' rent in deposit.  The common practice regarding deposits is that they be the equivalent of one month's rent.  This practice would be placed on a legislative basis by this amendment.</p><p>Amendment No. 9 would also prohibit the requirement of &quot;key money&quot;, which we have defined in amendment No. 8.  Key money is the money that prospective tenants are required to pay before they get the key to the property.  It is also known as viewing fees or non-refundable booking fees for the viewing of properties.  While those who can afford these extra costs might just find them tedious or an annoyance or inconvenience, key money is a real concern, poses a material obstacle to accessing housing and introduces further discrimination on the basis of wealth into the already stressful process of searching for housing.  In effect, it is locking people out of even viewing accommodation that they badly need.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right, in that landlords are using this mechanism to circumvent the anti-discriminatory legislation.  Previously, landlords would have refused rent supplement, HAP, etc.  It is a clear ruse to avoid social welfare-dependent tenants for prejudicial or other reasons.  There is nothing that people can do about it.  Not only does this create significant financial hardship, but it is deliberately designed to get around the legal prohibition on refusing social welfare and social housing support-dependent tenants.  For that reason alongside the issue of financial hardship, the Minister should consider accepting these amendments.  While I do not expect him to support them, he should.  The officials should consider this matter and seek to address it on Report Stage or in a subsequent Bill.</p> <p>  Even for people who are not being subjected to discriminatory practices by some landlords, to ask a working family on a modest or above-median income for two to three months' rent and deposit is huge.  Given that young couples are now purchasing much later in life because of the unaffordable cost of accommodation, more and more families are being affected.</p><p>I appeal to the Minister to consider this amendment.  If cannot support it, I ask him to come back with something that does the same thing.  He would have our active support if he did.</p></speech>

It is similar to Deputy Catherine Martin's amendment No. 8.  Its purpose is to limit deposits to just one month's rent.  We all know of situations where landlords have asked for two or even three month's rent in advance.  That excludes people who do not have that amount of ready cash.  I included this in a previous Bill and I would the Minister to give serious consideration to limiting deposits to one month's rent.</p> <p>  I also support Deputy Darragh O'Brien's amendment No. 183.  There is enabling legislation for the establishment of a rent deposit scheme.  As far as I recall, it has been there since 2015.  We really should have a scheme like that as well.  The most urgent matter now, however, is to limit deposits.  I do not mind which of the amendments it is, but I would like to see a limit of one month's rent for deposits.</p></speech>

There are many good landlords, as I have stated in all of these discussions, and this is not casting aspersions on all of them.  One month's rent as a deposit should be sufficient.  That is the norm in Ireland.  There were arguments to the effect that it is two or three months in other parts of Europe.  When we examine the level of rents here, however, rent pressure zones aside, the average rent now in Dublin is nearing &euro;2,000 a month.  Asking someone, therefore, to come up with &euro;2,000 for one month's rent and &euro;2,000 for one month's deposit totals &euro;4,000 of gross income.  That is a large amount of money.   I am interested to hear the Minister's response to the amendments tabled by Deputies Catherine Martin and Shortall.</p></speech>

I apologise again.</p> <p>  We have discussed the establishment of a national rent deposit scheme on Second Stage of the Bill and in this committee.  I understand that it can be complex from an administrative perspective in respect of where the money goes and how it is held.  It is a substantial piece of work.  There is, however, enabling legislation, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan stated.  My amendment is not tying the hands of the Minister by stating that it must be done now.  I would, of course, rather that he did that and we had a national rent deposit scheme in place now.  It is the one thing that is going to safeguard deposits into the future.  We should, therefore, be working collectively towards getting that established.</p> <p>  My amendment states that the Minister will report back on the establishment of a national rent deposit scheme within 12 months of the commencement of the legislation.  I think that is absolutely reasonable.  I would like to have gone further.  I would like to see the scheme established now.  I understand, however, that there are reasons why that cannot be done.  We should not, however, just leave this on the never-never and the long finger.  It is something we want to do in future.  My amendment would mean that, when the Bill is passed, there would need to be a report back in 12 months on a plan to establish a national rent deposit scheme.  That will help and it will underpin a resolution of all of the issues about which my colleagues have spoken during this meeting.  I refer in particular to Deputy Catherine Martin's point on the level of rent.  One month's rent should be more than sufficient as a deposit.</p></speech>

I understand fully the complexities of the creation of this scheme but it would assist the RTB greatly in reducing that bit of its dispute backlog.  It would also generate revenue.  The interest would be a considerable sum if the RTB were to be the holder of all of these deposits in its account.  There would, therefore, also be a financial return for the RTB, as well as a reduction in its administrative burden.  I know it is beyond the scope of this legislation.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien's amendment is a good one.  It is just asking the Minister to go away and then come back to us to outline when it is intended to do something the Oireachtas has already decided should be done.</p></speech>

I have lost my deposit before in circumstances I thought were absolutely incredible.  When I saw the dispute options open to me, I felt the burden of pursuing them was not going to be worth the money I was trying to retrieve.  I have also been in a situation where I have used a deposit to cover my final monthly rent payment.  People like to have the flexibility to do that as well.  There is a commitment to bring in a deposit protection scheme.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan is absolutely right that the 2015 Act provides for this to happen.  I have been examining this matter since I came into this brief because it is something we committed to and that it is possible to achieve in law.</p> <p>  Some difficulties have arisen, however, that were not there in 2015.  There have also been some changes in the landscape.  One is that it was originally intended that this would be financed by the interest payable on the deposits in the scheme.  The ECB has stated, however, that it is going to continue with a zero rate for the foreseeable future.  The interest on even a large amount of money would not, therefore, be enough to cover the management and maintenance of this scheme, its operation and the administration required.   We need to consider the numbers of tenants and the amount of money involved.  A change in the market means that disputes about deposits are no longer commonly referred to the RTB.</p> <p>  Turning to the issue of the two-month deposit, I do not have a problem with defining a deposit as generally being one month.  It is not something significant according to the RTB, however, nor is "key money".  There was much reportage on these issues at the time.  Threshold stated that it was a disgrace and should not have been happening.  It had to withdraw that statement the next day because the evidence brought to Threshold had not been actual evidence of people being charged to view properties.  There has been some misreporting on this in the media.  That is not to say that it does not happen.  When we look at all of the different things we are asking the RTB to do, however, including the new things it will be doing - and we have given it money and resources to do those tasks - we have to be careful about the additional burdens we ask of the RTB.  It may not see those issues as being foremost priorities.</p> <p>  Regarding the size of a deposit protection scheme, we are looking at more than &euro;300 million according to a back-of-the-napkin estimate.  It is estimated at about &euro;340 million and rising.  That is a significant amount of money that needs to be managed and held.  Where would it be held?  Who would manage it?  Under what terms would the moneys be released?  What would be the different dispute mechanisms needed for mediation?  We would need all of those things.  It is not a simple thing to do.  It is a great idea but it is complex.  That is not to say that it is not something we should proceed with but it is not being presented to me as the priority it once was.  Given everything else we are asking the RTB to do, we are not proceeding with that aspect in our Bill.  I cannot, therefore, accept the amendments brought forward by the Deputies.</p></speech>

That is regrettable.  There is a housing crisis so should address anything that is locking anyone out of even the possibility of viewing a home.  There is also the issue of a two or three month's rent being requested as a deposit.  I am hearing about those issues in my constituency in Dublin-Rathdown.  I am being contacted by people who cannot even view a home because of the "key money" fee and by people who cannot afford the deposit because it is two or three month's rent.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this again before the Bill goes on to Report Stage rather than give an outright refusal now.  "Key money" fees and two or three month's rent being required for a deposit is essentially facilitating discrimination on the grounds of wealth.  There should be no discrimination and there should be equality when accessing houses.  Allowing a landlord to state it is necessary to have a deposit of two or three month's rent or to have key money to even see a home is locking people out of housing when we are in the midst of a housing crisis.  I appeal to the Minister to revisit this before Report Stage.</p></speech>

It is something that could affect the other aspects of the Bill.  There is obviously a reason.  In respect of our own amendment, I understand that there could be a cost implication and I understand about deposit interest rates being zero at the moment.  No one is suggesting that within the creation of a national rent deposit scheme there would not be an administrative fee for holding a safe deposit.  It should be possible for the Department to come back to that in a report.  All we are asking for is that we do not leave this indefinitely just because it is thought to be complex and costly or because it is this, that and the other.  The Department should say it is going to come back within 12 months and lay out the options.  Maybe one of the findings will be that it is not actually required and we do not need to do it.  I encourage the Minister to accept amendment No. 183 on that basis.  It does not tie his hands or tell him to do anything, with the exception of coming back here within 12 months to tell us where things stand.  There is an issue with security of deposits as rents get higher.  We all want to tackle driving down rents or at least seeing the inflationary nature of rents reducing.  A deposit is a substantial fee.  All we are asking is for a provision to come back in 12 months to report on the options for a national rent deposit scheme.  If administrative cost is the issue, if I was lodging &euro;2,000 with a landlord for my deposit, we could look at an administrative fee as part of that, to at least know the deposit is secure.  We continue to hear complaints.  It is interesting to hear that there has been a reduction in the number of complaints to the RTB about deposits.  That is welcome.  However, we will all still be very aware of these issues when they arise within our own constituencies.  In the main it is the landlord who holds the deposit.  The landlord can then withhold the deposit and all those complaints go to the RTB.  They take up a lot of time.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that there is a saving here.  There could be a saving to the RTB in respect of time expended dealing with complaints around deposits.  I do not wish to be obstructionist but I intend to press amendment No. 183.  It makes sense.  There is a statement of intent there.</p></speech>

They were grouped differently from how we thought they might have been.  I had told Deputy O'Brien that I would not be able to accept amendments because we had not had enough time to see what might be the consequential impacts.

I absolutely respect the principle of one month's rent as a deposit.  I do not think there should be anything like key money.  It is just that we have not had a chance to see what other impacts there might be.  I will absolutely look at those two amendments between now and Report Stage.  On a point of clarification, the current idea is that all of this burden would fall on the RTB.  Perhaps in the compiling of a report we could look at how we could keep this away from the RTB without restricting anyone's rights to the RTB.</p></speech>

While the Minister is right that there was probably some inaccurate reporting around key money, it is important to make a distinction between that and the very common practice of some landlords looking for multiple months' rent in advance.  All of us have significant experience of that.  Because it is not something about which people can complain to the RTB, the RTB will not have data on it.  It is a widespread practice, particularly in Dublin.  On that basis, whatever about the issue of key money, on the issue of multiple months' deposits and rent up-front there is a real need to intervene.  I would welcome seeing the Minister's Report Stage amendments.</p></speech>

In respect of a definition of "deposit", my amendment No. 12 defines the term as "howsoever described, being money payable on entering into an agreement for the tenancy of a dwelling and intended to be held as security for the performance of any obligations, and the discharge of any liabilities, of the tenant under or in connection with the tenancy."  My great assistant, Finbarr O'Malley, drafted that.  He is very good at these things.  I have no problem if the Minister wants to use that definition.  Either way, I welcome the fact that the Minister will look at this again.  It is important.</p></speech>

More generally, beyond this immediate crisis, we need for those who enter into the rental sector to understand that the people who rent from them have rights and require security of tenancy.  We often talk about having a rental sector that is more like the European model.  Various people say we have to accept there will be a bigger rental sector in Ireland.  It seems to me that we cannot do that unless we change fundamentally the nature of the private rental sector to the effect that those who get involved in the business of renting out property understand that this is not just something they can flit into and flit out of again, treat tenants with contempt, disregard the impact of their actions on tenants or leave them high and dry.</p><p>It speaks for itself.  I do not see why renovation or substantial refurbishment should be a ground for eviction.  I refer to the example I am familiar with, as it is staring me in the face every day across the road from my constituency clinic on Main Street, D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  This is a loophole speculators and property investors are constantly trying to utilise.  We need to close it down.  If someone needs to renovate a place, it does not mean the tenants have to leave.  They can be housed somewhere else for a while.  Indeed, one of the points we made when they were trying to evict tenants from that particular development was that they had a couple of empty places anyway and there was no reason they could not undertake the refurbishments and move tenants around as they did so within the same development.  That is what they should do.  Landlords need to have a responsibility to tenants and understand tenants have a right to long-term secure tenancies.</p></speech>

Getting in for capital appreciation and treating a second property as a pension fund is what leads to someone all of a sudden getting a notice to quit because the landlord has reached a particular time in his or her life.  Such volatility has damaged the rental sector in the past.  Moving to a more mature rental sector involves doing the kind of things that we are doing in this legislation.</p> <p>  This amendment is not about whether substantial refurbishment can be cited as a grounds for a notice to quit.  That is allowed and elsewhere in the Bill there is a good definition of that.  This is about when property has to be vacated because refurbishment works are being carried out and the amendment states that they will not have to pay rent in that circumstance.  That is an unnecessary provision to insert in section 16 of the Act.  That is for the landlord and the tenant to agree.  It is often the case that another form of accommodation is provided, if the tenant so wishes.  It also might be provided for a rent-free period as well.  If the parties cannot agree to a temporary vacation of the premises on such terms, there is a breakdown in the relationship and if the works are substantial according to the definition that we have in the Act, section 34 can be invoked.  I cannot accept this amendment.  In terms of the definition, there is a wider question around substantial refurbishment that we have not yet come to.</p></speech>

There should be measures to deal with that fact but there are not.  The people who have come in are simply looking to buy into the market, wait for property values to increase and sometimes use refurbishment as the way to drive up the value.  That is what they are doing.  I, again, cite the place across the road from my clinic.  That is exactly what they are doing.  As we speak, they are making substantial refurbishments to ten of those apartments.  That will drive up the value.  When the number of existing tenants in the occupied places drops to nine, I guarantee they will move to sell that place and to benefit from the capital appreciation.</p> <p>  On the amendment itself, we need to close off all loopholes that could lead to eviction at present and that is the logic of this.

This is for the purpose of the inclusion by amendment No. 177 as improper conduct by a landlord for the purposes of the new Part 7A of the Act, in section 18, of false or misleading citations of tenancy termination grounds in termination notices and failure to make re-letting offers where required to do so.

It is in line with comments I have made that the rental sector has to change and that only in exceptional circumstances should a landlord have the right to evict people.  People going into the business of renting property need to know in advance that it is going to be difficult and costly for them to evict people because of the impact that has on tenants, families and so on.</p></speech>

We have discussed both at length and I am not looking to open up the debate but just to make the case briefly.  The issue of vacant possession notice to quit is significant and everybody knows why.  Amendment No. 50 seeks to remove sale of property as a ground for issuing a termination notice.  At some point we have to move to a rental market where properties are rental properties just like in the commercial rental market.  While we should allow landlords to sell their properties, they should sell with the tenancy intact and as a going concern rather than the current situation.  The Minister has spoken on several occasions about the need to professionalise the landlord sector and move towards the kind of sector that exists in other European countries.  This is the norm in many of those countries in that kind of rental market and, therefore, it makes eminent sense.</p> <p>  Likewise, amendment No. 51 seeks to remove the use of a family member as a ground for termination of tenancy.  If a person has a rental property in a rental market, the notion that it is acceptable in the current climate to evict one family to house members of his or her extended family is problematic.  I understand where it comes from and I understand the consequences but these are both necessary as we professionalise and improve our rental market into the future.</p></speech>

In terms of the debate we have been having about vacant possession or tenants <i>in situ</i>and removing this part of the Bill, the advice I have received is that it is not constitutional.  Further advice I received was that, even if it were constitutional, it would not be retrospective so it would not protect people in existing tenancies.  That is the legal picture.</p><p>There are also significant risks from a policy point of view.  For example, we understand there would be a devaluing of the sale price of the property by between 20% and 30%.  If we were working in a pure market where one landlord is selling to the other because one is selling its rent roll to the other, that would all make sense but that is not happening in our market at the moment.  Given the recent history of the housing market, it could lower the sale price of that property by 20% or 30%, not the profit on the sale but the actual sale price of the property which, if someone is coming out of negative equity or trying to settle a debt with a lender, is in financial dire straits or needs the money for something very serious, would be an unfair attack on them.  Furthermore, also as a policy consideration, if we decided we did not care about that and were going to proceed no matter what harm it might to the do the individual selling the property, a new couple buying the home would have to serve a notice to quit.  What if the people do not leave in those circumstances?  This young couple is paying a mortgage that is no doubt very expensive and is also paying rent, not living in the property, and going through the stress of having to deal with what would then be an eviction, not a notice to quit.  Given those policy considerations, it is not a good idea.  I do believe, however, that many of the changes we are making to section 34 as a whole, which we did work on - the Taoiseach and I engaged on several occasions with the leading NGOs - will strengthen protection for tenants and make an impact.

Given that the restriction applies to commercial rentals, it has to be legally possible, whether retrospectively or not, to apply the same rule to new tenancies.</p> <p>  On the issue of the impact, it is not that I do not care about the impact on the property owner but, to use a phrase that the Minister and his predecessor always like to use, we need to strike a balance between the rights of the landlord and those of the tenant.</p> <p>  Vacant possession and notice to quit are the leading forms of family homelessness.  They account for 70% according to Focus Ireland, less according to the RTB so there is another side to this equation of what happens to those families.  There is also a significant cost to the State because if a family spends between six and 24 months, or more, in emergency accommodation that costs.  While I understand the argument about the loss, whether as a percentage of the profits or of the overall value of the house, there is also a loss to the taxpayer from not taking action, whether this or something else.  </p> <p>  I know I am not going to convince the Minister to change his mind.  There is nothing bar an extension of the notice period, which we will come to later, for those families currently subject to vacant possession or notice to quit and I urge him, as I did during the Second Stage debate on our legislation, to consider that issue.  He is engaging with the NGOs to find some way to tackle the issue of reducing the flow of families into homelessness.</p><p>I urge the Minister to look at that issue, as I did during the Second Stage debate on our legislation.  I know he is engaging with the NGOs to find some way of reducing the flow of families into homelessness.  If he rejects this provision, there is an onus on him to bring something else forward.  If he does and it is positive, he will certainty receive the support of Sinn F&eacute;in.  Of itself, extending the notice period will not protect those families who either have a vacant possession notice to quit today or will imminently get one.  I accept that it gives them a little more time to find a place, but it does not stem the flow of families into the homeless system or into being at risk of homelessness. </p></speech>

This will have a consequence for the market that could be even more detrimental and cause a further flight of landlords.  I have problems with institutional landlords, particularly with some of the funds and banks that have entered the market.  A Minister for Justice and Equality in the previous Government, Mr. Alan Shatter, passed the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 and made a commitment to examine the requirement for vacant possession, particularly in instances where investment properties were taken over by banks or lenders.  That is a big issue for people.</p> <p>  The Central Bank, in its report for the final quarter of 2018, indicated that approximately 15,000 mortgages were in grave difficulty and could reach the point where banks and institutions would move on them.  In some circumstances, these institutions serve notices to quit and then rent out the properties again to newer tenants.  They put them back on the market.  The suggestion of Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Boyd Barrett, to simply ban any sale of a property unless it is sold with a tenant, would not work.  Most people know it would not work, as was proven in the Committee Stage debates on the Anti-Evictions Bill 2018.  Having said that, the Deputies have highlighted that this is a real issue, as has my party.  Does the Minister envisage an alternative approach being taken, albeit not as part of this Bill?  What is his view on that?  Most people who fall into homelessness do so via the private rental sector.  We moved an amendment to a previous Bill which would oblige a financial institution to take on the roles and responsibilities of a landlord once it takes over a residential investment property.  That is a tack that could be taken.</p></speech>

I will start with the last point.  In our engagements with this committee, non-governmental organisations and others we try to see if a targeted intervention could make a difference.  On refinement, the NGO amendment focused solely on institutional investors.  That captures buy-to-let properties and, as we know, the buy-to-let market is not like a traditional institutional investor market in this country, for reasons I will not go into.  Constitutionally, that was regarded as an unjust attack on a subset of people to address a wider societal problem, one with far greater complexity than might be captured in just one change or an imposition on just one subgroup.</p> <p>  On institutional investors and vacant possession, in cases where these investors have obtained vacant possession, we are trying to get those properties before they go to the market and bring them into the social housing stock.  That is being led by the Housing Agency, working with various lenders.  There is a rolling fund that allows for that approach.</p> <p>  Going back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, I note there are much longer-term leases in the commercial sector.  Notices to quit cannot break a lease agreement.  If a tenant enters into a five-year lease with a landlord, a notice to quit served because a family member wants to live in the property cannot break that lease.  We do not have long leases in the residential sector because, in my view, there is no taxation structure that incentivises them.  There is such a structure on the commercial side.  I would like to have a taxation system that incentivises longer-term leases.  That would provide greater security for tenants without risking a flight of providers of rental accommodation from the market.  These are other matters that we are considering.</p> <p>  I do not wish to get into a Second Stage debate on these issues.  However, there is a correlation between the number of people entering homelessness or emergency accommodation from the private rental sector and the reasons given.  We are trying to establish the extent of that correlation because that also has an impact on legal advice and other matters.  That work is continuing.</p></speech>

The one change I want to make to the Government's notice periods is to allow 90 days when the duration of tenancy is less than six months.  One would not need that in a normal rental market.  There have been a small number of cases wherein people have signed up to a rental agreement and something significant has happened, such as a vacant possession or a notice to quit under pressure from a bank and that family has 28 days to vacate.  That is why I propose 90 days.</p></speech>

I will give the example of people who are currently topping up with HAP payments, of whom there are a lot, and it will become increasingly an issue.  It seems to be semi-official policy now, because HAP limits are completely inadequate, that people are topping-up over and above what is provided by the HAP payment to meet the excessive rents that are being charged and that is unsustainable in many cases.  Many of those people are going to get themselves into difficulty despite their best efforts.</p> <p>  Some of the top-ups are in excess of what would legally be allowed, for example, for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to deduct from somebody's social welfare payment.  The top-ups are driving people into extreme poverty.  Somebody should not be evicted for being poor as a result of a dysfunctional market and the failures of Government policy.  This is a protection for people who genuinely cannot afford to pay, to prevent them being evicted.</p></speech>

A re-letting offer will now be required where a contract to sell the property is not entered into within nine months of the tenancy ending.  Under the existing provisions, a re-letting offer is required where occupation by the family member ceased within 12 months of the tenancy ending, on completion of refurbishment works and, if the dwelling was to be put to some other use, it becomes available for letting within a year of the tenancy ending.  These time periods were previously changed by amendment No. 40, which we discussed.  Re-letting offers are required where the tenant has provided and kept up to date their contact details, which is important for their being contactable by the landlord where the re-letting has to take place.</p> <p>  We have discussed the rest of the issues relating to this amendment because it relates back to amendments Nos. 40 and 41.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.1100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019041100002#OO00200"><p>I will speak on amendments Nos. 36 and 44 together, then Nos. 45 and 46 together and then on amendment No. 28 separately.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 36 and 44 deal with an anomaly in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 which allows for what is called the no reason eviction at the end of a four or six-year Part 4 tenancy.  Currently, all Part 4 tenancies in Ireland, which are most private tenancies, must be renewed after six years or four years if one is in the property before 2016.  Part 4 tenancies generally automatically continue and are considered rolling tenancies in terms of the amount of notice the landlord must give the tenant to vacate the property.  However, when a Part 4 period comes to an end there is a window for the landlord to evict a tenant for no reason under section 34(b), a power which amendment No. 44 deletes.  Rebuilding Ireland contains a commitment to move towards indefinite tenancies and our amendment simply places that in legislation.  The time for doing so is long past.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 refer to eviction due to sale of buy-to-let or investment properties.  It is simply unnecessary to allow eviction on the grounds of sale.  It should not be happening.  In European countries with established private rental sectors with strong security of tenure sale is not permitted as a ground to evict.  The same is even true in the UK, which has a similar private rented sector legislative structure to ours.  However, I am willing to withdraw those amendments and to table something similar on Report Stage.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 28 is not in this group.</p></speech>

It is the Government's policy to move to tenancies of indefinite duration.  As I outlined last year when I was bringing this Bill forward, that is one of the measures we wish to address in the next rent Bill.  It is also where we will be addressing the issue of receivership that we discussed with Deputy Boyd Barrett earlier.  Unfortunately, even if we felt this amendment captured it adequately and that there might be some room to consider it between now and Report Stage, it is far more complex than the amendment as drafted.  We need more time and that is why we have put it forth for the second Bill.  I cannot accept the proposal.</p></speech>

The Deputy was speaking in the Chamber earlier.  I stated previously that we were going to do a number of things in this Bill and a number of things in the next Bill.  We have added many things to this Bill and we did that on the basis of priority and what is needed now, such as in respect of extending rent pressure zones, closing down perceived loopholes and so forth.  I also stated that because of the way the amendments are grouped and the late stage at which we received them, I would be unable to accept them today but that I will examine certain amendments before Report Stage to see if we can accept them.  I made that commitment to Deputy Darragh O'Brien and with regard to one of the Deputy's earlier amendments in respect of deposits.  However, we will not be able to capture the complexity of what we must do in terms of tenancies of indefinite duration with an amendment from our side, which would be required if we were to do it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

It seeks to remove the exemption originally introduced in respect of new dwellings in the RPZ legislation, new properties on the market and so forth.

The expiry of the RPZ by virtue of amendment No. 33 will occur on 31 December 2021 so the application of the rent increase restrictions to these new lettings will be for a short period only and affect a maximum of two rent reviews.  Amendment No. 17 would achieve substantially the same outcome as amendment No. 16, but my amendment only applies to rent reviews because application to the initial rent setting for tenancy of the dwelling would require the letting be preceded by another tenancy which, by definition, is not the case.</p></speech>

In terms of the implication of the Minister's amendment for the rent review, obviously there is no rent review in the first setting of the rent so the mechanism for setting the rent is the market rent as per the RTB index for that type of property in that area.  The rent reviews, as per the rent pressure zones, would apply 12 months after the first rent is set.</p></speech>

What we had previously has been called a loophole, but it is not a loophole but how the law was designed in the first instance.  If somebody had a property that did not come under the RPZ because it was a new property, and this was put in place to encourage more investment and more building in the rental sector, not only would it not be captured by the RPZ in the first letting, as it was a first letting it would never be captured.  After seeing what is happening in the rental sector, I am of the view that we should be capturing these properties.  It is fair enough to come into the sector and set a rent at the market rate from the RTB indices, but after that in any future letting or a rent review it has to be in line with the RPZ provisions.  That was described as a loophole, but it was not.  It is how the law was written and we are closing that down.  It is a further strengthening of the RPZs.</p></speech>

I do not think that doing things to an apartment or other property that need to be done should justify massive rent increases.  Rents are not set at affordable levels and the Government is doing nothing to set them at affordable levels.  Other amendments of mine will deal with other aspects of the problem but we should not provide any mechanism for landlords to put up rents that are already excessive, extortionate and unaffordable.</p></speech>

If a landlord did a substantial refurbishment to their property they were able to cite that as grounds for getting outside the RPZ provisions.  People were concerned that this was being used for renovations and as an excuse to get people out so that they could jack up the rent and the RTB issued guidance to landlords so that landlords would know how not to break the law or breach rights.  This Bill brings forward a definition of substantial refurbishment and we are bringing forward an amendment to further improve the definition and make sure it is watertight.  We do not want to allow our rental stock to fall into disrepair over a number of years by giving no incentive for a landlord to invest in a property.  We do not want to stop people from improving their properties, such as by providing extra bedrooms to accommodate more people, by ensuring they will not get their money back for the investment they have made.  If a landlord spends &euro;30,000, &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 to convert a garage into an additional room, maybe a play room, a TV room or a bedroom, but the tenancy agreement states they can only increase rent by 4% in an RPZ, they should be able to step outside the RPZ provisions because they should certainly be able to charge extra rent for another person in the property.  We want to avoid unintended consequences that prevent or dissuade landlords from investing in their properties so that we keep stock up as time goes by.</p></speech>

If landlords do that they can put in an application to the RTB, signed off by a registered professional such as an architect or surveyor as to the extent of the work, and they can then increase the rent by more than 4%.  The work would necessitate a person vacating a property so it is something significant.</p></speech>

One should be that it goes to the top two categories and the other is that it should jump three points.

I believe they are doing this across the road from me at the moment.  I do not think there will be any substantial change to the size of the apartments in question but I am certain they are going to ask to go beyond the RPZ limits.  I would be highly surprised, however, if anything dramatic has changed but they might manage to get through these tests.</p></speech>

That was always our position and, while I liked the version in the original Bill on account of it being so restrictive, we have to deal with the amendments in front of us.</p> <p>  I have a couple of technical questions.  The criteria for an extension are straightforward and they seem sensible.  The creation of an extra room has to be within existing building regulations but one could imagine a person subdividing one room into two and, so long as the two rooms met the regulations for adequate room size, the work constituting substantial refurbishment, even though the financial cost of subdividing a room into two would not be very significant.  How can the Minister satisfy the committee that the provision cannot be abused?</p><p>I share Deputy Boyd Barrett's concern about the building energy rating, BER.  Anything that incentivises and pushes landlords to raise BERs is important.  It is a minimal cost to improve from the lowest grades.  If something is already at a high grade, going up a point or two might not necessarily cost a significant sum.  I like the principle of finding a mechanism but I am not sure what the Minister has is adequate.  I do not have a better option for him but it is something that he could look at between now and Report Stage.</p><p> This gets tricky when it relates to changes in internal layout.  What kind of guidance will be given to the RTB or to the local authority to make it clear what kinds of changes would fall within this proposal?  Likewise with adaptation works, it is a very general proposition.  If there are substantial renovation works to assist disability adaptability, that is really good but it could include a relatively minimal level of change, such as ramps and rails, which would raise a question.</p><p> All of these works we are talking about already enable landlords to write off the capital costs against their tax liabilities, albeit at 12.5% over a year.  I am not proposing this but I know that Deputy Casey had a good discussion with the Minister at a previous meeting about a financial threshold.  Working a financial threshold into legislation is very clumsy and I am not proposing that but I think for any of us to justify a threshold to excuse somebody from the rent pressure zones, it has to be over and above the ordinary renovations one would expect landlords to be doing, which they can write off against their tax liability anyway.</p><p> I am not opposed in principle to what the Minister is proposing but there is a lot of convincing to be done that what is currently in front of us is tight enough not to open up another area of abuse.  This will be more tricky to abuse than the current scheme but the questions I am asking are genuine in intent.</p></speech>

That allows scope for abuse.  It is very easy to fluctuate by two grades.  What measures has the Minister developed to ensure changing grades are monitored correctly and certified?  Will certification be overseen by the RTB alongside the SEAI?  I will discuss it later since amendment No. 28 addresses it but I ask the Minister to give further consideration to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.1156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019041100002#QQ00300"><p>Where a landlord seeks to invoke this exemption, the rent will not be treated as a small thing.  A number of different documents will have to be lodged to prove the landlord has done it.  I understand the concerns about whether a landlord might address just the BER or the layout.  A combination of three of the four factors I laid out would have to be accomplished, or a 25% extension to the floor space.  I understand the point about the BER jumping by two points.  What if a landlord was doing something significant that was not disability adaptation, but changed the layout, added an extra room and went up by a BER grade, but could not go up by three points because it might take the property beyond A1 or maybe to A1, which might not be seen as necessary and the landlord might not want to incur the costs?  If it were just two points on the BER scale, if it is coming from a low BER, simple insulation in the attic might address that and I would be concerned about it.</p> <p>  The RTB issued guidance about what it would consider to be a change of layout, renovation and such.  I will refer to that briefly.  When we talk about a change of layout or structural alteration, those include attic conversion, garage conversion, the change of a ground floor bedroom to improve the layout of a property and so on.  We are not talking about changing tiles on the floors but about the movement of walls to create rooms.  An example I gave earlier is turning a garage into living space, whether a bedroom, a playroom, a living room or even a kitchen.  That is significant work.  We talked about some of the investments that might be made to improve the BER.  Attic insulation is not very expensive but cavity wall or dry lining can be, as can external wall insulation.  Maybe the boiler, the pipework, the radiators or the cylinder are being replaced or maybe one is doing the windows and doors.  Those types of investment are expensive but we are not asking for them to be done on their own.  They have to meet three of the four criteria or a 25% extension.  They then have to have surveyors and architects sign off and give documentation to the RTB which will then adjudicate and state that the clause has been invoked in the right way.</p> <p>  We think it is a vast improvement on not having a definition.  We came with a definition because the committee looked for a definition.  In the conversations we have had at the committee about the previous definition, some of the problems we and others saw in the definition were highlighted, and we have now come with what we think is a more robust definition.</p></speech>

It may merit a little more thought and consideration of the detail on all sides.  We have to look at certain test cases.  One could go into that apartment block across the road from me to see what that company has put in for.  It would be interesting to see.  I am certain that what it is doing is to try to have a higher than 4% rent increase.  Judging from what I can see from the outside, there definitely will not be an increase in space.  We shall see whether that passes muster.  What we propose is a little tighter.</p></speech>

I am aware of what the Minister is proposing in amendment No. 25.  Requiring a minimum of two grades would not involve extensive change and a landlord could fluke an increase like that with very little change.  BER can even improve on its own since grading was different 12 years ago due to the intensity of fossil fuels in our energy system.  I ask the Minister to give it further consideration and strengthen it.  I think it is open to abuse.  I know amendment No. 25 is tied in with others.  I hope to get this right and am looking for this to be increased by at least three grades, to bring the dwelling to a minimum of a C1 rating.</p></speech>

I am informed that the Custom House is such a building and that one could never get it up to a C1 rating.  I am reluctant to tie it to a specific grade but we can look at whether we can have a requirement of three points if it is at a certain grade, or of two points if it is at another grade, and to have a gradient to it rather than a jump of two points each time.  I will look at that between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

That option is still there, and while I know the Minister said it could not work, the home incentive scheme has worked quite well, where a list of permitted enabling works is given and a financial minimum that can be spent is put on it.  Some of these works can be carried out without affecting the tenant, especially when it comes to the building energy rating, BER.  Many of us have lived in our homes when we have had major renovation works carried out and there was no issue.  By adding the financial limit to it, along with listing the works that are permitted, it simplifies it a bit.  We seem to get very technical in everything we are doing instead of saying that we can increase the energy efficiency, improve disability access, improve wiring and so on, but it must have a certain minimum value.  That was the general opinion I felt at the time, and while the Minister said it was not operational, the home incentive scheme has worked very well in the sense that every contractor who is doing it has to be tax compliant and they have to go through the processing, log it online, and away they go.  It is an option that we have put on the table and it could and should still be considered, although the Minister has other evidence from what I have.</p></speech>

The home incentive scheme is a bit different because it is a person's home, so perhaps there is a different incentive base working there.</p></speech>

Here we are very much falling down on the rules because a principles-based approach was too open to interpretation.  Where we came down with regard to the money issue was that it was more of a problem around verification, the potential to defraud, and that type of approach to it rather than the way we are going with it.  We did not progress it any further, therefore.  We looked at it but we came down in favour of our amendment.</p></speech>

That gives the potential for imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine up to &euro;4,000 or both.  If, after the summary conviction, the offence continues, a further offence is committed under the Residential Tenancies Acts on each day that such action or inaction continues.  The class E fine applies then for each of the further offences.  We believed that was proportional in using class A in the new section on obstruction of an RTB authorised officer's investigation and class B where an offence was committed under the new section 19 offences.</p></speech>

We are taking Dublin out of the picture.  There will be two new qualifying criteria.  The first is the greater Dublin area, excluding Dublin, plus the rest of the country to qualify in the greater Dublin area, and the second is the rest of the country, excluding the greater Dublin area, to qualify outside of the greater Dublin area.</p></speech>

I have seen data from the RTB and we also ran the numbers.  For a while now, the committee has been calling for a review of the qualifying criteria.  I have been engaged with the RTB on various pieces of work in that regard.  Each scenario threw up different results.  I wanted to come up with a change that was simple and would not confuse people such that both the landlord and tenant would know their rights.  This is the one we chose.  I do not have information with me on the likelihood of new areas qualifying but once Dublin is taken out of the equation, given how far ahead rent in the capital is, other areas start to come into RPZ designation quite quickly.  I do not have information on the numbers or the areas to hand.  I would not like to speculate on them.</p></speech>

If we get this legislation into law at the beginning of May, at some point in June the RTB will do the quarter 1 index for 2019 using the new criteria.</p></speech>

We have had some boundary changes, Cork being the most obvious.  Where a boundary has changed but the RPZ designation was made under the earlier LEA boundary, does that have an impact?  I accept the Minister might not be able to answer that question now.  It is an issue that came up recently in conversation with my Cork colleagues.  If he is not aware of the issue, perhaps he would have his officials examine it.</p></speech>

The Ceann Comhairle's office has made a decision that this would in some way add a charge to the Exchequer.  I reject that.  Rent transparency important.  We want a rent register.  In private session we discussed at length how we might be able to do this.  Most members were in agreement that it would be a help.  Certain GDPR issues were raised and the Attorney General raised some concerns.  I was surprised it was ruled out of order on the basis that it would involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.</p></speech>

On Report Stage, I will return to the issue of a rent transparency register.  We have discussed the issue of deposit protection, which is different.  We will get on to that because it is important.  The Minister was broadly supportive of it.  The issue was getting down to specific houses.  If it was 14 Main Street in Rush, people would know how much that is.  We were talking about a transparency register based on area.  I remain to be convinced on that.  I will retable amendments on that.  Even if it was a question of getting a report 12 months following the passage of the Bill, we cannot just give up on rent transparency.  It is important to ensure fairness within it.  It is good for tenants and landlords.  Much of these data are recorded by the RTB.  I will work on an amendment to table on Report Stage.</p></speech>

We have discussed it on a number of occasions.  I was hoping to get down to the individual property level.  We have gone back and forth to the Attorney General on this.  The advice is that we cannot go to the individual property level.  While we were investigating what amendment we could introduce to do it at a local area level, we think we have identified a separate Act where we might be able to get at this for a local electoral district area level.  We are working to see if we can do that.  It might not require an amendment on Report Stage at all.  We will get a chance to discuss it then in more detail.</p></speech>

Government amendment No. 84 technically amends the new section 148S of the Act, which is being inserted by section 18 of the Bill.  This is a technical amendment to legally provide territorial jurisdiction to the District Court for the purposes of making court orders to generally enforce compliance with the requirements of an authorised officer under the new RTB sanctioning regime.  Government Amendment No. 85 is a consequential technical amendment.  </p><p>The Government cannot support amendment No. 136, which proposes to delete the new section 148Z, which provides for a right to appeal a RTB sanction decision in the Circuit Court and that a RTB sanction decision must be confirmed by the Circuit Court, either on appeal under section 148AA or on foot of direct application, on notice to the landlord, for confirmation by the RTB under section 148AB.  The new section 148Z is a central legal requirement to enable the empowerment of the RTB to operate its new administrative sanction regime.  I accept that where court involvement is necessary, the courts process will add to the length of the overall sanctioning process but I am following the advices of the Attorney General on this important legal point.  It is important to point out that a decision to impose a sanction is not a given.  A decision maker can decide not to sanction and court involvement is not then required.  I do wish to stress that on the ground, court involvement need not delay redress for the tenant.  The decision on the nature of a sanction to be handed down takes into account the actions of a landlord after the RTB issues an investigation notice.</p><p>For example, under section 148AD in determining the nature of the sanction, the Circuit Court or decision-maker may have regard to, for example, whether the landlord acknowledges the improper conduct, the extent of any failure by the landlord to co-operate with the investigation, any steps taken by the landlord to remediate any loss suffered or costs incurred, the duration of the improper conduct, the recurrence, if any, of the improper conduct, the continuation of the improper conduct after the landlord has been notified of the investigation, the extent and timeliness of any steps to end the improper conduct, any steps taken to remedy the consequences of such conduct, and whether similar improper conduct occurred previously.  There is good scope at the earliest juncture for a landlord to acknowledge and stop the improper conduct and remedy the matter to hand.  The incentive is there to limit the sanction to be imposed.</p><p> I also wish to highlight that proceedings need not go all the way to confirmation by the court.  Landlords have a number of opportunities during the process.  For example, section 148W(3) provides that, where a landlord acknowledges improper conduct, the decision-maker shall on receipt of such acknowledgement determine what sanction, if any, is to be imposed.  This provision applies to both tenant complaint initiated and RTB own volition investigations.  Section 148X(4)(a) provides that the decision-maker may, if he or she is satisfied that improper conduct has occurred, impose a sanction on a landlord.  This is an enabling provision.  It does not follow that the decision-maker must impose a sanction, even if improper conduct has occurred.  The decision-maker must continue the sanctioning process only if he or she wants to impose a sanction.  Separately, 148X(4)(c) provides for complaints to be dismissed or for no further action to be taken if the decision-maker is satisfied that no improper conduct has taken place.  Section 148X(5) provides that where an acknowledgement by a landlord is received under 148W(3) as referenced above, the decision-maker may decide to impose a sanction on the landlord as he or she thinks fit in the circumstances of the case.  This implies that the decision-maker is not obliged to impose a sanction.  Under 148Z(2), the decision to impose a sanction requires a Circuit Court confirmation.  The Bill does not provide for court confirmation, however, if the decision is to impose no sanction.  Circuit Court confirmation is legally required to publish the detail of any sanction and to give effect to any sanction.</p><p> I will also be moving amendment No. 145 to provide technically territorial jurisdiction to the Circuit Court for the purposes of an appeal by a landlord under section 148AA(1) of a sanction imposed.</p><p> The Government cannot support amendment No. 146, which proposes the deletion of the new section 148AB requiring the RTB to apply to the Circuit Court to confirm its sanctioning decision.</p><p> I will also be moving amendment No. 150, which concerns the granting of territorial jurisdiction to the Circuit Court to deal with applications made by the RTB under section 148AB(1) and related matters.  Again, this is a legal necessity for the operation of the new RTB administrative sanctioning regime.</p><p> Section 168 of Act of 2004 will be amended by amendment No. 175, which inserts a new paragraph (da) into subsection (2) of that section 168.  Subsection (2) of section 168 lists the categories of person to whom a section 168 indemnification can be applied by the RTB.  Amendment No. 175 includes authorised officers and a decision-maker appointed for the purposes of the new RTB sanctioning regime in the list of indemnified persons.</p><p> All of the amendments speak to the new sanctioning regime, how it is to be applied, the role of the Circuit Court in that regime, and the different points in time at which the process can come to an end.  The decision-maker may decide that there is nothing to put forward because there was no breach or because the reason the sanction was imposed either has been remediated or compensation has been made to the aggrieved party or both.</p></speech>

There were concerns that the timeline of the new process, at its very longest, could be excessively long.  The Minister said he would look at it to see if there was some way of shortening it.  In terms of the amendments tabled here, is it the view of the Minister that those amendments assist us in any way or provide for those concerns?  There was also a concern around the new role of the decision-maker and whether it would lengthen the time required to make a decision.  A suggestion made by a number of members was that decisions on sanctions below a certain amount could be made by the chief executive rather than the decision-maker, or that the decision-maker could make sanctions of a higher order.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 136, which I tabled, contains a drafting error.  I must have had some help from Deputy Darragh O'Brien on that one.  I did not intend to remove the right to appeal to the court, rather I wanted to remove the court confirmation.  I will withdraw the amendment, but I will return the amendment at a later stage on the matter of the court confirmation.  I still hold the view I held at our previous discussion, which is that court confirmation adds a cost and unnecessary delay.  The right to appeal to the court is sufficient, and we will return to that matter on Report Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.1369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019041100002#WW00300"><p>We discussed this at length previously.  The confirmation of the court cannot be removed if the ultimate outcome is going to be a sanction and the publication of the sanction.  Where there is no compliance or acceptance by the landlord, for example, where he or she has acted offside in some way and does not accept that he or she has acted poorly and wants to take it all the way, it has to go to court.  We looked at this matter with the Attorney General, and it has to stand.  It has to be there at the end of the process if we want to impose the sanction and publish the details.  However, there is an official sanction, which involves going all the way through the process before sanctioning, but the voluntary acceptance of a type of sanction is also possible and can happen at a much earlier date.  When we discussed this previously, it was not clear if, once this investigation had begun, the only way to come to a conclusion that satisfied all parties was to go through the entire process and end up in court.  There are three or four instances in which the process will end based on different outcomes from the investigation.  Mediation is now available in the first 60 days as a possible outcome as part of this regime.  Both parties can be brought together and a solution can be reached which both are happy with.  Another potential ending is if the complaint is not valid, meaning that one would not have to go to the court.  Landlords were worried that they would have to go all the way to court to confirm that a complaint was not valid, but that is not the case.  The landlord, under section 148 and the different subsections I set out, can acknowledge that he or she is in the wrong.  In that case there is no official sanction but there will be some sort of remedy if it is done within the first 40 to 66 or 70 days.</p> <p>  If the aggrieved party, for example, the landlord, decides that he or she wants to go further, there is then the possibility of an oral hearing with the investigation report having been given by the authorised officer to the aggrieved party.  A decision might be made then that there has been no improper conduct and that there will be no sanction.  Alternatively, there could still be a settlement if the parties wanted to take that route and such a solution was acceptable to all parties.  Once we go beyond that point, resolution could potentially take some time.  That is a long way of answering the Deputy's question.  We have found ways in which participants can step out of this process at an early stage.  However, if someone refuses to accept that he or she has a liability and one wants to pursue a formal sanction and publication, we will have to go through the Circuit Court confirmation process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.1370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019041100002#WW00400"><p>The shorter processes might involve something like a landlord who is in breach of the rent pressure zones legislation.  If he or she owns up to that and accepts the sanction, he or she can do that.  It is within his or her gift.  The RTB pointed out to us that the real value for it of the new investigative and sanction powers is that if someone is breaching the rent pressure zone legislation, it will be able to move on it very quickly, take the case and win it.  If the landlord drags the process out to the end, its concern is that, given the timelines provided in the original Bill, that process would be significantly longer than the standard process for a comparable adjudication and fine.  The RTB expressed concern about that.  Is it fair to say that, in a case where a landlord is unwilling to accept fault, there is a likelihood that the RTB's concern is a valid one and that some of those cases may take longer than would ordinarily be the case under the current regime?</p> <p>  I am still not completely clear about the court confirmation aspect.  The RTB, in its determinations today, can make sanctions and publish those determinations, including the details of landlords.</p><p>The sanctions can be very high.  For example, in the case of third-party antisocial behaviour complaints, they are in the tens of thousands of euro.  When we last spoke, the Minister said what is different about this process is that the RTB is doing the investigation, and that is the reason for the sanction.  If we look at the determination process of third-party complaints for antisocial behaviour, the adjudicator is doing an investigation and then making a recommendation to the board.  I accept the two parties get to present and dispute the facts, and all of that.  Obviously, I do not have the benefit of the Attorney General's advice but, essentially, I do not see how the process of this investigation and sanction regime is substantively different from existing adjudications, fines and publications in a way that would warrant this to have a court confirmation where those other determinations and very significant financial fines and publication of details do not warrant court confirmation.  I am not trying to be awkward.  I am genuinely not clear on this. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.1372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2019041100002#XX00200"><p>To be clear, I met the RTB specifically on this issue and we went through it.  If we were to take a worst-case scenario on timelines, where it would be necessary to go through the full court confirmation process to level a sanction on someone who was not accepting a liability, then some of those fears of the RTB may be realised in terms of the length of time.  Following that meeting, I went back to the Attorney General and the legal advices to see how we could come at this in a better way so there is not that fear of those lengthy time periods.  What is an improvement in terms of the understanding is there are points at which a person can step out for things like mediation or where a person accepts improper conduct, but it has to be accepted.</p> <p>  As it was explained to me, the reason the threshold seems to be high, in terms of having to get Circuit Court confirmation, is because of a combination of the powers that have been granted, whereby the RTB can investigate and can initiate an investigation itself and the sanctioning, which can potentially total &euro;30,000, is higher than what is awarded in other examples under the existing process.  That combination of factors warrants the involvement of the Circuit Court and we have not been able to get around that.  What we would hope is that given the clarity we have provided in law in this Bill, the excuses a landlord might be able to give such as "I did not know" and so on, fall away because so many things are being tightened or better defined in this legislation.  We also think that, given the power the RTB will have to deal with this and the amount of money that can be levelled, this will be a deterrent and that landlords will be, if not coerced, then induced to admit liability because it can be so clearly proven by an investigating officer because of the legislation but also because we have these officers coming in on foot of the legislation.  It remains the case that where a landlord is in breach and the RTB has chosen to pursue, the Circuit Court has to be there. </p></speech>

In order to sanction and to publish, the court confirmation has to be there.</p></speech>

It would affect the Title because it would be a substantial provision in the Bill.  There is a big problem with new tenancies and the setting of their rents which neither current nor proposed legislation deals with.  For a brand new tenancy the rent can be set at any level at all.  We can see that rents are being set at extortionate levels.  There was a place in the docks where they were talking about charging &euro;3,300 a month.  Something has to be done about that.</p> <p>  I am not sure why my amendment was ruled out of order but I will check with the Bills Office.  I am not challenging that decision but the proposal was that the RTB should set rents for new tenancies, that affordability should be a factor in setting them, and that the Minister should provide guidelines as to how that might be done in consultation with this committee.  One of the reasons RPZs are not limiting rents to the extent that the Minister or we might want is that new tenancies are being created all the time.  The more building there is, the more will be created and landlords are totally free to set rents at whatever level they like.  Something has to be done about that but nothing is being done about it.</p></speech>

The Irish Association of Pension Funds, IAPF, represents pension savers with an aim of ensuring pensions in Ireland are secure, fair and simple.  We are a not-for-profit membership organisation.  Our members are pension schemes set up by employers for their employees, and companies that provide services to those schemes.  The services we provide for our members are representation, education, and information.  In terms of the Bill we are looking at today, we have advocated for some form of debt on employer legislation for quite some time, with correspondence on the issue with the Department as far back as 2008.  In a joint paper with the Society of Actuaries in Ireland, submitted in December 2008, we advocated for some form of debt on employers in order to provide greater security for members of pension schemes, discourage employers from abandoning pension schemes, and to provide greater flexibility in the ongoing funding of schemes.</p> <p>  Since 2008, there has been a significant decline in the number of defined benefit schemes and the number of active members, which are employees who are continuing to accrue benefits within those schemes.  As a result of funding issues, many schemes have restructured, often reducing members' benefits and also requiring increased funding from employers.  According to the most recent figures from the Pensions Authority, 126 of 611 defined benefit schemes did not meet the minimum funding standard.  However, in total, the aggregate assets of defined benefit schemes, at &euro;64.1 billion, were higher than the total aggregate liabilities, which were &euro;59 billion.  Schemes that do not meet the minimum funding standard are required to put a funding proposal in place, which is designed to get the schemes back to meeting the standard.  The proposal has to be agreed by the trustees, the employer, and the actuary to the scheme.  If the proposal is for a period longer than three years, it also has to be agreed by the regulator, the Pensions Authority. </p> <p>  Defined benefit provision is declining worldwide for many reasons, including cost and fluctuation of cost, accounting practices and changes in work practices.  Ireland is no different in this respect.  That has been reflected in the decline in the number of schemes and active members of schemes, with just over 100,000 active members of private sector defined benefit schemes today.  A concern often raised with this type of legislation, which imposes a contingent debt on employers, is that it may precipitate the closure of schemes in order to avoid its impact.  However, schemes have had plenty of opportunities to close or wind up in recent years, and this legislation has now been under consideration for two years with no evidence of that happening.  It could be argued that the schemes that now remain, therefore, have already decided they are in it for the long term.  It should also be remembered that the rules of the scheme may give trustees the power to request contributions from the employer in a wind-up situation which may have the opportunity to bring funding above the minimum funding standard level. </p></speech>

I know he has time constraints so we will not delay him unduly.  I want to ask a few questions on the documentation we received from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  One of the objections it raised was on wind-ups being delayed as a result of this legislation.  It made a few comments on that, but Mr. Moriarty has already answered the point very effectively about people being forced to wind up.  This has been talked about for the past two years and that has not been reflected.  One of the issues mentioned was that it might disproportionately affect younger members of the scheme, because the scheme would continue while the wind-up was postponed and the retired members would continue to get their entitlements, which might increase the deficit to the ultimate detriment of younger members.  I would like to hear Mr. Moriarty's comments on that.</p> <p>  The Oireachtas report also states that there might be some constitutional difficulties about the legislation being possibly retrospective, and it goes on to say that it might force people to wind up before the legislation comes into effect, which seems to be contradictory.  It also mentions that a law like this might put some employers at a competitive disadvantage, and that it might drive some companies into insolvency.  Question were also raised about the first section of the Bill, which deals with appeals, and I might have to modify that, because I do not think I got what I wanted to get, now that I read the section again.  Perhaps Mr. Moriarty could comment on those issues.</p></speech>

It is no longer the sort of cliff edge where there was a huge difference in the value of one's benefits the day before retirement and the day after.  Possibly for some schemes, it may make a difference if there is a member in the scheme who has very large benefits, and there are only a small number of members, but overall I would not see that as a huge issue, unless it is a really long delay where the whole structure of the scheme is fundamentally altered.  I do not see that it could be a significant issue for the vast majority of schemes.</p><p> On the constitutional difficulties, the minimum funding standard was introduced by legislation after the Pensions Act came into effect in 1990.  There have been a lot of changes made to that to enhance members' benefits over time, such as preservation of benefits, where once someone has been in a scheme for two years, he or she is entitled to the value if it is kept as a deferred benefit.  There was a time when one could work up to just before retirement, leave the company and get all one's member contributions back.  More recently, there has been the introduction of a risk reserve, which has raised the funding requirements as well.  None of those issues, as I understand it, caused any constitutional difficulties, so I do not see how something like this could either.</p></speech>

All those changes affected pension schemes that were already in existence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.1485" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Moriarty" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019041100002#D00300"><p>Exactly.  I am not a lawyer, but when all those changes took place and there were no issues, I could not see why that was the case.  I touched on the forced wind up before it comes into effect.  As I said, this legislation has been discussed for the last two years, and there are other similar Bills.  There has been no experience of a rush to close schemes in that time.  I think that there have been a lot of opportunities for schemes, particularly when there were a lot of funding issues in the middle of an economic crisis.  If there was ever a time for a company to wind up a defined benefit scheme, that would have been it.  I think there is still a lot of employer goodwill towards defined benefit schemes, and a lot of the restructuring that has been done happened in conjunction with trade unions.  People have sat down together and reached solutions, so again, if that was going to happen we would have been seeing evidence of that over the last two years, and there certainly has been none of that.</p> <p>  Regarding the issue of putting employers at a competitive disadvantage, employers already have to account for defined benefit schemes within their balance sheets, so I am not sure that putting a contingent debt on the employers, from a balance sheet perspective, is going to make any significant difference for most employers.  It is already there, and is already accounted for in their books, so again, I do not see that as a huge problem.  As this is a contingent liability, it is only triggered, and only comes into effect, if the employer is trying to wind up a scheme that is not fully funded.  From an accounting perspective, it is not a real debt, and it is already in the balance sheet in some form anyway.</p></speech>

I realise that we might have to refine that section of the Bill because a solvent company be a company with a very slight excess of assets over liabilities and a pension deficit of &euro;1 billion.  It can be a very profitable company with a very small deficit.  I have tried to mitigate that by giving the Pensions Authority the right to allow people to pay a lesser sum up to 50%, or to pay it over a five year period with an appeal to the High Court, but that might need to be modified further because we do not want to drive companies into insolvency.  That is the last thing we want to do. Would Mr. Moriarty agree with that?</p></speech>

If there are any specific circumstances where that might be the case, or there is potential for that, I would certainly agree that should be looked at, because I do not think any employees are going to welcome a situation where they have better pensions but have lost their jobs as a result.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.1488" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019041100002#D00600"><p>Would Mr. Moriarty agree with our approach in asking the Pensions Authority to examine the minimum funding standard, or should we be asking somebody else to examine this thorny question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.1489" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Moriarty" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019041100002#D00700"><p>I would certainly agree that it should be examined.  I think the minimum funding standard looks at a snapshot picture in time, and it looks at what would happen if a scheme were to wind up at that time.  However, many companies and schemes will argue that they are in a good position, and there is no reason they should wind up at this particular point in time.  While they might have an issue in that, if they had to, they could not pay all the benefits at once, if they look out over the next 40 years when they are planning to pay benefits, they are perfectly fine from a cashflow perspective.  I can also understand from a regulatory perspective that because there are no protections which force employers to bring schemes up to full funding, and there is no pension protection fund, which would cover an insolvent employer situation, the regulator might be focused on protecting against that worst-case scenario because there are no other triggers and protections in place at the moment.  Certainly, if this type of legislation came into effect, which had that additional protection, I think that would give a very good opportunity to then re-examine the funding standard as it works.</p></speech>

I know there is a pension protection scheme in the UK but that is a totally different scenario, and a vastly bigger market.  Is there any scope for anything similar here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.1491" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Moriarty" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019041100002#D00900"><p>I think it would be difficult, just because of the small size of the market.  The danger is, because the market is very skewed as well, there are a very small number of very large defined benefit schemes, which would in effect just be paying for everybody else, like an insurance scheme.  It certainly merits being looked at.  I know it has been looked at before, but there is a lot more evidence now around how the protection fund works in the UK, and maybe that could be brought into the discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.1492" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019041100002#D01000"><p>I received correspondence this morning from somebody with an interest in this subject asking me about the institutions for occupational retirement provision, IORP II.  We have already had discussions with the Minister on this directive, and there seems to be some conflict about it, judging by the representations we are getting on all sides of the political divide.  Does the IAPF have a position on that or any views on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.1493" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Moriarty" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019041100002#D01100"><p>Not particularly.  I think the particular issues are for very small, self-directed schemes, which are mostly for company directors.  Our members tend to be more on the large employer schemes.  While the Government has been clear that the current IORP directive only applies to schemes of more than 100 members, the intention is to apply it to all schemes.  We certainly feel that should not happen, at least until there are suitable alternatives for those smaller schemes.  The regulator has been very clear that it wants greater consolidation of schemes, because we have too many small schemes.  I think this is a trigger to make that happen, if the governance requirements become so difficult that it forces schemes to do something else.  At the moment, those other options that are available are planned to be changed.  The regulator wants a new regime for regulating and authorising master trusts, which are multi-employer schemes, or one scheme with lots of employers in it, but those provisions are not in place yet.  We also know there are plans to introduce auto-enrolment, where all employers are going to have to put their employees into a pension scheme, and our concern is that, without either of those two options being on the table yet, if a lot of additional requirements are forced on smaller schemes, employers are just going to stop doing anything.  We feel that would be a mistake.  Until that is in place, the derogation should continue to apply to smaller schemes.</p></speech>

Is there a significant cost involved in regularising that and increasing that percentage?</p></speech>

All those schemes would be on funding proposals, and because of the aggregate figures I gave, where there are more assets than liabilities, for the system as a whole I think it is fair to say most of the schemes that do not currently meet the standard are probably pretty close to getting there.  A lot of them would have put in ten year funding plans eight or nine years ago, so they are coming to the end of that.  A lot of the schemes would probably have done a combination of things in an effort to get back to full funding, such as reducing some of the benefits within the scheme.  Quite often what schemes would do is take out any future promised increases or change retirement ages, which increases the overall funding position, but it will also involve additional contributions from employers, and often from employees as well.  There would be a lot of pain in terms of getting back to that full funding position.</p></speech>

I take it that it is a global figure.  For companies that are in a position where they may have to get back to a particular level and where there is employer input, is there a risk this would make such companies less competitive in the marketplace for whatever activity in which they are involved?  Do we have any figures to underpin that?  While Mr. Moriarty clearly said that many of these companies may be near, the question is how near.  Do we have statistical data on the range of companies?</p></speech>

The lady who emailed me this morning gave me a figure for the total deficit of the 126 companies that have not registered of &euro;1.8 billion, which means the other 80% of companies must be at &euro;1.8 billion plus the difference, which is &euro;5.1 billion.</p></speech>

I acknowledge what Deputy O'Dea is saying in terms of the global figure.  If one is introducing a mechanism, it is necessary to ensure there are not unintended consequences whereby a particular company may lose competitive advantage in trying to meet the employer contributions.</p></speech>

However, that is one of the things they sign up for when they have a defined benefit scheme in place, namely, there is going to be a fluctuation in cost.  For companies that go to the other side and go back into surplus, the contributions will start to reduce over time.  Certainly, companies are probably spending more than they would have planned.  The whole idea of the restructuring plan or funding plan that gets put in place is that it is signed off and agreed on between the company and the trustees, and also the regulator if is for longer than three years.  There is quite a bit of toing and froing in the negotiations that go on so everybody can come out with a figure they are comfortable with and can live within.  Companies have to look at, first, what they can afford and, second, what they want to pay, and try to get the right balance between them.</p></speech>

The point I would make is that it concerns the cost base and competitiveness of a company with a defined benefit scheme versus a company which is trading against the first company but which does not have that scheme.</p></speech>

Those companies would have had the opportunity to close those schemes down.  Many of them feel strongly that, as part of the overall benefit structure they offer to employees, it is important enough to continue to offer that.  I take the point.  There are many other things they would prefer to be spending the money on in terms of making the company more competitive.</p></speech>

For example, it talks about a situation where if a company decides to wind up a plan, it is the trustees who, technically, will have to wind up the plan.  Generally, if the company tells the trustees it is going to stop paying contributions, the trustees are forced into winding it up at that stage.  However, I am guessing those technical issues can be picked up on.  Where categories of members feel they are being treated inequitably, I am not sure about that in some ways because-----</p></speech>

This is in response to the many representations we have had from company pensioners that they have no input and no part in the negotiations, and they are simply communicated with to say that, as part of the restructuring, the company is going to unilaterally reduce their pension, refuse to pay them cost of living increases or whatever.  They simply want an input into that, which is what I was trying to achieve.</p></speech>

I understand the point because I hear a lot of those arguments.  I suppose pensioners feel a bit left out because trade unions negotiate on the part of current employees and deferred pensioners and people who have left the company probably do not get a lot of say and, other than the fact they are communicated with and have the right to respond to that communication but then, things can move on.  It is probably more a question for the Pensions Authority as to what it can do and what the output that would be.  I better understand the context now.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Billy Hannigan, national secretary at F&oacute;rsa.</p> <p>  Congress is the largest civil society organisation on the island of Ireland, representing in excess of 700,000 workers across the economy.  Congress has been to the fore in highlighting the serious need for radical reform in the area of second-tier pension provision.  That is not least because fewer than half of all workers have an occupational or private pension to supplement their State pension.  A total of 90% of public sector workers do, compared with one in three workers in the private sector.</p> <p>  As the State pension is paid at a flat rate rather than being earnings related, workers without a supplementary pension are exposed to a significant drop in their living standards in old age.  Congress represents the great majority of members of defined benefit pension schemes.  Most DB schemes were first established in the collective bargaining process, with trade unions and employers agreeing the terms, rules and benefits of the schemes.  With pension assets plummeting due to the international financial crisis, many DB schemes, already under pressure, fell further into deficit from 2008.  Today, more than 90% of DB plans are closed to new entrants.  However, while in decline, approximately 102,000 pensioners, 111,000 active members and 415,000 deferred members draw, or will draw, retirement income from DB pension schemes.  As such, the DB sector, with assets under management of more than &euro;62 billion, remains a very important part of pension provision.</p> <p>  Congress has played a leading role in the attempts to rescue the DB system from the sustainability challenges it faces. We have done that in two ways: first, by negotiating the restructuring of individual schemes and, second, by engaging with the Government to strengthen regulation and oversight so that there is greater protection for workers who are members of private pension schemes.  We had several meeting with the former Minister for Social Protection, now Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and we had a general understanding that he was well disposed to legal protection to limit, where possible, DB scheme closures.</p> <p>  The publication of the heads of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 confirmed that in several ways: by requiring employers to put forward funding proposals within six months of the actuarial funding certificate, by obliging employers sponsoring DB schemes, whether in deficit or not, to give 12 months' notice of their intention to cease contributions, and by enabling the Pensions Authority to determine a schedule of contributions that will restore to solvency DB schemes which do not meet the funding standing or reserve in circumstances where the employer has failed to engage with the trustees to develop and agree a funding proposal.  To date, however, the Government has failed to legislate for these measures.</p> <p>  In February of last year, the Government published an ambitious five-year plan for pension reform, covering the entire pension landscape.  One of the roadmap's six strands focuses exclusively on improving protection for DB pension schemes in the form of more effective regulatory oversight and transparency.  Disappointingly, the action deadlines set out in the roadmap have been missed.</p> <p>  Congress therefore welcomes the committee's scrutiny of Deputy O'Dea&rsquo;s Bill and the issues it highlights.  In short, as the committee will be aware, this Bill aims to protect DB scheme members against the risk of employers winding up a scheme.  It proposes to provide an appeals mechanism for members where a scheme is being wound up by the trustees and to make it illegal for a solvent company to wind up a scheme in deficit without consent.  The Bill also proposes to give new powers to the Pensions Authority.</p> <p>  This Bill, together with the roadmap, makes clear that there is political consensus that stronger regulation is required to support DB pension schemes and to protect the interests of members of the schemes.  A key weakness with the current regulatory regime is that there are no safeguards to prevent an employer unilaterally deciding to cease making contributions to a scheme or otherwise trigger the wind-up of a scheme.  The consequential unfairness of that has been crystallised in a number of high-profile cases where financially secure employers announced their intention to withdraw their support from a DB pension, putting the pension benefits of members in jeopardy.</p> <p>  Congress is aware of some employers' concern that a rebalancing of the regulation of DB schemes will result in a deterioration in the financial standing of firms operating such schemes.  We do not accept that it is an inevitable consequence.  The purpose of what the Government has proposed and what is proposed in this Bill is to ensure that employers are required to enter into discussions with the trustees to address funding issues where they arise.  It is the view of congress that this is entirely reasonable.</p> <p>  Congress sees the scrutiny of this Bill as an opportunity to deliver on the political consensus that stronger regulation of DB pension schemes is required so that the hundreds of thousands of active, deferred and retired members of DB pension schemes can rest assured that their interests are protected and that they will get to enjoy the benefits they have accrued over their working lives.  I thank members for their attention.  We are happy to take questions.</p></speech>

I will let each member ask a number of questions and either witness can feel free to respond.  I remind members that this is not a general chat about pensions.  It is specifically to scrutinise the provisions in Deputy O'Dea&rsquo;s Bill and I ask that the questions would be formulated in that regard.</p></speech>

Dr. Bambrick rightly said the Government's proposals have yet to be legislated for.  Having studied an outline of those proposals, I understand they do not add much to the existing protections.  There is much talk about extra consultation but no compulsion.  We are proposing something stronger involving compulsion.  The unpaid amount of the deficit will be a debt on the company etc.</p> <p>  While in the case of a wind-up where there is a statutory provision for distribution of assets, my original intention in drafting section 1 was to provide for cases where there is a reorganisation and benefits are reduced across the board.  At the moment in cases of a reorganisation there is a certain amount of discretion.  I have received representations saying that pensioners have no say in that even though they are often one of the parties adversely affected.  I want to ensure that provided a majority of the overall membership is in favour of looking at what is proposed by the trustees by way of reduction of benefits in the case of a reorganisation, there would be some appeal mechanism which includes pensioners.  I may not have taken the most elegant route to reach that conclusion, but we can redraft it.</p> <p>  The Department analysis suggests that something along the lines of what we are proposing would be a disadvantage to younger members because in the case of a scheme which is eventually closed down, if the closure is delayed the present beneficiaries can continue to receive their benefits thereby increasing the overall deficit and this would adversely affect younger members.</p> <p>  We also need to guard against driving companies into insolvency.  I have tried to do that to the best of my limited ability by allowing for a lesser payment but not less than 50% or having it payable over a five-year period with ultimately an appeal to the High Court.  Perhaps we could be more flexible there.  Solvency can range from cases where the assets barely exceed the liabilities to very wealthy companies.  A pension deficit can be anything from &euro;50,000 to &euro;1 billion or &euro;2 billion.  We need to get that balance right.</p> <p>  It has also been mentioned that a proposal such as this would put companies at a competitive disadvantage.  They seem to be the main issues raised.  I would appreciate ICTU's comments on those.</p></speech>

Since this legislation was last in the House and since the Social Welfare Bill 2017 coming from Government, we have seen movement towards auto-enrolment albeit that other milestones are being missed.  Members will agree there is momentum towards auto-enrolment that did not exist in 2017 when this legislation and the other legislation were introduced.</p> <p>  While auto-enrolment will not remove the incentive and the unfair competition, it will seriously reduce it.  DB pension contributions will be much higher than what is likely to be required by auto-enrolment.  While there is no current legal obligation for companies to provide a pension, that will soon be addressed.  On competitive disadvantage, auto-enrolment will even the playing field because we would regard most employers with a DB scheme as good employers.  We share the concern that nothing should be done to put those jobs at risk.  While we are eager to have this protection for members of DB schemes, we also want to protect the viability of those jobs.  Therefore we are not requesting anything we feel would jeopardise that.</p></speech>

In referencing them I believe my colleague was simply saying there appears to be a degree of consensus that something needs to be done and that employers must have some obligations not to simply shut down schemes.  There might be some divergence between the current Bill and the intentions behind the original Government proposals.</p> <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform is a clear statement by Government that something needs to be done.  That was the reference Dr. Bambrick made in her contribution.  Whether it is done through this Bill, an amendment of this Bill or a combination of the two efforts, something needs to be done.</p></speech>

Unfortunately there is no Harry Potter solution to that.  There is a potential for conflict in trying to protect somebody's benefit that is due to become payable in 30 years and Billy's benefit that might become payable in six years.</p></speech>

I have been a young contributor to schemes and have left organisations before benefiting from them.  It is very important that younger employees can have a level of trust in their pension scheme and trust in their employers.  If they see their older colleagues being treated poorly or having their schemes withdrawn, it will make many younger employees question the trust in the relationship they have.  There is an element of trust in pension schemes, including defined benefit schemes, especially trust in the idea of employees of one company engaging collectively with the scheme, which is probably equally important.</p> <p>  We have referred to the danger of people closing schemes because legislation is coming.  I tabled amendments to the Social Welfare Bill 2016 on Report Stage in the Seanad.  Of course, if they had been agreed, it could have been law within ten days.  I know this committee expedited looking at this issue back in 2017 when we did a legal review of that area in the hope that change could have been introduced in the summer of 2017.  It is unfortunate that we have lost two years on the matter.</p> <p>  The Bill makes reference to a number of time periods.  I know that Deputy O'Dea is considering a five-year time period.  I like the way the Bill does not simply take a snapshot of a company's finances.</p><p>Instead of simply looking at a snapshot of the company right now, it considers whether the company has the capacity to restore itself in the next five years.  That avoids the danger of an outlier moment of artificial depression in company finances perhaps being used to justify the infeasibility of a scheme as a longer period is under examination.  Dr. Bambrick might comment on how that could be used effectively.  There may be scope in terms of members making an appeal.  That also might need a time period because we want to ensure it is not just a technical opportunity for members to lodge an appeal over a bank holiday weekend or something.  Unfortunately, we have seen circumstances where very short notice periods were applied but we would like to ensure there is a reasonable period of notice in this regard.</p><p> Will Dr. Bambrick refer to the auto-enrolment schemes?  Is there potential in the Bill or in complementary legislation to deal with situations where companies may wish to move from a defined benefit, DB, scheme to an auto-enrolment scheme?  I mean where companies are bringing in auto-enrolment schemes for their new, current or young employees but have a defined benefit scheme for others.  Will Dr. Bambrick outline what she thinks good legislative practice might look like regarding that transition?  Let me give an example.  If I have been working for five or ten years and only have a certain number of defined benefit contributions that I have made and the scheme is winding up, do I carry that benefit or how does it work?  Does Dr. Bambrick have an outline of what good practice might look like?  Will the DB pension systems run parallel within companies or is there scope for the winding up of one scheme to segue into the other in a situation of transition that did not involve insolvency?  </p><p> A roadmap for pensions has been mentioned a number of times.  Without wanting to stray too far, with due respect to the Chair, what we are discussing concerns people who, in good faith have paid into a scheme over their lifetime and expected and planned for a certain level of security in their retirement.  Similarly, in relation to the roadmap for pensions, there are issues at present around the contributory pension which again, people have planned for contributed to and paid in to.  While the transition from 20 years to 30 years' contributions to qualify for the State pension had been signalled for ten years, I refer to the discussion that has taken place around the move to 40 years' contributions in order to qualify for the full State pension.  Might Dr. Bambrick see any parallels for those who have planned and contributed over their working life, only to suddenly find the goalposts moving in that regard?</p></speech>

The Senator referred to the total contributions, the move from yearly averaging to the total contributions method.  While we thought the original proposal was that 30 qualifying years would be required, we are now looking at 40 qualifying years.  Let me remind members that total contributions is due to come into effect in January 2020.  We are talking about it taking effect in eight months' time.  We have seen very little progress in that.  If that is going to be the new movement, people will have to be informed and know the situation.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has already received messages from people who are nearing retirement and want to know what number of contribution years they will require.  As for those with DB pensions, we think the real difficulty is in the move to the qualifying age with the pension, where in 2021, that is, in 18 months' time people will have to wait until they are 67 years to qualify for the pension.  Arguably anybody who has a defined benefit, DB, pension and is nearing retirement, will be able to start drawing it down from 65 years, if not earlier.  Those pensioners with DB pensions are possibly in the best of the worst-case scenario in that they will have their DB pension to bridge the time between their retirement and the State pension coming into effect.  We would argue that it is the qualifying age is causing the most difficulty for people, rather than the qualifying years of contributions.  People have now had to bridge an extra year, where they might not have a supplementary pension to help them and in 18 months' time, it will be a gap of two years.  With the total contributions approach, we are very surprised that we have not had clarity to date on that so that we would be expecting clarity very soon.</p></speech>

I think what the Minister has told us is that it is a matter for discussion and a debate.  Will Dr. Bambrick clarify the position of ICTU on the issue of the number of contributions and the issue of having at least a ten year lead in time, if the Government is going to increase the contributions requirement by ten years?  Will Dr. Bambrick comment on the increase from 30 years of contributions to 40 years of contributions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-11a.1527" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019041100002#L00400"><p>The position of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is that it should be 30 years and its reason for that is based on practicality.  Social insurance coverage was very late coming to Ireland because we did not industrialise until the 1970s.  While we had the requirement to pay social insurance from the mid-1960s, very few people in Ireland were working in insurable employment.  People who are coming into pension age will find it very difficult to have 40 years of contributions.  If one was self-employed, one did not need to pay a contribution until 1991.  If a self-employed person is due to retire next year in 2020, it is not possible for the person to have 40 years of contributions.  If one was working part-time, one only had to pay a social insurance contribution from 1988.  Some civil servants have not been required to pay the full social insurance contribution, so we cannot introduce a standard of 40 years of contributions when people who were in full-time or part-time employment were not required by the law of the land at the time to make a social insurance contribution.  Forty years is just not practical.  There are other reasons, such as the Senator suggested not giving people enough of a lead-in time, but that for us is the ultimate reason.  It is just too difficult for people to reach that goal.  It is unrealistic.  We have seen the difficulties the 2012 pensioners had but that will be small fry if we introduce a 40-year target in January of next year.  We would say that the qualifying age will be the bigger problem for people as the age of eligibility is being pushed out.</p> <p>  When making our submission to the Government on auto-enrolment, it was a concern and is a concern of ICTU that auto-enrolment will cause displacement with current occupational pensions.  For some pension schemes, where the contribution is less that the 6% employer contribution, that would be fine and it will bring people up.  Our fear would be that the recommended contribution would become a ceiling and not a floor, that employers would reduce their contribution down to the proposed 6% of salary, if that is what it is going to be.  Auto-enrolment would displace existing pensions by employers moving over or reducing the level of contribution if it is above the minimum.  Another possible fear is that auto-enrolment will displace current good occupational pensions and that these occupational pension schemes will be closed to new members and new members will be auto-enrolled into the State pension and existing workers would remain in the occupational scheme.  In our submission to Government on auto-enrolment, we ask that this area will be examined within the first year and in time after that to see if there is a displacement and if there is, that we will look towards the good practice Senator Higgins mentioned. </p> <p>  Timelines were mentioned.  We think it is really good, regardless of what they will be, that timelines will be introduced because the current legislation as it exists is that an employer can wake up on a morning and decide it no longer wishes to contribute to a DB scheme, which mostly has the effect of triggering the winding down of that scheme.  As there currently exists no timeline, the fear is that if employers see this legislation or other legislation gathering speed, it will accelerate the closure of those schemes.</p><p>They can already do that and this is the current legislation gap.  Timelines are really important and sponsoring employers are required to come up with a plan in a timely manner to engage.  There is room for negotiation on what those timelines should be but the inclusion of timelines is something we support.</p></speech>

It does not matter how temporary the crisis is, as a crisis, generally speaking, would not necessarily be visited on the shareholders of a company but rather the employees in a pension scheme.  Any piece of legislation that provides a degree of protection to workers in such circumstances must be welcomed.  With a defined benefit scheme, a person has with a degree of some certainty - insofar as we can have certainty over 30 or 40 years - to be able to plan for retirement and know what benefits he or she is likely to get when that person gets to 65 or whatever the provisions are in the pension scheme.  In defined contribution schemes, as we know, the only certainty is what is put into the scheme.  Workers have no idea what investment people are going to make with the money at the end of the day.  Where defined benefit schemes operate, they need protection.  This is particularly the case where an opportunity arises to take advantage of a crisis, no matter how temporary is that crisis.</p></speech>

The Minister told me it is now envisaged this would not be introduced until at least the second half of next year.  There is clearly consideration of the 40-year model versus the 30-year model.  As the committee knows, the 40-year period applies to the temporary arrangement for the post-2012 people.  We have strongly argued and made submissions to the Minister about why it should be 30 years for the proper system, which will go into place next year.  I hope we will be successful in that regard.  There is also another issue that has been brought to my attention and which will require a decision from the Government.  In order to qualify at all for a contributory pension, a person will have to meet 520 contributions paid in total.  That used to be 260 and this was unilaterally increased to 520 in 2012 but I do not know the reason behind that.</p> <p>  I take the point on auto-enrolment versus defined benefit pension schemes.  The Government proposals on auto-enrolment indicate that where companies have a pension scheme in place, members will not be automatically enrolled and it will be a choice for members.  There are a number of issues around that.  I take the point about increases if benefits are lower or people losing out.  We have made detailed submissions to the Government on that.  It invited different political parties to make submissions and we have done so.</p> <p>  I take Mr. Hannigan's point, which has not been sufficiently emphasised in all this debate.  It is the fundamental difference between defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.  Anybody who has paid into a defined contribution scheme would have seen investment wiped out during the recession because investment managers do not have some sort of hidden wisdom and get things wrong.  The auto-enrolment scheme is going to be a defined contribution scheme, which is the problem.  I put it to the Minister and I did not get a response but if there is a 2% payment by the State, with 6% coming from both the employer and employee, is it possible that the State contribution could be used to provide an element of defined benefit?  This could bring some certainty and people would not be hammered just because the guys who get the money to invest it make a hames of it, get it wrong or are unlucky.  Is it possible part of that funding could be used to give more certainty about a minimum floor?  I know the floor is already the contributory old-age pension but I would like to think there could be a second floor.  The Chairman can confirm that we debated the Estimates for social welfare recently.  The &euro;5 per week we gave last year cost the Government approximately &euro;80 million.  The fact that so many extra people joined the ranks of the pensioners cost the Government three times that sum, and that trend will continue.</p></speech>

In the UK in recent years, they have removed the stipulation that they must be paid contributions.  They can be a mixture of paid or credited or all credited.  That is a good move.  If the stipulation for 520 contributions remains and there is no return to the 260 contributions, it may be beneficial to individuals and the type of people, mostly women caring in the home, to have a mixture or allowing credited contributions to be taken into account to make the higher number.  That is something that congress has requested.</p></speech>

It changed when the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was Minister.  There used to be a one-year window to make voluntary contributions and now there is a five-year window.  I did not succeed in getting the Government to reduce the threshold.  If a person has 470 contributions, for example, it is not just a case that he or she would not be in the scheme but such a person could not even make voluntary contributions to make it up.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked if a portion of the total auto-enrolment contribution could have a defined benefit element for the purpose of at least guaranteeing a return.  A concern of congress is that we are more or less requiring workers - there is an element of compulsion as there is a small window if people want to opt out - to put 6% of their pay into a second-tier pension.  How can we guarantee that they will have some return?  Our understanding is that with the limited number of schemes that will be introduced, there will be some sort of timing factor.  When people reach a certain age they will automatically go into a low-risk plan, which in itself will guarantee a minimum.  There will not be a minimum floor, however.</p> <p>  Ultimately, congress would argue the best protection for workers in the auto-enrolment is not allowing this to be divvied up by commercial pension providers.  There should either be a public fund or congress is currently looking at an employer-worker master trust.  Instead of being profit-driven, this would be led for the worker's benefit.  That is how we are looking to protect the best interests of workers.</p></speech>

If it is entrusted to investment vehicles, the primary motivation of that vehicle would be how much money it can make.</p><p>Looking at the briefing paper the members prepared in the context of the legislation, I read what has to be the most extraordinary statement, namely, that in order to protect people from the potential closure of defined benefit schemes we should do away with them altogether.  That is like a suggestion that we should abolish umbrellas in case one would open it on a windy day.</p></speech>

They will be dealt with in separate proceedings of this committee.  We expect the Minister to come back to the committee on that.  Some years ago the perception was that the total contributions would be over a 30-year cycle but because of the remedy the Minister introduced on the 2012 issue a 40-year cycle is now under consideration.  We expect the debates on auto enrolment and total contributions will be dealt with in other proceedings of this committee.  We had the Minister here previously.  She has made opening statements so they are not concluded.</p> <p>  Before I conclude, are there any elements of the Bill proposed by Deputy O'Dea about which Dr. Bambrick or Mr. Hannigan have concerns or that they believe should be modified in any way?</p></speech>

However, the absolute principle underpinning the Deputy's Bill is welcomed by congress because it is to provide protection to people in defined benefit schemes.  To be honest, in terms of the mechanics as to whether a more detailed item of legislation or protections over a more detailed timeframe should be introduced, the principle that we would wish to see agreed is that the protections need to be put in place.</p></speech>
