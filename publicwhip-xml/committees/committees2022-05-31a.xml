This meeting is to discuss the challenge and opportunity of climate action at local level, specifically regarding the role of local authorities.  I welcome Mr. Paddy Mahon, chair, climate action, transport and networks committee of the County and City Management Association, CCMA, and chief executive of Longford County Council; Mr. Peter Burke, Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and the climate action, transport and networks committee of the CCMA; and Ms Eleanor Ryan, LGMA, who is joining us online.  From the climate adaptation regional offices, CAROs, I welcome Mr. Joe Boland, regional lead, eastern and midlands CARO; Mr. David Dodd, Dublin metropolitan CARO; Mr. Liam Bergin, regional lead, Dublin metropolitan CARO; Mr. Kevin Motherway, Atlantic seaboard south CARO, who is joining us online; Mr. Louis Duffy, regional lead, Atlantic seaboard south CARO, also joining us online; and Mr. Martin Keating, Atlantic seaboard north CARO.</p><p>From the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, we have Councillor Nicholas Crossan, president, and Mr. Tommy Moylan, director, both of whom join us online.  All of the witnesses are very welcome.</p><p> Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For the witnesses who attend remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, or join us online, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness who is physically present on the campus.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members they may participate in this meeting only if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask any member joining us online to confirm, prior to making his or her contribution, that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p> I invite Mr. Mahon to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paddy Mahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022053100002#E00200"><p>On behalf of the County and City Management Association and the climate action regional offices, CAROs, I welcome the opportunity to meet the Chairperson and members of the joint committee to discuss the challenges and opportunities of climate action for local authorities.  We believe the local authorities are well placed to address the climate challenge by embedding climate action in our operations and leading climate action across our areas and communities.  With 31 local authorities across Ireland working towards this ambition, there is an opportunity to achieve significant impact locally.</p> <p>  In recent years, the CCMA has overseen a number of important developments.  The CAROs were established in 2018 and are funded by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications for a five-year period.  The CAROs were set up to do drive climate action across the sector, assist in the alignment of policy and mainstream climate action across all local authority functions.</p> <p>  In 2019, local authorities prepared their climate change adaptation plans and signed the climate action charter.  A comprehensive local authority climate action training programme was also developed.  In 2020, the sector achieved its energy performance target of 33%.  We also developed a sectoral strategy entitled, Delivering Effective Climate Action, and made a subsequent funding submission.</p> <p>  In 2021, significant activity included the creation of guidance on the electrification of the local authority fleet and electric vehicle, EV, charging; a national conference on economic opportunities and climate action; the creation of active travel teams throughout the sector with funding from the National Transport Authority; the identification of decarbonising zones; a public lighting retrofit programme was put in place; work commenced on the local authority housing retrofit programme; and climate action training continued.  This year, the focus has been on the preparation of guidance on climate adaptation for regional and local roads, engagement with local authorities on the areas of rising sea levels and coastal erosion, and preparing guidance for the forthcoming climate action plans, as we are required to do.</p> <p>  The challenges we face are framed by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 and the Climate Action Plan 2021, specifically in the areas of improving energy efficiency to 50% by 2030, delivering a 51% reduction in carbon emissions, and each local authority devising its own climate action plan.</p> <p>  Local authorities are also engaged in a number of areas.  In adaptation, which is a pivotal area of local area activity, coastal erosion is particularly challenging at the moment.  The CAROs and local authority sector are represented on the national steering group on this area, which is led by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  To date, training has been made available to over 16,000 employees and all of our elected members.</p> <p>  In the area of community and enterprise activity, local authorities are well positioned in communities with established engagement in climate action to take on a broader role, influencing and facilitating others to meet their targets.  For example, we are a lead partner in the GAA green clubs programme.   The economic opportunities arising from the climate action project work with local enterprise offices, LEOs, and the local community development committees, LCDCs, to promote climate action through the lens of opportunity.</p><p> A just transition is an essential element of climate action.  Local authorities already provide a range of socioeconomic and community development services and we are well placed to enable and support a just transition.</p><p> Our ambition is clear.  It was pointed out in the charter that we signed in 2019 and in the strategy that local government developed in 2020, Delivering Effective Climate Action 2030.  It is a comprehensive commitment across all 31 local authorities.  Our vision is to leverage the capability, reach and resources of local authorities to lead and co-ordinate climate action across Ireland.</p><p> It needs resources.  In its annual report in 2021, the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, noted the progress of the sector but it also pointed out the resource and capacity constraints facing local authorities.</p><p> Climate action, as the committee members all will be aware, is a broad area requiring diverse skill sets.  It also needs boots on the ground.  From communication with the sector and feedback to Departments at the recent CCMA plenary, it was clear that there is insufficient staff capacity at local authority and CARO levels.  The CAROs, were originally established on a climate adaptation footing but their work programme has expanded rapidly and moved very much into the climate mitigation and energy area, with insufficient staff at regional level to assist local authorities.  The sector is looking for clarity from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications as to what happens when the five-year temporary funding of the CARO ceases in March 2023.</p><p> We are also looking to that Department for support for staff resources across the local authority sector.  Those resources were identified in the strategy that I mentioned earlier, Delivering Effective Climate Action 2030.  We believe each local authority needs: a climate action co-ordinator; an energy and emissions manager; a climate action officer; a green solutions specialist; and a community climate action officer.</p><p> We have been engaging over the last year, particularly with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, with a view to securing the necessary funding towards the cost of putting these resources in place in advance of the preparation of the climate action plans that we will be required to do before the end of this year.  The CCMA is clear that these additional resources need to be in place in 2022 to ensure that local authorities realise our ambition to deliver transformative change and measurable climate action across our cities and counties and within our own organisations through leadership, example and mobilising action at a local level.</p><p> I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak.  My colleagues and I would be delighted to try to answer the committee's questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Crossan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022053100002#F00300"><p>As AILG president, I thank the Chair and the committee members for affording us the opportunity to meet the committee today and contribute to the committee's work and discuss both the challenges and opportunities for local authorities in climate action.  The AILG's director, Mr. Tommy Moylan, is with me today.</p> <p>  Climate change is the defining issue of our time with all sections of society aware that we must deal with the reality of climate change.  All sectors of society and the economy need to act now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and thus avoid the worst impacts of climate change.  The local government sector is no different.  Local authorities have long been at the front line in dealing with extreme weather events and as these extremes become more frequent, local authorities must ensure local adaptation to a changed climate.  The all-of-government climate action plan is a measure of how involved councils will be in addressing the climate challenge.  The current programme for Government commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, a 51% reduction over a decade and achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  The 2050 target has been set in law by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 with every sector contributing to meeting this target.</p> <p>  In order to ensure that the local government sector plays its part in achieving the 51% reduction, it is essential that we build the capacity of local authorities to lead locally and to engage citizens and communities on climate change and biodiversity.  Local authorities are key decision makers regarding choices relating to energy use, buildings, transport, waste management, green infrastructure and the many other initiatives that can help reduce our emissions.  The sector has already commenced this work in leading the local challenge to climate change with the establishment of the regional climate action offices, CAROs, in 2018, which have driven climate action responses at local level including building capacity, awareness and training with both local authority staff and elected members.</p><p>The CARO offices have developed a comprehensive local authority climate action training programme for all local authority staff and the 949 elected members.  This training has been rolled out over the past 12 months with tailored training for the members and staff in championing leadership to harness that local leadership role of the members in driving effective climate action.</p><p> All local authorities, including the cathaoirligh and mayors, have co-signed the Climate Action Charter for Local Authorities and they have been formally adopted in each individual council.  The charter commits local authorities to several actions that will ensure that they play a key leadership role, locally and nationally, in delivering effective climate action.</p><p> Local authorities have also prepared and published their climate action plans.  Further initiatives for the local authorities will include leading the energy transition by retrofitting their social housing stock, reducing our dependence on high-carbon transport systems by providing safe cycling and walking infrastructure, ensuring that local development plans are developed to stimulate economic growth and ensuring no sector of society or community is left behind in the movement to a low-carbon future.</p><p> We, in AILG, are committed to ensuring that the elected members have the required training, knowledge and tools to lead and champion the local response to climate change.  We have had extensive engagement over the past number of years with the Department's national emergency management directorate and Met &Eacute;ireann which have provided briefings to the members on the local authority response to severe weather events and mitigation of severe climate events.  As well as working with the CARO offices on the roll-out of their training programme, the AILG have also delivered a comprehensive training programme with the Office of the Planning Regulator and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on the development plan review process to include areas such as decarbonisation, focusing on the implementation of national climate policy and the roll-out of new energy sources and active travel.  We have also just delivered a training module for our members on local government and the sustainable development goals, SDGs.  It is important that the members and local authorities embed the SDGs in their county and city plans and local area plans.  The members must also ensure that the SDGs are integral to council policy development across all departments.  The AILG has also engaged extensively and participated on the advisory body on the marine planning and development Bill and also currently participates on the advisory body on the new national waste and circular economy action plan.</p><p> The AILG is delighted to partner with UCC this year in developing a level 7 certificate in continuing education professional development in climate crisis and local government.  This Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, approved level 7 certificate has been designed specifically for councillors.  It will cover up-to-date policies and initiatives, such as the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act and the climate action plan.  Twenty-six of the AILG's members have just completed this course and are awaiting final results.  As we have stated, one of the new emerging roles and responsibilities of the local government sector is responding to the challenges of climate change.  It is imperative that the members have the necessary knowledge, education and leadership expertise to lead this challenge and the availability of a bespoke accredited course in climate action is of vital importance for the AILG and its members.</p><p> However, as local authorities rise to the challenge of leading the local response to climate change, they also face a number of challenges, particularly around resources.  Over the last ten-to-15 years, local authorities have seen a reduction on staff numbers and if the targets on climate action set by the Government are to be delivered at local government level, local authorities will require much-needed additional resources.  The AILG welcomes the commitment in the programme for Government that every local authority will have a sufficient number of biodiversity and heritage officers among its staff complement.  However, additional staff resources will be needed to work with communities and the public on local initiatives to achieve out climate targets.</p><p>Additional resources will also be required for the local government sector in respect of the core philosophy of a just transition and to ensure that no sector of society or community is left behind in the movement to a low-carbon future. </p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for listening to our submission.  We look forward to participating in the debate. </p></speech>

We are a little behind the time and about two and half hours remain in this session.  As we do not have all day, I propose, as usual, that members take two minutes in which to ask questions.  Guests will be given latitude to answer and take as much time as they need, within reason.  Is it agreed that we stick with the two minutes for now?  Agreed.  If we do have time, there will be a second and third round.  If guests wish to contribute on any question, even though it may not have been directed at them, just raise a hand and I will bring them in.  If guests are joining us online then please use the raise hand function and I will get to them.  I ask members to please indicate their wish to contribute and the clerk will make a list.</p> <p>  I wish to ask the witnesses a broad question because I am sure that all of the members are interested in hearing their views.  We, on this committee, all work very hard on this issue week in and week out.  I pay tribute to my colleagues on the committee on their efforts.  We have found that as we go outside of the committee room to the Oireachtas that generally there is broad consensus at a high level about what is needed.  Sometimes I wonder if the penny has dropped about how hard the challenge is going to be that we are setting out on because we have found that generally, it has not been politicised at the Oireachtas level but we have evidence at local authority level that when the meaningful polices and actions start to be implemented, debated and processed that, in some cases, all hell breaks loose.  These things can be politicised very easily and quickly, and ultimately the best intentions can falter.  We saw that happen in Salthill with the proposed cycle lane and similarly with Strand Road.  In Lucan recently, there has been a huge public reaction to the removal of a handful of parking spaces and councillors took sides.  In every local authority around the country, when permeability issues are discussed one sees there is resistance and the same with parking, which is also a contentious issue.  I seek the views of witnesses on how we can translate this high-level agreement and the urgent need for action to the local level.  We must respect the fact that we live in a democracy and everybody is entitled to a view.  There are processes and due diligence of course but as we are also in an emergency, we must see this ambition realised.  I am very interested in hearing the views of representatives of both the CCMA and the AILG on how we can get the local authority system more on board.  I mean the political side as well as the official side.  I say that because it will be one our biggest challenges in implementing meaningful climate action.  I first address my query to Mr. Mahon and please feel free to bring in colleagues. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paddy Mahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022053100002#H00300"><p>The issue has been covered to some extent in the CCMA submission and that of the AILG.  Increasingly, there is a higher level of governance across the local authority sector in the area of climate action.  Consequently, climate action is a regular agenda item for all management team meetings across the sector.   Most, if not all, local authorities now have a strategic policy committee named as a climate action committee and, in some cases, dedicated exclusively to climate action.</p><p>The AILG mentioned the training that is being rolled out at the moment.  As I mentioned earlier, training has been made available to 16,000 of our staff out of a total of 29,000 staff and to all of the AILG members.  So there has been a significant ramping up of governance and in promoting awareness, and an understanding of our role and the key areas that are involved in addressing climate change and in our functions under climate action.<br/><br/>Earlier I mentioned a very good example of when resources were put in place very quickly.  Just over a year ago the Department of Transport, along with the National Transport Authority, NTA, made significant funding available for resources for local authorities to put in place active travel teams.  A year later, up to 200 people are working on active travel projects, which are beginning to discover issues on the ground, although they are probably not unexpected.  I believe that with the right approach and governance, and the right understanding and training for ourselves and across the whole local government sector, we will build capacity and the know-how that is required to deliver what is effectively a Government policy and a key tool in understanding, and dealing with, climate change.<br/><br/><b></b>My colleague, Mr. Joe Boland, eastern and midlands CARO, will comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Boland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022053100002#J00200"><p>I will reiterate the importance of being strategic and what is expected of the 30,000 local authority staff and 950, I think, elected members.  Building the capacity of the sector is key.  We have about 18,000 people trained between elected members and staff, and I can go into the training structure in more detail.  There are different methods used to calculate staff numbers.  In the case of senior staff, elected members have a heading in the training plan, which is funded by the Department of the Environment, Communications and Climate Action, and is called championing leadership.  There are other streams to that as well.</p> <p>  Policies and legislation are in place.  The whole bottom-up aspect is very important and particularly involves municipal districts, Tidy Towns fora and different fora at local level and public partnership networks, PPNs.  That is very important when encouraging innovation at local level.  There are community capacity building pieces, which are very important.  As for what some local authorities have, Kildare County Council has a graduate who works full-time with local communities so there is a whole link with creativity in the arts, for example.  That is just a very high-level overview.</p> <p>  Another important point is strategic collaboration and reaching out at other entities at national, regional or local level.  One example of strategic collaboration is the GAA green clubs initiative and there are other examples that we can progress.</p> <p>  One must realise that while there are challenges, as the Chairman has rightly pointed out, there are significant opportunities, particularly in the area of economic opportunities, which is an issue we can go into in more detail.  We have done a lot of work on that aspect.  A lot of that work can be rolled out through the local enterprise offices.  We must also not forget just transition and that no one is left behind.</p> <p>  Mr. Mahon mentioned governance.  Most local authorities have a climate action team and an energy efficiency officer.  Climate action is a standing item on management team agendas, corporate policy group agendas and even on the agendas of full councils.  There is also a strategic policy committee on climate action.  Therefore, the whole governance piece is very important.</p> <p>  Earlier the adaptation piece was mentioned.  Our adaptation plans were adopted in time.  We have a lot of statistics and roughly about 85% of the actions nationally have been either delivered or are in the process of being delivered.  As Mr. Mahon has outlined, the focus henceforth will be on mitigation and reducing the carbon footprint.  We can go into those aspects in more detail.  A key important message is that we must be strategic.  I have referred to the big-ticket items and we can go into them in more detail.</p> <p>  The Chairman made worthwhile observations and I appreciate there can be disagreement at times.  The strategic piece is very important, however, because there are significant challenges ahead, particularly in the context of the new Government targets.</p><p>I hope that is helpful.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Boland.  A big part of his answer concerned the bottom-up approach and I agree on that.  Is there more we can do?  The system we have had for a long time was reformed in the past ten years with PPNs and so on, for very good reasons.  Is it equipped well enough?  Do we have to engage more in the bottom-up approach and talk to more people to get them on board and help them understand why these changes are important and necessary and how they can be beneficial?  We could then pre-empt the stage where councillors feel they need to take sides.  The battle is lost if we get to that point.  Is there more we can do on the bottom-up approach?</p></speech>

In Mayo, for example, we did it as a competitive bid among our communities.  We assisted them in making bids and got them to present their vision and how they would structure it, governance-wise and that, within their communities.  We were overwhelmed by the response we got.  Ten communities came forward and the outcome is we now have a network of communities in Mayo that want to decarbonise.  We brought that back into the council chambers and got those communities to share their vision of decarbonising their communities over the next ten years.  It demonstrated to the political system and to us as managers in local government that people have the ambition and it is important to them.  That was a big breakthrough and needs to be continually worked on and fed through.</p></speech>

Climate action was low on the agenda of local authorities six or seven years ago.  There were different approaches and scales of activity in local authorities.  With this in mind, the CCMA decided to set up CARO, a shared service that would support the development of expertise and capacity within local authorities.  It was established in 2018.  The first climate adaptation strategies by local authorities were adopted in 2019, which was just 18 or 20 months after the initiation.  The setting has changed so much with the climate action Bill being enacted and the development of the national climate action plan.  CARO has worked on the development of guidelines for local authorities in order that they will be in a position to bring in plans for their entire counties.  This is a shift from where local authorities were because not only do we have to look at activity of the local authority but we have to look at the ways we can support communities, industry and agriculture in making the transition.  For this reason, we can, with the appropriate resources, work with our communities and Departments.  That is another challenge because every Department and sector of Government has a responsibility and a role to play.  Quite often, the local authority is seen as being the main actor on the ground.</p><p>Even in the development of our climate adaptation strategies, CARO representatives were members of the national steering group for adaptation and we engaged with all of the other sectors to ensure our plans matched with theirs.  We have such a high level of ambition for Ireland that there is much engagement and alignment of the work of Departments and our sector to make sure we are not contesting or overlapping with what they are doing.  We are trying to make the best use of available resources.  It is a challenge for us.  We need additional resources in our teams and in the local authority sector.  Early engagement with PPNs was supported by local authorities, even though the engagement was directly between the Department and the PPN.  In every instance, a liaison was offered by local authorities and this can continue.</p><p> In the broad response to the Chair's question about how we bring it down to local level, local authorities are there to do that and, even in areas where we are not the primary service delivery agent, we work with the relevant Department and community involved in that area, such as agriculture, industry and commerce generally.</p></speech>

We see challenges in the training provided, which gives our members the necessary skills to empower the general public and bring it along with us.  We are all sceptical of change from time to time but it is important that local members are upskilled as well as we can be to serve our communities.  The opportunities include more responsibility for local authorities because we know the local leads and have local knowledge of our areas and how best to serve them with regard to climate change.  </p> <p>  A strong point came through concerning sustainable development goals.  They have to be incorporated across all Departments, whether in our national plan, our local area plan, regional plan or whatever.</p></speech>

It is the defining issue at national Government and has now come through at local level.  Sometimes change is difficult for members and a new way of thinking is needed.  We see our role in trying to give that knowledge and skill set to our members and to make them aware of their responsibilities as members of their local authority to deal with issues of climate change and climate action at local level.  I found the training really good in the sense that it was about the leadership quality needed from our elected members to bring their communities on board with them.  That is hugely important because we have to bring the public on board.  Hopefully, as that happens, we will see fewer instances where there is conflict at local level over new initiatives and getting a new way of thinking.  We will continue to help with that.</p> <p>  Our development plan reviews with members over the past 12 or 18 months have been hugely important.  All local development plans and county and city development plans are at some stage of the review process, some nearing completion.  Addressing climate action as part of that review was a big part of the work of the elected members.  Going through that process has empowered our members, as well as getting them a new way of thinking.  As the objectives of the development plans are rolled out over the next six years, which is the lifetime of the plans, I hope they will deliver on their responsibilities on climate action.</p></speech>

I am aware that I am taking much more than my allocated time, but I wish to flesh this out some more.  Does the AILG view its role as just training and informing its members or would it step in during a situation like that at Salthill, Lucan or wherever and advise its members that the situation is important and they should think carefully about it and perhaps go a certain way?  I am despondent.  Before being elected to the D&aacute;il, I served on a local authority in Limerick.  Almost unanimously, its members argued for an almost universal right to build one-off houses.  That has major climate implications.  Recently, it made some national headlines when members of the local authority argued that the building regulations should be revised so that every new home would have a chimney stack, which is utterly crazy for anyone trying to build energy-efficient housing stock.  It seems we are still a long way off, notwithstanding the good work that the AILG and CCMA do.  As we go through the session, we might address how to bring the political system on board.  "Hostile" is a strong word, so perhaps I should say that it is not as ready as the official side.  We will revert to this matter.  Other committee members will probably make similar points.</p></speech>

I will pick up on a couple of points.  The title of this session is "Challenge and Opportunity for Local Authorities in Climate Action".  Regarding challenges, I am hearing about staffing issues at local government and CARO levels.  What is the extent of workforce planning?  There are a number of headline positions, but what number and types of positions need to be filled at local government and CARO level?  What difference would filling them make in practical terms?</p> <p>  What has been the experience thus far of drafting county development plans?  To what degree are they, or should be, co-ordinated?  What oversight is there of them?  They contain obligations to meet targets.</p> <p>  What has been the witnesses&rsquo; experience of the bottom-up element?  This is an emerging field, but can they provide examples of successes?  What opportunity has there been to work with PPNs?  I have a particular interest in sustainable energy communities, SECs.  Do the witnesses see a role for local government in this regard?  What community-led and supported vehicle can deliver on climate action?  There is some complementarity between PPNs and SECs, but they are separate in many ways.</p></speech>

He did a great deal of work on preparing business cases.</p> <p>  Before I turn to him, each local authority has gone through, or is going through, a county development plan process.</p><p>A number of plans have been reviewed and adopted, overseen by the Planning Regulator.  It is an ongoing process, but climate action is an overarching theme.  It was a significant part in our case in Longford, particularly with the just transition owing to the closure of power stations in the midlands.</p><p> The county development plan process is guided by the national planning framework and the regional spatial and economic strategy, RESS.  There is a co-ordinated approach to development plans, with climate action a significant theme therein.  It permeates through the various sections of our county development plan and every other plan.  The reviews of these plans will have a significant input from the response to climate action.  There is considerably more detail involved than I have laid out, but climate action is an important theme now compared with previous county development plans and the process has significant regard to it.</p><p> Regarding the bottom-up element, our sector engaged in the national dialogue on climate action last year and this year.  These were conversations on climate action that were co-ordinated by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications with cross-Government support.  We were happy to be involved as a sector.  Through our involvement, the PPNs and Comhairle na n&Oacute;g were involved in those conversations last year, which helped to inform the climate action Bill and the subsequent Climate Action Plan.  This year&rsquo;s conversations on climate action are being organised at the moment.  Last year, a sample of PPNs were included in the conversations.  All of our PPNs will be included this year.  This is a positive message, not only to communities, but to the local government sector, given that we were happy to facilitate that process last year.  The process works well.  It gives communities the opportunity to play a meaningful and significant part in how climate action is addressed.  The message that we keep sending at local, regional and national levels is that we are well placed to impact locally on national and global issues in terms of climate action.  The PPNs and SECs have a positive impact at a local level.</p><p> I understand that the Department is due to roll out a community climate action fund.  Through our involvement with the Department over the past year, that fund is being rolled out via local authorities in partnership with communities and PPNs.  This is another positive contribution that we can make.</p></speech>

Significant progress is being made on this across all local authorities, particularly in recent years through regional mentorships.  I will refer to one of the accompanying documents that was sent with our opening statement, namely, the CARO progress report, which provides some detail on the SECs.  In the Dublin and wider mid-eastern region, 142 SECs have been set up, with 80 in the four Dublin catchment areas alone.</p> <p>  We view the SECs as playing a key role in the bottom-up approach.  They are coming from the community and could be GAA or other sports clubs, local community halls or Tidy Towns groups combining with local sports halls.  They come together to draft energy master plans, perhaps including the retrofitting of some residential houses, and then apply to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.</p> <p>  An issue we have encountered is that of bridging funding at community level.  There needs to be some funding for groups to draft energy master plans.  We are overcoming this issue through a memorandum of understanding with the local authority sector, which would provide the bridging funding for communities to get their energy master plans over the line.  A master plan might call for a community hall to be insulated, solar panels to be put on its roof, etc.</p> <p>  The Dublin region and some other CARO regions are working directly with energy agencies.  In the case of Dublin, that is Codema.  Other energy agencies, for example, Tipperary Energy Agency, are doing a great deal of good work through local communities and SECs and driving community involvement in energy efficiency and climate action.</p></speech>

All the interactions the existing staff have offer an opportunity to bring climate action into the conversation and be part of the considerations on whatever function or programme is being discussed.  In developing the strategy, we identified core staff who were required to leverage the full ambition for the sector.  To start with energy officers, we have tough targets in the context of our absolute emissions targets for 2030, so we are looking for energy officers to be deployed in each of the local authorities to help to deliver that.  In addition, the energy officers will start to build knowledge and capacity within each of the local authorities which can feed back into the communities to provide advice on the new technologies that are appropriate for them.  The second area of focus is climate action community officers.  To follow on from the earlier discussions, a continuous engagement with the community for a bottom-up approach whereby we co-create a solution that is appropriate for each community is resource-intense.  That is why we are looking for climate action community officers to carry out those engagements, consistently interact with the community and feed back into the different functions within the local authority.  Third, there is a need for green solution specialists who will work alongside the planning departments but also feed into the adaptation strategies.  We are considering our land use policies and nature-based solutions to adapt to the risks and impacts from climate change.</p> <p>  As regards the overall role for local authorities, one of the major roles in adaptation in particular is to co-ordinate the national and sectoral adaptation policies down at the local level.  We identified climate action co-ordinators to assist with that and, in addition, to help to co-ordinate the broader role of climate action - the mitigation and community engagement piece - and co-ordinate the overall climate action team.  To assist them, we also identified the need for a climate action officer within each local authority.  One of their primary roles will be that cultural change within the local authority so that all 28,000 staff are aligned to deliver on climate action, but also to provide support to the co-ordinator or community officer for different programmes, such as the community conversations that were rolled out with the national dialogue.  Those are the positions we identified in the sector.  There are different metrics in respect of each of the roles.  In total, we identified 170 positions across the 31 local authorities.</p></speech>

Do our guests have an update on how many of the staff are in position?  I know some local authorities are getting on with the work in the meantime but do our guests have an update in terms of the complement of local authorities?</p> <p>  I do not know if any of our guests can address the possible need at a CARO level.</p></speech>

CARO was initially set up in 2018 with the main aim of adaptation but that role has been expanded.  The report published last year by the Climate Change Advisory Council identified the potential that is within CARO to drive this on.  We identified a resource in respect of adaptation to specialise in that area.  Similarly with the role of energy, it is to support the local authorities on their own energy transitions but also to provide support to communities and planners to mobilise that element of climate action.  I refer to the need for a planning and green specialist to help to co-ordinate and roll out green solutions.  I refer to the need for a data specialist as a shared resource across the four local authorities, particularly in the context of adaptation.  There are many data sets relating to risk and there is a need for a person to collate and manage those.</p><p>As regards funding, once the projects have been identified, there is a need to ascertain what funding sources are available.  That will be the role of a specialist who can examine what national and European funding is available and help local authorities to capture that.  I refer to the whole area of communicating climate action and, in particular, the good work that has been done by local authorities and communities.  It is about communicating policies and funding streams to local authorities but also to communities.</p></speech>

As the Deputy stated, some local authorities have gone ahead and put people into some of these positions but, by and large, that has not happened across the sector.  It is a resource issue.  There is no point in denying that.  There is great ambition, as I stated, but having the funding in place is critical for many local authorities.  We have engaged, particularly with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, on this matter for more than a year.  Mr. Mellett and his colleagues prepared a business case that was submitted earlier this year and helped to inform the Department in preparing its own internal business case that I understand is going through the departmental processes.  Our expectation and hope is that it will secure funding to allow these resources, or some of them, to be put in place.  We are awaiting a response from the Department in respect of what, if any, funding might be made available.  What is critical to us at the moment is that although the ambition is there among our staff and the elected members, as the committee heard, there is a timing issue because we expect the Minister, before the end of the year, to direct every local authority to prepare its climate action plan.  That will demand more resources straight away.  The earlier we have people in place, the earlier we can prepare and put in place a meaningful climate action plan for every city and county council in the country.</p></speech>

If the local authorities are instructed to develop the climate action plans at the end of the year, do our guests envisage there will then be a review of county development plans, depending on what those climate action plans come up with?  It may be the case that once that process is gone through, there are all sorts of things that are not consistent with the county development plans.</p></speech>

In some cases, the timing of the development plan might align with the development of the climate action plan.  In other cases, the county development plan, such as ours in Longford, may need to be reviewed in the context of what emerges from our climate action plan.  I do not think the responses for each of the 31 city and county councils will be similar but regard will have to be had to what is in the county development plan.</p></speech>

They are slightly different as, since 2019, they have prepared climate change action plans through working with Codema.  Those include adaptation and mitigation actions.  As Mr. Mahon stated, there are several other local authorities that have mitigation elements in their climate adaptation or climate action plans.  The vast majority are just adaptation actions.  In the context of Dublin, the targets and actions that are already there in terms of retrofitting public buildings, social housing, etc., are already being taken into account in the context of the city and county development plans in the Dublin region.  A similar situation pertains in other regions that already have mitigation targets included.</p></speech>

The Chairman and Deputy O'Rourke may have been looking over my shoulder when I was writing down my questions earlier.  They are probably the obvious questions in respect of the role and function of our guests in the context of climate action.</p><p> I have a couple of questions for Councillor Crossan.  First, I thank him for speaking to us.  I am a former local authority member in Fingal.  One of the issues that arose in terms of the training that was made available to local authority members is that the level of that training and the accreditation that was offered by that training was never perhaps where it should be.  I appreciate things have changed since I left the local authority in 2011.  Does Mr. Crossan feel, given his extensive experience, that this is still present and that there might be a difficulty in regard to regulated accredited training for members in their function, particularly as it relates to climate action?</p><p> I have a similar question, which I feel has been answered, in terms of identifying the roles that are going to be needed across local authority level, within the local authorities themselves and within their workforce.  Notwithstanding the identified figure and the sum which Mr. Mellett has given us, we are now moving very rapidly.  Identifying the individuals and then identifying the budget we will need to acquire them, so to speak, is fantastic.  However, are we going to achieve the target of actually getting the expertise into the local authorities if any particular local authority does not have that level of expertise available to it?</p><p> Related to the Chairman's opening salvo of questions regarding a possible lack of willingness at local authority level among members, do we need to consider a legislative change in regard to the process of providing pedestrianisation, cycle tracks and other climate-friendly measures, as I consider them, that local authorities are trying to achieve in certain places?  There are process issues that have been identified with certain applications as opposed to local authorities making a democratic decision not to proceed with a particular scheme, which is a different thing.</p><p> In regard to the local authorities&rsquo; role in improving biodiversity, the Chairman mentioned one-off housing.  I would go a little further than the Chairman in saying that there is a middle ground but there is no line in some local authorities, whereas in others it is an absolute and they are just not provided anymore, certainly not in the same way they were provided in my time.  I think there is a middle ground to be found where a carbon-neutral or low-carbon property can be delivered.  The Chairman mentioned chimneys being put back in and things like that.  This is just as frustrating as seeing A-rated new properties with gas boilers, and I have come across those in recent times as well.  It is incredibly frustrating.</p><p> Are local authorities adequately equipped to properly administer our rivers and lakes?  I reference to a certain extent the river basin management draft, which is on public display at present.  There are many examples where local authorities are either unable or unwilling - probably unable - to fulfil their functions, and I am not just talking about my own constituency or county but others that I have read about and am aware of.  Is that going to be a problem in the future in terms of clean-ups, including discharges into our rivers and lakes, and the impact that can have on flora and fauna, water, aquatic life and the general quality of land surrounding our lakes and rivers?</p><p> There is a broad range of questions there to top up what had already been asked by the Chair and Deputy O'Rourke.</p></speech>

In the last few years, there has been comprehensive training with the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, and the CARO, and also an accredited partnership with University College Cork.  I will let Mr. Moylan take that up shortly.</p><p>Before I move to that, the Chairman asked whether the AILG would get involved with the local authority regarding, for example, Salthill.  The AILG is a representative body of all 949 members plus all 31 local authorities.  While we must respect the democratic standards that the councillors have in that field, from time to time we have councillors, groups and political parties coming along for advice and guidance on that.  If that happens, the AILG steps in and we offer our services to them to the best of our ability, and there are issues which we can deal with internally or else contact whatever Department it might be for advice.  However, we would respect the democratic right of each local authority.</p><p> I hope that answers the question.  I will hand over to our director, Mr. Moylan, on the question of training.</p></speech>

There is an argument for another day about the local government reforms of 2014.  However, in fairness to the then Minister, Phil Hogan, at that time, as part of those reforms, he asked the AILG, which was the new representative body following those reforms, if we would take on a training and education remit with our elected members.  Over the last six years, we have developed a comprehensive training module in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which has given us access to tremendous speakers across all Government Departments, sectors and public agencies.  A number of the members who are at this afternoon's meeting have attended our training days and given briefings to our members.  We have expert presenters made available to us as part of the training programme.</p> <p>  We want to take that training programme into the area of a continuous professional development programme for our members, and sitting parallel with that is a certified training module which we have pioneered with UCC.  As I said, 26 members have just completed a level 7 certificate in climate action and local government.  Hopefully, pending successful exams, they will have a level 7 QQI certificate later in the summer, and they will have that because of the AILG, which is a really good legacy for us.</p> <p>  That is what we want to do.  We want to empower our members.  We want to give them the required skills and knowledge to do that, so they can participate on these types of issues and they can speak at local authority level with confidence on the areas of climate action for housing, planning or whatever else because they have that skill set.  That is our plan and we are certainly getting there.</p> <p>  I appreciate that certified training is not for everybody.  We have a wide and diverse body of 949 councillors so we want to keep a tier under that of continuous professional development for our members.  Over the years, we have seen local authority elected members giving 20, 30 or 40 years of service to their local authorities and maybe walking away with nothing as regards a certificate or a piece of paper to acknowledge that service.  That is where we want to get to.  That is our aim and we are doing that in conjunction with the Department and with the executive side of the local authorities as well.  We are very grateful for the expert speakers who are made available to us right across the board.</p> <p>  With regard to the lack of willingness of local authority members in delivering on climate action at local government level, what I would say is that a lot of work is being done at the moment in regard to a review of the county and city development plans.  As Mr. Mahon stated, our members have put in long hours over a long period, engaging with their executive and their planners, engaging with communities, engaging with the public and reviewing the submissions that have been made as part of this process.  Climate action has really come to the fore as part of that process and we hear that on the ground with our members across the board.</p> <p>  The challenge once these plans are adopted and approved by the elected members is what happens then, and we are taking that challenge to our members.  Their job cannot just be done when the development plan has been approved.</p><p>They must start delivering on the objectives of the development plan as well and bringing them into their everyday work as members of the local authority.  That is the next challenge for us.  We are pioneering more training with the Office of the Planning Regulator and with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and we are saying, "Your development plan has been approved now, so what happens next?"  That is where we have to take this conversation with our elected members.</p><p> I hope that answers the questions.</p></speech>

In terms of achieving the target resources, assuming we have funding in place for some or all of those resources, it is definitely a challenge.  It is a factor of the labour market at present.  One example is that, more than 12 months ago, funding was put in place for active travel resources through the Department of Transport in partnership with National Transport Authority, NTA, and 60% to 70% of those resources are now in place 12 months later.  It is not something that happens overnight, but significant progress has been made in that space.  I expect that with the level of ambition and expectation there is within the sector, it would be treated as a priority by city and county councils.  However, there is no doubt it does not happen overnight and there is no point pretending otherwise.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the prospect of having to change legislation in respect of experimental traffic and trying to put in place alternative traffic systems.  That has been raised with us through our committees at the County and City Management Association, CCMA, and we have engaged with the Department of Transport on it to see if the existing legislation is fit for purpose or if it needs to be changed.  It is with the Department of Transport at this stage.  In my past, along with one of my colleagues we did an experimental pedestrianisation of Main Street in Westport approximately 20 years ago and we learned a lot from the feedback from businesses, politicians and the public.  It is very important to be able to do these things, but to do them in partnership with the communities, businesses and enterprises so things can be learned from them without creating significant opposition and antagonism in that space.  It would be helpful if the legislation allowed it to happen more easily, possibly, but at present we have passed that back to the Department of Transport and look forward to its response on it.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the issue of river water quality and groundwater quality.  That is something another committee of the CCMA is dealing with.  A business case is being prepared in partnership with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to put in place the necessary resources local authorities need to manage that area effectively.  That is going through a business case process in partnership with the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA.  In time we expect it will deliver in terms of resources so that area can be managed effectively as well.</p></speech>

The river basin management plan is not in its infancy but has been in existence for many years.  It is only now being updated.</p></speech>

As Mr. Mahon said, there is a business case that has just kicked off this year.  It is a year-long timeline that is being funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It is to present that within the year.  That will set out what an expanded local authority water projects office will look like.  We will probably rebrand it as natural water function.  It will come back to the underlying issue, which is resources, but it will set out what the request is and what that reformed structure will look like.  We are talking about a year for the business case to be developed.  It is quite comprehensive and there is a lot of work to be put in place to do that.</p></speech>

It is a talking point among our members, particularly our rural-based councillors, and it is often raised.  In fairness to our members, they are looking at their local communities, especially in rural areas, which they have seen being strongly affected over the past generation.  They are trying to protect their local communities.  For our members and for ourselves, it is about getting the balance right.  We must look at solutions that get the balance right, that solve the issue of one-off rural housing, and that look at how we can develop our towns and villages and how we can get services into them that will allow people to remain in their rural communities, perhaps not in one-off rural houses but by building up the towns and villages.  However, the services are needed there.  They need the community services and the infrastructure services.  It is a very difficult and emotive issue with our members so, for us and our members, it is about the getting the balance right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.62" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022053100002#T00500"><p>I will conclude on this point.  I fully agree with Mr. Moylan.  There is a balance there and it is about making sure the services are delivered and the balance is right.  However, the local authority system across the board should be very conscious of the level of vacancy and dereliction throughout the State and particularly in rural towns and villages.  I might be from Malahide but I know rural Ireland very well over many years.  The census will give us an opportunity to drill down into the actual numbers, as opposed to desktop exercises, which is what we are operating from at present, to find out if it is 196,000 or if it is a smaller figure.  Given the audience before me, I ask that local government focus on that and use the schemes that are available through both the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to try to further the renewal of towns and villages in rural Ireland, to use those vacant properties, and to reduce the requirement for one-off houses at the end of a boreen with no services but where there is an entitlement under the rural housing policy of the given local authority, and the difficulties this creates then in terms of delivery of services and the delivery of services in an environmentally friendly way.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for this opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.63" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022053100002#T00600"><p>I thank Deputy Farrell.  If I may make an observation, Mr. Moylan's point is a strong one.  If we do not provide the services in our villages and towns and make them places where people will want to live and can live and make them attractive places, obviously people will look elsewhere and they might be more inclined to seek to build rurally.  For me, that is where the effort should go.  It is to create the positive incentive to solve the problem, rather than the negative.</p></speech>

Many of the questions have been covered so I might change the topic slightly and broaden it out to some of the stuff that has been raised with regard to the joined-up approach in planning.  This committee heard recently about buildings that are being demolished as opposed to being repurposed, the carbon footprint of that, and that the best and most efficient building is the building that is still standing.  Are the local authorities doing any type of analysis of what buildings could be repurposed?  For example, the one that broke my heart was the Kevin Street technical college.  It was a fantastic building and it has now been demolished, but I believe it could have been repurposed.  Are local authorities looking at that?</p> <p>  Also, with regard to joined-up thinking when it comes to fossil fuel lock-in and water use around planning permission for data centres and data centres having to have their own gas generation on site, are the local authorities doing any analysis of whether that leaves them exposed in terms of lock-in to fossil fuel?</p><p> There is the identification of homes that are at risk of sea level rises and the plans to address that.  We heard on a recent podcast about issues in Galway with moving back from the coastline and where it is possible build.  Are we identifying the properties that might need coastal adaptation measures or properties that might not be saved?  How do we engage with the people living in those houses?</p><p> Dublin City Council has passed a motion and is progressing work on community wealth building as has Limerick County Council.  There are great examples of where community wealth building in Britain is having a fantastic impact in shortening supply chains, keeping the wealth in communities and facilitating just transition.  After all, local authorities are anchor institutions and they have quite a lot of power when it comes to procurement and things like that.  If they led by example through a community wealth building model, it would facilitate a just transition, shorten those supply chains and put in place restrictions around procurement so that, for instance, it would have to be energy efficient or use sustainable products rather than just buying at the lowest price.  I do not know who might want to answer any of those.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.67" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Bergin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022053100002#U00300"><p>On repurposing buildings, we are doing a good bit of work on embodied carbon at the moment.  If a building is knocked down, there is a carbon consequence of that, as there is if a new one is built.  We are looking at that in our city and county development plans.  Some have gone through and they might not have had as much time to develop that notion.  In this iteration of city and county development plans it is an emerging issue.  I have no doubt it will be much further developed in the next cycle, which will be in four years for the majority of local authorities.  It is something at which our planners, architects and housing sections are looking.  I am not surprised it is absent from the ones that are about to expire but they will be much more conscious of that from now on because it is a major issue.  It also makes a lot of practical sense, especially when working in a city.  The effort involved in restoring a property can be much more community friendly rather than knocking a building where it may not or may not be necessary.</p> <p>  The question around outputs from fossil fuels is something on which we are very keen.  I am thinking of Dublin but there are more examples of that now, particularly with data centres, as the Senator mentioned, and the outputs relating to them.  Initially, it might have been hoped we would be looking at electricity into the carbon centres.  It is only because the grid cannot manage it that we are looking at local fossil fuel solutions around that.  My understanding, and obviously it will be specific to each planning application, is that fossil fuel will back up the electricity, that is, it will run off the grid insofar as possible but the fossil fuel is there for cases where there is blackout or a difficulty.  The fossil fuel is complementary rather than the main source of power.  Certainly, it is something on which we are focused.</p> <p>  The Senator will be familiar with the district heating schemes in Dublin city where we are looking at the waste to energy plant.  That is a very significant scheme but south Dublin also has a district heating scheme from a data centre.  That is very significant heat output.  It is a negative, unfortunately, at the moment if it is using fossil fuel.  Mostly it is using about 40% renewable energy.  We are capturing the output.  That output will give us a positive back into that.  At the moment we are there or thereabouts but as the grid becomes more renewable, then it will be a pure benefit to the district heating scheme because it will be coming almost exclusively from renewable energy, but just with the backup.  The Senator will understand why they would need a fossil fuel backup, especially when relying on solar or wind.  From that perspective, it is something of which we are very conscious.  It is being factored into any data centre getting planning permission now.  A site will be being chosen that will allow us to capture those downstream benefits, in terms of hot water especially.  They will be campuses rather than particular stand-alone data centres in the future to allow that.</p><p> On sea level rises, my colleague Mr. Duffy from Atlantic Seaboard South is more fully involved in looking at coastal erosion nationally.  I agree, we have to stop making it worse by building houses close to the sea.  That is an issue and the Office of Public Works is strongly involved with Mr. Duffy.  He will cover that.</p><p> As the Senator says, Dublin City Council passed a motion on community wealth.  Some colleagues in my own area of Dublin City Council are working on that now.  It is being led by the finance section and is under the finance strategic policy committee, SPC.  The work is at an early stage.  The Senator is right we are paying particular attention to what has been achieved in the UK on this.  It seems to have widespread support across Dublin City Council.  I would say we are a little while away from any practical implementation on the ground.  I understand that within 12 months it will be finding its way into the policies councillors will be adopting.  A bit like the strategic development goals, SDGs, it will be flagged to reflect that perspective or ideology coming towards it.  We are at the early stages but there seems to be widespread engagement across a number of departments in Dublin City Council and I think that it will be favourably received at council level.</p><p> On the materials used for buildings it would be a case of looking at the building regulations around that.  They specify what materials can and should be used in development.  We would be guided by that because any planning permission application we receive would be required to comply with building regulations, so it is a case of the technical specifications that are preferable.  We have some things in our county development plan, and it is probably obvious, around the classes of development we would like to see.  It would be easier to get planning permission for an A-rated house than for a B-rated house.  Obviously, there are a lot of regulations around retrofitting too.  It depends on whether a certain portion of the building fabric is being exceeded.  I will say 51% but I cannot say exactly.  If a house or building is being rehabilitated significantly, it is a requirement to bring it to a B2 standard.  We would be guided by those regulations as well.  Those national requirements would be reflected in our county development plans and other plans we would have locally.</p></speech>

The potential for its use is more widespread than it first considered.  What sort of resources do the local authorities need?  The SEAI is saying it will not just be our cities but that villages and towns will also be able to avail of district heating.  What would the local authorities need to bring that district heating on stream as quickly as possible?  That would allow us not to have to focus as much on heat pumps.  It is a much quicker way of bringing down emissions.</p> <p>  Planning guidelines have to be changed to ensure the most efficient design of data centre is being used in terms of energy and water use.  Irish Water made the point to me.  Are local authorities making those observations when the planning applications come in?  Irish Water has made those observations repeatedly because it is not actually stipulated in the planning guidelines that the most efficient design must be used.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Bergin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022053100002#V00300"><p>To answer the simple one first, on oversight, the Office of the Planning Regulator gives guidance to local authorities about the particular conditions that should be applied to the design of data centres.  A significant amount of work has been done on that.  The Office of the Planning Regulator would have engaged with bodies such as the SEAI, the Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, on that.  There is also an umbrella group for data centres.  A significant amount has been learned by the local authorities within the local area structure and from those external agencies.  Unfortunately, that is where the simple answers end because then the question is what we need to enable district heating, and that is very complicated.  From the local authority perspective, it is an enormous untapped resource for us.  We could provide district heating to 1.5 times the number of houses we have in Dublin if we could get it up and running.  It is extraordinary.  District heating would be preferable, in my view, to air source heat pumps.</p><p>There is a significant cross-departmental focus on it.  A working group has been established and is working on the issue currently.  It will produce a report by October.  The work includes listing the bottlenecks, as it were, in the context of providing district heating.  Dublin City Council will be providing the heating.  Our current work programme suggests that it will be the end of 2025 or perhaps even into 2026 before we will be able to deliver it.  However, that will be dependent on a series of stakeholders contributing to the work.</p><p>Sometimes there is frustration that the local government sector is moving slowly on district heating in Ireland.  It should be noted, however, that the local government sector in Ireland is much more constrained than is the case in Europe.  For example, local authorities in Finland have a much wider base of power.  It may be the case, for example, that we will need to put in 7.3 km of pipe for the district heating scheme.  We do not have the legislative power to open the road to lay the pipe.  We would have had that power once a upon a time, before Irish Water was established.  We need a whole host of legislative powers to do the work.  That is just the legislative side.  Due to the fact that district heating is a new technology for Ireland, the SEAI has to decide on the appropriate rating mechanism.  For example, a developer who has to meet the requirements of the building regulations to comply with an A rating will have to demonstrate that the district heating meets the requirements.  At the moment, we do not have that capacity.  Everyone, including the marker, has their part to play in relation to the project.  We are a lot closer than people think to delivering it.  It will make a massive contribution to Dublin city.  I am perfectly happy to share information with the committee.  In March we shared a document with the Department detailing what Dublin City Council feels is necessary and what we need from the Department.  There are other players that we need to engage with.

These are issues that have challenged our island for many years.  They have been dealt with generally by trying to protect anything that has been identified as damaged or exposed.  Nationally, and as a sector, we are trying to look at it more strategically now, and trying to plan how we will deal with it in the future.  Both erosion and sea level rise would have been seen as risks that led to the assignment of the Atlantic Seaboard, as a pair of CARO regions, to look at the whole area.  Nationally, the issue has been led very much by the Office of Public Works, OPW.  There is an interdepartmental committee reviewing the issue.  A draft report has been prepared.  It will be reviewed by the committee and hopefully published within the next number of weeks or months.  The OPW has identified that 2 million people live within 5 km of the coast in Ireland.  It has looked at the various different types of coastline, including hard rock, beaches, artificial coast, erodible rock and muddy coastline.  Through the OPW, and with the assistance of Geological Survey Ireland, we are starting to identify the areas of coast that are at risk.  Building on that, we will look at where interventions have been undertaken in the past, and where areas are generally at risk.  In 2017, Fingal County Council carried out a survey of a number of coastal counties in the country.  The survey identified what work had been done already and what work is ongoing with regard to identifying the risk and mitigating it.</p> <p>  When Atlantic Seaboard South took up the baton in this area, we formed a working group which included members from the relevant Department and subject matter experts from right across the country.</p><p>We looked at counties that had already done some work on the issue.  We brought officials from those councils onto the working group.  The first stage in that was to rerun the survey that had been done by Fingal County Council in order to try to get a complete picture of the national coastline.  We found that just eight local authorities have undertaken processes to identify the areas at risk.  Those authorities identified 2,279 properties deemed to be at risk as a result of coastal erosion.  We are starting to go through a lot of the statistics on that.  Generally speaking, we are starting to get the point of understanding the areas that are at risk.</p><p> We are working alongside the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which is the Department with responsibility in this area and which is leading the interdepartmental group.  As a sector, we are trying to ensure that we can collect and collate the information at a local level, feed that into the national interdepartmental working group and then take the learnings from that, interpret them and prepare guidelines for local authorities to work on.  Typically, Ireland has sought to protect what coastline we can, and attempted to ensure that no properties are damaged.  Having said that, 12 properties have been identified as being lost to coastal erosion.  That is an increase of seven since the 2017 report.</p><p> Ten local authorities around the coastline have outlined processes to identify roads at risk.  These are developing areas, and we are also challenged by resourcing issues.  However, we are starting to make some progress in the area.  In recent discussions with officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, we have set out to develop a protocol for establishing a baseline, looking at the existing coastline, the existing interventions that have been carried out historically and the areas that are immediately at risk.  This will build an overall national picture of the areas of coast that we need to consider in terms of protection or indeed, managed retreat, if that becomes necessary, which clearly is not the preferred path at this point in time.  It is something that we will build a picture of over the next 18 to 24 months.  In the sector, the work is led by Atlantic Seaboard South.  Nationally, it is led by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></speech>

I attended a recent meeting of Oireachtas Members and my local authority, Kildare County Council.  The issue of data centres was raised because as there are quite a few in County Kildare, and more are being planned.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the fact that local authorities are financially strapped.  Do the witnesses find that there is much conflict between those who are working in the environmental side, those working in the financial departments, and indeed, those at executive level?  How does the increasing number of data centres sit alongside the climate plans that every local authority has?  I have another question.  Have the local authorities looked at setting up one-stop shops at county level?  I am aware that there are a few SEAI groups in north Kildare, which I represent.  How good is that at actually targeting the local authority homes where there is a lot of energy poverty, and getting into the homes where residents may not have the time to go looking for the information?  Do local authorities find that they can get the information to the people who really need issues relating to energy poverty to be addressed?  I ask the witnesses to respond to my question on data centres first.</p></speech>

It can be challenging from a planning perspective but I would not say there is any conflict.  There are many challenges in progressing a data centre.  My colleague, Mr. Bergin, set out the scene in Dublin.  One aspect in that respect that has been considered in Kildare is the issue of water usage and the possibility of locating a centre close to a treatment plant where it could recycle grey water.  There are many aspects to it but I would not say there is any conflict, however, there are challenges from a spatial planning perspective.</p><p> On the one-stop-shop model, sustainable energy communities were referenced by Deputy O'Rourke and he is on the right track with that initiative.  There is growing interest in sustainable energy communities.  Twenty five of them are registered in Kildare, six are ready to progress to a master plan stage, which is positive.  I am aware of one good example of that initiative in Dunleer in County Louth on foot of a presentation to our strategic planning committee, SPC, two weeks ago.  Sustainable energy communities benefit the whole community.  They are sponsored by Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  That initiative is strong in Kildare, Meath and Wicklow and the example of it I cited in County Louth is quite good also.  My colleague, Mr. Dodd, said there were 120 of them nationally.  There is a role for them to interact with individual householders, community groups and industry to advise on the grants available for retrofits or more sustainable systems.  There are also opportunities for local energy renewal initiatives.  That is being progressed in Dunleer in County Louth.  There is potential for the exchange and imparting of information on sustainability to local householders and communities.  Each of the climate action regional offices, CAROs, has been assigned a specialism.  We would seek in our CARO to increase our knowledge in this area and in the context of the next round of plans to bring forward guidance for local authorities to get more sustainable energy communities up and running.  That is one avenue for imparting information on sustainability.  I hope that response is helpful to the Deputy.</p></speech>

Would there be a reluctance to object to data centres when a local authority would be very reliant on funds accruing from rates and, if there is not conflict at an executive level, should there be?

Other colleagues might like to comment on the former point.  Under the national retrofit plan, there are plans for a one-stop shop and I understand a number of them have already registered with the SEAI.</p><p>That would be private householders on the local authority side in terms of retrofitting.  We are reliant on funding from central government for social housing etc., but the Deputy raised a good point.  There is an opportunity to have better models to meet the ambitious target of retrofitting the number of houses that require it.  We need to go into an area and deal with social houses and privately owned houses together rather than separately to get better bang for our buck from the Exchange and to do the work, for example, on a row of terraced houses as opposed to one or two along a road.  There is an opportunity to have public private partnership but the one-stop-shop model is in place through the national retrofit plan being managed through the SEAI.</p></speech>

I will bring in Deputy Smith if she is still online.  She indicated she wanted to contribute but she might have stepped out.</p><p>I appreciate the witnesses staying with us.  I have a question relating to the alignment of the work of local authorities <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the development plans, the operational decisions, the climate legislation and the 51% target and net zero target, both of which are set in law.  I alluded to some instances with which I am familiar that suggest that alignment is not quite there.  I am thinking of issues such as planning to build new roads, one-off housing, the chimney stacks issue I mentioned and the resistance to active travel development, notwithstanding the good progress that has been made.  Do both groups represented consider they are constrained by the upcoming local authority climate action plans and that is the route to playing their part in reaching the 51% target or is the responsibility broader than that?  Should we not be thinking of the 51% target in every decision we make because we all know it will be very difficulty to achieve it?  If we are going ahead and planning new roads or housing developments on the edges of urban areas or even further out that would be very car oriented developments, are we not pulling against the climate legislation?  I would be interested to hear the groups' views .  I am not sure who to ask to respond first.</p></speech>

As I said, there is timeline issue in that not every local authority is on the same point on the journey in adopting the county and city development plans.  In some cases there is an opportunity for alignment between the climate action plan we will all commence probably later on this year and the county development plans which are in the process of being reviewed.  In some cases where climate action adaptation plans include mitigation measures, there is the opportunity, as Mr. Dodd said, for those to be incorporated in the development plan that is being rolled out.  In cases where the development plans are already adopted, there is a challenge to merge the legal obligations that come with the climate action plan and the county development plan that has been adopted.  As a sector we need to begin to understand what emissions we are creating, how to measure them and how to reduce them.  That is something the sector, with the support of the climate action regional offices, is beginning to examine.  The guidelines developed to assist us to prepare our climate action plans will allow us to do that.  We have done good work on climate action in responding to climate change.  The sector has met its targets on energy efficiency.  That is as a result of a combined approach across all sections of-----</p></speech>

However, there is the planning side of it and the emissions that might be induced by the decisions made by local authorities, be that by the executive or reserved decisions.</p> <p>  Transport is the big one for me.  You could technically reduce emissions in any local authority by 51% or whatever is required but if you are planning and building roads all over the place, you are actually leading to a significant increase in emissions.  Does the CCMA see that as not being a matter for local authorities but for central government and the policies it brings through that would ultimately trickle down?</p></speech>

Again, we in the Atlantic seaboard south CARO are doing work on adaptation of our regional and local roads.  A significant element of that process is understanding the carbon element of how we manage, maintain and build our regional and local roads.  That is work we are beginning to do.

We are focused on understanding what the carbon implications are about ongoing works we do  - it is just one small example.  In the area of new roads we will be obliged to comply with the carbon budgets that impact on transportation.  We are a significant player in that but we are obliged to work alongside the likes of TII, the Department of Transport and the NTA to understand what our budget is going to be because we spend significant funds either from central government or from our own resources in the area of roads and transport, so we have a job of work to do to understand what our budgets are, but that would be in partnership with all of Government.</p></speech>

We have I think 500,000 public lights.  In and around 200,000 have already been retrofitted to LED, so they are significantly reducing the energy consumption but we need to understand how does that head over to reductions in overall emissions.  We have a programme to replace the other 300,000 between now and 2025 so we are going to see a significant energy efficiency but as to how that follows through in reductions in emissions, and real reductions in emissions, there is work to be done there.  We need to understand that not just on our own but in partnership with policymakers and Departments.  One thing is to replace every public light in the country with an LED that is a more energy-efficient source of light but we probably need to do more.  We probably need to get more out of that asset.  To get more out of that asset we probably need to understand what is involved in what is called trimming and dimming.  Do we dim the lights at certain times of day and do we do turn them off at certain times of the day?  These are significant policy decisions-----</p></speech>

Through the CARO, we are looking at putting together a framework for the appointment of specialists to look at carbon baselines both in our own activities and in those right across the counties.</p><p>In that way we can start looking at where action can be taken.  It has been said that some of our local authorities might meet their 2030 targets for carbon reduction by some of the actions taken such as the LED shift and the shift to electricity as a source of heating power for our buildings and that, combined with the greening of the network, would make us reach our targets.  However, that presumes nothing happens or there is no development.  We are a growing country and there are challenges and every additional industry and every additional head of population we have will bring about a carbon demand.  What we must get to is that situation where we can look at what the sources of the existing carbon load are and then what are the additionals.  We will have to make some national decisions on prioritising what actions we will take.</p><p> It is certainly a very complex area.  It is one where there are three different levels of carbon assessment that can be carried out at the moment.  The first tier of that is something we will be able to do initially but a lot of the information is not available for going to tiers 2 and 3, but that will have to be the basis of the establishment of our first climate action plans.  Based on those we will be looking, as I said, not only at our own sector and the areas we can directly control but we will also be providing information on sectors we must influence or sectors we may not have any control over at all and they will have to be brought to a national forum that will make some decisions on that as to where we take the action.</p><p> Much is said about agriculture and what it can and cannot achieve.  All of that will be in the context of a desire for that particular industry to grow and develop.  Other areas of activity in the State will also have to be considered and balanced against our needs.  For example, at the moment there is a Government policy document on electric vehicles, EVs, that has been published for consultation.  One of the areas we are trying to look at in that is the provision of EV chargers at transport hubs and park-and-ride locations so people living in rural areas who may not have access to public transport would be able to park their vehicles at a transport hub and be able to access cities and towns while charging their car and would be able to make the journey home.  There are a lot of intersectoral discussions that will have to take place and in many ways, the apportionment of the targets will have to be reviewed when we look at how successful we are in the first stages of making those improvements.</p></speech>

To go back to his point, and Mr. Mahon has touched on it, to achieve our targets over the next decade the practical measures that have been spoken about will help.  There is the retrofitting of our public lighting and of local authority houses and the electrification of the local authority fleet over the coming years.  They are concrete measures that can be taken.  The role of our elected members is to set the policy for the local authority in any given local authority.  When they are setting, reviewing or adopting that policy, it needs to be proofed for decarbonisation.  That is the challenge for our members going forward, namely, that they bring in that way of thinking, going forward.  These policy decisions, and major policy decision that they are taking need to be proofed for decarbonisation to ensure that not alone are the current climate action targets until 2030 achieved but also out to 2050, where we are looking for a 50% reduction in our emissions.</p></speech>

The interaction between spatial planning and climate action is a very significant strategic aspect and is not without its complexities.  For a sense as to what might happen in the future, all local authorities have been asked to nominate candidate de-carbonising zones.  Deputy Cronin will be aware that in the case of Kildare, Maynooth has been so designated.  That is where there is a concentration of adaptation, mitigation, biodiversity and good planning aspects.  They could probably be regarded as a test bed for what might happen in the future.  We are still awaiting guidelines on this but we would envisage that there will be a concentration of adaptation and mitigation measures in the areas of public realm, ensuring charging points are available, encouraging linkage with and the use of public transport, public lighting, local innovation and possibly local green enterprise.  There is a concentration of measures along with good sustainable planning, particularly co-ordination with the regional spatial and economic strategy.  Those de-carbonising activities will be a test bed for planning into the future.  It is a very significant strategic aspect.</p> <p>  Infrastructure was referred to.  Obviously, this would be a matter for future Government policy but there is provision in the public spending code and a methodology for calculating the carbon footprint of a piece of infrastructure.  I can see this coming more and more to the fore in the future, particularly in the context of grants, but, again, this is a matter for Government policy.  </p> <p>  The Office of the Planning Regulator was mentioned earlier.  This office is taking a very active interest.  The Office of the Planning Regulator reviews the plans of local authorities.  In the case of Kildare, the entire local area plan was looked at significantly through the lens of climate action and I know the Planning Regulator took a particular interest in that.  </p> <p>  We mentioned training earlier.  One aspect of our training is thematic specialist training.  One area that was identified - rightly so - at the outset was training in the area of spatial planning and climate action.  Some 290 staff - mainly planning staff - have been trained to date.  There is no question but that climate action is interweaving significantly with so many of our plans and programmes such as our local economic and community plans, economic development strategies and river basin management plans.  We have a suite of specialist training in areas such as spatial planning and flood risk management where some 379 staff have received very specialist training to date.  A training module in green procurement has been rolled out.  We have already produced a specialist module on energy.  I mentioned economic activity and local enterprise offices earlier.  A lot of research has been done on that and the benefits of that will be rolled out significantly through our training programmes.  I think the committee will appreciate that a lot is happening in that space.  There is a lot of complexity there.  Again, it is important to be strategic and to try to pull these things together at a strategic level be it through decarbonising zones, our training programme or various policies we have.  I hope this is helpful.  </p></speech>

I do not think that is a bad thing.  I think it is necessary.  First of all, it is a sign of a healthy democracy that people can have their views aired locally.  Many councillors and officials are on a journey.  Some of them are very climate-conscious while some are becoming more climate-conscious.  Everybody has a series of priorities and we are re-ordering those priorities.  That is true for councillors as well.  Realistically, what we would expect and what we find is that as the priorities of the people re-order so do the priorities of those who represent them, i.e.,  the councillors.  The councillors reflect public opinion.  Public opinion is changing-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022053100002#DD00200"><p>Public opinion is a challenge because some of this stuff is very difficult.  In Salthill, people say "hey, no, we don't want this".  How does the system say that this is really important and outline the benefits but also the reason we are doing it?  I would be very wary of expecting everybody to demand climate action.  Actually, the tendency might be to resist it and, therefore, progress falters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Bergin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022053100002#DD00300"><p>That is a very good point.  Touching on the just transition piece earlier, the burden must be shared across the community.  This challenges us to ensure that the plans we bring forward for discussion and adoption by councillors reflect that there is burden sharing there.  There are some people who are disproportionately asked to contribute due to their geographic location, socioeconomic position or whatever it is.  We must try to proof those plans to ensure that the councillors understand that they fairly represent the benefit to the community.  From the planning perspective, we are going to have conflict or constructive and lively discussion in the council chamber.  I do not think that is something we should try to avoid.  It is something we should welcome provided we get the right results at the end of the day.  I think that is a challenge for us as well as the executive to make sure we can bring it forward in a constructive way.</p></speech>

Is that to resource the enhanced CAROs or is it for the local authorities as well?  How does it break down in terms of thinking about staff numbers?  Do the witnesses from the CAROs have figures for how many people they think the CAROs will be hiring for that money?</p></speech>

That was &euro;11.5 million just for the local authority resources we identified.  That is broken down across the co-ordinators, energy managers, the climate action officer, the green solution specialist and the community officer.  It also takes into account that some local authorities have already filled these positions.  From the CARO enhanced structure, we were talking about an additional &euro;1.9 million to provide those additional resources to the CARO.</p></speech>

One theme that came up in various meetings was the challenge of delivering renewables at the scale that will be required.  It seems to me that it is every form of renewable - onshore wind, solar and off-shore wind.  One area for the CAROs is the prospect of local authority renewable energy strategies.  The Planning Regulator has appeared before this committee.</p><p>Various people at different forums have expressed concerns such as, for example, about the amount of land available to develop onshore wind energy.  The prospect of zoning areas as suitable in the context of the development of renewable energy gas been mooted.  I have a broad question on the challenge of delivering renewables at scale and the types of changes involved, such as in terms of planning processes.  For example, we know there is a lack of regulation and updated guidelines in respect of onshore wind.  We do not have any for solar.  This creates an environment that is not healthy for planning because it leads to developer-led speculation in what is already a challenging planning environment.  It makes it even more challenging.  This is my perspective.  What is the sense of the witnesses about what needs to change to deliver renewables at the scale they are needed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paddy Mahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022053100002#EE00200"><p>In general, the Deputy is right.  We are operating on the basis of interim guidelines for wind energy.  Finalised guidelines would be very welcome.  City and county development plans are required by the regulator to identify areas where each jurisdiction can positively contribute towards the national targets in terms of renewable energy.  I will ask Mr. Dodd to go into a bit more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Dodd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022053100002#EE00300"><p>It is quite a broad question.  At national level we have the national planning framework and at regional level there are regional assemblies that identify regional policy objectives for renewables, such as the identification of renewables zones.  At local level there are the county and city development plans.  There are also existing and future climate action plans to try to identify renewable elements.  Speaking on behalf of the climate action regional office I work in, we have the benefit of working with Codema, which is an energy agency that has developed a regional energy master plan.  It is being formally launched tomorrow and there will be a webinar on it.  Codema works directly with the four Dublin local authorities to identify opportunities in heat and transport to find solutions that can reduce the emissions in those sectors.  These solutions could be district heating in Dublin city from the waste-to-energy plant or from data centres in south Dublin.  There is also the potential for offshore energy.  Depending on the location there are other possibilities.  For example, Ireland is certainly a laggard in using anaerobic digestion, whether it be slurry or food waste, compared with other countries in Europe.  This is linked to the regulatory regime.  There is no attractive feed-in tariff for the private sector and farmers to get involved.</p> <p>  There is a broad range of opportunities.  In terms of local authorities it is very much dependent on the national regulatory framework that has been set to meet the targets, such as in terms of a percentage of renewables by a particular date.  Deputy O'Rourke mentioned solar power.  We are slow in this regard nationally.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, opened the first large-scale solar farm in recent weeks.  The planning perspective is not an area that climate action regional offices get involved in.  We were set up on an adaptation footing and have moved into climate action mitigation.  With regard to this enhanced structure there is a need for wider capacity in terms of energy managers regionally and at local authority level to help drive the renewable transition.  There certainly are opportunities that local authorities can avail of.</p> <p>  With regard to decarbonising zones, as Mr. Boland mentioned there is an opportunity for test beds for renewables and for public private partnerships.  There is already an example of community-owned wind infrastructure in Tipperary.  It took a long time to get through the system.  We need to make community-owned energy opportunities much more streamlined.  We need to reduce the time involved.  In July there will be a package to allow domestic owners and people who have made investment in solar and micro-scale wind to get a feed-in tariff for excess energy.</p><p>These are all incentives that can help to drive us to meet our renewable targets.  We are very much reliant on the regulatory system aligning to enable us to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022053100002#FF00200"><p>I want to ask about cars and transport generally.  We certainly have to encourage people onto active modes and sustainable transport.  For those who need them, we have to transition to electric vehicles to a certain extent.  The extent is arguable.  A total of 20% of our national emissions are associated with driving.  A lot of emissions are associated with electric vehicles as well as with fossil fuel vehicles.  We really need to not lean on them as a solution.  We need a plan for cars.  We really need to look at how much car parking we provide.  We must also look at traffic management and the prioritisation of certain modes.</p> <p>  I do not know whether any of our guests are with Dublin City Council, but it has done tremendous work in prioritising the more sustainable modes.  It seems we need to go a lot further in this regard.  We need to change our thinking.  Historically, it has been that we need to keep traffic flowing and solve congestion.  In the past there may have been an economic benefit to this.  Certainly, it was felt this was a very important objective.  This needs to fundamentally change if we agree that cars, whether they are electric vehicles or fossil fuel vehicles, are a problem.  What is the thinking in the system with regard to traffic management and the prioritisation of active and sustainable modes of transport over the private car?  I am speaking from experience.  The local authority I came through is certainly on a journey.  Some really good work has been done in recent years but it seems there is still a long way to go.  We are still falling back on the old conventional thinking that we need to get cars through our cities.  When we think like this decisions on bus lanes, cycle lanes and wider footpaths become much more difficult.  I do not know whether the witnesses want to comment on this observation.</p></speech>

Every city and county council has resources in place, and they are beginning to put together active travel programmes.  This is a sign of our commitment.  Some of the biggest challenges we will face over the coming months and years will be delivering on the ambition we have with regard to having more suitable town and city centres for pedestrians and people who want to come into our towns and cities and engage and gradually removing cars from those centres.  This depends on the situation and the level of alternative access to our towns and cities.  There is definitely a strategy to make our towns and cities much more attractive and safer for the people who want to come in and use them.  We have begun this journey.  Some parts of the country are ahead of others.  Our engagement with the NTA and the Department of Transport has put in place resources to be followed by sustainable transport plans for all of our major towns and cities.</p><p> We need to look at our villages as well.  We need to look at safe routes to school schemes and at how our children get to school.  Most of the traffic generated in our towns, villages and cities around the country, and many of the headaches and issues around it, relate to how our children go to school.  We need to look at that.  That is not just a matter of changing the infrastructure.  This is a matter of changing culture and changing people's minds.  As I said earlier, we are beginning that journey.  It is a significant one.  We will need clear plans and a clear vision and buy-in from all our communities, businesses and enterprises, if we are to begin to demonstrate that taking away car parking spaces and replacing them with outdoor dining and outdoor public ground spaces is to be of benefit to their businesses and not a hindrance to doing business in towns and city centres.</p></speech>

It is a priority for Dublin city.  We have an executive manager-director who has been appointed solely to lead that.  This is to create the critical mass in Dublin City Council, both from a resource point of view and from a strategic focus point of view, to allow us to deliver on it.  I think one of the unintended consequences of Covid-19 was to allow us to bring to market a number of solutions in Dublin that demonstrated they could work without having to convince people in theory that they worked.  We have by accident, and by design now, found ourselves in a position where active travel is demonstrable on the ground in Dublin.  The benefits of it are clear.</p> <p>  In terms of EV charging, that follows behind that in this model shift.  We do not want different types of traffic.  We want less traffic in relation to it.  That said, we are on a path in relation to our EV charging which fits in that broader context.  Having the active travel piece first allows us then to slot another jigsaw piece into that, but informed by that modal-shift-first policy.  A regional EV charging strategy is being launched on 13 July.  The focus will be that this is not the solution but a consequence of the modal shift.  It will not, therefore, be all things to all people.  It is a consequence of the active travel.</p></speech>

I do not think we have a choice here.  So many of our streets are limited in width.  We see it on Capel Street and we see it on the quays.  I come up every Tuesday morning and I cycle from Heuston Station to Leinster House and the change is incredible.  It may be by accident, because Dublin City Council has been trying to put in some segregated infrastructure for ten years, but it seized the moment when Covid-19 came along.  It is there now and proven.  I see the number of cyclists who are using it.  While I am not suggesting we should have another pandemic, I pay tribute to Dublin City Council and other local authorities on the work, including my own in Limerick.  They have done some very good work and they took that chance.  We need to see a lot more of that reallocation of road space and a lot more thinking around parking, removing parking and, as Mr. Mahon said, getting the cars out of our towns and our villages and reducing the net total of private vehicles in the system.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for those answers.  I have interrogated them for long enough so we will finish up.  I thank them sincerely for coming in and for their time and contributions and the hard work they do in the various offices at local level.  So much of climate action is going to be channelled through them and I certainly wish them well.</p> <p>  Central government and the Oireachtas generally want this to work.  It is important we hear those calls.</p><p>The calls for resources are timely.  That is a strong message.  We will certainly relay it back.  I thank all the contributors.</p></speech>

They are keen we receive an update on the current situation and on issues the Irish Government and Parliament should be engaged in.  They are very welcome to our meeting.  Mr. Yermak is joining us from Ukraine via Microsoft Teams.  I understand he must be excused after about one hour so we will engage with him in the earlier part of our meeting, subject to interpretation.  We are very pleased Mr. Yermak can join us.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that we will hear opening statements followed by a discussion with questions and answers with members of the committee.  I ask members to be concise in their questions so that everyone can have an opportunity to participate.</p> <p>  Witnesses and members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them in any way identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if any speaker makes statements that may be potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that any such direction is complied with.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the parliamentary campus at Leinster House, there are some limitations as to parliamentary privilege and they might not benefit from the same level of immunity in respect of legal proceedings as a witness physically present in our committee room does.</p> <p>  I am very pleased to call on Mr. Yermak to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak to you today.  It is three months now since we have been resisting one of the largest armies in the world.  I am sure members are among those Europeans who do not need any explanation as to why we are doing this and what it is for.  They simply know.  If by any chance they do not, then they can ask Bono, the Edge, and U2.  They played in the Ukrainian subway while above ground there was an air raid alarm.  They saw everything for themselves.  Bono said we are fighting not only for our freedom, but also for your freedom.  He made a lot of sense when he said that.  It is indeed true.</p> <p>  Today we are without exaggeration the shield for Europe.  Ireland was one of the first countries to reach out to help Ukraine in the very first hours of the fully-fledged Russian aggression against Ukraine.  We are grateful to the people and the Government of Ireland for their support, for the immediate cancellation of visas and for establishing the most favourable conditions for refugees from Ukraine.  We are also grateful for the Republic of Ireland's consistent position throughout eight years of Russian aggression against Ukraine, in confirming, and in being consistent with, international norms and law and not acknowledging the annexation and illegal invasion of Ukrainian territories.</p><p>During these eight years, the world did not succeed in stopping Russia.  The world did not manage to hold back Russia's imperial ambitions.  Unpunishable and unpunished evil always becomes stronger.</p><p> Ukraine has not submitted to Russia.  For more than three months now, Ukraine has resisted and the Kremlin cannot subdue us.  As a result, it has started its destruction.  It has started destroying the industrial and economic potential of our country.  Regular missile and air strikes shell communities and settlements and critical infrastructure sites to make sure it achieves this goal.  The looting of the occupied territories is large-scale and systemic in its character.  This shows that looting has become the basis of the state policy of the Russian Federation in these territories.  In the southern district, which is under the control of the Russian Federation, it has taken more than one hundred thousand tonnes of Ukrainian wheat while at the same time it is not providing the green corridors for the export of our agricultural products.  This is obviously blackmail.  This is outright blackmail of the international community by creating a shortage and deficit of food.  Ukraine was the guarantor of food security and safety for 400 million people in the world before this.</p><p> This is the fourth type of blackmail that the Kremlin has used during its aggression against Ukraine.  Previously, the European Union has been threatened with energy restrictions, a possible emergency at one of the captured nuclear power plants and with strikes using nuclear weapons.  We do not know what else the Kremlin will do as it strives to gain superiority.  We do not know for sure and this is why Russia needs to be stopped.</p><p> It is difficult for us now.  Some 5 million people have fled our country because of the warfare and hostilities.  The same number - 5 million people - are internally displaced in Ukraine.  Thousands of peaceful citizens have died during the Russian aggression.  The war has taken 35% of Ukrainian GDP.  We have lost more than 200 plants and factories and our direct loses surmount $600 billion.</p><p> Despite this, Ukraine continues to defend itself.  In the east and in the south, the heavy fighting is still going on.  We have to win.  Otherwise, Ukraine will simply disappear.  Our nation and our country will continue to exist as long as we win.  Our victory will depend on the amount of assistance provided by the international community to Ukraine.  I mean any assistance - military, technical, political, financial and humanitarian.  Extremely important support for Ukraine in pushing back against the aggression is the strengthening sanctions and continuing sanction pressure against Russia.  Therefore, strengthening sanction pressure is extremely important.</p><p> I would like to highlight to members an initiative established by President Zelenskyy.  I am honoured to spearhead a group of international experts and together with a former US ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, this group has already presented two documents, namely, the sanction strengthening plan and the sanction roadmap.  These include very detailed recommendations and guidelines regarding the co-ordination and agreed steps regarding the sanctions.</p><p>I am glad to state that certain recommendations have already been implemented.</p><p> Ukraine welcomes the movement of the European Union towards the introduction of the sixth sanction package.  The key element in this sixth package is a full embargo on Russian oil.  This has to be done as soon as possible because energy and energy resources contribute the lion's share of the revenues of the Russian budget.  Therefore, by purchasing oil, Europe is funding the Russian military machine.  The European Union has responded to the Russian aggression by gradually increasing the sanctions and the supplies of weapons to Ukraine.  This is taking too long and is inefficient.  We are proposing to change the approach.  We should do something the Russians are not expecting us to do.  We should introduce a massive, large-scale sanction blow while at the same time increase as much as possible the supplies of heavy weaponry to the Ukrainian military.  This will not only help rescue and save thousands of lives, but it will also allow us to avoid the lengthy and long-term war that Russia is already getting ready for.  We are asking members to send this message and to communicate to partners in the European Parliament how important such a step would be.  We would also be grateful for political and any other support and assistance and for receiving weapons that Ukraine needs so badly.</p><p> Of not least importance is the continuation of the sanction pressure on Russia.  This is one of the safeguards against further attempts of aggression against Ukraine and will also provide an additional mechanism of security guarantees.  The working group for this purpose, which I am spearheading with the former Secretary General of NATO, Anders Rasmussen, is already working on developing possible ways of putting together such mechanisms.  We would be very happy to see representatives of Ireland in that group.  Ireland is a country with a very rich experience of peacekeeping operations.</p><p> I would like to use this opportunity to congratulate Ireland on beginning its presidency of the Committee of Ministers in the Council of Europe.  I would also like to propose including on the committee's agenda the question of member states' compliance with their commitments to, and obligations as regards, a common sanction policy as well investigation of the war crimes of the Russian military.</p><p> It is not an exaggeration to say that Ireland is a technological and financial hub of Europe.  Sometimes multinational corporations try to do their business as usual as long as they can.  As regards Russia, however, business as usual in this case is simply facilitating the aggression.  It does not matter what the business is about.  Moscow has continually demonstrated its ability to use the elements of hybrid war even in its co-operation in the humanitarian area.  We should not forget that this always ends with the provoking civil and citizen conflicts, undercover operations and political killings.</p><p> When we ask for support; we are not talking about charity.  This is an investment.  This is an investment in a common European security, in a common European future.  For these reasons, among others, Ukraine is considering prospective membership of the European Union.  Ukraine has paid a big price for its choice.</p><p>Ukraine has paid a big price for its choice and continues to pay for it.  Every vote in favour of Ukraine and the support counts.  That is why I would like to ask all those present today to do whatever it takes to help Ukraine implement its European perspective as soon as possible.</p><p> We hear continually that one of the barriers to Ukraine joining the EU is corruption.  We have to be honest.  In terms of the European Union, the corruption, which is nourished by Russia, really contributed and became a stumbling stone to this question.  We have to put an end to it.  We were enraptured by what Irish fishermen did when they protected Ireland's exclusive economic zone from the drills of the Russian fleet.  This was a witty and beautiful step and I am sure that this famous talent of the Irish people will help Ukrainians a lot as well.</p><p> Today and at the end of the war we will rebuild our green country.  I bet Johnny Cash could find "Forty Shades of Green" in Ukraine.</p><p> Our government has already been working to put the U-24 recovery plan in place.  Ukraine's recovery is based on two main principles: regional and parametric.  The regional approach or principle is about partners helping Ukraine in rebuilding and reviving a certain region, city or community.  A parametric approach or principle is about rebuilding according to the contemporary parameters and standards of the European Union.  We suggest and propose to Ireland that it takes part in this programme.  Following on from the invitation of President Zelenskyy, I would like to also invite Ireland to help us in building and revitalising some of this.</p><p> We have a broad spectrum of possible areas of co-operation starting with agriculture, the pharmaceutical industry, the food sector, machine building, services - you name it.  I would like to emphasise the IT sector, in particular.  Even before the war, Ukraine introduced a ground-breaking and a revolutionary in nature taxation regime, which is called Diia City.  It is still very efficient and operational even in the current circumstances.</p><p> Our future security will depend among other things on the ability to adapt and introduce new technology such as artificial intelligence and automatic management cyber protection.  Ukraine could successfully co-operate with Ireland as it is a highly technological country in these particular areas.  As is said in Ireland, success is about getting up one time more than you fall down.  This is what we need to do.  Please help us to do so.  I am sure members will see for themselves that Ukraine will be grateful and will pay back in kindness.  I thank members very much for their attention.  We are ready to answer questions.</p></speech>

That was a very thought-provoking address and hopefully for us an action-provoking address.  I acknowledge the address some weeks ago of President Zelenskyy.  He had a very strong message for us in Ireland and we were very grateful that he took the time to address our Parliament.  Similarly, I am grateful to you, the head of his office and chief of staff, for joining us in our parliamentary committee.</p> <p>  I said to members that we have something of a challenge because you have about 15 or 20 minutes.  I will ask the ambassador, H.E. Ms Gerasko, to wait for a moment to allow for some direct questions to you.  We will resume with an update on the situation in Ireland with the ambassador and Mrs. Shaloput.  I would say to the members that we do not have time for speeches or observations.  I ask them to put direct questions to you, Mr. Yermak.  I am going to start with Deputy Cowen.</p> <p>  I would say to you, Mr. Yermak, that in spite of all the apparent insurmountable challenges you face that you still had time to mix seriousness with humour.  You managed to do something nobody else has ever done, which is to invoke the name of Johnny Cash at our committee.  Can I say in response to your reference to Johnny Cash that this committee "will walk the line" with you by declaring our support and our loyalty in the same way the message was portrayed in the most famous of Johnny Cash songs?</p><p>I thank you for being with us.</p><p> I will go straight to questions and will start with Deputy Cowen, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and Deputy Berry.  We will take three or four questions together.  I would ask you, Mr. Yermak, to respond before departing.</p></speech>

We are very appreciative of him for making himself available along with the ambassador and the representatives here today.  We acknowledge and appreciate the grave difficulties his country and its people are facing in the form of Russia's illegal and barbaric act, namely, the invasion.  As alluded to by the Chair, we are delighted that our people, our country and our Government are in a position to ensure we can offer a safe haven for Ukrainian refugees and to contribute handsomely to the European peace fund.  Our support for Ukrainian accession to the EU is steadfast, and so much so that our Taoiseach is to the fore in seeking to ensure it is done in a timely fashion rather than having to go through the same criteria previous applicants have had to go through.</p> <p>  We note Mr. Yermak's comments in relation to the request for Europe to continue and even increase the pace of sanctions - economic and otherwise - against Russia.  We acknowledge and appreciate that request, irrespective of the impact it could have on our own economy.  It is a small price for us to pay to support the Ukrainian people and its country and government.</p> <p>  My only question might be seen as a very simplistic question but comes as a result of the previous comment in relation to sanctions.  People ask whether Ukraine can defeat or repel the Russians.  It obviously can not be done alone. Thankfully, the wider world order is behind Ukrainian defence.  Ukraine may be dependent on the sanction as the best weapon to see success, or to see this illegal and barbaric invasion off.  Does Mr. Yermak think the Russian Government or even its media will ever change its imperialist mindset which seems to have engulfed the regime in recent times?</p></speech>

I am conscious of the Chair's advice to keep things succinct but I want to assure our visitors of our continued solidarity and support for the people of Ukraine.  There have been a number of references to Europe and what we could be doing at an EU level.  I would like to get the view around Ireland's position on the UN Security Council and how we may utilise that position.  We have a very proud record of peacekeeping around the world but we also have a very proud record and experience of peace building.  Whether it is in terms of peace building negotiations and, indeed, humanitarian support at a UN level, I would like to hear the views on what we could encourage people to do.</p></speech>

Is there anything we can do in terms of providing support or provisions to help those who have been internally displaced and are still in Ukraine at this moment?</p></speech>

To answer the first question, if Ukraine receives all the weapons that we have requested and if there is a powerful sanction blow and policies introduced against Russia, we will succeed and we shall win.  This will not just be a Ukrainian victory.  This will be the victory of all our partners and allies as well.</p> <p>  Regarding the question as to whether the Russian Federation can change, we all have to understand that Russia does not understand and is not capable of hearing and listening to the language of dialogue.  Instead, what it understands and what it does is to use the language of power and blackmail.  Historically, it has come to do so.  Of course, if the situation changes and there is victory and the democratic will prevails, then after a certain number of years, maybe we would see some change in the Russian Federation.  This will only happen if the things I have just mentioned materialise, namely, the fully fledged weaponry and military support for Ukraine, sanctions and the consolidated position of the whole democratic world.</p> <p>  Regarding the question pertaining to Ireland's possible support in peacekeeping and peace building, Ireland is indeed famous for this particular policy and that support would be extremely important for Ukraine these days.  I will now explain what these steps could look like.</p> <p>  First of all, in the humanitarian area, Russia has practically blocked the procedure of exchanging people.  I mean people who were arrested in the occupied territory and, of course, people from Azovstal in Mariupol.  This procedure is not happening and possible mediation through the United Nations and through other organisations will be very important and much appreciated.  </p> <p>  Thousands of Ukrainian children were illegally deported to Russia or to the occupied territories.  On the initiative of the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, we have now created a special group which has started working very hard to find these children and to prevent this illegal procedure.  Just a couple of days ago, Putin signed a special law stating how Russians can adopt Ukrainian children in an absolutely illegal way.  It is a big problem for us and now the President has given a very serious signal to the Government and to all Ukrainian institutes to work hard in this direction.  We would appreciate if Ireland could participate in this job.</p> <p>  The programme of food security is of course very important.  Russia has blocked practically all Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea.  Now we are working with the United Nations, the United States and Turkey on how to unblock these ports and how to create humanitarian corridors and opportunities to export our harvest, the grains and other agricultural products.  As I said in my statement, Ukraine is a big player in the food market.  This is the biggest problem. We are currently working with many of our partners, including Mr. Guterres, but it is all still on the negotiation table.  I think Ireland's voice and position will be very important.</p> <p>  I think we still have time and the committee will have the opportunity to ask more questions.  The last question involved the people who have had to leave their city and their home places to travel but who are still in the territory of Ukraine.  We have a special programme to support these people.  They are mostly concentrated in the west of Ukraine.  We would be very appreciative of any programmes of humanitarian help for these people.  Our ministry of infrastructure is now looking at a special quick-build house programme where people could stay before they get the opportunity to return.  We can connect our minister who carries out work with this group of the people with the Irish Government and they can communicate directly.  In general, we would be appreciative of any humanitarian help because millions of our people are affected.  The stress on our economy and the situation of our economy during these hundred days of the war means it is very difficult.  Thank you.</p></speech>

Unless there are other pressing issues, I will express my appreciation and thanks on behalf of the committee to Mr. Yermak for his address, his presence and his very direct message to the Irish Parliament.

As always, this committee welcomes the presence of H.E. Ms Gerasko and her deputy chief, Mrs. Shaloput.  Would you like to address us by making a brief opening address?  We can then take up some of the issues as already discussed.

I did not prepare a statement because our main speaker was the chief of the President's office.  As the committee knows, almost 33,000 Ukrainians have arrived in Ireland.  It is a huge number for your country.</p> <p>  I would like to share the results of a survey with the committee.  One of the Ukrainian organisations in Ireland has conducted the first big survey among Ukrainians who arrived in Ireland after 24 February.  This organisation received 2,191 answers from people in 26 counties in just one week.  This accounts for 6.6% of the newly arrived Ukrainian population in Ireland.  First, 92% of Ukrainians are very grateful to Ireland while another 8% are just grateful for the support and help and for everything.  Some 16% of Ukrainians and their children do not have a home to return to because it has been either damaged or destroyed.  There is active fighting going on in the home cities of 43% of the Ukrainians in Ireland.  Some 73% of newly arrived Ukrainians are willing to actively contribute to the economy.  They are either already working or are actively looking for a job.  Some 24% have found a job but unfortunately only one in five of these jobs matches their professional qualifications.  One of the main obstacles in this regard is a knowledge of English at a working level.  Finding long-term accommodation, access to healthcare, transportation and access to necessary infrastructure are among the most painful subjects in the survey.  Some 21.6% of the respondents do not have a pharmacy within walking distance while some 30% do not have a supermarket.</p> <p>  One of the main problems is long-term accommodation because most of the Ukrainians are living in hotels right now.  It is a problem for them.  They move from one hotel to another one.  It is not a problem for adults but it is a problem for the children because they have to change schools often.  It is a bit traumatic for children.  Almost 100% of Ukrainians who have arrived in Ireland are really very happy and are very grateful to the country and to the Irish people for the support, help and for everything.</p></speech>

The members of the committee are at something of a disadvantage because we have not seen the data.  Having regard to what you have said, we acknowledge your kind words in terms of the very high degree of satisfaction.  We welcome that.  I am sure there are other aspects of the survey which we could have a look at in terms of our engagement with agencies and with Government.  If possible,could the data be shared at an early stage with the committee members?  We would have an opportunity then to reflect on it and perhaps be in a position to respond.  We will be meeting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in July but I am sure there are other issues for other Departments that we will be very keen to take up on your behalf should the results of the survey warrant such an intervention.  It seems that in the areas of schools, healthcare, jobs and childcare the situation is somewhat evolving.</p> <p>  Let us not pretend there are not challenges.  There are challenges and we hope the circumstances of these challenges would be resolved smoothly.  I note that in some communities outside of Dublin, in particular, there has been a very strong community response.  Deputy Stanton is with us and, as a former Minister of State in the Department of Justice, he pioneered the community support response in respect of previous instances of migration challenges.  Deputy Stanton may have a comment to make to H.E. Ms Gerasko.  I will then take a question, observation or comment from Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.</p></speech>

People are working hard and there is a lot going on in my area.  Hubs have been set up where people from Ukraine can collect clothes and other essentials they may not be in a position to purchase.  These were donated by local people and volunteers man these particular hubs.  They have proved to be very effective.</p> <p>  I am aware of some Ukrainians who have taken jobs here.</p><p>The fact we have Ukrainian children in schools has meant schools can retain teachers, especially in some rural areas where numbers were falling.</p><p> I have a question for the ambassador.  Ukraine is a huge country and there is awful, vicious fighting going on and terrible atrocities in the east and in the south.  We condemn them out of hand.  Could the ambassador tell us what the situation is in the centre and in the west of the country?  I know some Ukrainian people are considering returning to the centre and to the west around Lviv and cities like that.  Is it safe for them to do so?  What would the ambassador's advice be to people who have come here but are not sure as to whether it is safe to return?  It is mainly women and children who have come here.  Their husbands, parents and grandparents are still back in Ukraine.  Could the ambassador give us some advice in respect of that?  If people want to go back, how it would be done?  What supports can the embassy provide and what can be done to assist people who want to go back to visit family for a temporary period and then return here?</p></speech>

She has a huge and significant piece of work ahead of her in terms of the mechanics of supporting our new Ukrainian community who are settling here.  There are huge mechanical issues around housing, health provision and education, which need to be dealt with in the short term.  The issue I would like to put to the ambassador is probably more of a medium-to-long-term one but I want to flag it with her to see if there is anything we can work on moving forward.  It will particularly impact on Ukrainian people who make their homes in Border communities.  The ambassador may be aware that legislation has passed in the British Parliament requiring non-Irish and non-British citizens to avail of a travel visa if they want to travel into our Six Counties in the North because they are unfortunately entering a jurisdiction that has been taken out of the EU.  Has the ambassador had any engagement with her counterpart in the UK or any engagement with the Executive in the North of Ireland to raise this issue in the medium and long term?  We want people coming to Ireland to be able to enjoy and to avail of all of Ireland but, in particular, we want Ukrainian people who may settle in Border communities to live in the same way that their neighbours live.  They may need to do their shopping in the North.  They may need to send their kids to school in the North.  I appreciate it is a very bespoke question.  While it may not be the main issue facing the ambassador's community now, it could become an issue for a significant number of Ukrainian people as they settle in the medium and long term.</p> <p>  I appreciate the ambassador may not be across the detail of all of that just yet.  It is perhaps something we can engage on going forward.  I would like work to be done with colleagues in the North of Ireland and for the ambassador's colleague, the ambassador in London, to be aware of the impact this legislation could have on Ukrainian people coming to Ireland.</p></speech>

I know the ambassador and her colleague have been to County Cavan and have seen how close it is to the Border.  We have quite a few Ukrainian people located or relocated to Cavan and they are very welcome.</p> <p>  In the last week or so, there have been reports of some difficulties particularly within residential settings where people with Ukrainian citizenship and passports who left there many years ago to live in Russia are now here as refugees.  There seems to be some difficulties in some of those centres among refugees who left Ukraine at the start of the war and people with Ukrainian passports and Ukrainian citizenship who left Russia.  Could the ambassador elaborate a little bit on that?  What procedures have been put in place to try to ensure this is rectified as soon as possible?  It is something we should be taking up as well but I am interested to hear her point of view.  Has she received many complaints and how is that being dealt with?</p> <p>  On the situation in Ukraine regarding medical supplies, pharmaceutical supplies, medicines, etc., I know the ambassador requested that this Government would do its best to supply medical equipment, in particular.  What is the situation in relation to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1587" speakername="Cathal Berry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022053100002#J00900"><p>I have a couple of brief questions.  The ambassador and her team are most welcome again.  I thank her for updating us on that very important survey.  It is great hear some very positive findings from it.  As the Chair said, it would be great get a copy of the documentation just from an evidence based point of view.</p> <p>  My first question is on the number of displaced Ukrainians in Ireland at the moment.  The number seems to have stabilised around 33,000.  I know it is very difficult to forecast but does the embassador think it is likely that this number will continue to stabilise or does she see a continuing flow from both Ukraine and from the wider European Union into Ireland?  Is 33,000 a number we can go firm on to some extent?</p> <p>  I am familiar with international reports that a number of days ago Lithuania, through a crowdfunding mechanism, raised US$5.4 million to buy a drone to assist the Ukrainian armed forces, and I am conscious of Mr. Yermak's appeal for defence and protective weapons to win the conflict in Ukraine.  Could that same model work in Ireland?  The ambassador is aware of my position in favour of giving projective and defensive weapons but I recognise the Irish Government does not want to do this at this time.  A large number of people have contacted me directly saying they would like to make a contribution even if the State is unwilling to do so at the moment.  Does the ambassador think a similar crowdfunding mechanism could be used in Ireland to provide similar technology to the Ukrainian armed forces?  Is this something we should consider exploring?</p></speech>

There is no safe place in Ukraine.  Russia has dropped bombs many times in places not far from Lviv, near the Hungarian border and in Ivano-Frankivsk.  It has attacked many objects of infrastructure in the western part of Ukraine.  Most of our Ukrainian internally displaced people have moved to central and western parts of Ukraine.  It is a challenge for the western parts of Ukraine because they are less populated and the people here face challenges with accommodation.</p><p>It is safer there than in the north or the east.</p><p> We receive a huge number of letters, calls and visits from our Ukrainian citizens in the embassy, so our consul literally works 24-7.  Our citizens need consular assistance in order to obtain a new passport, to get translations or other documents, etc.  We provide consultations in order to better explain the Irish rules to our Ukrainians.  We do everything.</p><p> I have not had any engagement with the UK.  I do not know the situation with regard to the movement of Ukrainian displaced people or refugees.  Due to privacy law, it is hard to get the number of Ukrainians living in County Kerry or in other counties.  We do not have any information on how many people have moved illegally to Northern Ireland.  My colleague, the Ukrainian ambassador in the UK, does not have the number.  We are not engaged in this process.</p><p> I am very well informed about the situation regarding tension between some of our Ukrainian citizens.  I know about some incidents in counties Cavan, Kerry and Dublin.  I am in contact with the representative of the Department of Justice and we discuss on a case-by-case basis how our Ukrainian nationals can get protection here if they travel from Russia or other non-EU countries and not from Ukraine.  We have some examples of even sexual abuse and of many other situations.  Unfortunately, our women are sometimes fearful of calling the Garda.  There is, however, a small number of such incidents.</p><p> With regard to medical supplies, we need medicine and medical kits.  The ministry for health in Ukraine updates a list weekly of what we need in order to save the lives of our civilians and our military.  </p><p> With regard to Deputy Berry's question, I know about the fundraising in Lithuania where $5 million was collected to buy a Bayraktar.  It was amazing.  As far as I know, Irish legislation permits you to collect money for humanitarian aid if you have a charity account.  The question is whether a humanitarian aid or not.  I do not know.</p></speech>

According to our Ukrainian statistics, the number of Ukrainians returning home exceeds the number leaving.  It has plateaued now.  This number has more or less stabilised.  Everything depends on the situation in Ukraine.  When the Ukrainian military pushed back the Russian troops, people started returning home.  If the situation deteriorates, more people will flee the country.</p></speech>

Shortly after the start of the unlawful invasion, on Saturday, 26 February, you emailed members of the committee and other Members of the Houses being the friends of Ukraine.  You posed a series of 21 issues you would like addressed by the Irish Parliament.  I am not going to deal with them now but could you update the committee on these 21 issues?   Some have been implemented and more have been partly implemented.  You might be in a position to advise us on the ones that are still outstanding.  In that letter, you outlined particular sanctions of an economic and a political nature that Ireland could engage in on the basis of our relationship with certain Russian business or entities.  If your office has time, I would be grateful if over the next week or so you revisited the questions and let us know of progress.  We are very keen to ensure that issues posed by you some months ago were addressed by the Irish authorities in a manner we hope you find acceptable.</p> <p>  The only other issue I would like to raise with you while you are here - it was mentioned by Mr. Yermak - is in respect of the current blockade and the fact that convoys of ships and boats with vital food are unable to access the Black Sea.</p><p>Mr. Yermak mentioned that some western and NATO assistance would be required.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile referred to Ireland's membership of the United Nations Security Council earlier.  Is there a role for Ireland or any way we might assist to ensure appropriate naval convoys are assembled to ensure protection for ships leaving Ukraine with vital food and grain?  Are there any alternative routes that might be sought?  Road and rail were certainly mentioned but I am not sure how feasible they would be having regard to the quantities involved.</p></speech>

Next week we will revise all those questions and will let you know what the situation is.  With regard to the situation in the Black Sea, Russia has unfortunately taken control of the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov, and the port of Mariupol has been destroyed.  Russia's war against Ukraine is a threat to global food security.  According to my data, 22 million tones of food products remain locked in Ukraine.  Russia has rejected Ukraine's proposal to establish humanitarian corridors to export Ukrainian grain.  As Mr. Yermak mentioned, Russia is blackmailing the world by using the threat of hunger as a weapon.  Russia has mined in the Black Sea and it is impossible now to get coal to our ports.  Unfortunately, this is the situation.  We would be very grateful to Ireland for its support and assistance in resolving this situation.  As Mr. Yermak mentioned, Ireland has very good experience of peaceful settlement, negotiation and peace talks.  We are sure your experience and your efforts will be very valuable to Ukraine.</p></speech>

You have raised a number of issues that will require some follow up and consequent action on our part and you are going to share the information from the survey.</p> <p>  I acknowledge again the presence earlier of Mr. Yermak, the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine.

It was decided that the titles of State companies and institutions would be in Irish in the future.  This is the first point where &quot;Coimisi&uacute;n&quot;, or &quot;Commission&quot; in English, appears in this Bill.  Rather than start where we do not mean to be, we should take the opportunity to amend this, so An Coimisi&uacute;n Toghch&aacute;in would be known thereafter as &quot;Coimisi&uacute;n&quot; in the legislation.  It is not a major chance but it is in line with the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021.  Many amendments related to the Irish language are tied to the provisions in that Act.</p></speech>

As it is the Government's intention to commence the Act, I cannot see why it cannot be done.  I will happily withdraw them on the basis that we will look at it again.  I will submit them again anyway to ensure that there is a debate at that Stage.  The delay in commencement is a procedural delay.  If this Bill completed Committee Stage this week and came before the D&aacute;il in two weeks' time, which is technically possible, the Act may not be commenced by then.

Amendment No. 2 amends section 3 of the Bill, concerning repeals, to include the repeal of section 85 of the Electoral Act 1992 that provides for early island voting.  The repeal of section 85 of the Electoral Act 1992 will remove provisions that currently allow returning officers to take the poll on islands in D&aacute;il elections, presidential elections and referendums up to five days before the polling day appointed by the Minister, if in the opinion of the returning officer it may be impracticable, owing to stress of weather or transport difficulties, to either take the poll on the polling day appointed by the Minister or to deliver the ballot boxes to the count centre by 9 a.m. on the following day, if the poll goes ahead on polling day.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 104 to 109, inclusive, insert a new Part 7 into the Bill, which amends the Electoral Act 1992, the Presidential Elections Act 1993, the Referendum Act 1994, the Local Elections Regulations 1995, the Local Government Act 2001 and the European Parliament Elections Act 1997, to provide for same-day island voting at elections and referendums in Ireland.  These amendments will ensure that polling at elections and referendums on the islands will take place on the same day as the rest of the country.</p><p>In line the repeal of section 85 of the Electoral Act 1992 under amendment No. 2, amendment No. 107 will amend Article 49 of the Local Elections Regulations 1995 and amendment No. 109 will amend rule 48 of the Second Schedule to the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 to remove the provisions that allow for advance island voting at local and European elections and the provisions that prohibit an alteration to the notice of poll.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 104 to 109, inclusive,  will insert new provisions into the Electoral Acts to provide the Minister with the power to make an order to shorten polling hours on an island for an election or referendum where it would be unnecessary or impracticable to have full polling hours due to local circumstances and taking account of the advice of the returning officer.  Such an order must be made no later than seven days before polling day and the amended polling period must not be less than four hours.  The returning officer would be required to give public notice in the polling district of the times and date of the poll and as specified in legislation, orders would be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.  The local circumstances to be considered include the size of the electorate on the island, distance between a polling station on an island and the count centre, advance weather forecasts or foreseen transport difficulties.</p><p>These new order-making provisions would be inserted as new subsections (1A) to (1D) in section 96 of the Electoral Act 1992; new subsections (2) to (6) in section 7 of the Presidential Act 1993; new subsections (2) to (6) in section 13 of the Referendum Act 1994; new subsections (2A) to (2C) in section 26 of the Local Government Act 2001; and as new subsections (1A) to (1C) in section 10 of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997.  Amendments Nos. 104 to 109, inclusive, will also amend the existing provisions of section 86 of the Electoral Act 1992, Article 49 of the Local Elections Regulations 1995, and rule 48 of the Second Schedule to the European Parliament Elections Act 1997.  These provisions currently allow for polling hours on islands to be reduced on polling day itself where weather or transport difficulties affect the commencement of the poll or the timely delivery of ballot boxes to the count centre.  The amendments would clarify that these are emergency provisions to be used only in the event of unforeseen weather or transport difficulties on polling day itself.</p><p>In addition, amendments Nos. 104 to 109, inclusive, will amend the preliminary procedures for the counting of votes in section 114 of the Electoral Act 1992, Article 76 of the Local Elections Regulations 1995 and rule 75 of the Second Schedule to the European Parliament Elections Act 1997.</p><p>These amendments would allow returning officers, in the event of weather or transport difficulties at an election or referendum that would give rise to the late arrival of ballot boxes from a polling station on an island, to proceed with the opening of ballot boxes and the verification of ballot paper accounts for each box that has been received.  These tasks typically take a number of hours to complete and the proposed amendments would allow these tasks to be commenced pending the late arrival of ballot boxes from a polling station on an island.</p><p>The amendments will also delete references in the Electoral Act 1992, the Presidential Act 1993 and the Referendum Act 1994 to section 85 of the Electoral Act 1992, which will be repealed under amendment No. 2.</p><p>Finally, I propose to move amendments Nos. 33, 34, 62 to 64, inclusive, 71 to 73, inclusive, and 81, which are technical drafting amendments recommended by the Office of the Attorney General to clarify that these references in the Bill are referring to polling day order provisions under section 96(1) of the Electoral Act 1992, section 10(1) of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 and section 26(2) of the Local Government Act 2001, and not an order to shorten the poll on an island.</p><p>I seek the support of the committee for these amendments.  I thank the Chair.</p></speech>

It concerns the need for Government-appointed boards to have a certain number of people on them who have the competency to carry out their functions in the Irish language, given that in this case they will be dealing with the whole country, areas of which are designated Gaeltacht areas. The rights of Irish speakers outside of Gaeltacht areas, as expressed in the Official Languages Acts, also have to be taken on board.  There is also a need for those who are in positions of authority to have competency to carry out their functions in the language.  With amendment No. 22, we are also seeking to ensure that the chairperson must be able to conduct his or her functions in the Irish language.  Amendment No. 21 seeks to require that at least 20% of members of staff appointed in a given year shall be competent to conduct their functions in the Irish language.  That is in line with the provisions of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021, which aims to ensure that 20% of new recruits to the public service will be competent in the Irish language by 2030.  Given that this will be a new organisation, we are seeking to impose the 20% rule from the start.  Rather than starting off with 100% ability to function in the English language only, we want to set an example with the coimisi&uacute;n.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022053100002#E01400"><p>I will address amendments Nos. 5, 21, 22 and 24 together as they all relate to the placement of Irish language proficiency requirements on the ordinary members, staff, chairperson and chief executive of the commission.  At the outset, I will say that I appreciate the rationale behind such requirements.  However, as highlighted in pre-legislative scrutiny process, the commission requires a wide range of skills and experience in order to carry out a wide array of specialised functions.  I am mindful of not wishing to impose overly restrictive conditions in relation to the make-up of the staff and members of the commission.</p> <p>  I wish to make some general points in relation to these amendments.  In respect of the commission's chief executive and ordinary members, the Bill provides avenues for the Minister to agree with the Public Appointments Service general requirements for the candidates in sections 9(3) and 20(8) of the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 for the ordinary members and chief executive, respectively.  This will provide an opportunity for the addition of Irish-language proficiency as a desirable attribute for candidates.  It is important to note that the Official Languages Acts apply across public bodies.  I can confirm that it is intended that the newly-established electoral commission will come within that legislation.  I believe that this is the best approach in this regard.  Section 18C of the Official Languages Act 2003, as inserted by the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021, targets having at least 20% of staff recruited to public bodies competent in the Irish language as soon as practicable, and no later than 2030.  As I have said, this target will apply to the commission.  I do not think that it is necessarily a good idea to legislate in isolation outside of the provisions of that Act.  For these reasons I do not propose to accept the amendments.  I assure the Deputies that our officials will engage with colleagues in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to ensure that the electoral commission comes within the provisions of the Official Languages Acts.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1485" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022053100002#E01500"><p>I am not going to take up much more of the committee's time on this issue.  We are trying to ensure, for example, that the 20% requirement in respect of staff recruited to the commission in a given year is included in this legislation for the very reason that the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 has not commenced.  Staff could be recruited to work for the commission before the date of commencement or the functioning of the Act.  The advisory committee has not been put in place yet.  It is due to be put in place in a number of weeks.  That is one of the reasons for these amendments.  The amendments also seek to reflect the intention of Government and the Oireachtas in passing that legislation.  As the Minister of State has said, competency to carry out functions in the Irish language is a desirable attribute and the Minister should take cognisance of it while setting out a remit for a chief executive, chairperson or members of boards.  However, as we have seen in the history of the Irish language, such competence was always a desirable attribute, but never a requirement as such, which meant that many State boards and bodies did not stick with the original intentions of the State.  People will recall that when the State was founded, there was a long tradition of most of the State organisations having Irish language names.  There was a huge campaign to ensure that those within the Civil Service learned Irish and spoke in Irish.  In the past 30 to 40 years, in particular, we have rolled back on that.  That is one of the reasons for the implementation of the Official Languages Acts, and some of the rationale behind the amendments that I have moved here and will introduce in respect of other legislation.  I am seeking to ensure that we have the debate at the earliest point, whether successful or not, so that those who come after us understand that in the intentions as set out, we were mindful of the need for all State organisations to reflect that need for language competency and to reflect the fact that they are not operating in a singular vernacular across the State in the future.</p></speech>

He is absolutely right to seek to ensure that we meet these Irish language competency requirements.  However, I think it would not be a good idea to include the requirements in legislation outside of the provisions of the Official Languages Acts.  I can assure the Deputy that our officials will engage with colleagues in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to ensure that the commission comes within the provision of the Official Languages Acts.  I hope that the Deputy will accept those assurances.</p></speech>

I believe this is appropriate for membership of any State board, and especially in this case given the centrality of the electoral commission to our democracy.  Due to the easy availability of electronic tax clearance certificates, I am confident this will not place an unreasonable burden on persons seeking to become ordinary members of the commission.  There is precedent for such a requirement from section 49(j) of the Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019, which relates to membership of the Data Governance Board.</p></speech>

They may receive communications in the English language only or, at times, the English language may be the primary means of communication used by the State for election purposes to the detriment of the Irish language because it is then seen as less important in those areas.  The amendment will provide that the commission will understand from the start its role in ensuring those rights will be upheld and that the use of the Irish language will be visible in all publications, particularly within Gaeltacht areas, in order that Irish speakers can fully engage and take part in the democratic process without having to alter their names or change their direction because material has not been made available or communications to them are not in the language of their birth, in many cases, and the primary language of the State, the national language as indicated in the Constitution.  As I understand it, even with the Official Languages Act, there is a need for this type of provision to be reflected in the duties and objectives of any State organisation.  Given this will be a new organisation, it is important that it understands fully from day one that this will be one of its primary functions.</p><p>Obviously, the primary function is the electoral register and the election process but that has to be done while recognising other rights.</p></speech>

I again thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for these amendments and we appreciate the good intent behind them.  In respect of amendments Nos. 25 and 28, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the signage, literature and ballot papers used at electoral events are produced bilingually and given equal prominence.  Where polling places are located in Gaeltacht areas, signage is displayed in the Irish language only.  These practices will remain in place into the future, notwithstanding the establishment of the electoral commission.  Amendment No. 29 proposes assigning an additional regulatory function to the commission.  The commission is taking on a significant number of functions from the outset.  Being mindful of the need for the commission to get established and build up organisational capacity, it is not intended to add to these functions at the present time.  However, it is planned that the commission will take on additional functions after it has been established and has built expertise and capacity.  This provides an opportunity to consider assigning it additional functions.  For the reasons outlined I am not in a position to accept the amendments.  Again, I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from with the amendments.  However, I would stress that the functions being assigned to the commission have been carefully considered after many detailed consultation processes around the functions in recent years.  It has always been my intention to establish the commission and assign an initial set of functions to it.  However, it is also important to note that as the commission builds capacity and expertise, additional functions can be assigned.</p></speech>

In all of the discussions thus far on the Irish language and the change in tack that has come about since the discussions on the Official Languages Acts, and the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 in particular, there is an acceptance that things had gone awry and that our job is to set the system on a proper course that recognises the rights of Irish speakers.  Similar to other amendments, I can take the Minister of State at his word.</p> <p>  The biggest problem I have had is where on election day, people have found a breach and it is too late to change that.  All the apologies thereafter are too late where there is an affront to somebody who is an Irish speaker.  We have to find a mechanism for this although I acknowledge that people have worked hard to try to ensure there is no ignoring of those rights, which I have acknowledged, and mistakes happen.  People can accept mistakes but sometimes the same mistake is repeated election after election.  Material has been produced in the past by the Referendum Commission which has not been the same.  Two different messages went out with a more simplified message in Irish or a message that you had to root out.  There is a frustration in Irish language circles and in Gaeltacht areas over the years because they will get an apology and the apology will sit there until the next mistake is made.</p> <p>  I am happy enough to accept the Minister of State's bona fides and what he has said and to withdraw these amendments.  However, there needs to be some mechanism for when the fault lies with the commission or with one of the agents whereby action must be taken to ensure it does not happen again.  This is not about punishing somebody but about ensuring that lessons are learned and that as we grow as a country and nation, we address problems as they arise.</p></speech>

The opportunity to input to that will be important.  There is a good robustness to that so that we ensure that if mistakes are made at an electoral event, lessons will be learned and the commission will be able to make recommendations based on that.</p></speech>

Sometimes it comes down to a new Minister but at least in this case we will have a commission in place that has the duty to deal with complaints if they come or to take the praise if there are no complaints.

English is recognised as an official language and Irish is the national language and an official language.  The amendments seek to ensure that material will be published in the Irish language only or bilingually.  Being practical I presume that in the vast majority of cases it will be done bilingually but in Gaeltacht areas it should be in the Irish language only unless requested in English.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 40 and 42 deal with the titles of constituencies and are a recognition that in the past, the State had a view of using the Irish language first and in most cases the Irish-language names of the constituencies make more sense than the English names of the constituencies, which bear no relationship with any of the areas they reflect.  Amendment No. 45 is to do with the titles of constituencies and local electoral areas and seeks to ensure that they are in the Irish language first or only and then in English afterwards if so required, rather than just in the English language as happens in most cases.</p><p>Amendment No. 50 seeks to ensure that the programmes are in both languages equally.  Sometimes in the past an abbreviation of a document or report has been provided as Gaeilge rather than it being of equal length or size.  It is seeking that the equality that is reflected in the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 also be reflected in the publications from the commission or on electoral issues.</p></speech>

They relate to the use by the commission of the Irish language in its communications and the use of the Irish names of constituencies in electoral events generally.  I am satisfied that current electoral events are carried out with equal emphasis on each of the State&rsquo;s official languages.</p><p>It is current practice that the signage, literature and ballot papers used at electoral events are produced bilingually and are given equal prominence.  Where polling places are located in Gaeltacht areas, signage is displayed in the Irish language only.  The Referendum Commission has a strong commitment to the use of the Irish language.  Its current policy, as set out in its language scheme 2021 to 2024, provides that information material delivered nationwide to the electorate is published in each of the official languages simultaneously; all information published on the commission's website is produced in each of the official languages; all Referendum Commission broadcasts on radio and television are produced in each of the official languages; the Referendum Commission's report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is published in each of the official languages simultaneously; a spokesperson for the commission will be available to the media to provide an Irish service if advance notice is provided; and its website is fully bilingual.  I am satisfied that this sets a strong template for the electoral commission's referendum and public engagement functions.  </p><p> I would also point out that the constituency commission report in recent times has included the names of recommended constituencies in the Irish language.  Again, I see no reason this will not be followed on by the electoral commission.  On that basis, I do not propose to accept the amendments.  I would stress again that the electoral commission will be bound by the provisions of the Official Languages Act.  I thank the Deputy for tabling these amendments.</p></speech>

This particular amendment speaks to issues around illness or disability.  Obviously electoral turnout is a big issue and there was quite a lot of discussion about ensuring the maximum level of electoral participation.  Clearly if people want to vote but cannot do so for very legitimate reasons, under terms that would be prescribed by the commission and by legislation, then we should move towards the system that many other European jurisdictions have, which is a far less restrictive approach, particularly to postal proxy voting, in this case because of disability or illness.  Later on we will look at other areas like people being abroad for holidays or work and so on.  Again, a little like my colleague's amendments, if this is something that the Minister of State is willing to take away and look at with his officials and return to on Report Stage, that would be acceptable to us.  Otherwise, I will be pressing the amendment.  </p></speech>

By way of information, I wish to point out some features of the Bill which relate to persons with disabilities.  Section 67 empowers the commission to conduct <i>ex-post </i>reviews of the administration of electoral events.  These are mandated to include a description of the assistance provided by presiding officers and returning officers to persons with disabilities under the Electoral Acts.  This means that details of where and how assistance is provided are recorded for the first time.  This provides an avenue for highlighting best practice and encouraging greater consistency across the country ,which is something we all want to achieve.</p><p>In addition, Part 3 of this Bill provides for the extension of flexible voting arrangements which are currently available to persons with physical illnesses or disabilities to persons with mental health difficulties through amendments to the Electoral Act 1992.  In effect, this will mean that persons with mental health difficulties who are unable to attend a polling station on polling day can apply for a postal vote at the place where they are ordinarily resident or avail of the existing special voting facilities for people who are resident in nursing homes or similar facilities.  As the electoral commission is being positioned in a regulatory space, it is important that it stands apart from involvement in the administration of elections.  In that context, I ask the Deputy not to press the amendment.</p></speech>

We need to make sure, whether it is in terms of assistance, the language of choice, an extension of postal proxy voting and so on, that there are no barriers put in people's way, unfairly or unduly.  I will take the Minister of State at his word but I ask him to ensure this is something that continues to be kept under review after the passing and enactment of the legislation.</p></speech>

The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that very small online platforms with a relatively limited circulation would be exempt from the administrative burden of having to comply with the identification and verification checks as set out in Part 4, as well as the record-keeping requirements as they relate to online paid political advertisements during electoral periods.</p></speech>

We feel that in many ways, the regulations regarding online political advertising are really a facilitation of it.  I do not want to rehearse all of the arguments but I refer to many of the concerns raised during pre-legislative scrutiny process.  While I do not want to speak on amendment No. 70 too early, it relates to other amendments so I feel I must explain my position.</p> <p>  One concern is that we are just regulating it for the period of the election.  We know that spending on online advertising accrues a benefit well in advance of the election period so the idea of only regulating it during an electoral period is a farce, in many ways.  Many members of this committee felt that online political advertising should be, at the very least, regulated for a much greater period.  The second issue that arose is the anomaly of the prohibition of advertising on broadcast media, that is, radio and television, and the facilitation under this Bill of online political advertising.</p><p>It makes no sense to deprive trusted local media outlets, such as local radio stations that providing good quality news, of advertising sources - for good reason, because we do not want to go down that road of advertising - yet facilitate online platforms that, in many cases, withdraw from the idea of even being called a publisher and have quite loose standards in terms of fact checking to circulate content that, as we have seen in other countries, is often detrimental to the democratic process.  This is a once-in-a-generation Bill.  It is fantastic legislation but the very light touch approach in the context of online advertising is its real weakness.  I propose that we ban online advertising, bring it in line with the current ban in broadcast media and actively regulate the space in a very strong way or allow the commission to do so.  We are tinkering at the edges of something that strongly impacts the democratic process.  We have seen how outside agents in other countries have influenced elections and referendums across the world.  We have not come to grips with how online advertising is dealt with in the Bill.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State were to speak to amendment-----</p></speech>

It would simply require the commission to publish on its website all the information it is required to have.  We know there is a degree of transparency in respect of how parties operate.  My party, for example, publishes its constitution, memorandums and so on in order that everyone knows how decisions are made.  The amendment is not necessarily reinventing the wheel.  The register of political parties will be required to have party constitutions, memorandums and articles of association and so on.  It is not a big step to require the commission to publish all of that information.  It is important for it to do so and I hope the Minister of State will consider agreeing to the amendment.</p></speech>

As regards the register being available for inspection, the current legislation, that is, section 25C(2) of the Electoral Act 1992, as amended by section 11 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, only requires that the register be made available for inspection at the registrar&rsquo;s office.  The current practice is that the registrar regularly publishes it on the Oireachtas website.  When bringing existing electoral functions over to the commission in the Bill, I have taken the general approach of endeavouring to bring them over intact.  In this instance, I removed the stipulation under the 1992 Act that the register be made available for inspection at the offices of the registrar.  The text in section 51 is more general, such that it does not contain an implication that the register is a physical document that must be inspected at the registrar&rsquo;s office.</p> <p>  In respect of the amendment, while I support transparency in terms of how political parties are governed, I am conscious of the burdens on the commission in getting established and building up experience and organisational capacity.  I have referenced that previously.  On balance, I am of the view that this is not the time to make changes to the content of the register and I am rejecting the amendment.  I point out, however, that it is intended to legislate to assign more functions to the commission soon after its establishment.  It may be the case that the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion could be considered at that time.</p></speech>

If the registrar of political parties is required to have all this information and, from what the Minister of State is telling me, the relevant documents and so on can be made available for inspection and scrutiny, then surely, in the interests of transparency, it would not be a significant ask of the new commission to cater for the publication of that information when the responsibilities shift to it.  It is limited information but it is important to have that information relating to the functioning of political parties available on the website of the commission.  It is straightforward.  Many parties publish that information anyway.  People have a right to know how parties operate internally.  Those parties may be making big decisions in the context of the future of the party or organisation, as well as the future of the country.  This is a reasonably modest ask of the new commission and would not be a significant burden.</p></speech>

In this regard, I am proposing my own amendments to Part IX by way of the insertion of a new Part 6 into the Bill.  The new Part 6 will provide for a number of amendments to the 1997 Act that are intended to strengthen our political funding regime against financial resources from outside the State being used to influence our electoral and democratic processes.  These amendments will introduce a requirement on each political party to disclose in its annual statement of accounts all property within the ownership or control of the party.

This shall include, but not be limited to: <blockquote> 	(a) lowering the voting age to 16;<br /><br />(b) extending voting rights to all residents;<br /><br />(c) extending voting rights to citizens living in Northern Ireland;<br /><br />(d) extending voting rights to recent emigrants. </blockquote>(2) This review shall include a process of public consultation and expert engagement.<br /><br />(3) This review shall be provided to the Minister, the Joint Oireachtas Committee and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within 18 months of the establishment of the Commission.&rdquo;. </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>This amendment seeks a review of voting rights in terms of who is eligible to vote and voting entitlements, to be conducted within 18 months of the commission being established.  The review would consider issues such as lowering the voting age to 16 years of age and extending voting rights to citizens living in Northern Ireland, recent emigrants and people who are resident in Ireland but do not currently have a vote.  It also calls for an extensive public consultation and engagement process as part of the review.</p><p>I will touch on a few of the issues.  The call to lower the voting age to 16 years is not new.  In 2013, a constitutional convention recommended to the then Government that this question be put to people in a referendum.  It has been almost ten years but no Government has acted on it.  The National Youth Council of Ireland, the Children's Rights Alliance and the Irish Second-Level Students' Union have called for this.  It is worth serious consideration and young people should be part of the conversation.</p><p>There are significant issues affecting young people that are not getting a sufficient response in the political system, for example, mental health and the lack of choice for students and their parents in terms of schools.  In my constituency, many students want to attend second level mixed-gender secular schools but there is a lack of choice.  The options open to them are largely single-sex religious schools, which do not reflect their wishes.  Young people do not have a sufficient voice in this round, yet theirs is an important voice on issues like climate change and housing.  Not having their electoral voice is a matter that needs to be examined.</p><p>In Austria and Germany, where voting for 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds has been introduced, we have seen equal levels of voter turnout and participation among that age group as among older cohorts.  The argument that we would not get the same level of participation or turnout does not hold.  Scotland, Austria and seven of Germany's 16 states have lowered their voting ages to 16 years.  Countries like Switzerland and Estonia have done so for local elections.  There is a strong case for this idea to be considered as part of a review, which is what this amendment is seeking.</p><p>I appreciate that all residents have votes in local elections, but the fact that local democracy in Ireland is not as strong as it should be means they do not get the same kind of say.  When out campaigning, we explain to them they have a vote in the local elections but not in anything else.  I am not suggesting someone who has only been resident in Ireland for a short time should have full voting rights, but extending voting rights to those who have lived here, worked here and contributed to society over many years and who are part of Irish society in the same way as anyone else is at least worth considering, as is extending voting rights to the other cohorts I have mentioned in my amendment.</p><p>I am suggesting the commission review these matters within its first 18 months.  I look forward to the Minister of State's comments.</p></speech>

I will speak to that and then to the other elements of the Deputy's amendment.</p> <p>  The case for extending the right to vote to younger people is compelling.  We spend a great deal of time speaking of concerns about how the participation rate of people aged 18 to 20 years is far lower than it should be and how our democracy would be greatly enhanced if we found ways to encourage it.  The best way to get someone to vote is to start as early as possible.  If people start voting at an early age, the likelihood of them continuing increases.  Consider the other age restrictions in our society.  The age of consent is 17 years, as is the age at which someone can drive a car.  Some would say that being able to vote is more dangerous than driving a car, although I am not sure I agree.  We allow 14-year-olds and 15-year-olds to work up to 35 hours per week under certain conditions set down in legislation.  We allow 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds to work for 40 hours per week.  While only a small number of people of that age would work anything close to those hours, they pay tax and there is a core principle that there should be no representation without taxation.  Under the reverse of that, if someone is paying tax, surely he or she should have a say in how that tax is allocated and spent.</p> <p>  While this amendment is well crafted in that it asks the commission to review this matter instead of changing the voting age right now, it would send a powerful signal if the Government were willing to indicate it would consider the matter, either by way of accepting the amendment or returning with its own version of it on Report Stage.</p> <p>  The current situation must be galling for non-citizens.  They are living in this country, working hard and paying their taxes, they could be paying mortgages and their kids might have been born in Ireland and be going to school here, yet we give them no say whatsoever in how their taxes are allocated and spent.  This makes a mockery of the principle of democracy.  There are complex issues as to what point someone who is a resident in the State and not a citizen should be given that entitlement.  Obviously, there must be checks and balances and it must be done in an appropriate way, but we have long-settled and valuable new Irish communities.  Many of the people in question might not want Irish citizenship because they have an attachment to their countries of origin and want to hold on to that citizenship, but they also want to be full and equal participants in the life of this State.</p> <p>  The value of this amendment is that it is not asking the Government to change policy, only to have the commission examine these issues, which is something the commission is being set up to do.  Some of us represent significant parts of the west of Dublin city where there are higher concentrations of people whose original countries of origin are outside the EU.  Their engagement with the electoral system is a challenge at the best of times.  For those who would like to engage to be denied that right simply because of their citizenship is a problem.  Irrespective of what is in the Minister of State's speaking note, I urge him to think long and hard about this amendment and revert at a later stage, if possible.  There is no compelling argument for someone with a long residency and long history of paying taxes in this State to be denied the right to have a say in how those taxes are spent and allocated.  On that basis, I am happy to support the amendment.</p></speech>

It is obvious there are many issues affecting young people, for example, mental health, employment and major economic decisions the country makes during periods of growth and contraction.  We should not stand over the idea of excluding younger people's voices principally because we established the citizens' assembly and there was a recommendation on this matter.  The Government should take one of two steps, those being, act on that recommendation or state that it disagrees with it and has a democratic mandate from over-18s.  We should not sit on the fence.</p> <p>  Many British citizens who have been resident in this country for a long time will have seen a reduction in their voting rights as a result of Brexit, in that they can no longer vote for Members of the European Parliament despite living here.</p><p>They are also excluded from general elections.  I would like to see a threshold whereby long-standing residents could vote without necessarily giving up their citizenship.  Citizenship is an expensive process and people often have to put other costs ahead of that.  Will the Minister of State at least give a commitment that the electoral commission will be asked to do this, if it is not included in the legislation?</p></speech>

This is a well-presented amendment seeking merely to establish a review of this policy question.  Similar amendments were ruled out of order for different reasons but I am glad we can have a discussion about this, brief as it might be.</p> <p>  It seems eminently sensible that this might be the first job, in terms of the research capacity of the commission, that it would be asked to do.  There is a live debate on the question of voting age and extending voting rights to others, including people who have made Ireland their home and who do not have the status that would allow them to vote in general elections but who are engaged in enterprise, society and culture and have enriched our lives, communities, culture and society.  Democracy is a delicate flower.  It is evolving and it has been a long time since we scrutinised robustly and in an evidence-based way why our voting age should be 18 for general and local elections.</p> <p>  I said in the D&aacute;il recently and others have also said that the levels of maturity 16- and 17-year-olds show now compared with when I was 16 or 17 is incredible.  Given their levels of engagement and knowledge, how they assess information and the information sources they use, there is no doubt there is capacity among those aged 16 and over to participate in a democratic system in the way we do in our 30s, 40s, 50s, or whatever the case might be.</p> <p>  We ought to have a proper informed debate about extending voting rights to all residents within certain thresholds.  I hope that discussion can be led by the commission.  It is important.  Our democracy is evolving and it has been a long time since we assessed who should be entitled to vote and the extension of voting rights.  Now is the time to do it and the commission is the appropriate vehicle in which to do it.</p></speech>

Whether it forms part of the legislation or not, it should inform the first piece of work for the commission and is something we possibly need to review.  While reviewing voting rights and entitlements, there is also a need for significant research into the electoral registers and the number of people on the register who do not vote, particularly what some call the new Irish or new communities in Ireland.</p> <p>  This Government has made notable changes to try to empower newcomers to Ireland.  The most significant was probably the recent local authority mortgage, whereby we allowed for the first time stamp 4 holders to apply.  Previously, they were not able to apply for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.</p> <p>  We pride ourselves as an inclusive, vibrant and modern country and an intrinsic part of that is extending the voting franchise.

We look at the success in other jurisdictions.  I agree it should be reduced but that is my personal view.  It would benefit our democracy but it is important the commission be tasked with the research function.  We give a commitment to that.</p><p>This committee will have an important role in deciding the areas of research the commission will examine.  We are taking on board views today and will continue to do that.  It could enrich our democracy.  There are wider challenges around participation in our democracy that may not be related to reducing voter age.  That promotion aspect of the commission will be novel and unique in terms of engaging with the reasons our democracy is precious and important.  We give a commitment to ensuring from early on that the commission will be tasked with looking at reducing the voting age and the success or otherwise of that in other jurisdictions.  The modernisation of the electoral register and the pre-registration of 16- and 17-year-olds gives a commitment to engaging young people in our electoral system.  That is important.</p><p>On the point about all residents, we want to achieve from this, in the bigger picture, a change in our council chambers and our D&aacute;il Chamber in terms of people who are representative of those who live here.  That has been said across the debates and discourse on this Bill.  I give our commitment on that.</p><p>I will outline the provisions in Chapter 9 that set out the research, advisory and voter education functions of the commission.  Chapter 9 of Part 2 provides for the commission to take on a new policy research and advisory function.  As part of its work, the commission will prepare research programmes, conduct research on electoral policy and procedure and provide advice as required to the Minister and Government on electoral issues.  It can make recommendations to Government for changes to electoral legislation.The commission will promote public awareness of, and work to increase public participation in, the State&rsquo;s electoral and democratic processes through education and information programmes.  This is an expansion of the work the Referendum Commission carried out as part of its role.  The commission may also prepare and publish <i>ex post</i>reports on how electoral events were administered.</p><p>These provisions in the Bill will ensure we have, for the first time in our electoral system, a dedicated independent research, advisory and education function.  This is an important element of what the Bill seeks to achieve.  The commission&rsquo;s research programmes will be prepared in consultation with this committee annually, so members will have the opportunity to give their input into the commission&rsquo;s research priorities.</p><p>Respecting the electoral commission&rsquo;s independence from Government, I do not intend to legislate to require it to conduct specific pieces of research.  Notwithstanding this, guided by the programme for Government, I intend to request that the commission examine the Scottish experience of lowering the voting age to 16, which could be an important element of informing our consideration of the matter.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the matter of extending the franchise to Irish citizens outside of the State is under consideration.  In particular, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to hold a referendum on extending the franchise to citizens abroad at presidential elections.  A constitutional amendment Bill on this matter has been published and, if it is approved by both Houses, a referendum will follow.</p><p>Given the general research and advisory role for the electoral commission set out in the Bill, I do not propose to accept the amendment but, again, I give our commitment.  This is an important function.  Our next scheduled electoral event will be the local European elections in 2024 so I hope recommendations will be brought forward from that piece of research then.  I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for bringing the amendment forward.</p></speech>

This is calculated by reference to the most recent census of population.  </p><p>Section 56(2)(a) of the Bill provides that when recommending D&aacute;il constituencies, the electoral commission shall make recommendations based on the total D&aacute;il membership, which is between 166 and 172.  I am now proposing in this amendment to provide for an update to the terms of reference of the electoral commission in respect of the constituency revision.  Following this update the electoral commission will be required following the next census of population to recommend D&aacute;il constituencies based on a total number of Members in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of not less than 169 and not more than 179.  I am bringing forward this amendment in response to the latest estimates of population from the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  Last year the CSO published an estimated population of 5.01 million.  This would equate to a D&aacute;il membership of at least 168.  With further population growth likely since the estimate was made, I believe that the minimum membership of the D&aacute;il permissible under the Constitution will likely be 169 or 170 Members.  We will know that for sure when the results of the most recent census will become available.  I believe that a membership range of between 169 and 179 will allow the electoral commission a reasonable degree of flexibility to make recommendations on D&aacute;il constituencies that are in line with constitutional provisions.  </p></speech>

The commission, logically, would have to have that flexibility.  I have a question about whether consideration has been given to amending Article 16.2.2&deg;, given that the population is growing at the rate it is.  It might need to be changed to reflect that by either a greater number of people per Deputy or an increase beyond that.  Otherwise, we could continue to grow the numbers in the D&aacute;il.  I do not think that the Chamber will hold many more Members.  However, outside of that practical consideration, will it be the case that in 50 years&rsquo; time we will have a D&aacute;il with 200 Members?  In other jurisdictions they have lower numbers per head of population.  In some others they have a smaller number.  A conversation needs to be had at some stage.  Although this does not necessarily have to be at this stage, it should be soon enough.</p></speech>

It would delete &quot;3, 4 or 5 members&quot; and substitute it with &quot;4, 5 or 6 members&quot;.</p><p>To give some background, there was a very strong public discussion in 2013 in that constitutional convention about how politics operates.  It followed a period of crisis in Ireland where in public confidence in political system was knocked following the economic Celtic tiger collapse and all the social challenges and difficulties that arose out of that collapse.  Not every idea that was floating around the time has necessarily stood the test of time.  However, a considered discussion arose in the citizens&rsquo; assembly.  One of their recommendations was for all constituencies to have five seats or more.  One of the advantages of this would be to improve diversity and to make the D&aacute;il more representative.  As the Minister of State has already said, the D&aacute;il and many of our elected chambers across Ireland do not properly reflect and look like our population and the people who live in Ireland.  While this amendment alone will not correct that, many of those recommendations from the citizens&rsquo; assembly in 2013 have not been implemented and they are not reflected in this Bill.  In fact, this particular clause - which I am trying to change - simply copper-fastens the <i>status quo.  </i>It is hard to understand why almost ten years on, those recommendations are not being addressed.</p><p>I have been extremely moderate in my suggested change.  The constitutional convention specified five seats or more.  I have been very moderate here in the hopes that the Minister of State might agree.  I have therefore suggested four, five or six.  I am also mindful of the point was raised earlier in the in the D&aacute;il Chamber that there can be issues in rural areas.  We do not want to have redrawings of constituencies where parts of a particular county are shoved in with another county where there is no shared identity etc.  Therefore, combinations of four, five and six, particularly in rural areas will give us a much better fit than going larger.  However, going larger will certainly work in urban areas and cities without a problem.  I am mindful that it can be disempowering and alienating for people in rural areas to be taken out of their county and to be put in with another to which they feel no logical attachment.  Maybe we need to get to a situation where we move beyond that, but this would be a good start.  It is generally accepted that three-seat constituencies favour larger parties or, as we might say now, some of the medium-sized parties.  As a representative of a smaller party, we actually have very good balance between----</p></speech>

A third of our representatives in the D&aacute;il come from three-seat constituencies.  Another third is from four-seat constituencies.  Another third is from five-seat constituencies.  We therefore have good balance in that.  However, in general, smaller parties or different points of view get squeezed out.  In fact, we saw that historically in the Tullymander, when many three-seat constituencies were brought in.  It was not intended but it squeezed out much representation and it gave a disproportionate effect in those election results.  Therefore, I do not see the rationale for three-seat constituencies.  It is generally recognised that a great strength in our democracy is the proportional nature of it.  However, three-seat constituencies go against that.  We are all committed to having more diversity.  There is strength in our decision-making process.  The more diversity you have, the more different perspectives that are listened to and respected, you get better outcomes.  This is even the case when there are viewpoints that we all disagree with, because that is healthy in a democracy.  That is what this amendment is about.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</p></speech>

One of the issues is that members of political parties are probably the last people who should be asked about which size constituencies they would like.  If you are in a small party, of course you would prefer larger constituencies.  If you are a larger party, for selfish strategic reasons, you might argue that you would like constituencies to be smaller.  The great value of having an independent commission is that you can at least set out criteria by which they would then assess the optimum size of constituencies to achieve a particular result.</p><p>Rather than saying whether we favour this or that size, if we start from the point that we want to have the most representative cross-section of society represented in the Oireachtas and if we also want to make sure larger, less populated rural constituencies do not end up with a significant imbalance where Deputies tend to be from one area rather than another, we can set some reasonable criteria for the most desirable outcome for the commission.  It can then do a study, look at the scientific evidence and come back with something much more impartial than anything from elected Members of this House.  Our party has always favoured larger constituencies and we continue to do so, despite the fact the party has grown, because we accept the point made by Deputy O'Callaghan that they are generally more representative.  The caveats, however, must be about respecting not necessarily county boundaries exclusively but community boundaries and ensuring we do not end up with large constituencies where a significant minority of the population that is geographically located in one area ends up with no representation just because of the vagaries of the proportional representation single transferable vote, PRSTV.</p><p> Again, it is a little like Deputy O'Callaghan's earlier amendment and I can imagine what the Minister of State will say.  However, it is one whereby we could have a commission to do a very good piece of work and come up with the right formula for how to deal with this.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1485" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022053100002#N00200"><p>Like the other Deputies, I have always favoured larger constituencies.  We should approach this and get it right at the lower end, which is to set the local electoral boundaries and try not to breach them insofar as possible.  The reason I say that is there is an affinity to or an identification with local authorities, and there are local authorities where parts of their remit are in other constituencies.  For example, in my case in South Dublin County Council, there is a small portion, two wards, that are not serviced by the political representatives in that constituency as much as if they were a lot larger or a larger portion, or if they were in the rest of South Dublin County Council.  I understand it is difficult for a commission to try to juggle and move smaller bits of the local electoral areas, LEAs, around to try to ensure we match the figures in the Constitution or in what has been set out here.</p> <p>  The other problem is geographical and county boundaries, as mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  Every electoral commission is supposed to have heed to the geographical boundaries.  I remember when the Liffey was breached - I think it was in 1997 - and suddenly all of Ballyfermot was put with the north inner city for some bizarre reason.  There was no connection in any shape or form.  Something similar has happened in various areas and we all can probably cite areas that have no relationship.  Parts of what is traditionally called Crumlin in my electoral area are in Dublin Bay South.  In recognition of that, for a period the returning officer allowed the people there to vote in a polling booth in Dublin South-Central rather than in Dublin South East, as it was known at the time.  That was a recognition that they would not have voted otherwise.  It has changed since then.</p> <p>  The final point is that while in some ways I understand the reason for the changes and continuous boundary reviews, the constant tinkering interferes with people voting.  People grow to understand their areas, so if somebody is not connected with politics and is disaffected with life, it is very difficult to encourage that person to vote if he or she does not know the constituency and does not identify with it.  Although it is in the Constitution and in legislation, if one keeps shifting bits in and bits out in each electoral commission or boundary commission report, it can interfere, and has done so, with the turnout in some parts of constituencies.</p> <p>  However, I favour the larger constituencies.  Looking back to the founding of the State, larger constituencies were encouraged when proportional representation, PR, was being introduced in the first instance, on the basis that it would reflect society better.</p></speech>

We know that the PRSTV, multi-seat constituency system is among the most proportionate systems in terms of the outcomes and value, if I can describe it as such, for people's votes.  Deputies O'Callaghan and &Oacute; Broin have reaffirmed their commitment to multi-seat constituencies and how that can produce a more proportionate and fairer outcome in the context of the Irish electoral system.  My party was committed to that until a small blip in 1977, when James Tully, a previous occupant of the Custom House, decided in his wisdom to take a different approach.  That undoubtedly had an impact on smaller parties and the proportionality of the outcome of subsequent elections.  Lessons have been learned.</p> <p>  It is important to have as proportionate an outcome as possible.  That is why, from our point of view, if amendment No. 41 in the context of general elections and amendment No. 44 in the context of local elections were accepted, a commitment would be hardwired in primary legislation and in the system that there would be multiple seats in the constituencies that would be derived from the work the commission would do.  It is important to get that type of diverse outcome from our elections.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, the outcome should reflect our society in a way it does not now.  Our society is very diverse and, arguably, we could have the development of additional smaller parties over the next period of time.  Who is to know?  That is inevitable.</p></speech>

My amendments are self-explanatory.  If the Minister of State would commit to entertaining them, it would be a good day for democracy, for smaller parties and for the system generally.  When my party was larger, it was consistent in respect of the number of seats that should be returned from each constituency.</p> <p>  The issue of county boundaries and so forth was raised earlier.  County boundaries are arbitrary.  It happens to be how our local government system has been organised.  In many ways, it has as much to do with affinity for who we follow in the GAA as with anything else.  This should be about the efficient and proper democratic representation of people.  County boundaries do not reflect the reality of where people are living or where their centres of interest are these days.  We all look at things through the prism of own constituency.  My constituency should be properly renamed Louth and east Meath or Louth and the Meath coast because it includes a significant part of east Meath, including south Drogheda, Laytown, Bettystown, Donacarney, Julianstown and so forth.  Those areas are contiguous with County Louth and with the town of Drogheda, which is the largest town in the country that is not a city.  That is where the centres of interest for people in east Meath are.  There is little relationship with the centre of decision-making in County Meath, which is Navan, albeit there is strong representation from Meath county councillors in that area in the county council in Navan.</p><p>We must be conscious of that and, to be fair, successive boundary commissions have been.  The idea of consistency over a period of elections is now hardwired into the work the electoral commission is going to do into the future.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh is right.  Parts of Dublin, in particular, have been taken in and out of constituencies.  There is no affiliation with any particular Deputy, public representative or party.  That is fair enough and that is for people to decide.  However, people should have consistency of representation.  That is important in terms of turnout and the health of our democracy more generally.  Consistency is important.  We should slay some sacred cows around constituency boundaries unless there are clear geographic barriers.  The River Boyne was breached a number of years ago, not just in 1690 but after that on many occasions.  The town of Drogheda and its constituency were extended.  It makes sense.  It is all about the proper representation of people and county boundaries should be secondary.  I hope that is now hardwired into the work of the commission and will be, going forward.</p></speech>

Whether we want larger or smaller parties to get more votes, the point is we need more people to vote.  I echo a lot of what Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said.  We need to go back to basics and start from the bottom up in terms of local electoral boundaries.  There are some horrific examples across the country.  We are burdening this new commission with an awful lot of work.  It is a seismic piece of work.  It feeds back into Deputy O'Callaghan's earlier recommendation on the extension of voting rights to new citizens and young people.  The second largest town in the holy land that is Longford is Edgeworthstown.  It has been unable to return a local councillor in the past two elections because the town has been split into two local electoral areas.  It has been unable to return a local councillor, which is a source of discontent for the people of the area.  It is a heavily industrialised town with a large eastern European community.  There are many low-income families in the area, many of whom are not engaging in the electoral process because they cannot see a vision or pathway whereby they can elect somebody locally.  The piece of work for the commission must move from the bottom up and must start with the local electoral areas and work upwards.  There is more work to do.</p></speech>

I thank Deputies O'Callaghan and Nash for bringing forward these amendments.  Deputy Flaherty made points about local elections with which I agree wholeheartedly.  A considerable amount of work is required in that regard.  He is correct to say the commission is going to be burdened with a considerable amount of research.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin made a point about the commission's ability to look at the merit of four-seat, five-seat and six-seat constituencies.  We must consider the impacts on communities and the potential for disenfranchisement.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n made reference in the D&aacute;il to slivers of a county being excluded or cut off.  That is an important consideration.</p> <p>  For the local elections of 2014, my own city of Kilkenny was split into Kilkenny city east and west.  It had a borough council for hundreds of years prior to that.  There is a broader issue, though perhaps not for consideration today, about borough and town councils and the positive impact they had on smaller parties and Independents getting a foothold into the electoral system.  That is for another day but all these matters are parts of the broader debate we are having about our democracy.</p> <p>  Valid points have been made about constituencies with more seats.  It will be interesting to see what the census will bring forward.  I certainly benefited from being in a five-seat constituency and was elected by the skin of my teeth in the 2020 election.  There is no doubt a bigger constituency gives added benefit to small and medium-sized parties, which is important in terms of the diversity we are seeking to achieve.  As Deputy Flaherty said, it is about a bigger piece of work around participation in our democratic system.  The challenge for all of us relates to getting more people out to vote and to allow for greater engagement with the political system.</p> <p>  I will now speak directly to the amendments.  I again thank the Deputies for the amendments, which raise interesting points.  It might be helpful to the committee if at the outset I outlined the law and practice in the area of D&aacute;il constituency size.  Under Article 16.2.6&deg; of the Constitution, no law may be enacted by the Oireachtas providing for fewer than three Members for a D&aacute;il constituency.  The relevant Parts of the Electoral Act 1997 are being retained in this Bill and provide that the electoral commission will make recommendations based on three-seat, four-seat or five-seat constituencies.</p> <p>  While in the early years of the State there were seven-seat, eight-seat and even nine-seat constituencies, constituency size in Ireland has been restricted to three-seater, four-seaters and five-seaters since 1947.  Currently, the 39 D&aacute;il constituencies comprise 13 five-seat constituencies, 17 four-seat constituencies and nine three-seat constituencies.  It is worth noting that we have to go back to 1923 to find a time when we had fewer three-seat constituencies.  That was a time when constituencies ranged in size from three seats to nine seats.</p> <p>  In my view, there needs to be a reasonable choice of constituency size to produce constituencies that make sense to people on the ground by, for example, enclosing entire communities or adhering to obvious physical features.  I think the three-seat, four-seat and five-seat arrangement has served us well and strikes a reasonable balance.</p> <p>  Turning in particular to amendment No. 41, I am not in favour of placing any further restrictions on an electoral commission along the lines proposed.  It is important the commission has a reasonable degree of flexibility when making recommendations on constituency formation.  The amendment gives us no guidance on what circumstances would permit three-seaters or indeed enable a larger number of five-seaters.  The nature of the task of constituency revision calls for a workable menu of different-sized constituencies and I believe the arrangements proposed in the Bill achieve that.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 44 focuses on the proposed size of local electoral areas and proposes they do not have fewer than five seats and not more than seven seats except where that would result in a disproportionately large electoral area.  Section 60 sets out the process for the review of local electoral areas.  It should be noted that section 60 does not set out the matters to be considered in any such review.  That is a matter for the Minister and this is in line with the current process for reviewing local electoral areas.  However, I have now included a further step in the process, and when the Minister is making a request to the commission to review local electoral areas, that request will be laid before the Houses and must be approved by resolution of each House.  This will ensure Members will have an opportunity to debate and feed into the matters to be considered by the electoral commission when reviewing local electoral area boundaries.  It is at that point that matters such as the size of local electoral areas can be discussed and provided for.  Again, I think it is important to retain this flexibility in setting the terms of reference for the review of local electoral areas rather than being prescriptive in this Bill.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 43 is also related to the terms of reference of the electoral commission when it is reviewing D&aacute;il constituency boundaries.  Section 56(2)(c) provides that when the electoral commission is reviewing D&aacute;il constituency boundaries, the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable.  However, section 56(4) provides that this requirement will not apply to a boundary of a city or any boundary between any two of the counties of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin.  Again, this is in line with the current terms of reference for the Constituency Commission set out in the Electoral Act 1997.  The effect of the proposed amendment would require the electoral commission to avoid, as far as practicable, breaching county boundaries, including those boundaries in Dublin, when making recommendations formulating D&aacute;il constituencies.  The boundaries of the 32 counties of Ireland have been in existence for centuries.  In the past 200 years, these counties have become a well-established focus for community activity and so the requirement generally to align constituency boundaries with county boundaries makes absolute sense.  However, the effect of this amendment would be to impose greater restrictions on the electoral commission and would remove the avoidance of doubt type provision that currently exists relating to city boundaries.  The current provision will give the electoral commission some flexibility in dealing with our cities, including in Dublin city and county, the most densely populated part of Ireland.</p> <p>  The reality is that urban development around cities has long since spilled over into the adjoining counties.  Many people living outside the city bounds feel a strong degree of affinity and loyalty to their city and would prefer to be included in city constituencies.</p><p>For these reasons, we should not require the commission to avoid, where practicable, breaching city boundaries or administrative boundaries in Dublin.  It would be inadvisable at this point to tie the commission's hands in this way and so I do not favour any alteration to the commission's terms of reference in this regard.  Given the views I have outlined, I ask the Deputies not to press the amendments.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for his response.  There was a very good point made by Deputies Flaherty and &Oacute; Broin that politicians should not be involved with setting this.  That is correct.  The problem with the legislation in front of us is that we are, as elected politicians, copper-fastening the <i>status quo</i>.  We are tying the hands of the commission because the legislation will very clearly do that with constituencies of three, four or five seats.</p><p>It is correct that we must focus on greater engagement and participation from the electorate.  One of the ways we can do that arises because people participate most when they feel there is efficacy in the vote and their vote really does count and matter.  Greater proportionality assists that.  We also get greater participation when people feel those who are getting elected reflect society better, the elected bodies are more diverse and they can see people to whom they can easily relate getting elected to local councils or the D&aacute;il.  This is about doing that.</p><p>By tying our hands and that of the commission on constituencies with three, four or five seats, as this legislation does, we will not allow for greater participation or diversity with which we all seem to agree.  I do not understand why we would tie our hands with the legislation on this, especially in the context of the significant population growth.  It has happened and this is the ideal time to look at the increased number of representatives who will be elected to the D&aacute;il.  It would be the perfect time to look to increase slightly the size of the number of representatives per constituency.  There is no better time to do it.  I will certainly press my amendment.</p></speech>

My reading is that on page 41 of the Bill, section 56(2), the wording copper-fastens the <i>status quo</i>.

Will it have the flexibility, notwithstanding that section, to consider increasing the size of D&aacute;il constituencies?  Will the Minister of State clarify that so we are clear on the meaning of the legislation and we both have the same understanding of it?</p></speech>

The Commission shall provide a report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee within 24 months and may make such recommendations to the Minister and the Government as it considers appropriate.&quot;.  </blockquote> <p>This requests the commission to research and report back within 24 months on the impact on election outcomes of listing candidates in alphabetical order on ballot papers.  Again, I am not bringing forward this amendment because my surname is O'Callaghan and I have not had major issues in electoral contests.  When I first heard of the idea, I did not think it much of an issue but it was brought to my attention and I looked into it a bit, and there is clear evidence this can cause an issue in electoral outcomes.  In a High Court judgment in Ireland in 1986, the judge stated:</p> <blockquote> 	I am satisfied that the evidence adduced proves conclusively that, in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann elections over a period of nearly 40 years, there has been a significant over-representation of candidates whose surnames begin with letters at the commencement of the alphabet. </blockquote> <p>This has led to some changes in other jurisdictions.  For example, last year city councillors in Vancouver voted to scrap the alphabetical listing for municipal election and replace it with a randomised ballot paper.  There were ten city councillors holding office at the time and six had surnames beginning with the letters &quot;A&quot; to &quot;D&quot;.  The councillors took the view that having the names in alphabetical order discriminated against candidates with surnames of Chinese, south Asian and Latino origin, among others, and candidates from those backgrounds were less likely to have surnames beginning with letters from the top of the alphabet.  I know we are all committed to trying to increase our diversity.</p><p>An article in the journal <i>Parliamentary Affairs</i>looked at this in the UK, specifically with ballot papers in local elections between 1973 and 2011.  It found that, in 2011 in England, for example, 161 candidates were elected purely because their names were high in the alphabetical placing at the top of the ballot paper.  The review indicates this is more of an issue in what is often referred to as second order elections.  These are just as important as other elections but there may be less coverage and scrutiny of them.  It may not be as much of a problem in D&aacute;il elections as it would be in European and local elections, for example.</p><p>Evidence also indicates that when larger parties run three candidates, for example, there is a much higher chance of the two candidates with surnames beginning with letters closer to the start of the alphabet getting elected rather than the third candidate.</p><p>There is a view that the alphabetical listing of names could fall foul of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits discrimination.  It could be the subject of an application for declaration of incompatibility with the convention under the European Convention of Human Rights Act 2003.  </p><p> Just to get back to Ireland for a second, looking at the 2016 census, we had 122,515 Polish nationals in Ireland.  The top ten most common surnames in Poland begin with the letters K, L, N, S, W and Z.  It is hard not to conclude, given that the evidence shows that alphabetical ordering impacts on election results, that it discriminates against different sections of Irish society, given that by virtue of absolute chance their surnames happen to be located towards the end of the alphabet.  I do not think that is something any of us would stand over.  I have to admit that when I first heard this I did not realise the significance of it.  This warrants serious analysis and review.  There is probably no good reason it should not just be a randomised order.  That certainly does not cost us anything or make anything unfair on anyone, but it produces a fairer outcome.  Therefore, that should be considered and there should be a review.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</p></speech>

This is a very important area.  I think all of us are committed to looking at how we can make voting and voter participation more accessible for everyone, especially people with disabilities.  For example, the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, raised a number of issues with the Electoral Reform Bill in its submission, including, for example, how voting booths can be unsuitable in terms of inaccessibility.  In terms of voter registration, it has called for an online system that is fully accessible and compliant with the EU web accessibility directive.  It raised issues about lack of awareness around postal ballots and accessing polling stations due to lack of access to transport.  It raised the issue of the need for additional research on the use of technology to assist people with disabilities in voter registration in terms of identity verification and ballot casting to make the process simpler and streamline it, especially for people who are blind and have vision impairment.  This is an important area that needs to be researched.  It should be a priority for the commission and it should come back within two years after having looked at this.</p></speech>

I obviously support the thrust of them.  We absolutely have to enable more people with disabilities and those who have difficulty accessing polling stations as they are currently constituted.  We need to make it easier and more accessible for people to vote and participate in the democratic process.</p> <p>  Equally, Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan's points on the alphabetical order and the presentation of candidates merit further consideration.  I do not think we have ever had an Aaron Aardvark on an Irish ballot paper.  I hope things do not get that bad that somebody might decide that they want to change their name by deed poll and place themselves higher up the ballot paper by doing so.  Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan referenced very compelling research.  I hope that is something the Minister can take on board and the commission can take a look at.  Just because it is always how we did things does not mean we necessarily have to continue to do that and present the ballot paper in the way that it is currently presented and always has been.</p> <p>  Some of the elements of amendment No. 48 have been discussed to a degree in relation to earlier amendments, especially around the potential lowering of the voting age and the extension of the franchise to others who cannot participate at this point in time in general elections and so on.  I want to limit my remarks to subsections (a) and (b), which relate to the taking of opinion polls and the issue to do with the framework for broadcast election debates.  They are related in a way because both the taking and publication of opinion polls during an election period and the presentation of and manner in which a broadcast election debate is done have the potential to change the outcome of an election.  In the context of broadcast election debates, for example, I do not refer simply to the performance of the individuals who are actually participating, but also to how they are selected.  I cannot recall a time in the past 20 or 30 years where there has not been a High Court challenge taken by somebody who felt they should have been included in an election debate and were not.  Even the taking of a case or the idea that somebody might be excluded - even though it may be the case that they have a certain amount of D&aacute;il representation or are performing well in opinion polls and may make a challenge on that basis - feeds into the narrative of an election and who has been excluded and who has been included.  That can create some momentum behind a candidate or a party.  </p> <p>  It would be a good day&rsquo;s work for the commission when it meets - we are loading more work on it, but it is important because of the influence of opinion polls and broadcast debates during an election campaign on the outcome of the election -  if it could undertake research on how that works or use research available elsewhere to inform the development of a framework.  Perhaps it could agree with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland about how election debates could be organised in a fair and impartial manner.  Perhaps some form of regulatory standards would be imposed on opinion polling companies in terms of how they take opinion polls and how they and the media present those opinion polls, especially during an election campaign because it has an impact on the outcome.  At least that is what we believe to be the case, though it may not be.  There may very well be evidence to suggest the contrary.  However, I am not aware of any evidence that is there, at least in an Irish context, to inform this.  Given the substantial research function that the commission will have, this is an important piece of work that the commission should and could undertake.</p> <p>  On opinion polls, I do not believe there are any standards imposed on opinion poll companies outside of the industry standards that they impose on themselves.  Opinion polls in Ireland are carried out to a very robust and high degree and high standard.  However, especially in the context of elections themselves, we need to look at this idea of best practice standards in the taking of opinion polls in an election period.  I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view on that.</p></speech>

In some senses, the volume of the work that the commission can or cannot do will ultimately depend on its resources.  Therefore, we should not be shy about identifying, as a committee, the kind of things we would like it to do.  Obviously it will then have to decide what to prioritise, depending on how generous or not the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues in the Cabinet are when it comes to giving it its budget beyond its first year.</p><p>All of the points that Deputies O&rsquo;Callaghan and Nash raised are important.  I am in a constituency where I could have the unique experience in the next general election of having a candidate with an identical name to my own, namely Eoin &Oacute; Broin of the Social Democrats.  It is an interesting dilemma because the first question that is asked is how you decide the order of the ballot.  It was a matter of great interest to many people.  We never got to the bottom of it.  Some people thought it was the drawing of lots and others thought it depended on the middle name.  The fact that it generated so much discussion demonstrates that people are preoccupied by the position on the ballot paper.  Likewise, I have come across and am aware of cases where people used maiden names and not married names or <i>vice versa,</i>or they will use the Irish or English form of their name to see if it gives them some advantage.</p><p>Having said that, and the Chairman's point is a good one, I come close to the bottom of the ballot and my good party colleague Deputy Ward is at the very bottom, although that was not a difficulty for either of us in recent elections.  Nevertheless, Deputy O'Callaghan makes a good case and, in regard to both the issue of a candidate's position on the ballot paper and, equally if not more importantly, the issue of opinion polls, the evidence should determine the policy, which is why the amendments recommending additional research areas for the commission are welcome and I am happy to support them.</p><p> On that subject, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's final amendment, amendment No. 69, makes another request for a report.  In the spirit of all the amendments he has tabled as our party's Irish language spokesperson, it will provide that after an appropriate period, adequate research will be conducted to ensure the rights of Irish language speakers will be fully vindicated and fully supported within the electoral process.  On that basis, we hope the Minister of State will give the amendment a positive hearing and, if not supporting it in being incorporated in the Bill, at least ensure in the spirit in which he has spoken to similar amendments that it will be on the radar of the commission as well as the Government following the passing and enactment of the Bill.</p></speech>

I do not think that needs to be enshrined in legislation given we are burdening the commission with enough work.  Given the way we are going, I fear no one will want to sit on the commission because there will be so much work to be done.  Many valid points have been made and Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan has put a great deal of work into this.  He has pointed to the international research that exists on the issue.  While it might be an advantage to be at the top of the voting list, it is probably equally advantageous to be at the bottom given that if there is a list of 30-odd candidates, a voter's eye will scan that list very quickly.</p> <p>  I take on board Deputy Nash's point about standards for opinion polls and broadcast election debates.  Nevertheless, we have to acknowledge that even if we might not always agree with the results, the standard of polling in this country is very high.  Even though it is self-regulated, it is done very well.  We cannot account for how the general public will interpret those results afterwards and that is not an issue for the polling companies.  They do a very good job and self-regulate but it is something we need to keep an eye on.</p> <p>  Similarly, the standard of election debates in the context of fairness and equality for all has been especially high, although that does not mean we should not shine a light on the issue and see how it could be done better.  We can never account for a bad performance and numerous such examples over the years have influenced elections.  No number of prescriptive rules and guidelines can guard against that and any attempt to do so would just involve more work for the commission.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, we have found, whether within our constituencies or in rogue polls published by media outlets that may not be regulated but may be gaining some traction, that the methods are not robust and the polling can change the outcome of elections.  It is those kinds of arrangements that are in my sights in the context of this amendment, not the high standards that are imposed and followed by professional polling companies.  If their standards were not high, they would not be re-engaged to do the work they do.</p> <p>  This is an interesting area worth examining.  Of course, in the interests of openness, good journalism and proper reporting, we cannot manage or regulate everything, but certain standards should be adhered to, during an election period especially.  I wanted to provide that further context for the Minister of State before he responds.</p></speech>

I would have loved if we had a session on the issue during our committee deliberations given the many varying views and differing scientific perspectives.  I draw members' attention to a book published by Brendan Heneghan in 2018, <i>Secrets of the Ballot Box: How the Irish Voting System Really Works</i>.  It is based on research of electoral patterns in Ireland from 1981 to 2016, inclusive.  It is a very good read, for a start, but as a middle-ballot candidate I was always jealous of people whose surnames began with A or B.  I was surprised to learn that the author's statistical analysis of electoral results over that period showed there was no electoral advantage to being higher on the ballot paper.  In my constituency, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, we will put that to the test if we have, as looks likely, two candidates called Eoin &Oacute; Broin on the ballot paper given there is no clarity as yet as to whose name will come first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.432" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022053100002#R00500"><p>That is an interesting point.  I have come across that research and I think it bears out the fact that, perhaps, there is no significant advantage to being named higher up on the ballot paper.  It raises other issues relating to counting votes under our proportional representation system and it could make that challenging.  There may also be accessibility issues with the templates used for the visually impaired, an issue on which I met representatives of the NCBI a number of weeks ago.  The commission can examine these issues and give them consideration.  As Deputy Flaherty said, it will be quite busy and there is much research we have spoken about, but it is all important and it is welcome this amendment has brought forward a discussion it.  It is very significant in respect of people's voting patterns and fairness and transparency in our electoral system.</p><p>On the accessibility issue for people with disabilities, this is something we consistently take very seriously, as will the commission.  For the 2019 local elections, 53 polling stations were inaccessible and by the general election of 2020, that had been reduced to 23 as a result of direct engagement between our franchise section and returning officers.  It is a very good step.  Similarly, as I said, we have met representatives of the NCBI in regard to the template ballot papers and trying to improve them.  The new registration process will be available online and compliant with web accessibility standards, including screen reading software.  We are continuously striving to improve the experience of people with disabilities in our electoral system and that is critical.</p><p>Deputy Nash raised issues that relate to his amendment concerning polling and the impartiality of election debates.  I agree with the contention that we have a very robust system and broadcasters are generally very responsible, which we should be proud of.  That is not the case in every jurisdiction and we can be proud of that.  I reiterate these are issues the commission could and will, no doubt, be tasked with examining, so the amendments are important in that they allow us to discuss them.</p><p>As I outlined in regard to amendment No. 37, it is worth reflecting on the provisions in Chapter 9, which set out the research, advisory and voter education functions of the commission.  Chapter 9 of Part 2 of the Bill provides for the commission to take on a new policy research and advisory function.  As part of its work, the commission will prepare research programmes, conduct research on electoral policy and procedure and provide advice as required to the Minister and the Government on electoral issues.  It can make recommendations to the Government in regard to proposals for changes to electoral legislation.</p><p>The commission will also promote public awareness of, and work to increase public participation in, the State's electoral and democratic processes through education and information programmes.  This is an expansion of the work the Referendum Commission carries out.  The electoral commission may also prepare or publish <i>ex post</i>reports on how electoral events are administered.  The provisions in the Bill will ensure that we have, for the first time in our electoral system, a dedicated independent research, advisory and education function, an important element the Bill is seeking to achieve.</p><p>The commission's research programme will be prepared in consultation with this committee annually, so members will have an opportunity to give input into the commission&rsquo;s research priorities.  Guided by Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, it is intended the commission will be requested to carry out several items of research, including relating to the potential for the expansion of postal voting, the Scottish experience of lowering the voting age to 16, limiting the use of election posters and a review of the Electoral Act 1997 as it relates to political funding.</p><p> In the context of amendment No. 47, the matter of maximising the accessibility of voting is a priority for me.  Part 3 of the Bill provides for the extension of flexible voting arrangements that are currently available to persons with physical illnesses or disabilities to persons with mental health difficulties through amendments to the Electoral Act 1992.  In effect, this will mean that persons with mental health difficulties can apply for a postal vote at the place where they are ordinarily resident.  Such voters will also have the option of availing of the existing special voting facilities for people who are resident in nursing homes or similar facilities.</p><p> In addition, reports prepared under the electoral commission's post-electoral-event review role in section 67 would be required to include a description of the assistance given by presiding officers or returning officers under the Electoral Acts.  These provisions include: the requirement for local authorities, in making polling schemes, to appoint as polling places areas where at least one polling station will be accessible to wheelchair users; the requirement on returning officers, where practicable, to provide polling stations that are accessible to wheelchair users and to give public notice of all polling stations that are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than eight days before polling day - in guidance to returning officers, my Department has suggested that consideration should be given to providing suitable ramps in the case of polling stations that cannot be reached without negotiating steps; the requirement on returning officers to put in place arrangements to facilitate the marking and placing in ballot boxes of ballot papers by wheelchair users - in guidance to returning officers, my Department has suggested the provision at each polling station of an appropriately located table and chair to facilitate this requirement; and the requirement on returning officers to ensure, where practicable, that the place appointed for the counting of votes is accessible to wheelchair users.</p><p> While comprehensive arrangements are in place to assist participation in the electoral process by individuals with physical disabilities, my Department nonetheless continues to seek to improve these arrangements and to have regard to the special needs of such persons.  Given the provisions already included in the Bill, I ask the Deputy not to press the amendments.</p></speech>

He indicated that returning officers have been asked to ensure, where practicable, that the places where votes are counted are accessible to people with disabilities.  It is shocking that, where practicable, we would think it okay in this day and age that count centres in some cases would not be accessible to people with disabilities.  Should the instruction simply be that all count centres are accessible to people with disabilities - end of story?</p></speech>

Significantly, what we have done over the past number of the years, through great work here with the returning officers, is to ensure that we are reducing the level of inaccessibility.  I gave the statistics.  That is something.  We have worked well with the disability organisations to ensure that accessibility issue is addressed.  Significant progress has been made, at local level but also from our perspective, to support that.</p></speech>

In terms of polling stations, I appreciate that one could have communities where there simply is not an accessible venue.  In terms of count centres, the wording there is "to ensure, where practicable, that the place appointed for the counting of votes".  I do not understand why the term "where practicable" would be included.  I do not understand.  Surely every county has accessible venues for counting votes.  If venues are not accessible, they should not be used.</p></speech>

Voter education is a significant part of the remit for the commission.  It is extremely important.  Voter participation is also massively important.  In the 132 pages of the Bill, voter education is only mentioned twice.</p><p> Section 66, which relates to the educational functions of the commission, is very weak.  It is just three sentences long.  I appreciate that legislation is not all about length or the number of times something is mentioned, and there can be good legislation where particular functions are crisp and short.  However, I fear that if we do not spell out in the legislation in some detail what should be done under voter education, this is an area that may not get the resources or the prioritisation that is needed.  We have to design the legislation to withstand time so while I fully appreciate the Minister of State is highly committed to electoral reform and the different aspects of the Bill, we have to design the legislation in case he is replaced by someone who has no interest in this.  The legislation has to be robust enough to withstand that.</p><p> As I said on Second Stage, we all know from election counts of the effect of lack of voter education, information or awareness about how the process works.  We can see it when the ballot boxes are opened and, particularly in some parts of constituencies, we see a very high level of unintentionally spoiled votes.  While people absolutely have a right to spoil a vote, we see people doing it unintentionally because they are giving three first preferences or making three ticks.  They go to vote and feel they are casting a vote and having their say, but they are unaware that having gone to all that effort and gone through all of that process, their vote is invalidated.  They are not aware of that at all.  It is a significant number of ballot papers.  In any given constituency, there can be a few hundred spoiled votes and, out of that, more than 100 can easily be unintentionally spoiled.  The lack of strong voter education in Ireland is a big problem.</p><p> In New Zealand, which is a very good model in the context of electoral commissions, the electoral commission has youth advocates who drive up voter registration levels among younger people, it has outreach to people who are homeless, it has very accessible social media and easy to follow videos, it has enabled deaf and hard of hearing people to use sign language when voting and facilitated people who are blind to use a telephone dictation voting service, and it has facilitated early voting to increase turnout.  It has a range of measures that are really healthy in terms of democracy and that are a good model for our commission.</p><p> This amendment seeks to put a bit of flesh on voter education in the Bill so that if there is a Government or Minister in the future who has less interest in this, the electoral commission will be strongly supported through this Bill to carry out very good voter education.  Given that voter education has not had the priority and the resources put into it in this country to date that it deserves, and given how important democracy is, I do not think we can assume that will be the case, so we need to make sure this part of the Bill is as strong as possible.  If the Minister of State feels changes are needed to the wording I have put forward or that one or two parts of it are objectionable or problematic, I have no issue with that, but I feel this part of the Bill needs to be strengthened.  If the Minister of State is not accepting it in full, I ask that he would at least look to bring forward something similar on Report Stage to capture a lot of this.</p></speech>

This is an important amendment with a lot of value.  It is good to have a thorough discussion on it.  Nonetheless, I am conscious of the time.  We have three hours tomorrow and we are more than halfway through the amendments, and we expect the staff to come in early to work through it with us.  I would be pretty confident that if we suspend the meeting now, we will finish the Bill tomorrow in the time that we have.  I wanted to suggest that because I do not want to us to rush the debate on what is a lengthy and detailed amendment.  I am keen to talk to it but I do not want to prolong the debate if it is the Chairman's intention to suspend the meeting.</p></speech>

The electorate is actually more sophisticated than people often give them credit for, if we look at the low level of spoils in elections in general.  I have always been taken by the fact that when we go through the spoils, there is rarely a significant difference in terms of the geographical location or the demographic location.  The one difference, however, is in European elections and local elections.  Those of us who do the spoils often see a very clear pattern where people take the two ballots as consecutive and they go right down through the two ballots.  I think there are those areas where the electorate understand the system very well and are very sophisticated in how to operate it, but there are those cases where there is clearly anecdotal evidence from those of us who have been around elections for a long time where increasing knowledge of elections is key.</p> <p>  One of the questions I get asked a lot, often by people who have been around elections longer than I have, is that where people do not go all the way down the ballot, it somehow negatively impacts on their preferences.  Of course, I always give the advice to only vote for candidates who the person wants to see elected and to stop at the point at which they do not want to see anybody else elected.  The fact people even think that if they do not go all the way down, this means somebody else gets the vote when they have not assigned it, shows there are areas of the system where voter education is very important.</p> <p>  We see with referenda that there is real value in the way the referendum commission runs information campaigns.  Those campaigns generate additional awareness of the elections and help push up turnout, although not as much as we would like to see in some referenda.  Again, while maybe the level of detail in this amendment is more than what is needed for a Bill, I absolutely think the spirit of what Deputy O'Callaghan is looking for, and to have some legislative provision for this, is very important.  I am keen to see what the Minister of State has to say.  I certainly support the spirit as well as a fair amount of the content of the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022053100002#T00800"><p>I thank the Deputies for the quality of the amendments in general today.  They are very good and have sparked continuing debate about the commission and the legislation.</p> <p>  There is the point around unintentionally spoiled votes and voters voting all the way down a ballot paper.  It is not just a commitment from me or the Minister; it will be the commitment of the commission, which will have an independent statutory function.  Therefore, the commitment around that voter education and participation function will be ongoing, regardless of who is in the Department.  That is an important point to make.</p> <p>  With regard to the New Zealand experience of the use of advocates and the commission there, our commission will be tasked with looking at what works well and what does not work well in other jurisdictions in terms of voter participation.  Again, it is back to the members of this committee to participate in that and to direct the commission on what areas of research they would like it to carry out.</p> <p>  It is critical that the voter education part takes place and is an ongoing process, and is not just around electoral cycles or electoral events.  It needs to be ongoing, it needs to be immersive and it needs to be right across society, including in schools.  Many people of our age - I should say of my age - do not know how to vote correctly at times, so a lot of work needs to be done, which is something the commission will be committed to doing.</p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said in the context of trying to be prescriptive about its research function, we can see the points that Deputy O'Callaghan is trying to bring forward.  That is certainly something the franchise section has been doing consistently anyway and the commission will be tasked with doing this when it is established.</p> <p>  Chapter 9 of Part 2 of the Bill provides for the commission to take on a new policy research and advisory function.  As part of its work, the commission will promote public awareness of, and work to increase, public participation in the State&rsquo;s electoral and democratic processes through education and information programmes.  This is an expansion of the work which referendum commissions carried out as part of their roles.</p> <p>  Many of the actions set out in the amendment are matters the commission will be minded to pursue in compliance with its public awareness role.</p><p>In the main, these are really good ideas.  However, it is essential that the commission, as an independent body, have the freedom to decide as to how it goes about fulfilling its public information mandate.  Notwithstanding the important role the Referendum Commission played in the past, this is a new role in our electoral landscape, and leaving the decision-making with the commission will give it the flexibility to adjust its approach and emphasis over time.  To date, I have avoided the legislation being overly prescriptive in this regard.  Members will have gathered that from this afternoon's proceedings.  In continuing that approach, I am not in a position to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

I appreciate that this is not the approach that was taken to the drafting of the legislation.  That is fair enough.  I still have a concern, though, that the commission will ultimately read this legislation and will take its direction from it.  Yes, voter education is part of its remit, but I do not think there is anything in a reading of this legislation that would give it or anyone else any sense of the priority of our democratic function.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is correct that in the local and European elections we see people vote 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 on the local paper and 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 on the European one, the result being a ballot paper which the voter thinks is correct but which is spoiled.  That is quite frequent, and education on those things is really important.  That has not been done well enough to date.  I hope the commission does that but I want to see that priority reflected in the legislation.  Will the Minister of State look at this area and the current wording in advance of Report Stage to see whether it can be strengthened, albeit perhaps not in the prescriptive way I have attempted to do so?</p></speech>

That is significant.  Second, there is the fact that this committee will continue to have a role in the research and advocacy function of the commission in respect of recommendations and the reports that will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas arising from the commission's work.  It is very much an interactive process.  There will be a constant stream of information coming from the commission in the form of reports and research work, with this committee and Oireachtas Members having an opportunity to feed back into that.  I think the commission is strong enough to carry out that work.  We have talked this afternoon about a huge range of work we are now tasking the commission to do, which it will do, but it is important too that we have the flexibility I spoke about for it to be able to carry out that work.  While wholly accepting the rationale behind this amendment and related amendments, the commission requires that level of flexibility to be able to carry out its work.  I reassure the committee that it and Oireachtas Members will have an opportunity to interact continuously with the commission in its work.</p></speech>

I am concerned, however, that the criteria in it are too tight because they require an elector registered in a registration area in accordance with the subsection to renew his or her registration annually.  I am concerned that this puts an onerous requirement on people who are homeless, who may face a multitude of challenges, and that it could effectively discriminate against them in respect of registration requirements compared with other electors who do not need to renew their registration annually.  I hope this can be looked at.  The overall section is very welcome, but I have concerns that this could be discriminatory.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will know that we have a significant number of people who are in and out of the homeless system for a very long time.  That does not mean that they are not politically engaged or that they do not want to be engaged with the process.  We have to make it as easy as possible for those groups of people.  The idea of an annual registration seems almost punitive.  I completely accept that the nature of the accommodation and of the emergency accommodation system may mean that such people may not be at a given address in subsequent years or may be at multiple addresses.  People can be in and out of two, three or four different hostels in the space of 12 months.  I can just see no justification for this.  I fully accept that the Minister of State is trying to clean the electoral register, but we are talking about a small number of people and, at that, an even smaller number who are likely to be registered and engaged.  That is why I urge the Minister of State, if the briefing notes in front of him do not allow him to stifle us this time, to go away and to look at this.  There can be no reason why people who want to vote, simply because of circumstances not of their making, would be prevented from doing so by an onerous requirement.  I appeal to the Minister of State and the wisdom of his officials to find a fix to this.</p></speech>

I was in Cork Penny Dinners, which is a charity in Cork that works with many homeless people and many people in poverty, and I remember engaging with Caitr&iacute;ona Twomey, one of the co-ordinators and volunteers there.  I was talking to people who were homeless and who use that service.  These are really intelligent people who have political minds of their own and who want to engage in the political system.  They are really vulnerable but they want a say, and we should do everything to make that possible.  At the end of the day, they are all citizens and they should all have this right.  We should reduce barriers if possible.</p></speech>

Many homeless people I meet are very politically engaged, not only by virtue of their circumstances, and very well-educated and well-read people who are very engaged in our political system and the future of our country.  We all want to ensure they can participate fully in that.  Perhaps my speaking notes might have something of a stifling effect, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said.</p><p>Like all of the other amendments tabled by Deputy O'Callaghan, this is one well intended.</p><p> This is a new provision, the objective of which is to enable and facilitate people who are experiencing challenging circumstances to register to vote.  The annual re-registration requirement is intended to maximise the potential of people in this cohort to register and remain engaged with the process.  We can reasonably expect people availing of this provision to be a more mobile and transient group who will be more likely to have their details change within 12 months than many other voters.  As such, in order to keep their registration current, more engagement with their local authorities may be needed.  As this is a new provision, careful and considerate treatment will be needed in its implementation. </p><p> In respect of electors with no fixed addresses, the Bill requires registration authorities, in so far as is reasonable and practicable, to assist people making applications under this provision.  I refer Deputies to section 104, rule 37(2), at lines 3 to 4 on page 87.  In terms of renewals, I would expect that this assistance would be in place in good time to avoid people falling off the register.  The changes being made as part of the wider modernisation of the electoral registration process will enable a simple online process, including to reconfirm the registration for a further year or to update to a fixed address, where appropriate.</p><p> There is also a provision for the Minister to initiate a review of this provision within three years of its operation, ensuring that this annual requirement and any other part of the process can be considered in consultation with all stakeholders.  In this regard, I refer Deputies to section 82(8), at lines 16 to 27 on page 53.  This strikes the right balance and also creates a critical opportunity to gather information on the operation of this new provision to inform a future review.  As a result, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.494" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022053100002#V00200"><p>Has the Minister of State sought advice as to whether placing a requirement for annual registration on people who are homeless, when that is not being applied to anyone else, is discriminatory?  What was the advice given on that matter?  How can the Minister of State argue that this is not a form of discrimination against people who, through no fault of their own, are homeless?</p> <p>  I take from what the Minister of State has said that because the local authorities will be able to assist with the registration process, this will mitigate somewhat the onerous requirement to register annually.  We all know that local authorities have different priorities in terms of how they allocate resources and how they operate voter registration.  Indeed, this is one of reasons the electoral commission is being set up.  There is a huge variation in how local authorities interact with, engage and support homeless people with regard to their housing needs.  Needless to say, as we all know from our representational work, many people who have become homeless feel deeply disappointed by the level of engagement with them, the lack of support and way they are met with bureaucracy sometimes, notwithstanding the very good work that some people in local authorities do to support them.  To suggest that the same local authorities that people feel they are being failed by in the context of their housing needs are best placed to assist them with this onerous requirement for an annual registration is problematic.</p> <p>  As the Minister of State and Deputy &Oacute; Broin both stated, people who have lost their homes are very politically engaged.  They are often facing so many different challenges that if they can get to the point of being registered to vote, that is a step forward.  It seems unfair that they could potentially lose that because they miss out on the annual registration, which is not being required of anyone else.  It seems that we are taking a step forward in one respect in this Bill but then we are taking a step backwards through these onerous requirements.</p> <p>  If the concern is the fact that the person may be changing address or moving to different emergency accommodation, an annual registration is not going to sort that because there could be multiple moves with the year.  The provision for an annual registration is not going to address that issue.  The rationale for it does not hold up.  A person who is homeless could be moving around a lot so if he or she falls off the electoral register as a result of this requirement, that is deeply unfair.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister of State to address that point and to outline any advice he received as to whether this provision is discriminatory.  How does he believe it is not discriminatory?</p></speech>

In many cases, his arguments were strong.  We may agree or disagree with them but they were strong and credible arguments.  I say my next sentence with the greatest respect.  I do not believe for one second that the Minister of State believes the script he just read out is an appropriate response to the concern that is being raised.  I know that he is going to stick to the script, and that is fine, but I would really urge him, between now and Report Stage, to talk to officials and, as Deputy O'Callaghan suggested, to some of the homeless service providers about this matter.</p> <p>  Think about it for one second.  A family that is economically homeless could spend two years in emergency accommodation.  That emergency accommodation could change three or four times because of the nature of our system.  The family will start off in a hotel and then move to a hub.  They might then try to move to a hub that is closer to where the children are in school and then eventually they might get private rental accommodation.  That is a very typical experience because of the way the emergency accommodation system for families is set up.  Single homeless people who may have other complex issues going on in their lives could be in an out of a cycle of emergency accommodation including sofa surfing, rough sleeping and so on.  Therefore, the complexity of their addresses is very difficult.  That is why, for example, particularly in city centre homeless accommodation, we do not require those people to change their social welfare collection point every time they change hostel because it is recognised that there is a level of moving.</p> <p>  All I am asking the Minister of State to do is to think really hard about this one.  What Deputies O'Callaghan, Gould and I are saying is that this is a barrier that is unnecessary.  I know we have to make sure that the electoral register is clean and modernised but for such a small, albeit growing, cohort of people we can do better than this.  I would also say that the Minister of State should not cod himself that our local authorities in those areas with high and rising levels of homelessness have anything close to the resources needed to even deal with the emergency accommodation, HAP and housing needs assessment applications.  In most of the large local authorities, a housing needs assessment application when somebody becomes homeless is taking 16 weeks.  That is just to get people on the list.  HAP applications, if people manage to find HAP accommodation, are taking 12 to 14 weeks in the big local authorities.  In that context, I would imagine that if city or county managers or directors of housing were listening in and heard that their staff will be expected to annually register the 3,500 homeless single people and the homeless households, that there is an additional administrative burden, they would say that it is not going to work.</p> <p>  In the spirit in which he has engaged with us this evening, I ask the Minister of State to think long and hard about this.  A simple Government amendment on Report Stage could fix what is a significant problem for a small number of people without having any adverse impact on the integrity of the register or the process.</p></speech>

It is not the intention to be discriminatory.  What we are trying to do, and we are making genuine strides here, is to ensure our electoral register is robust and that our electoral system is open to and inclusive of all.  That is why we introduced this innovate and novel aspect in the Bill.  It is not intended to be discriminatory.  It is a new provision and we have made a commitment to reviewing the renewal requirement.  There will also be an opportunity, in the context of post-electoral events, to review the effectiveness of these provisions on a county-by-county basis.  It is a special arrangement.</p> <p>  An older person can have two or more addresses and we are trying to address that issue.  In light of the contributions from Deputies &Oacute; Broin, O'Callaghan and Gould, we will give further consideration to this matter before Report Stage.</p></speech>

In 2019, An Post launched an address point service for people accessing emergency accommodation.

Some members may be participating remotely from their offices in the Leinster House precinct.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pa Daly, who is abroad on parliamentary business, but is being substituted for by Deputy R&eacute;ada Cronin.  Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill and Senator Barry Ward send apologies.  Senator Lynn Ruane may join us at a later stage.  Senator Vincent Martin sends his apologies.  Deputy Patrick Costello is giving a speech in the D&aacute;il Chamber and hopes to join us later in the meeting.</p><p>The purpose of our meeting is to engage with stakeholders who made a written submission to assist the committee in the examination of the operation of the Coroner Service.  Before I welcome the witnesses, I will speak on how we operate in this committee.  This committee processes a significant amount of legislation.  We effectively mirror the Department of Justice.  We also reserve time in our diary for an elective module once a month, where we nominate a topic of interest to the committee for examination and consideration.  This month's module relates to the Coroner Service, which is why the witnesses are here.  I thank them for their interest and for contributing to our discussion.</p><p>I welcome Professor Denis Cusack, senior coroner for the district of Kildare; Mr. Steven Smyrl, director of Massey and King and an accredited genealogist; and Ms Nicola Morris, president of Accredited Genealogists Ireland.  From the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, I welcome Ms Doireann Ansbro, head of legal and policy; and Ms Sin&eacute;ad Nolan, communications manager.  I also welcome Mr. Roger Murray, senior counsel, Mr. David O'Malley and Ms Doireann O'Mahony BL, barrister and practitioner, all co-authors of the recently published work, <i>Medical Inquests</i>.  It was published to wide acclaim in recent months and represents a significant contribution to studies on the subject.  We are delighted to have the three authors here and indeed all the witnesses.  I think it will make for an interesting meeting.</p><p>There are some housekeeping notes at the beginning of the meeting.  As always, we advise witnesses of parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses and members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is otherwise known as good manners.  The witnesses are new to meetings in these chambers, but the reminder is for members too.  I ask mobile phones to be turned to airplane mode if possible.  Even though they may not be making noise, the signal can transmit and interfere with sound recordings and afterwards, it can transpire that something was missed because of interference with the signal.  I ask members who are participating remotely to keep their device muted until they are speaking and to remember to unmute when they speak so that we can hear them at the right times and not hear them at the wrong times.</p><p>We have adopted a format whereby the witnesses' presentations are kept relatively short, which allows time for significant questions and answers and engagement with the committee as the meeting unfolds.  Each opening statement will be limited to three minutes.  I think all the witnesses have tailored their remarks accordingly.  We have a clock in the top corner, if they want to keep an eye on that to help with their timekeeping.  I will have to be strict on that to make the meeting flow smoothly.  Once we have had an opening statement from all of the witnesses and the organisations they represent, we will have a round robin among members of the committee.  Each member will have seven minutes in which to engage, including both the questions they wish to pose and the answers that the witnesses may wish to give.  We will have a clock for that too.  There are three members present physically and two others present virtually.  Other members typically join the meeting in the course of the afternoon.  We may have a second round of such questions and answers depending on available time.</p><p>I will call Professor Cusack first, followed by Mr. Smyrl, Ms Ansbro, Mr. Murray and Ms O'Mahony.</p><p>Each of our guests will have three minutes.  First on my list is Professor Cusack, who is welcome to the committee.  I invite him to make his presentation.  I will remind him when his three minutes are up.</p></speech>

I am addressing the committee both in my individual professional capacity as senior coroner for the district of Kildare and on behalf of the president of Coroners Society of Ireland.  There are a number of matters on which I am happy to elaborate at a later stage.</p> <p>  The coroner&rsquo;s forensic and medico-legal death investigation, including post mortem examination and inquest hearing, is carried out in accordance with the provisions of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, common law and the provisions of the Coroners Acts, together with other relevant statutes, including the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.  I was privileged to serve on the Department of Justice&rsquo;s review of the Coroner Service working group which produced the report of 2000.  That report included 107 recommendations of a wide-ranging nature for reform of the Coroner Service in Ireland.  I stress that it is the Coroner Service and the coroners themselves who have been driving and pushing reform in those 20 years.  At page 2 of that report, under the heading of "Ethos of the Irish Coroner Service", it was stated that the investigation of sudden and unexplained death takes many forms throughout the world.  There is a relatively wide range of unexplained deaths.  Our work reflects the essential value placed by our Constitution on life itself.  I stress that this is about compassionate sensitivity with legal formality and humanity.</p> <p>  The Coroner Service is for the living as well as the dead.  It must be a service which balances that legal formality with compassionate sensitivity.  There is an overemphasis on inquests, which only occur in a minority of coroner's inquiries.  An inquest is a public inquiry and the coroner is the judicial officer of the State investigating certain categories of deaths, with more than 80% of all deaths in the State in 2021 being reported to the Coroner Service.  I refer the committee to section 18A of the Coroners Acts of 1962 to 2020.  I will refer later to recommendations of a general character designed to prevent further fatalities.</p> <p>  There have been many significant legislative reforms of the coroner&rsquo;s role in the intervening period since the report of 2000.  Senator McDowell is familiar with the coroner's rules and the Bill he introduced as Minister for Justice.  The reforms in investigation of maternal deaths and in civil legal aid are two important issues.  For various reasons, other reforms have not been followed through with regard to Part 2 of the Coroners Bill.  The structure, organisation and financing of the Coroner Service no longer meet the needs of a modern, forensic and medico-legal death investigation service and have not done so for some time.  The structure, organisation and financing are not fit for purpose in this modern era.  It is time to drive innovative change.</p> <p>  I have, in my submission to the committee, listed seven headings for reform.  Those relate to the reorganisation of districts within a larger regional structure, with shared operational, office, administrative, investigative framework and support; support service arrangements for pathology, post-mortem examination, toxicology and histopathology; an appointment system and terms and conditions for coroners with more full-time coroners as districts are amalgamated; the appointment of coroner's investigation officers on a regional and shared basis; importantly, the appointment of a chief coroner and deputy chief coroner to enhance leadership and consistency in practice; the establishment of a structured Coroner Service agency with an agency director; and the establishment of a Corner Service advisory committee.  I have also included methods of death investigation but I am not going to go through them unless asked to do so by the committee at a later stage.  I thank the committee members for their attention.</p></speech>

The input today from genealogists pertains to the coroners' responsibility for registering deaths and the effect this has on the extent to which much of the required biographical data is omitted from such registrations.  The origins of the Coroners Service developed out of a fiscal role surrounding death brought to Ireland by the English colonists in the 12th century.  By the 18th century, it had developed into one almost entirely restricted to establishing the facts around unexplained deaths.</p> <p>  Unlike other courts, that of the coroner is not adversarial but rather inquisitorial.  It is this role of establishing facts and gathering information which led, under the Registration of Births and Deaths (Ireland) Act 1863, and reconfirmed in the Civil Registration Act 2004, to coroners being given responsibility for registering the deaths of those who demise was sudden, violent or simply unexplained.  Since 1863, under successive legislation the registration process has remained largely unchanged.  Currently, section 41 of the 2004 Act requires that the coroner "shall give the appropriate registrar a certificate containing the required particulars of the death concerned and that registrar shall register the death in such manner as [the Registrar General] may direct". </p> <p>  Under the 1863 Act there were eight key particulars to be recorded in each registration.  They comprised the date and place of death, the name of the deceased, the deceased&rsquo;s sex, marital status, age and occupation, the cause of death and the name, qualification and address of the informant.</p> <p>  From our modern day perspective, 160 years later, the obvious omissions in the data recorded should have rung alarm bells.  For whatever reason, the system adopted in Ireland was almost identical to that implemented in England and Wales a generation earlier in 1837.  By contrast, the data recorded in Scottish civil death registrations from 1855 included vital additional information including the deceased&rsquo;s place of birth and their parents' names, including their mother's maiden surname.</p> <p>  The failings of the Irish system are that for many death registrations, once they move beyond living memory, it can be almost impossible to match a death record to a birth record.  As genealogists, we tend to refer to this as "genealogical snap", referencing the children&rsquo;s card game where two picture cards must match.  Historically, in terms of civil registration, only a name and age on a death registration will match, or approximately match, the same data recorded on a birth registration, and even then, this is beset with problems.  For instance, for married women, only their husband&rsquo;s surname will be recorded and not their own birth surname.</p> <p>  In the years leading up to the drafting of the Civil Registration Bill 2003, a significant amount of lobbying, spearheaded by the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations, was undertaken by genealogists to ensure that the death registration system in Ireland was brought into line with guidelines set by the United Nations.  We felt it was imperative that for the system to have any integrity, much broader biographical data would need to be recorded so that, again referencing genealogical snap, all three vital records of a citizen's life - those of birth, marriage and death - could be linked together.  </p> <p>  Under section 37 of the 2004 Act, for each deceased person death registrations are required to record their date and place of birth and the name and birth surname of their mother and father.  This system came into operation on 5  December 2005 under SI 764 of that year.</p> <p>  I have approximately three more paragraphs to read.  Should I continue?</p></speech>

They interviewed coroners, bereaved families, lawyers and others involved in the coronial system and made 52 recommendations for root and branch reform.  The ICCL is now conducting a public awareness campaign on the need for reform.</p> <p>  Primarily, the coroners system must be properly resourced and put on a professional footing.  Families and loved ones must be given more information and support, and recommendations from coroners must be given the due attention required to ensure tragedies that can be prevented are prevented.  We need a nationwide, full-time coronial service with fully trained coroners and adequate support.  A chief coroner should be appointed to manage the service.  An inspectorate should be put in place and a code of practice should be developed.  A formal jury selection process must also be established and we call on all parties to support Senator Boylan&rsquo;s current Private Members' Bill on this issue or for the Government to prioritise its own Bill on jury selection.</p> <p>  The lack of direct support to bereaved families was identified by the Department of Justice in 2000 as perhaps the most serious deficiency in the Coroner Service.  According to the interviews conducted for our report, little has changed 22 years later.  Most families we interviewed reported negative experiences.  Some faced long, unexplained delays.  Families reported being marginalised, not having access to information they need and experiencing retraumatisation.</p> <p>  The steps that have been taken so far in preparation for the reopened Stardust inquests demonstrate how the inquest process can be properly conducted in the most complex of cases and we congratulate the coroner and the State on the efforts being made to finally get to the truth of what happened on that tragic night.  However, more information and support must be provided to all families who have lost loved ones in unexplained circumstances.</p><p>While we welcome the new guidance note published by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, we consider that more support is required.  We believe the following: families should have access to bereavement counselling; legal aid must be more widely available; and an independent family liaison officer should be appointed.</p><p> The absence of a structured process to follow up on coroner recommendations is of deep concern and must be urgently addressed.  We note the commitment by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to review internal processes to implement such findings and we urge them to make such reviews public.  For many families, structural failings mean the present system does not provide an effective mechanism to get to the truth about how and why their loved one died.  These failings also mean that the public interest in getting to the truth of what happened and to prevent future deaths is not being met.  We call for all-party support for our key recommendation to establish a nationwide fully professional coroner service in Ireland.</p></speech>

The committee's work is of vital importance.  The coroner service is an underappreciated keystone of democracy and the rule of law.  The questions that the committee has addressed look at the core challenges to making a service that is fit for purpose in the 21st century.</p><p>I have represented over 100 families at mostly medical inquests located anywhere from Belfast to Cork.  What strikes me most is how helpful a well-run inquest can be to healing.  The converse is also true, as a badly-run inquest compounds the hurt and distress felt by a bereaved family.  Poor knowledge of the law, injudicious behaviour by coroners and unopposed obstruction and, in some cases, obfuscation by medics leave deep and lasting scars.</p><p>I had the privilege of representing the families of Dhara Kivlehan and Sally Rowlette at Sligo inquests in 2014, which added to the national debate on maternal deaths.  The learning that emerged from those well-handled medical inquests has undoubtedly saved lives.</p><p>In February of this year, I acted for the family of the late Shane Banks, who was a 43-year-old father of three children who died following surgery in Galway.  That inquest, which was presided over by Dr. Ciar&aacute;n MacLoughlin, who has since retired, heard from almost 30 witnesses over three weeks.  It is the longest running medical inquest in the history of the State.  No stone was left unturned by Dr. MacLoughlin and the thoroughness of his investigation is an example to others.  During those three weeks, hearings were heard in the function room of a rowing club, the council chambers of Galway Country Council and, most farcically of all, the stage of the Town Hall Theatre.  These are not settings that are appropriate to the gravitas of a coroner's court.</p><p>Coming here today, I took soundings from some coroners.  I asked them was there any message that they wanted me to convey and their resounding reply was that proper resources are badly needed.  Together with my colleague, Mr. David O'Malley, we have summarised some of the points that have been made in my submission.  I shall deal with the first number of those points before handing over to my colleague, Mr. O'Malley, who will deal with the remainder.</p><p>We have summarised the conclusions contained in my submission, the first one of which concerns the qualifications or experience or both of coroners, which I know is part of the committee's bailiwick.  What is the appropriate length of qualification?  Should coroners be legally qualified only?  Other speakers have already addressed the committee by mentioning the coroner's jury.  We add our voice to those who called for a properly representative jury to be present at inquests.  The number should be uneven and there should be a simple majority.  We need to introduce coroners' rules in order that there are no surprises on the day of the hearing.  Crucially, we should follow the example of England and Wales in having a statutory system of prevention of future death reports.  There should be an obligation on coroners to identify failings and call on those who have the authority to do so to remedy those failings.  Next, the prevention of future death reports should be clear, brief, focused, meaningful and designed to have practical effect.</p><p>With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I would now like to hand over to my colleague, Mr. O'Malley.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.519" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Doireann O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022053100002#D00400"><p>I offer my sincere thanks for the opportunity to address the committee.  I have represented many bereaved families in the coroners' courts across the country.  They were spouses, parents and children who were searching for answers as to how, and in what circumstances, their loved ones died.  There have been too many times that I have left a coroner's court with families whose grief has only been compounded by the process and whose questions remain unanswered.  During the process these people are at their most vulnerable.  They deserve truth, justice and accountability.  We owe it to them to provide a service that upholds these principles.</p> <p>  I hope that my account of working with bereaved people will help to inform the committee.  I will endeavour to make sure that the families whom I represent have their voices heard here today and I am here because of them.</p> <p>  We need to modernise and humanise what is a vital service, which is one of the oldest public services in Ireland but that has come under increasing scrutiny.  This afternoon's hearing is not before time.  Much credit is due to the committee for putting reform of the coroner service on the agenda.</p> <p>  I believe it is fair to say that little is known about the service by people who have not come in contact with it.  The following question has, for example, been asked.  When was the last time that an interview was held for a coroner's post?  I am not quite sure of the answer but I believe there is a need to reflect very high levels of transparency, accountability and fairness across the service.  To this end it would be appropriate for the Minister for Justice to take over the appointment of coroners nationwide.  Coroners are appointed by local authorities around the country after being selected by the Commission for Public Service Appointments, whereas in Dublin they are appointed by the Minister.  The following question has been asked.  How much are coroners paid?  Of course they are remunerated out of the public purse.  I believe that the salaries payable to coroners should be published.</p> <p>  It is fundamental to the maintenance of confidence in the service that coroners must not only be independent but also impartial.  They must treat all witnesses with respect and not give the impression that they have made up their minds in advance.  Experience has taught me that most of all, families want a professional service and a professional investigation.  The professionalism of the coroner in the lead-up to an inquest very much sets the tone.  For example, I have been involved in many inquests where coroners have refused to accede to the request made by families for the attendance of consultants under whose care their deceased loved one was in the lead-up to his or her death unless, and until, a series of questions to be posed to the consultant are provided, which is unfair and is not right.  We urgently need standardisation across the system.  There are noticeable inconsistencies between districts.</p> <p>  I echo what the other speakers said about recommendations.  I mean that recommendations made at inquests need to have force.  There should be a duty on coroners to report those recommendations to the relevant entities and a duty on the entities to respond back within a timeframe as to what has or will be done.</p> <p>  We owe it to those who have to go through the extremely agonising and tortuous process of an inquest but there is one glimmer of hope that it can offer, which is learning will come about that will prevent future deaths.  I believe that the review system is not user-friendly and ordinary people are intimidated by the idea of having to go to the High Court.  I believe that it would be of great benefit were a review panel or board to be established in order that matters could be referred to it, as appropriate.</p> <p>  Lastly, I echo the call for a new post of coroner's officer to be introduced at a regional level.  While members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in coroners' courts around the country provide an excellent level of care for relatives, the establishment of a new post of coroner's officer is the way forward as it would permit the standards of a service for the bereaved to be raised to an acceptable level for a public service in Ireland in the 21st century.</p></speech>

Now I will open up the meeting so members can ask questions and contribute in the order that they have indicated.  Some of the committee members are physically in this room and others are online.  I ask members to indicate whichever witness or witnesses they want to respond to their questions.  I advise all of the witnesses that if they wish to make a contribution then please indicate their intention to me.  If a question or comment is not directly addressed at a witness or witnesses then please feel free to raise a hand or pitch in and give me a nod if they want to comment.

I have read the opening statements and other associated material and I was struck by how all of the witnesses have requested that proper resourcing be put in place.</p><p>I imagine from my own experience - I am in the north west, in the Sligo-Leitrim area - that it is very much an <i>ad hoc</i>system run by the county councils.  I believe that is one of the primary problems.  I would be interested to hear how the witnesses feel that could be changed in a way that is adequate.  Personally, I think it needs to go towards regionalisation, where a number of counties would come together and there would be a permanent, full-time and properly staffed and resourced coroner, and this would be done across the different parts of the country.  Getting that part of it right would be one of the fundamental things we need to try to do.<br/><br/>Have the witnesses any sense of what the cost would be to the State, additional to the current cost?  Ms O'Mahony mentioned that we do not know the full cost of the service.  If we do not know the cost, we are not able to measure it.  Do we have a measure of that?  If we have, I would be delighted to get an assurance on that.  What level of additional funding would it take to get that professionalisation put in place?  Professor Cusack might want to answer on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.523" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Denis Cusack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022053100002#E00200"><p>The local authorities value for money report came out only a few years ago and it looked at this in great detail and costed the whole service, so that information is there.  The last time it was costed, it was somewhere in the region of &euro;8 million but that was nearly 20 years ago.</p> <p>  The Deputy says it is within the remit of the local authority.  The local authorities actually have little or no role other than the formal appointment of the coroner and the payment of fees for pathologists and witnesses.  Other than that, it is left up to the coroner.  There is a commonality.  I would not agree with everything that has been said and I think there are some misunderstandings on the role of the coroner.  The coroner service is not like the Courts Service.  The coroner service is the body of coroners.  It is not a section of the Department of Justice.  That is why I think it is the coroners who have been driving this reform.</p> <p>  On reviewing for this, I had to refresh my memory.  I actually chaired the sub-committee on the services of that reform.  Of the 107 recommendations, many of them that have since been put forward as being new or innovative were actually put into that report in 2000.  Senator McDowell brought forward the 2007 Bill.  If we look at Part 2 and Part 3 of that Bill, many of the answers to what we need are there and we do not need to reinvent the wheel.</p> <p>  I stress that we are very tied up with inquests.  Coroners issue interim certificates, cremation certificates, out-of-state certificates, insurance reports, follow-up for families, documents, research with the Health Research Board and coroner's certificates.  From 2019 to 2021, which goes back to pre-Covid days, out of 17,822, only 12% of the death investigations proceeded to inquest and 20%, or one in five, to post mortem.  The vast majority of the coroner's work is actually done in the office in investigating the death and helping the families, for example, in getting a death certificate to get a will, to get probate or to get insurance.  We have co-operated, helped and advised.  I would advise the committee not to get too bogged down with the inquests.  Inquests are extraordinarily important and medical inquests are extraordinarily important, and every death must be inquired into but let us not forget the majority of death investigations are not medical inquests and they are not contested inquests; they are post mortem examinations and follow-up with families.</p> <p>  I am going to address the issue raised by Mr. Smyrl, with whom I had enormous correspondence when I was president of the council of coroners from 2008 to 2010.  We do not disagree on the aims but the coroner service is not a civil registration service and it is not a genealogical service.  I will tell the committee why later on, if the members wish.  Because of the complexities of family life in Ireland today, the best people to help with civil registration and genealogy are the family.  They know their deceased one, they know the family, they know the origins.  Appendix L of the 2000 report set that out in the year 2000.  We have a commonality but it is how we get there.  I would agree that many of our recommendations are very similar.  It is just how we get there in order to have a more global view.</p> <p>  All of the time, I want to come back to the point that it is a legal formality, it is a legal system, but there is a compassionate sensitivity to the bereaved and to the dignity and respect of the deceased.  If I could sum it up in one word again, it is the humanity of the coroner service and what the coroners are doing within the legal framework but, sometimes, we lose sight of that with legal frameworks.  Much of what is in the report about support services, bereavement and counselling is not within the remit of the coroners.  Many of the reforms and many of the faults that we might say of people dealing with the justice system could be said for the High Court, the Circuit Court, the Supreme Court, the District Court and tribunals.  We need to focus on a wider approach of supporting families.  That should not simply be in saying how we support by counselling and support in the courtroom and in the courthouse for the coroner's court, and I think we should be looking at the entire criminal justice system.  The report from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission was only published on 6 May, and the coroners had an input into that in terms of looking at it with the officials.  We have a lot of the answers together and maybe it is just a difference of emphasis.</p> <p>  I want to assure the committee on behalf of the coroner service - my very good colleague, Dr. Cullinane, is here in the Gallery - that we are striving to continue the reforms and we have been pushing the door for reforms.  We, above all people, have the greatest perspective in our privilege in being able to serve our citizens.  We need to drive reform and I think we are very united in that.  I think of the families.  I have sent the committee recommendations from last month.  I think we are very much at one, if we can work together.</p></speech>

That concludes Deputy Kenny's slot for this round.  I call Senator McDowell.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.525" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022053100002#E00400"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their very thoughtful written presentations, which I have had the opportunity to read, and for the oral presentations.  As Professor Cusack mentioned, in the year 2000 he presented a report to my predecessor as Minister for Justice, John O'Donoghue.  In the flurry of law reform that I presided over, we only got to the point of publishing in April 2007 a Bill for the reform of the coroner service.  The electorate did their bit with me two months later, and that was the end of my personal involvement.  I want to thank the coroners for that report.  As Professor Cusack has stated, the Bill largely depended on that report, although maybe there were some aspects of it that the coroners would have preferred to have been slightly differently drafted.  However, in general terms, it is the fruit of their work.  If we are having an inquest, we should have an inquest as to what happened to the 2007 Bill, its strange death and the fact it is 22 years since Professor Cusack&rsquo;s group reported and nothing has happened.</p> <p>  There are a few things that I want to say and that I want to bounce off all of those present.  First, I think it is hugely important that we emphasise the inquisitorial nature of inquests and the coroners&rsquo; function, generally speaking.  Second, to go back to Professor Cusack's point, we need very definitely to work out in our own heads that only a small minority of cases go to an inquest before a jury, where there is a real clash of testimony or something that needs to be resolved in any way by having lawyers or representation.  The vast majority of coroners' inquests are different.  However, that does not mean the non-inquest approach is irrelevant, for example, to protect us from a Dr. Shipman situation.</p><p>I do not know how Ireland would detect a Dr. Shipman, to be honest.  I wonder whether it would happen.  This is an issue we have to deal with.</p><p> I have said it is inquisitorial.  At this stage in my career I can say we cannot go down the road of judicialising everything.  We cannot have people dragged to the courts.  Whatever can be done to keep people away from the courts must be done.  The courts are adversarial.  The decency and humanitarian approach that have been mentioned require an inquisitorial approach.</p><p> I fully support reform of the selection of juries.  I am slightly critical, and I hope nobody will take offence, of the idea of people starting to object to jurors.  This is crazy.  We could have 20 people interested in the outcome of an inquest as, for instance, with regard to the Stardust.  If they get seven challenges each, as the legislation suggests, God only knows how long it would take to get a jury empanelled.  If there is one interest group on the other side, if I may use that phrase, to give that person only seven challenges as against 150 would be very unfair.  We have to think this through more carefully.  Clearly, it is not satisfactory that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na just goes down to the local main street and selects people he or she finds available and puts them in to act as a jury.  I believe seven is enough.  We do not need substantial juries unless somebody else has a contrary point of view.</p><p> I have a question for Professor Cusack.  What happened to my legislation?  We do not need an inquest but perhaps a death certificate as to what happened to it.  What was the cause of death?</p></speech>

When we met the late Brian Lenihan, who briefly served as Minister with responsibility for justice, we thought we were there but the recession hit us.  In recent months, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and parliamentary questions from Members of the Opposition have highlighted very much the proper questions to be asked.  Much of the legislative reform has been passed.  I will cite two examples.  The first is civil legal aid, which is still imperfect and could be better but this could be said about the entire civil justice system.  The other is maternal deaths and I worked on this with Clare Daly, when she was a Deputy, and her researcher.  These are two very important reforms.  Much has been done piecemeal but Parts 2 and 3 have not.  Neither have sections 55 and 56 in the Bill, which deal with the recommendations.  A good deal has been done but work on the financing, structure, organisation, the chief coroner's office and the coroner's investigator has not.  Coroners are struggling to keep the service going.  As the Senator said, we have struggled during Covid-19.  Kildare was tragically hit by it and we provided a service there.  We do this with the enormous help of the Garda, GPs, hospital consultants and others.</p></speech>

People say their salaries should be published but they are published.  It is a very simple formula.  There are three areas as Dublin and Cork are different because of their size.  Other areas have approximately &euro;22,000 to run the entire office.  As the Senator has asked I will give the details.  For each death reported it is approximately &euro;129.  If there is a post mortem it is &euro;180 . It is &euro;520 for an inquest.</p></speech>

There are a lot of structures.  There are many things about which I could tell and inform the Senator.  Many of them are positive.

For every death reported where a coroner has to consider what to do and whether it needs a post mortem or can be signed off, that is &euro;128.  If it goes to post mortem, then the coroner has to go through the post mortem and issue further certification.  This is approximately &euro;180.  If it goes to full inquest, it is &euro;520.  I have the figures and we can do a quick sum.  In 2021 there were a total of 25,421 cases.  Of these, 18,746 were report only and this can be multiplied by &euro;128.  There were 4,574 post mortem only, which can be multiplied by &euro;180.  There were 2,101 inquests and this can be multiplied by &euro;520.  It is a simple calculation.  Out of this the coroner's service must pay everything.  There are also expenses.  We have to pay pathologists and the State Laboratory for toxicology.  Witnesses probably have to be paid although many witnesses do not put in for expenses.  All of this is certified by the coroner and it comes from the local authority.  Local authority managers have an interesting perspective on why it should still be a local system from the 19th century and not a centralised system in the Department of Justice.</p></speech>

We are speaking about modernising and humanising this vital service.  It is one of the oldest public services we have in the State.  Professor Cusack was the coroner in Kildare.  As he said, there were a disproportionate number of deaths in the first wave of Covid.  I heard him speak on "Drivetime" and I listened back to it because I was so taken by what he said.  He gave people back their dignity in death.  He referred to them as the unique and loved.  So much of the conversation about older people at the time was almost as if they had reached their best before date.  What is another year?  A year might be the difference between a first great-grandchild being born and a first day at school.  These years are important.  It is great to have Professor Cusack's input.</p> <p>  There is potential for the office of the coroner to be a voice for people.  Professor Cusack approached the nursing home deaths in a way that showed what is possible in the coroner's court to demystify the legal and medical processes and remove barriers so that ordinary people can be part of it.  There is potential for this.  Professor Cusack said he was involved in the Department of Justice's review of the coroner system in 2000.  He said 107 recommendations were made.  Have many of them come to life yet?  Which of those that have not would Professor Cusack be most interested in seeing implemented immediately?  For me it might be the centralisation of the process.</p></speech>

I met with the chief coroners of Singapore, Canada and England and Wales.  This approach enhances procedures and consistency, but it must be undertaken within a structure.  It is like everything else.  One does not abolish something, as we often do, without putting something else in its place.  We are all terribly aware of this point from our health service.  Therefore, regarding the recommendations, I refer to the establishment of an office of the chief coroner and deputy coroner.  Additionally, though, some areas of the country are struggling to get pathologists.  Some of my colleagues cannot get pathologists and bodies are being moved.  It is terrible for a family to find a loved one's body being moved 100 km because there is no pathologist.  I stress all these aspects.</p><p> I am not sure we need to have mandatory juries in any cases.  Regarding discretion, this is an inquisitorial system and there must be wide discretion.  I believe lawyers and others misunderstand an inquisitorial system because we live in a common law, adversarial system in the main.  When we have an inquisitorial system, however, we should be able to work together based on information.  On whether we need juries, we have abolished them for almost everything.  I understand, indeed, that the abolition of juries in defamation cases is being considered.  The last case of this type was the Dunne case in 1988 for personal injuries.  It was a medical case.  Therefore, I wonder whether we need to have mandatory juries.  Why could we not have good and qualified coroners?  We can talk about the qualifications.  I believe we have the right mixture.  In the early stages, more medical knowledge is needed to sort out how to proceed with the investigation.  Later, there is a need for legal qualifications.  What is the best qualification for a coroner?  It is to be medically and legally qualified and to have a lot of common sense and humanity.  I do not think that can be put into statutes.</p></speech>

It works well in the UK in respect of the inquisitorial nature of things.  Cross-examination should just be examination, as we discussed earlier.</p> <p>  I agree with Senator McDowell that juries must be representative of the community.  I refer not to people picking holes in juries, but the same people should not be showing up all the time.  In the west of Ireland, I see the same people turning up every time I do an inquest.  That should not happen.</p> <p>  I did the first inquest involving Covid-19 in the history of the State in Mayo.  The family members were not interested in verdicts etc.  Those are only gateposts.  They are instead interested in how death occurred and the wider recommendation, from a societal perspective, from the coroner.  It is mandatory now in the context of all Covid-19 deaths.  This is a chance for us all to learn lessons.  There are real-time data to assist in charting trends, preventing future deaths and making recommendations for processes in the State.  Therefore, we have been a bellwether in the Covid-19 situation and this is a good opportunity to learn lessons.  I felt I had to address those couple of points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.544" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Roger Murray" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022053100002#G00500"><p>Regarding what Senator McDowell said about the inquisitorial nature of the inquiry, as commented on by Professor Cusack, it is vitally important to understand this aspect.  In our civil law system, which is adversarial, there is a contest.  In the criminal courts tomorrow, for example, there will be those acting for the accused and those acting for the prosecution.  It is a contest between two skilled teams of lawyers.  The truth can quickly get lost in that situation.  Similarly, in a civil case, there is a plaintiff and a defendant and people are trying to score points off each other in the context.  In an inquest, however, the process is inquisitorial.  The coroner is the person who holds the ring and decides on the witnesses to be called, based on the evidence.  The truth remains central to that process.<br/><br/>Professor Cusack referred to the consistency of the figures in this regard.  Approximately 2,000 deaths annually are the subject of an inquest.  The importance of those proceedings to society cannot be underestimated.  Turning to the cost to the State in respect of getting answers, repeated studies by academics, including Boothman <i>et al</i>from 2014, show that the reason people go to lawyers in the first instance after an adverse medical event is not to seek compensation but to get answers.  Therefore, the State could save itself considerable amounts of money by investing in the coronial service to ensure in a medical context, where there are unanswered questions around a death, that a properly run and resourced inquest can address and answer all those queries.  Compensation might be the very last thing on the family's mind thereafter.<br/><br/>Regarding the question raised by Deputy Kenny concerning the structure or umbrella the coronial service should fall under, the recommendations Professor Cusack referred to suggested, and I refer to this in my submission as well, that the coronial service should be attached to the Courts Service and that a new statutory agency should be established to be known as central coroner services to reflect the core concept of service.  In this regard, an important Venetian saying comes to mind, namely, the dead open the eyes of the living.  It is crucial to emphasise the public importance of the lessons that arise from a properly run inquest.  It was also recommended that the central coronial service should have the logistics to support the undertaking of functions such as salaries, expenses and organisational set-up, training and development of a high-quality service and best practice procedures and information dissemination.  That latter point is something to which my colleague and co-author, Ms O'Mahony, has repeatedly referred.  There is also the importance of ensuring information available to the public.  My colleagues from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and the report by Professor Phil Scraton and Dr. Gillian McNaull, made particular reference to the dearth of information available to people.  It was also suggested there should be a national information system for coroners and that an annual report or presentation on the coronial service be produced.  The saving to the State of having a properly resourced and run coronial service will have a significant knock-on effect in respect of addressing societal concerns and suspicions, especially concerning medical deaths.</p></speech>

On costs, what we found in our report was that one of the crucial things missing in this context, and this aspect goes back to the 2000 report as well, as I mentioned in the opening statement, was information for families and the attitude of the people involved in the coronial service to families.  Providing information should not cost that much.  This is about the people engaging with the families, giving them information at every step of the process.  It is about explaining at the outset what the coronial system does and what the family members can expect from a post mortem.  In those 10% of cases where they happen, and it may only be 10% but nevertheless I agree with Mr. Murray on this point, inquests are vital for the service provided to families and to society at large.  I refer to providing information concerning what is going to happen initially and what may happen afterwards.  This kind of approach could radically change a family's experience of the service and without costing that much.  It is the same situation with attitudes.  I am delighted to hear Professor Cusack talk about a service that is founded on compassion and humanity.  Unfortunately, however, our report, and the interviews done with family members, showed many families did not experience compassion.  I emphasise again that everyone who interacts with families should have that attitude of compassion and humanity, whether those are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the members of the future support service, which I am sure we are going to find resources to fund, and, of course, the coroners themselves.  Everyone involved in this process should bring that attitude of compassion and humanity to bear, and that can greatly change the experience of families while not costing much at all.</p> <p>  Turning to the points made about juries, I must respond because it is of great concern to the ICCL that our right to a jury seems to be continuing to be eroded.  We are fundamentally committed to the constitutional right to a jury across the courts, but also in contested inquests.  This is because we consider it not only a fundamental right in our Constitution but also that a jury can add significantly to the perception of justice and bring the changing attitudes of society into a process such as the current coronial one.  Equally, a jury reflects the changing make-up and diversity of our communities when such important decisions are being made.  This aspect brings me to the jury selection issue, which is fundamental.  It is a burning issue now for the Stardust inquiries.  We need to get this facet sorted out.</p><p>We can resolve it very quickly, as Senator Boylan has done with her Private Members' Bill.  I believe the Government is committed to it as well, so I urge the Government to make that a priority.  As we have heard, not only are garda&iacute; potentially just going to the local community and asking people to participate, but we also heard about families seeing advertisements on Facebook from the Garda looking for jury members.  It is an absolutely unprofessional approach at present so we must change it, and we can change it urgently.</p></speech>

The witnesses are talking about pulling in the same people and the like.  Is an inquest not even getting off the ground still happening or is there still a risk of that?  That is one thing.</p> <p>  We have been talking a great deal about the chief coroner's office and the suggestion of looking at other models.  Some more information about that would be interesting to discuss.  I am curious about one thing.  If we are trying to keep our coroner system as an inquisitorial system, how does that work in New Zealand, Canada and the UK, which are also adversarial common law systems?  What about the juxtaposition of those different systems?</p> <p>  The information, the data and the like are very interesting and important, but that work cannot happen unless somebody is being paid to put it together.  This gets to the need for proper secretarial support, administrative support and so forth.  I am not sure compiling reports and statistical information, while important, is on that list of payments.</p> <p>  There is another matter I wish to flag.  I do not know if it was raised previously, and my apologies if it was.  We could go down a rabbit hole regarding the cost of justice to the State.  We can save money and we can save lives if recommendations are followed.  The problem is the recommendations are not followed.  They are often just recommendations.  We know in this committee what often happens to the recommendations we make.  I would love to hear from the witnesses about the other jurisdictions and about making recommendations more binding, if that is possible in any way.  That will obviously have impacts if we are looking at the inquisitorial approach and the lack of juries.  There is a wider justice piece there.  However, with regard to the piece about making recommendations stronger and more binding, how do other jurisdictions do that?</p> <p>  I have rambled a little, so I will summarise.  It is about the other jurisdictions in terms of how they manage the inquisitorial versus adversarial aspect and the piece about making the recommendations better.  I saw many people shaking their heads when I made my point about juries, so I think that has been answered.</p></speech>

In 2013, it introduced a new set of coroners rules that made it mandatory for a coroner, if information became available to that coroner during the course of an inquest, to come back with what is called a prevention of future death report.  Let us take the example of an accident on a railway where there is a lacuna relating to safety equipment, for example, a guard rail.  I came across a situation recently where the windows on some trains can still be lower down, and in that particular inquest the coroner made a recommendation to the authority in charge of the train that it must fix or remedy this problem.  The way it works is very interesting.  The coroner identifies the lacuna and the person who has the responsibility or the ability to fix it.  Crucially, the coroner does not tell the person how the coroner thinks the person should fix it.  The onus is on the person to whom the coroner is writing to come back within eight weeks with details of how the person proposes to fix it.  A report must not only go to the individual coroner but also go to the chief coroner.  Those prevention of future death reports are mandatory if a coroner identifies it in the context of an inquest.</p> <p>  At present, recommendations are returned by inquests and juries throughout this country that have moral authority and that certainly have saved lives, in my opinion and in my experience, but the difficulty, as has been identified by this committee, is there is no follow-up and there is no penalty if somebody does not respond to them.  There is no legal imperative or obligation on them to do that.  We add our voices to those calling for the recommendations to be put on a statutory footing.  The model is there - the prevention of future deaths reports in the UK.  Perhaps Ms O'Mahony has some thoughts on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.552" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Doireann O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022053100002#H00900"><p>This is something that has been covered quite extensively in the media over recent months.  Certainly, Ann Murphy of the <i>Irish Examiner </i>has covered a great deal about recommendations and families' disappointment with the lack of follow-through.  For example, a number of coroners around the country made recommendations that automated external defibrillators, AEDs, be at all Garda stations around the country because, obviously, everyone knows where the Garda stations are.  That has not happened.  The question was put to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the response was the Garda simply does not have the funding for it.  This is the situation.  The same sound recommendations are being made time and again by coroners but nobody is following up on them.  It would be very sensible if we were to follow what is being done in the UK and have force behind the recommendations and have a statutory duty on the coroner to send a report and a duty on the entity or organisation in turn to report back within a specified timeframe.  That would give a level of comfort to families as well.  My experience is the verdict returned at an inquest is just a piece of paper with a word on it and is meaningless for them.  What matters for them is knowing that decent recommendations can be made that can effect change and prevent future deaths.<br/><br/>I wish to comment on another thing before it is glossed over, which is the issue of the local authorities <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Department of Justice.  We are all in agreement on the point that coroners have to be independent.  However, how can a coroner be independent when he or she is answerable to the local authority?  I give the example of Cork city.  There are delays there at present and the coroner is at the mercy of the city council for funding, staffing and so forth.  I speak from experience.  Last year, I represented a widower whose wife and child died in a hospital in Cork.  Their inquests were pushed back on a number of occasions.  Eventually, they were listed on 30 August which, of course, suited everybody else and all the hospital staff, not to mention the fact this was the widower's son's first day at school.  It was adjourned on that occasion again and the coroner said, &quot;I cannot get a courtroom and I cannot get a place to hold the inquest.&quot;  This is a funding issue.  We fought and fought and eventually the coroner secured a facility in a hotel in Cork for three days, so there were three days to have the inquest heard.<br/><br/>The committee members heard at the outset that one of the longest-running inquests took place earlier this year, which ran over 14 days, yet in Cork there was an inquest into two deaths that was confined to three days.  It sat with a jury.  It started in the morning and ran on well past a time a judge would sit in court and late into the evening on each of the three days.  That was very hard for the jury, the lawyers, the coroner and all the witnesses, not least the family members.  I do not believe that is right.  We cannot just gloss over the fact that local authorities in certain parts of the country and in certain coroner districts have too much power.  It is a postcode lottery and one does not get the same treatment in Cork as one might get in Kildare or Dublin.  That is simply a fact and it has to be said.  Uncomfortable as it is for people to hear and for me to say it, it has to be said.</p></speech>

Ms O'Mahony has been in touch with her.  Ms Murphy has given good coverage to this issue in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  She filed a written submission to the committee that was very helpful to us.  She was not in a position to attend today's meeting but she made a significant contribution, which will form part of our deliberations when we produce our report, so I wanted to acknowledge her.</p><p>I will move on to our next Member, Senator Boylan, for the next interaction.</p></speech>

The discussion has been fascinating.  I am not a member of the Joint Committee on Justice so I am learning a lot sitting here.  I am here particularly to raise the issue of the Stardust inquest, which is coming up, we hope, in September.  Professor Cusack was involved in writing the report in 2000, which stated that the Coroner Service is a service for the living and should serve to reassure society as a whole.  That is where I am coming from in the context of the Stardust and the jury selection.  The initial inquest that took place was considered by Professor Scraton to be an abject failure.  There followed a judicial inquiry, which concluded with the finding of probable arson.  That stood on the public record for 28 years, so an entire community was tarred with the possibility that it was one of their own who caused the fire and the 48 deaths.  The idea of an inquest is not only to get answers for the relatives but also, as a society, to be able to learn and to try to prevent this from happening to any other family in the future.  The fact that we in the Stardust campaign were able to collect 48,000 signatures in a matter of weeks shows not only the public interest in this issue but also the public awareness that this is an unclosed event in Irish society and that the families deserve answers to what happened to their loved ones that night.</p> <p>  I was concerned to hear Professor Cusack speak of the right to a jury.  Seeing things from the perspective of these families, they had the first inquest, which involved a coroner.  All they were told was that their loved ones died of smoke inhalation and that was it.  There was nothing about the context as to how they inhaled the smoke.  Then there was the judicial inquiry, which was judge-led.  The families are now expected to go into a new inquest and, if they are not to have a jury, to have blind faith that things have changed and that they will get the answers they did not get 41 years ago.</p> <p>  While I have an interest in this because I brought forward a Bill on the matter, I do not care if it is done by my Bill, by the Minister's or by regulation.  The right to have one's peers hear what happened is a really important issue.  I am glad the ICCL has called for this to be resolved because we have an issue with reform of the coronial system, and all of that has to happen.  We also face a deadline of September.  The D&aacute;il is about to go into recess.  If we do not have legislation of some form to allow for independent jury selection, the inquest will not begin in September.  It just will not happen.  It also sends out a message internationally that we think it is appropriate that the Garda select the jury or that there be no jury in an inquest in which the Garda will have questions to answer as to how it preserved the site on the night of the fire.  On foot of that, I am here to lobby on behalf of the families of the Stardust and for their right to an independently selected jury.</p></speech>

I understand that Oireachtas Members will, of course, have an interest in particular inquiries.  That is natural and part of our role.  However, we will avoid a specific discussion because we do not want to prejudge any future hearing.  We will discuss the generality of the matter.  If that touches on specific matters, that is fine, but we will keep the discussion at the general policy level.  Does Professor Cusack wish to come back in?</p></speech>

I agree with Senator Boylan.  What I am saying is that we do not need a jury in every case.  The question is whether it should be mandatory in the list.  For contested or complex issues, I believe that there should be a jury and that we need to look at jury selection.  Last month, I held an inquest into maternal death.  I had a jury.  I complimented the jury on its deliberation, its wisdom and its thoughtfulness.  One particular juror, a lady, came up with extraordinarily perceptive questions.  There is a place for juries.  What I am asking is whether we need to look at the matter.  Is it not better to have it refined?<br/><br/>As for information, there are three websites.  Citizens Information is fantastic.  Every time we get in a family we send them out a booklet.  I do not wish to take issue with the 52 recommendations of the ICCL report.  I commend them, and this is not in any way to diminish the importance of those families, but some of those cases go back 20 years, to a different era, and fewer than 20 cases are examined.  During those 20 years there were 41,000 inquests, so we need to be very careful, without diminishing the importance to those families of the issues they faced, in drawing wide conclusions when we are talking about less than 0.1% of all inquests over 20 years.  I was saddened by some of the things I read in the report and I hope they belong to a different era.<br/><br/>As for the regulations, we were there before England and Wales.  As for the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations of England and Wales, to which Mr. Murray referred, there is regulation 28, and regulation 29 requires a report to be sent back.  I refer, however, to Senator McDowell's Bill when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Subsection 54(2) of that Bill states:</p> <blockquote> 	Where an inquest has addressed a recommendation to a Minister of the Government, a local authority or a statutory body, the Minister, local authority or body shall issue a response to the recommendation to the coroner concerned in writing no later than 6 months [I think that is a bit long] from the date of receipt of the recommendation and shall indicate the measures, if any, taken or proposed to be taken on foot of the recommendation. </blockquote> <p>We were there in 2007, so perhaps we could fine-tune that.  They have excellent templates in England and Wales.  I recognise Coroner MacLoughlin's inquest recommendations on maternal deaths.  They made a great difference.  I have sent the ten recommendations to the committee.  They show the wisdom of the jury.  Not only did we work with the jury but, in its absence, we also asked the legal representatives how they could help us frame recommendations, what they would like to see and what the family would like to see.  We had an expert witness, Dr. Peter Boylan.  I can mention him because this is in the public domain.  We asked him what he made of this.  Together we came up with ten recommendations.  It was the jury that decided in the end which recommendations to make, and I commend the jurors' wisdom.  We worked on the recommendations together.  They were sent to the people I have listed.  I always ask for an acknowledgement.  I ask them to let me know of any steps they have taken.  All I can do, however, is ask them that; I cannot require them to do so.  That needs to be strengthened.  We have that in models abroad and in the 2007 Bill.  Again, I think we are at one.  We have a commonality.</p></speech>

We feel pretty small by comparison because our bugbear, as Professor Cusack rightly pointed out, is to do with the registration of deaths.  Professor Cusack is right that perhaps ten or 12 years ago we had some communication.  There may have been a little confusion, however, because we are absolutely in agreement with what Professor Cusack said, namely, that the Coroner Service is not to be involved in genealogy, genealogical research or gathering of information.  In the two submissions I have made, the first, more extensive one to the committee and the short three-minute contribution, which I did not manage to finish within three minutes, we quite clearly say that what we would prefer to see with the registration of deaths is that the system be widened out.  At the moment, for any death that takes place where the coroner is not involved, the doctor issues a medical cause-of-death certificate.  It is a very simple device.  Whether it is in paper form or whether some sort of IT solution is found in more modern times, that document is then brought to the registrar and the death is registered.  Then the next of kin are able to provide the information required.  That is a really important thing for the next of kin because they want to feel involved.  Being able to provide some key information that only they can give, that is, the date and place of birth of the deceased and his or her parents' names, gives them a real input into the system.</p><p>We suggest that the coroner system be widened out and that, in future, the coroner issue some kind of medical form of death certificate, a document that would set out his or her findings, to the next of kin or the legal representative, which would then be brought to the registrar.  That would resolve this issue.  We have talked about the humanity of all of this.</p><p> One of the things that my colleague and I would say is that the lack of information in registrations is a concern.  When looking at deaths registered prior to 2004, under the old regulations which involved very brief information, we found that, once those deaths moved beyond living memory, it was no longer possible for anybody to say that a given Mary Murphy, born in Limerick, was the same person as a Mary O'Connor who died up in Dublin.  Since 2004, the maiden surname of a woman, the birth name of a woman, the date and place of birth and the parents' names, including the mothers' maiden name, are included.  We joke that it is like the old card game, snap.  You can put the records together.  That is really the nub of our proposal and submission to the committee.  I ask that the committee take those recommendations on board.</p></speech>

I come from Ballina and the first ever inquest there was that of Michael Tolan.  To a packed town hall and with a fully random jury and a number of medical experts, P.J. Ruttledge examined the death of Michael Tolan very thoroughly.  We have moved on, and the inquest in the Savita Halappanavar case and other high-profile inquests have also had full juries.  It is important that juries be considered very strongly in the case of big contested inquests.  Coroners across the country have different levels of experience.  I have done inquests all over the country and the difference between different counties is remarkable.  There have been other inquests in other jurisdictions in respect of Hillsborough and Ballymurphy.  As a society, we cannot shy away from allaying public suspicion and rumour and finding out what happened to people.  In the case of Stardust, the first inquest was terrible.  The families were presented with judicial findings that are still not satisfactory.  We now have an opportunity for Ireland to lead from the front on this.  I agree 100% with the Senator's Bill.  I also push strongly for random jury selection because justice needs to be done and, more importantly, to be seen to be done.  As a society, we really need to lead on this.  I 100% commend the Senator's work.</p></speech>

To add to what to Mr. O'Malley has said, I congratulate Senator Boylan on her campaign.  On the importance of inquests, we have spoken about their legal consequences and their consequences from a genealogical perspective.  They also have consequences from a societal point of view.  I will quote from the letter from the Attorney General regarding the reopening the Stardust inquiry.  In his decision under section 24, which is a very important and innovative feature of the 1962 Act, the Attorney General sits in a unique position to direct an inquest to take place.  Even if an inquest has already taken place or if the coroner is recalcitrant or reluctant, the Attorney General has the power to order that an inquest take place.  That is what happened in the case of the Stardust inquiry.  The letter from the coroner is worth quoting for the public record.  He said there is &quot;a distinct and separate imperative that the community as a whole should be satisfied, even if belatedly, that there be sufficient inquiry at any Inquest held to maximise the chances that the truth should emerge.&quot;  He said this would endeavour &quot;to serve the further public interest grounds, well established in law, of allaying rumours and suspicion, and of drawing attention to the existence of circumstances which, if unremedied, might lead to further deaths.&quot;<br/><br/>I am conscious that certain matters relating to Stardust are <i>sub judice</i>.  We will not dwell on those but will rather go back to what Senator Boylan and my colleagues from the ICCL have said and the impact of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.  Pursuant to our obligations under the 1998 Belfast Agreement, the State was obliged to transpose into Irish law its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, which led to the 2003 Act.  There is a lot of case law in England and Wales in this regard and, if there is an Article 2 inquest where there is an element of state responsibility for deaths and an obligation to conduct an effective investigation, the reality is that there is an adversarial contest.  I will quote from Dame Elish Angiolini's independent review of deaths in custody in the UK, who said:</p> <blockquote> 	The reality is that Inquests into deaths in police custody are almost always adversarial in nature.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />There is nothing inherently wrong with an adversarial approach as it may be the best way to robustly test evidence in court.  However, it needs to be recognised as such. </blockquote> <p>It was referenced in the McNaull-Scraton report that there is an inquisitorial process with an adversarial layer imposed upon it.  We add our voices to those saying that the use of juries should be maximised to the nth degree because juries are smart and are the experts in common sense.  Too often, I have been in courtrooms for inquests or civil cases where lawyers have been quoting law and arguing back and forth.  The people who pay attention to the facts and who seem to have the monopoly on common sense are the ladies and gentlemen of the jury.</p></speech>

In our report, we are talking about the families who have fought for 20 years and who have been consistent and committed advocates for reform and change and who have bravely continued their fight and spoken to us for this report.  We have not asked 41,000 people to tell us how they feel.  People have come to us.  It is fair to draw the conclusion that these people are representative of many more families who have not had a good experience in the coronial system.</p></speech>

I have a couple of points to make.  The issue of inquests and the verdict, which often is not one the family expects or is satisfied with, was mentioned.  One of the questions put to those coming in here was whether there was an alternative or better way to appeal such verdicts.  What mechanism should be put in place to allow for appeals where people are dissatisfied with the outcome?  What are the witnesses' views on the admissibility in later court actions of the findings of a coroner's report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-31a.571" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Doireann O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022053100002#K01300"><p>In and of itself, a verdict has no place in a forum where criminal or civil liability does not come into the fray.  Perhaps, "findings of the coroner" would be more appropriate terminology going forward.  The verdicts, in and of themselves, can be pretty meaningless to families.  Alternatively, families might have high expectations or hopes of getting a particular verdict and may feel disappointed if that verdict is not returned by the coroner or the jury.</p> <p>  I will make a point while I have a chance.  A moment ago, we were talking about how justice must be done and how it must be seen to be done in public.  From my real lived experience of meeting many different people who have been through this process, I know that what matters to them is that their loved ones are not forgotten in the middle of it all.  When things get heated and debates rage, the people at the centre of the matter can often feel forgotten.  I have personally been told by family members that they have felt like furniture at inquests.  Particularly in the case of hospital death inquests, there will sometimes be two or more sets of solicitors coming in for the hospitals and consultants.  There will be multiple people and boxes of papers.  The families feel their voices are not being heard.</p><p>I have been involved in inquests where members of the family have given statements or depositions to the coroner and then the hospital has tried to have those statements ruled out or redacted in large part.  In other words, it makes families feel as if they are being gagged and as if their voices do not matter.  That is something that is very important and that is why things could be made fairer if we were to have a set of coroners' rules and a review board or review panel.  Reference was made to the prohibitive nature of judicial review.  That is where somebody appeals a decision.  It is terribly expensive and it takes an awfully long time.  As I said, most people are frightened off by the idea of going to the High Court and they just do not have it in them.  They are exhausted, broken down, grieving and the last thing in the world they want is to have to go to the High Court.  If we had, as was recommended a quarter of a century ago, a review board or panel perhaps made up of a member of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, a coroner, a pathologist and a layperson, matters could be referred to that board or panel as they arise either in the lead up to or during an inquest and that would save time and costs and would mean people would not always have to resort to a judicial review.</p></speech>

I wish to clarify a matter for our report writing after this session.  In terms of the recommendations, we have spoken a good deal about the postcode lottery.  Would I be right in assuming that currently there is no central collection of figures and recommendations and it is quite possible every coroner is making the exact same recommendations about the exact same cause of death without anyone putting them all together and joining the jigsaw?</p></speech>

I would refer to the prevention of future death guidelines in the UK from the chief coroner in England and Wales.  He said the prevention of future death reports are vitally important if society is to learn from deaths.  He also said coroners have a statutory duty rather than simply a power, where appropriate, to report about deaths with a view to preventing future fatalities.  He further said a bereaved family will be able to say a person's death was tragic and terrible but at least it is less likely to happen to somebody else.  He said prevention of future death reports, PFDs, as they are called, are not intended as a punishment; they are done for the benefit of the public.  The guidance goes on to state in regard to PFDs that they should not be unduly general in their content, that sweeping generalisations should be avoided and that they should be clear, brief, focused, meaningful and, wherever possible, designed to have practical effect.  The model is there with respect to what prevention of future death reports should look like.  They save lives.  I know that because I have seen carefully crafted recommendations.  I would echo what Professor Cusack said.  I would commend juries on their ability, after hearing days of evidence, to distil it down into four or five net points.  In large measure, the recommendations are practically capable of being put into effect.  Deputy Costello is correct in pointing out that currently there is no follow-up in regard to it.  There is nobody saying the coroner in County Clare made this recommendation a month ago and, therefore, it is redundant for you to say it.  I think if there was that level of scrutiny, more lives would be saved.</p></speech>

We would support that.  However, we must be very careful.  The most central person is the deceased.  I remind everybody every now and then the most important person here is the person, sadly, who is not here, the deceased, then their family and then others.  In one case I dealt with a photograph of a deceased was held up by a family member, which I thought was very poignant, for the entire two days.  I agree with the PFDs.  The model is there.  We recommended a central database, and I am sorry I sound like a broken gramophone record, 20 years ago in order that these could be collected and seen.  However, we need to be careful.  Reference was made to the families.  In my experience Ireland has changed during the past 20 years.  Often we do not have a single voice for the family.  Sometimes there are two or three and there are very serious tensions among them.  It is sometimes difficult to say who is the family.  Each section of the family must be given equal hearing; each has the same rights.</p> <p>  I have made recommendations about roles for which the local authorities are responsible.  I must say in all my years in this role, Kildare County Council has never taken an adverse approach to me, my funding or my resources.  The coroner remains independent.  I would give credit to Kildare County Council.  We are independent judicial officers.  We must be brave, hear evidence, rely on the facts and bring in a verdict or findings based on that.  Sometimes that is not what the families wish to hear.  We are not there to bring in findings for any particular person unless they are based on evidence but we must listen very carefully to the family.</p> <p>  In terms of admissibility, I would refer to section 55 of the 2007 legislation which deals with non-admissibility in criminal proceedings of evidence given at inquest and section 56 which deals with admissibility of a report in civil proceedings.  We have done a good deal of this.  </p> <p>  With regard to delays, I want to make another point.  One of the questions asked by the committee was about closure.  As a doctor and a coroner, I have a difficulty with the word &ldquo;closure".  When we lose somebody dear to us, I do not think we ever really close that off.  There is always hurt, a gap, a loss.  There is always a pain at Christmas, anniversaries and birthdays.  The closure is about bringing them to the end at least of the procedure and they feel they do not have that hanging over them.  That is the closure.  I hope for some people we may bring an emotional closure.  I talk about serenity, peace or acceptance.  I am not sure we can ever close off on a loss of a loved one but what we can do is bring a closure to proceedings that are burdensome.  I will say this, as I will be saying it publicly next Tuesday at my coroner&rsquo;s sitting, with respect to adjournment of inquests for criminal proceedings in certain areas.  I will not mention any authority regarding accidents and fatalities at work, but I am dealing with a case has been going on for six years.  I cannot proceed with my inquest as only last year the case went from the Director of Public Prosecutions to criminal proceedings.  Only two days ago, with regard to another accident at work case, the partner and brother of the deceased told me they are desperate and hurt.  They asked why was it taking so long.  I had to tell them that I agreed with them and that I felt their hurt but I could not proceed because there are still applications before me.  That is now over three years.  We must examine certain aspects of that.  That was dealt with by the way and this is one of the matters on which we did not agree with the Department under section 57 of the legislation or section 25 of the current Bill.   Article 2 refers to a death inquiry being independent, effective, reasonably prompt, sufficiently open to public scrutiny and involving the next of kin.  We must do all of those and we can do that better together.</p></speech>

It is important for the committee to be aware that currently there is no statutory definition of what a verdict is.  There is no list of available verdicts.  They have arisen by custom and practice.  The rules come in and are there in draft form, and have been for the past two decades.  The model in England and Wales is available, whereby there is a menu in terms of the potential verdicts available and what the criteria and thresholds are.  It is correct, as Ms O&rsquo;Mahony said, that the threshold for a particular verdict in front of one coroner will vary considerably from district to district.  If we had uniformity of approach and objective criteria on whether one meets the threshold for medical accident or for medical misadventure or whether it is a narrative situation, it would provide enormous clarity to families and would certainly help the legal advisers.  It is important to counsel families before they go in to temper their expectations.  There is no outcome that will give them vindication.  The only outcome is one where there has been a complete and thorough investigation of all of the facts.  The recommendations and the learning that arise are of much more significance to them.</p></speech>

The justice plan for 2022 has the reforms as a priority.  Even though the report of the coroner's rules committee is not statutory, we have been following the recommendations.  We hold twice yearly educational meetings and often the legal coroners help with the education of medical coroners.  I assure the committee that we are aware of the weaknesses, deficiencies and defects in the system and we are trying to address them.  Like everybody else, as professionals we know we can always learn and do better.  We must never become arrogant or out of touch.  We could do with support for the reforms, as everybody has agreed.  We would do an even better job.</p> <p>  For my sins I am president of a European forensic body.  Covid has kept me in office because we have to meet in person in general assembly to change roles.  I have been stuck in office for the past two years when I should have vacated it.  I know what international death investigation systems are.  I know what they are like in the civil system in the non-common law world.  I have listed four papers with regard to international bodies.  Without being complacent and without in any way being smug I can say the Irish death investigation system is very good.  It has deficiencies and is in need of reform, which we must recognise.  We must also compliment our system, including the legal representatives who come before coroners, whom I always welcome.  They are very important when families need this form of assistance.  I would like to see a better civil legal aid system and criteria introduced.</p></speech>

This has been a very useful exercise.  I thank the witnesses and members for their time.  The discussion has highlighted the value of the deep dive the committee does when we take on a module and scrutinise it.  It has been highly informative for me and I am sure other members will agree.  We will produce a report.  We will consider at another meeting the deliberations today and the written submissions we have received.</p> <p>  Mr. Murray made a comment earlier that the dead open the eyes of the living.  I can see it working its way into report.  It is very pithy.  I am also reminded of Joyce and the last lines of his short story about the "snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead".  Sometimes, just like snow, change comes dropping slowly.  There is an opportunity for us in this exercise to effect change.  This is what this committee is about; we scrutinise the work of the Department and we also put forward our own recommendations.  It is not always the case at committee meetings but today there has been agreement on many of the points raised.  It is a very useful template.  I look forward to our deliberations and to the report, of which the witnesses will all be able to get copies.  I hope it will reflect all of the views expressed today and in written submissions.</p> <p>  I ask committee members to remain because we have some private housekeeping to deal with.  I thank all of the witnesses and the organisations they represent for their input.  This has been a very useful productive meeting.</p></speech>
