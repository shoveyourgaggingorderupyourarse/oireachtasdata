Before I introduce the witnesses today, at the request of the broadcasting and recording services, I ask members and visitors to turn their mobile phones off or to put them into flight mode as they interfere with the broadcasting system.  On behalf of the committee I extend a warm welcome to Ms Dee Forbes, director general of RT&Eacute;, and her colleagues, Mr. Jim Jennings, director of content on RT&Eacute;, and Mr. Jon Williams, managing director of RT&Eacute; news and current affairs.  From Met &Eacute;ireann, I welcome Mr. Eoin Moran, director, who is joined by his colleagues, Dr. Sarah O'Reilly, assistant director, Ms Evelyn Cusack, head of the forecasting division, Dr. Saji Varghese, Mr. S&eacute;amus Walsh and Mr. Eoin Sherlock.<br/><br/>Before we commence our meeting I want to carry out some formalities.  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I call Ms Forbes to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#L00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to come here today.  This is the first time that RT&Eacute; has been invited to attend this committee, and we welcome the opportunity to engage with national legislators and policymakers on this important issue.  As we understand it, the purpose of this committee session is to explore some of the ways in which RT&Eacute; can contribute to the broader discussions and awareness relating to climate change.  In that regard, this engagement is especially timely as it coincides with a range of editorial opportunities that we are exploring at this time.<br/><br/>As Ireland&rsquo;s leading national public service media entity, RT&Eacute; plays a unique role in Irish life and society.  With a 94% weekly reach across all adults in the country across our services, we continue to play a central role in the national conversations.  That is a position that we never take for granted.  As a dual-funded broadcaster, RT&Eacute; receives approximately 50% of its overall operating costs from the licence fee collected from the public.  For that, RT&Eacute; must deliver against a very wide-ranging remit which includes national and international news coverage, the provision of an Irish language media service, the provision of online services, orchestras and performing groups, a national media archive and the coverage of national sports.<br/><br/>RT&Eacute; plays a trusted and important role in informing Irish citizens and in shaping national debate.  Coverage of climate change and environmental issues has been regularly reflected in both news and current affairs coverage and across many other different types of programming.  A cursory review of coverage over the past six months on this issue demonstrates that RT&Eacute; is making genuine efforts to engage with this subject across a diverse range of output and from a wide range of perspectives.  Apart from dedicated reportage in long running programmes such as &quot;Eco Eye&quot; or consistent analysis and reports from our correspondent Mr. George Lee, the topic is well reflected in output which ranges from bespoke children&rsquo;s games and programmes on RT&Eacute;jr, current affairs debate on radio and on television, long form articles and opinion pieces on <i>www.rte.ie</i>, exploration of the moral and ethical considerations on programmes in worship and faith related programmes, and putting the topic in more localised context in output such as &quot;Big Week on The Farm&quot; and &quot;Science Week&quot; on RT&Eacute;.  Beyond that the more global impacts are reflected in programmes such as &quot;This Week&quot; and &quot;What in the World&quot;.<br/><br/>Efforts are being made to make the topic relevant, accessible, and in regular focus in relevant sectoral debates such as those on programmes such as &quot;Countrywide&quot; or &quot;Ear to the Ground&quot;.  The subject has also been well represented in various political debate programmes such as &quot;Drivetime&quot;, &quot;Today with Sean O&rsquo;Rourke&quot;, &quot;Late Debate&quot;, or &quot;Saturday with Cormac &Oacute; hEadhra&quot;.  It has also featured on prime time flagship entertainment programmes such as &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, with questions on this issue being raised with former President Mary Robinson and the Taoiseach, to give two recent examples.<br/><br/>The topic of climate change can be perceived as complex and somewhat removed from day-to-day life.  In terms of our own editorial contribution, however, we are trying our best to ensure that it is explored and discussed from many perspectives to meet the needs of different audiences.  That is not to say that there is room for complacency.  The coverage of climate change, and other sustainability topics is a matter of ongoing review in terms of our editorial activities, and we have renewed ambition in this regard for 2019.  By way of example, some of our plans include making it the theme of one of our Big Picture projects, which is a themed week of programming exploring a particular topic with depth and range across the unique range of multiplatform services that RT&Eacute; offers.</p><p>Giving a single topic such concentrated focus and amplification can deliver significant impacts in terms of public attention and action.  We are also looking at our lifestyle programming to explore ways in which we can make some of the mitigating actions seem more relevant and more accessible.  Given the growing levels of public interest and concern around this issue, the topic of climate change will be a thematic priority in our news and current affairs coverage.  We are also exploring partnerships and imaginative approaches in terms of messaging this to younger audiences through our RT&Eacute;jr services.</p><p> However, notwithstanding our own reach and remit, as well as the importance of national media in general, I would caution that if there is an ambition at a broader political level to create mass awareness on climate change and related corrective action, there is no substitute for bespoke public information campaigns, as well as a correlating level of leadership actions and policy implementation.</p><p> The State routinely and effectively develops public information campaigns focused on communicating clear and easily understood pathways to practical action by citizens around broad areas such as healthy living, road safety, nutrition and so on.  While such campaigns to be effective must be accompanied by substantive and coherent policies and incentives, they are essential in bringing about the broad understanding critical to changing behaviour.  On a broader point, if there is little by way of action on climate change in terms of legislative change, policy initiatives, parliamentary debate and business innovation, regrettably there is less for the media as a whole to report on.</p><p> Perhaps this is one of the other ways in which RT&Eacute; can demonstrate its value.  The work of RT&Eacute; is only possible with the support of Irish citizens.  It exists to serve the needs of those citizens.  Among those needs is the requirement for an independent media voice which will hold the powerful to account on what they are doing and what they are not.</p><p> Arising from their wide-ranging deliberations, the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly delivered a focused range of cogent recommendations for action.  There are clearly ways in which as a country, as a society and at an individual level we can make a contribution.  RT&Eacute; is keen to play its part within this framework and within this conversation.</p></speech>

I call on Mr. Eoin Moran, director of Met &Eacute;ireann, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#M00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to Met &Eacute;ireann to give evidence.  It was also a great honour for Met &Eacute;ireann to present at the Citizens' Assembly in 2017.</p> <p>  Met &Eacute;ireann is the Irish national meteorological service, as recognised by the UN Convention of the World Meteorological Organization, WMO, a specialised agency of the United Nations.  Established in 1936, Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s mission is to monitor, analyse and predict Ireland's weather and climate, as well as to provide a range of high-quality meteorological and related information to the public.  This is focused on supporting public safety and promoting wider societal and economic well-being through the delivery of timely, actionable and reliable science-based weather and climate information.</p> <p>  In December 2017, Met &Eacute;ireann put in place its ten-year strategy to help Irish society to be ready for and responsive to weather and climate risks with the vision of making Ireland weather and climate prepared.</p> <p>  Weather and climate science is intrinsically international in nature.  The global network of national meteorological services collaborates internationally to share information, along with building the expertise and knowledge needed to support and develop the global predictive capability available for weather and climate systems.  Met &Eacute;ireann represents Ireland and actively contributes to the WMO, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, EUMETSAT, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, ECMWF, which, among other things, is responsible for the implementation of the EU Copernicus Climate Change Service.</p><p>Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s public services are based on knowledge-leading, scientific expertise and capacity, developed in co-operation with a wide range of leading international scientific collaborative networks including the EC-Earth climate modelling research consortium, the HIRLAM numerical weather prediction consortium and EUMETNET, the European meteorological services network.</p><p> Met &Eacute;ireann places a major focus on our international collaborative partnerships as they allow it to successfully build strategic national capacity and capabilities, while providing Ireland with the best possible weather and climate services based on world-leading expertise.  Such co-operation and collaboration was at the foundation of how the international scientific community has detected and helped develop an understanding of the challenge of climate change, which brings me to the global context for climate change.</p><p> Climate change is a reality.  It is likely that the world is now warmer than at any time during the past 125,000 years.  The past four years were the warmest on record globally with the most pronounced warming in the Arctic.  Latest indications show the average temperature of the past five years was 1.1&deg; Celsius above the pre-industrial era.  Last year was more than 0.4&deg; Celsius warmer than the average temperature from 1981 to 2010.  This warming is directly linked to increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gases, which are also higher in concentration now than any time in the past 800,000 years.  Further warming is inevitable due to the continuing rapid and record rise in human produced greenhouse gases.</p><p> This global warming is now impacting global weather patterns.  This includes changes in circulation patterns leading to, for example, changes in the Asian monsoon, changes to the behaviour of the jet stream, more heatwaves and droughts worldwide, increased flood events, as well as slower moving and more moisture-bearing hurricanes or typhoons.  The frequency, severity and probability of extreme weather have also increased globally.  Recent extreme events in Ireland, such as the flooding of 2015-16, including Storm Desmond, Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma, as well as the recent summer drought of 2018, are all consistent with, and part of, the trend of more frequent high-impact weather events.</p><p> How does global warming affect weather patterns in Ireland?  Ireland currently benefits from a temperate oceanic climate with abundant rainfall in a predominantly westerly atmospheric circulation, moderated by the North Atlantic Drift with little in the way of temperature extremes.  It is worth noting we have always had extreme weather in the past such as downpours, flooding, droughts, cold spells and windstorms.  However, with increased global warming, Ireland is likely to experience a less dependable, less stable climate with more frequent and intense extreme weather events.  In general, modelled projections show the Irish climate is trending towards a reduction in overall rainfall, particularly in spring and summer, along with more heavy rainfall events in autumn and winter.  Heatwaves and droughts are becoming more probable and all seasons will be warmer with more hot days and fewer frosts.  The overall number of storms affecting Ireland is likely to decrease.  The number of extreme damaging storms, however, could increase.  This, coupled with expected sea level rise, is likely to lead to an increased risk of coastal erosion and storm surges.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s response to climate change is informed by national predictive capability.  Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s key role in meeting the challenge of climate change has been the development of national climate modelling capability.  Table No. 1 in the annexe to my submission shows the development of this predictive capacity over the past 15 years.  This strategic national resource has supported the formulation of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in Ireland over that period.</p><p>As members will see in the table, our climate modelling effort began in 2003 with C4i, a joint project between Met &Eacute;ireann and UCD funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and Science Foundation Ireland, SFI.  In 2008 Met &Eacute;ireann joined the international EC-EARTH climate modelling consortium working with leading experts from 12 European countries to develop and run state-of-the-art climate projections which were then accepted and used in the IPCC fifth assessment report.  Between 2009 and 2015 Met &Eacute;ireann, with the Irish Centre for High-End Computing, ICHEC, developed the most recent model projection for Ireland&rsquo;s projected climate change.  Currently, Met &Eacute;ireann is engaged in the next phase of EC-EARTH global model projections and regional climate model projections for Ireland, the outputs of which will be available for use by the wider climate change research community.  Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s analysis of the EC-EARTH global model output will be available during 2020, the findings of which are expected to be used by the IPCC in its sixth assessment report.<br/><br/>How do we unlock all of this scientific information and use it to promote climate action?  As part of &quot;Making Ireland Weather and Climate Prepared&quot;,<i></i>Met &Eacute;ireann is expanding its range of operational, high quality, user oriented climate information and prediction services.  This is to support understanding and decision making in managing climate dependent risks for Ireland.  This enhanced service will build on Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s existing climate services.  They include: the management of Ireland's national climate archive of quality controlled reference climate observations; the dissemination of climate products based on historical and current climate data; publication of synthesis reports on climate projections for Ireland; the development and dissemination of the award winning M&Eacute;RA<i></i>re-analysis of the Irish climate and also other sector specific climate products, for example, for the agriculture sector.<br/><br/>The enhanced climate information and prediction services will involve providing climate information for citizens, decision makers and policy makers via an interactive, integrated national climate information hub equipped with interpretative tools to contextualise expected states of Ireland&rsquo;s future climate and to enable understanding of climate risks at local level.  The information provided will be user driven and support decision making for specific sectors such as agriculture, health, transport and energy to help further develop the understanding of climate dependent risks.  Met &Eacute;ireann is also building capacity in event attribution and actively involved in the development of a state-of-the-art, pilot event attribution service as part the EUPHEME<i></i>European research project.  To support adaptation, Met &Eacute;ireann is also developing flood forecasting capability in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, OPW.  Leveraging the latest developments in meteorological science, Met &Eacute;ireann is developing local scale services extending from monthly forecasts and seasonal projections through to climate projections and analysis, based on state-of-the art ECMWF, Copernicus and EC-EARTH<i></i>projections.<br/><br/>Turning to communication of climate information to the citizen, Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s primary motivation when communicating with the people is to help to protect life and property and to promote economic and social well-being on the basis of the best available, evidence based information.  Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s existing communication channels include its work with RT&Eacute; and other TV and radio broadcasters; its new website and app and extensive social media reach; its public outreach via its citizen-science climate observer network; seminars; workshops; conferences and through its partnership with the Irish Meteorological Society; its work with print media; its educational resources; its participation in the BT Young Scientist &amp;amp; Technology Exhibition; the National Ploughing Championships; science week; mathematics week and so forth.</p><p> Met &Eacute;ireann is now building on its extensive experience of communication and engagement with the public to raise awareness and understanding of how the Irish climate is changing.  This work will include expanding our network of citizen scientists through the weather observations website, WOW, an interactive digital platform that will be launched during 2019.  WOW will allow for more community involvement in directly contributing to our understanding of our changing climate and weather patterns.  Met &Eacute;ireann is also planning to expand its capacity for media engagement and to increase its contributions to scientific programming on the topic of weather and climate, primarily with the public broadcaster RT&Eacute; but also through wider engagement with commercial broadcasters.  This involves developing climate specific educational segments for TV, the web and social media.  In particular, these segments will be used when educational opportunities arise such as in the aftermath of an extreme weather event or when weather or climate related news items occur.</p><p> While recognising the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment's responsibility for climate action and its overall national co-ordination role in the communication of climate change information, these communication initiatives by Met &Eacute;ireann are intended to support the wider national climate action agenda through enhanced public awareness and understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change, founded on evidence based scientific information.  This information will support Ireland&rsquo;s national adaptation and mitigation plans by aiding citizens in making informed choices regarding the realities of climate change impacts.</p><p> I again thank the committee for giving me this opportunity to provide evidence.  I am happy to provide further clarification, as required.</p></speech>

We are a little tied for time as we have another session at 4 p.m.  The lead speakers have ten minutes each.  To get the benefit of that time they should keep their contributions to questions.  They will get more answers when staying within that timeframe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1237" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#P00300"><p>I thank the delegates for attending to discuss what is an important part of the work we have been doing.  We spend much time with experts discussing the challenges of the issue, but - it is clear from its presentation that Met &Eacute;ireann is aware of this - the other key part is how to try to bring people with us because we know that we must bring about significant behavioural change.  We must do that and take personal responsibility for doing it, but how do we try to bring people with us?  Our experience in the past has been that when we get these things wrong, not only is there political fallout as a result but the environment also loses.  That is something we have to avoid.  In some ways, it is a job of work to bring people with us on that journey of behavioural change.  Some citizens are ahead of us, particularly the younger generation which probably has much to teach us.  I was struck by this at the BT Young Scientist &amp;amp; Technology Exhibition and it was very refreshing to see it.</p> <p>  I wish to raise some points with the representatives of RT&Eacute; and Met &Eacute;ireann about the programmes they run on news and general current affairs and the opportunities they have each day, given that their reach is phenomenal, to present abnormal weather events and plant the seed in people's heads that this is not normal.  My first question is for Ms Forbes.  </p> <p>  The BBC recently updated its editorial policy for journalists on how to report climate change.  As part of it, the BBC has indicated that since the science is now clearer and climate change is accepted as happening, climate change deniers are not required on panels for balance, as they would have been.  It has also invited editorial staff to sign up for a training course on reporting climate change.  Does RT&Eacute; have a policy on the inclusion or non-inclusion of climate change deniers in shows that are discussing this issue at length?  Has RT&Eacute; changed the way it reports on climate change as the science has become more clear?  Has its staff received any training in reporting on climate change?</p> <p>  With regard to the need for balance, how does RT&Eacute; try to ensure it balances its coverage between reporting on the need for Government policies to address both climate and behavioural change and the potential negative responses from certain groups that might oppose it?  While I was driving my car last week, I heard a report on a news bulletin about a protest in Dublin.</p><p>It went into detail about the protest and at the end of the report there was mention of there being about a dozen or more people involved.  The mental picture in my head was thousands of people out on the street protesting, until I heard the last bit of the report.  The balance needs to be right with regard to the element of proportionality and in reporting on legitimate protests or in nearly inciting people to go out and making them feel bad if they are not out protesting.  I would like to hear the RT&Eacute; witnesses' views on that.</p><p> Is RT&Eacute; seeing an increased demand from viewers and listeners for material that addresses climate change in programmes such as "Eco Eye" or special "Prime Time" segments?  If so, is RT&Eacute; ramping up its coverage or does it plan to increase its coverage on that?</p><p>I have some brief questions for Met &Eacute;ireann.  As the national weather service what does it see as its role and responsibility around communicating the reality of climate change to Irish people?  I acknowledge again, along with RT&Eacute;, the progress Met &Eacute;ireann has made in recent months on its website and improvements in different areas.  From the presentation I take it there is a very high level of elements and policies but I still believe that primarily, first and foremost Met &Eacute;ireann's strongest reach is after the "Six One News" and at the "Nine O'Clock News" onwards with the weather bulletins - and I acknowledge the presence of Ms Evelyn Cusack here today.  I am a farmer and always turn on the television for that bulletin, especially on a Sunday.  I am very struck that some of my constituents have commented positively to me that it is lovely to see the daffodils out in January before the snowdrops, and that the cherry blossoms are starting to blossom.  Personally that frightens the life out of me.  I am really worried that it has been such a mild January if this is to be part of a bigger picture.  Plenty of people have said to me that it is lovely to get a bit of snow again in the winter and to have a really warm summer.  I can understand all of that but I believe there is a fear inherent in this if we think this is all just fine and if we do not see it as part of the four warmest years in 125,000 years.  It is frightening.  We should be a little bit scared if we want to bring people on the journey of very significant behavioural change that we need to bring them on.  They need to understand that this is not normal, as the science is telling us.  Does Met &Eacute;ireann have a policy of infiltrating that? When Met &Eacute;ireann is reporting on a very mild January is there a way it could subtly reference that by saying it is not normal, that it does not happen very often and that it is a worrying trend?  They are my main points.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#Q00300"><p>I will address the last question first.  The Deputy asked if we are seeing an increase in demand from viewers and listeners.  It is fair to say that when a topic becomes more interesting and is more discussed, we see an increased need and appetite for more in that area.  This particular area right now is in that place.  We aired a programme on Monday night, for example, which was "One Day: How Ireland Cleans Up".  It looked at how we are tackling waste in the State.  That programme on Monday evening had more than one third of the country watching it.  This tells us very quickly and easily that there is demand.  A number of years ago that same programme would not have had that sense of engagement.  Likewise across our radio shows, if one looks at the breadth of radio on a given week across RT&Eacute;, one will see peppered across the schedule a lot of engagement from listeners on this topic.  It is very fair to say that we are getting much more engagement, and as a result we will then aim to cover more and more.  Following that Monday show, Claire Byrne had a segment on how we could reduce our waste.  There is no doubt that it is a topic of our time and therefore we are addressing the topic in our news and current affairs programming and in other programming.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Jon Williams, in current affairs to address how we are treating the topic in news and current affairs.  Mr. Jim Jennings, our director of content, will then outline how we cover the topic in our other content.  It is the breadth of content across RT&Eacute; that will reflect all of that.</p></speech>

The context matters.  The BBC produced its editorial guidance after it was found to be in breach of the UK communications' regulator Ofcom guidelines in reporting climate change.  As part of the mitigation the BBC has issued guidance to its staff on how to report climate change.  "The Today Programme" failed in its obligation to be fair and impartial by, essentially, equating and providing equivalence between the science and climate change sceptics.</p><p>RT&Eacute; has not been found to be in breach of Broadcasting Authority of Ireland guidelines.  We are very clear that we have guidance.  Section 39 (1) of the Broadcasting Act requires RT&Eacute; to be fair and impartial across a whole range of subject areas.  The reporting of climate change is no different from the reporting of homelessness, Brexit, health or criminal justice.  We are not obliged to provide balance and we do not balance different perspectives, but we are obliged to be fair and impartial.  We strive to do that across all of the different subject areas we cover.</p><p> The director general has referenced the increasing engagement by audiences.  We can always do more but during the recent climate change summit in Poland RT&Eacute; did pieces pretty much every second day on climate change.  We are responding to the increased interest we recognise from the audience.  We are a responsive organisation and we live or die by the engagement we have with our audiences.  We would be mad to not respond to the demands the audiences make through their engagement and their interest.</p></speech>

We have seen an increase in our output over the last years.  It is increasing as we go.  "Drivetime" features pieces on climate change every two to three days.  We also do other programming such as "Ireland's Deep Atlantic" in early 2018 and "Eco Eye", along with documentaries and science week - and as the director general has said we plan to do climate change as our big picture later this year.  We are commissioning more documentaries as we speak.  We have another two and possibly three landmark documentaries coming up within the next 12 months looking at this area.  This is not just based on public demand for more information, it is also coming from our staff who are very engaged on this.  They know that we do not have to go around programme teams asking them to do climate change; they are doing it of their own volition.  We do not have to tell them to do it.  As the Deputy said, we all have young kids and family members, and the younger generation is really engaged on this and is nearly driving the older generation on the issue.  This will be reflected more and more in our programming as we go forward.</p></speech>

There was a lot in those questions so I will pass over to Ms Evelyn Cusack and Mr. S&eacute;amus Walsh for a few of the issues.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if there were subtle ways in which we can communicate climate information to the public.  Part of the job of science is to explain and not just to provide facts, figures and do all the research.  It is very important to be able to provide an explanation to the public.  With regard to whether Met &Eacute;ireann has a strategy in strengthening, improving and expanding our climate information proposition to the public we have our ten year strategy.  This speaks a lot about ensuring that users, citizens, decision makers, policy makers and politicians are informed so as to be able to make the correct decisions and to achieve the best outcomes for society.  This gets to the core of our approach to any services we provide, be they in weather or climate.  We focus on providing the most relevant and salient information to allow the best decisions to be made for society.  This is supporting impact-based decision making.  We must understand the impacts people have to deal with around weather or climate, and then we must provide the most relevant and easily accessible information possible.  That is at the core of the philosophy behind the strategy.</p> <p>  On communicating climate information, standing back and looking at where we have come from, our role is to provide the scientific bedrock for the scientific projections we have and to understand the future climate for Ireland over the coming few decades.</p><p>That is in place.  What we are now doing is building on what we have called our climate services.  I have outlined this in my statement.  This is to allow people to have access to specialist information so that they can serve themselves and make their own decisions - ordinary citizens, policy makers and specialist users.  On top of that layer, we are focusing on improving our communications - enhancing our existing communications so that we can enhance understanding.  </p><p> In the context of improving citizens' or the Irish public's understanding in a subtle way and answering those questions about burnt grass during the drought in summer or phenological responses taking place as we speak relating to warm conditions, this is an event attribution exercise.  For many years, Met &Eacute;ireann has looked at developing and enhancing our capacity in event attribution.  As I mentioned in my statement, we are involved in a state-of-the-art European research attribution service that will deliver on a semi-operational basis attribution information relating to weather events on a regular basis, be it seasonal or monthly.  There may be an opportunity to provide a more rapid attribution service to the public, which would answer the type of questions raised by the Deputy.  We have seen very useful examples of this during the drought in 2018.  The science is now ready to provide that type of information.  It is like a newly-developed drug for a particular disease.  It is in research and we are moving towards transposing this highly-useful and very exciting and promising piece of information into an operational service, which is a different task entirely.</p></speech>

When I started in 1988, our weather forecasting was just about one day ahead - where we had confidence in our accuracy.  I am very glad to say that since then, we have developed to the point where we are up to five to seven days ahead.  As the Deputy mentioned, the farming forecast on RT&Eacute; is of great importance.  We concentrate on the weather forecast, warnings and advisories for the safety of the public during that slot.  Very occasionally, we mention climate change.  We have plans to bring it in in a more organised way - perhaps at the end of each season - and to bring in more WMR and IPCC reports.  That slot is primarily for weather forecasts and warnings.</p></speech>

He mentioned the latest research.  The next challenge is to make that information available on an operational basis.  One thing we can say and have been saying relatively recently in respect of severe weather events is that they are part of the general trend in global warming.  For example, during the heatwave, we were able to say it was part of the trend in global warming.  A rapid attribution study was carried out that said that the heatwave over Ireland last summer was twice as likely to have occurred because of human-induced climate change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#S00700"><p>I will be brief because my predecessor covered a lot.  The challenge facing us as an Oireachtas is to try to engage with the public to make the reality of climate change an acceptable phenomenon for it, to try to put in place a series of measures to change the behaviour of the public that the public will find acceptable and to do so in a way that the public does not feel it is being foisted on it for any reason other than improving the lives of members of the public and the lives of their children.</p><p>Notwithstanding the widespread acceptance of climate change, because the basis of it is scientific and, consequently, academic, much of the debate has taken place in that forum.  We have all busied ourselves to some extent looking at targets, percentage movements, a percent here or there and a degree here or there.  We know the buzzwords and acronyms and those of us on all sides who must engage with it are comfortable to some extent.  However, the eyes of the public glaze over when faced with that kind of communication.  It is all about communication.  Let us forget about trying to fight the battle on whether climate change is a reality.  That fight is over because climate change is a given.  Of course, Met &Eacute;ireann will involve itself very specifically in the science so that it provides the evidence base for the future.  As Ms Cusack identified, most people tune into the weather forecast to find out what tomorrow will be like.  They are now doing so on apps.  </p><p> The difficulty we will face is communicating what needs to happen next, the actions that must be taken and the policy decisions that must be made.  We need to move away from the academic debate and the scientific basis for it and speak the common language.  Mr. Moran spoke about the burning of grass because of the sun.  People understand that.  Farmers understand that.  Everybody understands that.  </p><p> RT&Eacute; does a very good job with the news.  George Lee's appointment was an excellent decision and I think he has done exceptionally well in marrying the two sometimes conflicting roles of environment and agriculture.  When I saw it initially, I wondered how it would work out but it has worked really well from my perspective because I see his capacity to explain in very clear language and to tell the story in a non-scientific way.  He has the language.  Perhaps he benefitted to some extent from being a Member of the Oireachtas for a period in terms of enabling him to communicate with the public at large.  That is good.  </p><p> It is about how we move this issue from news and current affairs and into everyday life.  Even the fact that RT&Eacute; has brought in people from both sides of its house is welcome.  The ratings show that "Room to Improve", which is presented by Dermot Bannon, is a hugely successful programme.  He tells really good stories.  One of the major issues has been the loss of heat and how we are heating homes unnecessarily.  If this was overlaid with the climate change agenda, carbon footprint, the loss of heat and ensuring that room is made for electric vehicles, looking to the future would be very much part of that and telling that story.  There is work and potential there.  </p><p> There is also potential in RT&Eacute;'s soaps.  I am not a regular viewer but sometimes I am subjected to one such programme at home if I am there at a particular time.  I have watched over the years how "Fair City" deals with important social issues such as violence against women and migration.  The scriptwriters handle these issues very successfully and blend them in without setting them apart so they are inculcated into everyday life.  There are opportunities there.  If we are to be successful, we must make this issue mainstream and get away from it being just climate change.  It has to be part of life, which is the challenge for us.  RT&Eacute; can play an important role in that regard.  </p><p> My only question concerns what the witnesses are looking for from us.  Is Met &Eacute;ireann funded adequately to gear up in the manner in which it is gearing up?  Does it require additional funding?  Does that need to be factored into our budgetary provisions?  I address the same question to RT&Eacute;.  We previously discussed the funding of public service broadcasting in the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  RT&Eacute; gets additional funding from the sound and vision fund.</p><p>Should we look into ring-fencing some of the fund for items other than current affairs public service content?  Should we consider requiring some or all of it to be used in reporting on climate change issues?  The answer is probably that RT&Eacute; will not refuse any money it is offered.  Have the delegates given consideration to proposals that ring-fenced funds play a greater role in supporting such communication?</p><p> Ms Forbes mentioned public information broadcasting.  I welcome ideas she has to provide good quality public information.  People tend to find ways to scroll or move beyond public information notices in adopting a somewhat similar approach to that taken to advertising on the RT&Eacute; player; therefore, such information would have to be presented in a very clever manner that would engage citizens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.36" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#U00200"><p>Deputy Dooley has made a very strong and clear point about telling the story.  We always endeavour to tell the story to the best of our ability across multiple genres.  There is no doubt that climate change is a complex issue to understand and that we have work to do in that respect.  We are constantly investigating and evaluating programme ideas in this space and always welcome ideas for new programming.  It has been widely recognised that the "Operation Transformation" programme has been of great benefit to health.  Ten or 15 years ago that might have seemed impossible.  We are looking at and encouraging ideas from a broad spectrum of programme makers.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, we are looking at lifestyle programming to see if we can come up with a programme as effective as "Operation Transformation".  It is early days, but we are investigating the matter.  My colleague, Mr. Jennings, may wish to elaborate in that regard.</p> <p>  We must be very careful that this issue is not brought into programming in a manner that could be interpreted as preachy or finger wagging.  We are very conscious of this, which is why children are having a significant impact in this space, particularly in children's programming.  As a previous speaker mentioned, we are learning a lot from children in this space.  We are working on ideas for how we can use children's programming to help everybody in this space.  It is fair to say we are investigating across a wide range of genres.  This is not just about news and current affairs, which are very important.  The topic will be brought into more and more genres of programming.</p> <p>  On Deputy Dooley's point about information and public service, it is not the role of RT&Eacute; to come up with such ideas, but we are very happy to engage and be part of that discussion because a public service campaign becomes truly impactful when citizens know what they can do to make a change.  As I mentioned, in areas such as road safety and health people knew what they were required to do and there was the public service area of communication to back it up.</p></speech>

We will work very closely with it on the content, other than weather bulletins, which it proposes to create in this area in order to identify where it will sit, whether it will be available online, whether it will have a linear attribution and how to ensure the public will be able to find it.  We will be working very closely with it in that regard.</p> <p>  The best drama reflects real life.  As this issue is real life, one would expect to see it reflected in drama and I think we will.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#V00100"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  As I will have to leave to speak in the D&aacute;il to the motion on nurses, I will not take too long.  </p><p>RT&Eacute; in its submission states the topic of climate change will be a thematic priority in its news and current affairs coverage.  I ask the delegates to flesh out that point, although I do not expect them to present a thesis on the matter.  There has been much discussion of children and young people and their awareness of this issue, which is greater than that of my generation or the generation after mine, and how they will play a leading role.  Studies have shown the extent to which children influence adults, including a study of how the decision to buy a particular type of car is 60% attributable to what one's children say about cars.  That is a very well-known fact.  Therefore, the more we do to encourage children, the more it will impact on their parents, other relations and the older generation.</p><p>A protest by children against climate change will take place next Saturday outside Leinster House at 4 p.m.  In spite of Deputy Heydon's comments on a protest being attended by 12 people and the RT&Eacute; news report making it sound like it was an enormous protest, it would be a wonderful event for RT&Eacute; to cover.  Although I have not seen any coverage of it in the Irish media, there has been a strike by schoolchildren in Australia against coal mining and the coal being transported out of Australia through the Great Barrier Reef which has been seriously damaged.  A young woman in Sweden has made amazing speeches on climate change.  Such events should receive news coverage because they would have an impact on children and their parents.</p><p>I understand what Ms Forbes stated about the role of RT&Eacute;, but in its written submission it points out that there is no substitute for bespoke public information campaigning.  Although I agree to some extent, I disagree that it is just about changing public behaviour and individual behaviour, which is often the focus of this committee.  There must be a far greater focus on changing corporate behaviour and the activities of oil companies and the coal and gas industries.  I am not aware of any serious journalistic attempt by RT&Eacute; to explore the issue of corporate behaviour in the context of climate change.  That is a task it should take on.</p><p>In its submission RT&Eacute; states broadcasting depends on the actions of the Oireachtas in making legislative change.  The Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 in my name is quite controversial and ended up in limbo following a vote of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment before Christmas.  It is of great interest because it challenges the oil and fossil fuels industry and proposes that fossil fuels be kept in the ground and that there be no further extraction or issuing of licences to extract fossil fuels in coastal regions.  However, it has been given very little coverage by RT&Eacute;.  When I have discussed it on news programmes such as the one presented by Cormac &Oacute; hEadhra, I have been given very little time to explain it.  I do not accept that it is all about academics and science.  If children understand it, we can too, but we need to name it.  If we do not do so, we are doing a disservice.</p><p>That brings me on to my questions for Met &Eacute;ireann.  I note that Mr. Moran is a permanent representative to the World Meteorological Organization.  He knows that its recent report really nails the issue by identifying climate change as the problem in terms of extreme weather.  Met &Eacute;ireann could do far more in that regard.  I was very pleased that it addressed human-induced climate change in a weather report in early January, but in its submission today it discusses weather and climate science.  Is it reluctant to call it climate change science?  I am sure Mr. Moran accepts the science because he is part of the scientific community.  There should not be a reluctance to acknowledge it.  A news report on the <i>journal.ie </i>website before Christmas stated Met &Eacute;ireann staff had been told not to link specific extreme weather events with climate change.  Met &Eacute;ireann has explained that one event does not necessarily result from climate change, that it must be a series of events in order to be so identified.  However, at this stage we should state clearly that a series of extreme weather events is taking place because of climate change.  That should be done because we are trying to educate the public.  At the heart of what Met &Eacute;ireann, RT&Eacute; and the Oireachtas are trying to do are the raising of public awareness and pointing out to the system that this is not acceptable.</p></speech>

I mean this quite sincerely; Met &Eacute;ireann is part of the international scientific community that since the 1900s has been monitoring and taking the pulse of the planet on a minute-by-minute, hourly and daily basis.  It has contributed to the detection of climate change and on an ongoing basis it provides the definitive reference analysis of the state of the climate.  It has initiated the national programme to provide climate projections for the country.  It was the first scientific organisation to do that for the country.  I will be brief on this.  National meteorological services provide that strategic outlook on a scientific basis.  They provide long-range plans to meet the requirements of the country from a scientific point of view.  On that basis, Met &Eacute;ireann has had the view that climate change is a great challenge for the last several decades.  It is a huge challenge for this country, and Met &Eacute;ireann has responded strategically to meet that challenge and to service the Irish public and Irish citizens in that manner.  </p><p> In regard to some the articles that have been referred to and some of the questions that have been asked, of course it is true that for the last several years the public has been quite rightly seeking explanations for the increased frequency of extreme weather events we are all experiencing.  I can tell the committee that these extreme weather events are putting us to the pin of our collar.  In terms of communications, we are at the front line when it comes to climate change.  The introduction of weather warnings and our storm naming mechanism were initiatives taken by Met &Eacute;ireann.  We are at the vanguard in communicating the impacts of extreme weather and the changes therein caused by climate change.  There is no ambiguity.  We have always had the position that the climate is changing.  In regard to the communication that we provide for our forecasters, of course we have to give guidance on how to speak to journalists.  This is because within the language of climate change there can often be some confusion.  </p><p> I wish to clarify that our role is to provide climate information to the public.  Again, this is to support users, decision-makers, policymakers and politicians to help them to make their decisions.  I note that this is also to support the wider climate action agenda as co-ordinated and managed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p></speech>

The weather forecast is my favourite programme, both on the radio and on the telly.  I absolutely love it.  Met &Eacute;ireann does a great job.  I am talking about language, and I do not mean it to sound like a semantic argument.  Instead of talking about climate, can we talk more about climate change and human-induced activity resulting in weather extremes?  Only once have I heard about human-induced activity being responsible for weather events on the weather forecast.  We could up our game on that as a way of shaping the argument in the country.  Loads of people love the weather forecast, watch it all the time and learn loads from it.  I do not mean to be objectionable to Mr. Moran's role, absolutely not.</p></speech>

Let me deal with the thematic issue.  The challenge for us, truthfully, is how we make the whole bigger than the sum of the parts.  We have evidenced quite a lot of what we are doing.  The challenge for us is to bring it all together.  The director general talked about how we aim to do one of our "The Big Picture" weeks on this issue later this year.  We began last year by addressing the issue of homelessness.  Last spring we looked at mental health; just before Christmas we looked at the place of women in Ireland in 2018.  The success of "The Big Picture" has been to reach out beyond the core news and current affairs programmes.  For example, it has engaged 2FM on mental health.  It engages with RT&Eacute; drama and the orchestras.  What we mean by the thematic issue is how we actually harness the resources of RT&Eacute; together to make the whole bigger than the sum of the parts.</p><p> There has been reference to children.  We are incredibly proud of "News2Day", our children's news programme.  That programme has also done a lot in the realm of climate change.  I would be happy to take on board the protest on Saturday which has been mentioned.  I will talk to my colleagues in the newsroom about it for this weekend.</p></speech>

The World Meteorological Organization, WMO, guidance regarding attribution of weather events says that if we are asked a question like whether climate change caused a particular event, there is no simple &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answer.  The WMO says that is a poorly phrased question.  If we try to tell a journalist that he or she has essentially asked the wrong question, we get nowhere, so we do not say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;.  We place an event in the context of a warming planet and an increase in extremes.  That is how we do it.  If one is interviewed by a journalist and one cannot say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;, and the journalist chooses to write a headline saying that Met &Eacute;ireann says &quot;No&quot;, that is the headline.  We do not write the headlines.</p></speech>

The advice is that one cannot say "Yes" or "No", but one can place it in the context of a warming planet.  One can say things like these type of events are what we are likely to see and they are part of the warming trend.  One cannot specifically say in real time that a certain event was or was not due to climate change.  One can talk about the probability of it occurring.  It is like a loaded die.  The probability of these events occurring has increased, but in real time one cannot say for sure that one was or was not caused by climate change.  The journalist could just as easily have said that Met &Eacute;ireann has been told to link events to climate change as that it has been told not to.  We are told to do neither, but to place events in the context of a warming planet and the increased likelihood of these events.</p></speech>

When we come to the conclusion of this committee, the big debate is going to be around carbon tax.  I will probably be in a minority opposing it, but that does not mean that the people are not opposed to it.  That should be reflected.  We had the same problem in Parliament with water charges.  There was hardly anyone in the Parliament against it, but the people were against it.  We saw the same in France with carbon tax.  I note that RT&Eacute;'s guidelines state that it must cover minority views.  That is a very important one.</p></speech>

There has been reference to legislative action and what happens here.  I held this brief in the previous D&aacute;il as Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on the environment.  I was part of the group that produced the committee report for the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 in 2013 and 2014.  I acknowledge that this subject was not as big at that time.  However, other committee members and I were trying to get it covered.  It needed more attention.  Deputy Smith mentioned one Bill.  I have introduced numerous Bills here that never saw the light of day on any channel, including RT&Eacute;.  I refer to the Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill 2017, which is mainstream stuff in Germany and right across Europe.  I introduced the Waste Reduction (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017.  I brought forward a policy for power in Ireland up to 2030 so that we can deal with the effects and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  That is where the debate needs to move to.  We can all say that what is happening is terrible.  We need to move the discussion on.  We have identified a problem.  What are we going to do about it?  I notice that other Bills belonging to other people do get coverage.</p><p>However, a number of the environmental Bills that I introduced did not see the light of day in the mainstream print or electronic media.  The witnesses might respond to that point, given that they have said that RT&Eacute;'s coverage depends on legislative action, what is happening in the Oireachtas and what the political parties are doing.  We can account for ourselves in this regard and have done a substantial amount of work that has never been covered by anyone regardless of our significant efforts.</p><p> I only saw parts of the waste programme because I arrived in late before being called out again.  It was good and I compliment RT&Eacute; on broadcasting it.  Doing so was a good idea, as people could relate to what they were doing themselves.  Doing the same in this context would be useful.  Waste is adding to greenhouse gas emissions, but our lifestyles mean we produce 60% to 70% more greenhouse gas emissions than the average European, so a similar highlighting of certain practices, for example, long commutes in Dublin, and what can be done about them would be good.  Does RT&Eacute; have plans in this regard?</p><p> My final question is on advertising.  Half of RT&Eacute;'s revenue comes from the licence fee, and rightly so, but it depends a great deal on commercial revenue.  Companies involved in practices and industries that are anything but climate friendly supply it with advertising material to broadcast.  From an ethical point of view, has RT&Eacute; a policy on this?  There could be a conflict.</p><p> Met &Eacute;ireann's communication of weather warnings is good and its forecasting has improved in recent years.  We are on the edge of the north Atlantic, which makes forecasting difficult.  I have often watched Ms Cusack trying to give people an honest picture.  I always find the forecast good.  People say it is not accurate, but they are not listening to it properly.  If they listened to the full forecast, they would find it to be accurate, particularly for those who work outdoors.</p><p> Met &Eacute;ireann has issued warnings about extreme weather events only for those events not to affect particular locations.  Just before Christmas, Dublin traders complained that because Met &Eacute;ireann had issued a red or orange alert that day and told people not to go outdoors, the shops were empty.  Forecasting can be difficult, but is there a need for further refinement on a regional basis?  Met &Eacute;ireann makes an effort to say where, for example, heavy rain, flooding or extreme winds are likely, but could it try to nuance its orange and red warnings?</p><p> Regarding attribution, a memo was cited.  I understand that Met &Eacute;ireann cannot say that an event was caused by global warming.  There are few certainties in reading the science involved, given that weather changes, but in terms of developing Met &Eacute;ireann's policy on what it communicates to the public, is it shifting in the direction of telling them that, for example, the four serious weather events in Ireland in the past 12 months were the effects of global warming?  I would appreciate brief answers to these questions.</p></speech>

On any one day, the RT&Eacute; news and current affairs section is trying to balance a variety of stories, be they terrorist attacks in Kenya, the fallout of a Brexit vote, the inquest into the Carrickmines fire or the trolley crisis.  There is a limited amount of airtime and our editors make editorial judgments.</p><p>I would be concerned if, across the full range of output, we were not reflecting that.  What the Deputy referenced was before my time, so I will take his points back and investigate them, but I would find it difficult to believe that "Oireachtas Report", for example, did not cover Bills that had been introduced.  One of the reasons for us transitioning our Oireachtas coverage away from broadcasting in the middle of the night to real-time digital-first reporting is to allow us to carry out more reporting about what is happening in the Chambers, both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.</p><p> We are committed to reporting what happens in the Oireachtas and what legislators are doing.  That is why we have as many people based here as we do.  That reporting of what the Deputy and his colleagues do is a major investment.</p></speech>

Regarding the latter, there are three phases to the developments in which we are engaging.  One is the scientific and technical development to improve the attribution so that we can understand and identify the climate change fingerprint that may or may not be present in any particular weather event or sequence of weather events.  This is a complex scientific task, as the atmosphere is chaotic, and it involves cutting-edge science in terms of mathematical simulations.  We are at the vanguard in that regard and working with leading scientists internationally.</p> <p>  The second phase is about turning that work into an operational service that will provide routine updates, perhaps on a seasonal basis or, depending on the scale of the relevant weather pattern, rapidly afterwards.  It depends on the type of weather pattern.  If it is a large heatwave or a drought scenario, it is more suitable for attribution studies whereas something that is highly energetic, such as a convective event, is more difficult to attribute in terms of hard science.</p> <p>  The key issue, which has already been touched on in this discussion, is the understanding of that information and its communication to the public.  When one communicates any item of information relating to weather or climate to the public, the two challenges are confusion and give mixed messages.  The main exercise in our research with colleagues in Europe is about ensuring a single, consistent and coherent approach so that just one message is provided using the very best attribution assessments of past weather events, be they recent or in the past season.  We are working on the matter the Deputy raised, namely, improving communication so that the public understands and gets the maximum impact of any information we are providing.  I will ask Mr. Walsh to discuss this matter shortly.</p> <p>  On weather forecasting, there has been a silent revolution in the accuracy of forecasts in recent times.  This reflects developments in mathematical science, physics and the supercomputing facilities available to us internationally within the scientific community.</p> <p>  Regarding the specific question on weather warnings, I might hand over to Ms Cusack to comment.</p></speech>

In the particular incident cited, we have examined the warning.  It was justified for Dublin.  There was a south-easterly gale for six hours, accompanied by heavy rain.  I cannot imagine how anyone could have described it as a good day.  To the best of our ability, our warnings are specifically temporal and spatial.  That is by county, but even within counties we sometimes refer to eastern parts and so on.</p></speech>

While a specific attribution study has not been done on an event, we can fall back on the body of work that is being carried out globally on event attribution.  It shows that the likelihood of many events, particularly high-temperature ones, has been increased because of human-induced activity in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.  According to that body of evidence, when extreme events occur, human fingerprints are on them.</p> <p>  Regarding some of the extreme weather events we have had, for example, Storm Desmond in the winter of 2015-16 and the heatwave last summer, scientific attribution studies show that the likelihood of such events has increased.</p><p>If there is a specific event, we can fall back on the global body of work on extreme weather events and say that these are part of a trend of increasing severe weather events because of climate change in a global context.</p></speech>

I will focus on ancillary recommendation I of the Citizens' Assembly, which is that "Greater emphasis should be placed on providing positive information to the public which encourages people to make changes to the aspects of their behaviour which impact on climate change."</p> <p>  Everyone has a role to play on that.  We have a sense that a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach will be required to deal with this most urgent issue facing humanity.  Both of the organisations represented here have an incredible responsibility in this.  First, they are trusted, particularly Met &Eacute;ireann because people tune in to hear its reports every day.   In an extreme weather event we are all glued watching Ms Evelyn Cusack and all the others who tell us that it is not safe to go out, and we trust them.  That is the reality.  We see Met &Eacute;ireann as being incredibly important in this.  I was amused at the part of RT&Eacute;'s opening statement stating "A cursory review of coverage over the past six months on this issue demonstrates that RT&Eacute; is making genuine efforts".  That period happens to coincide with the length of time this committee has been holding its hearings.  I wonder are they related?  Over the previous six years, I have been a little disappointed at RT&Eacute;'s balanced coverage, for instance, when planning issues were being discussed and the reasons people were considering renewable infrastructure.  Insufficient accurate information was sought to establish why in heaven's name we were doing this, because the climate was changing and we have responsibilities.  Therefore I welcome what RT&Eacute; said about looking at something along the lines of "Operation Transformation".  There is great merit in that because people will tune in if they are getting accurate information on this.  Will RT&Eacute; require funding from a specific Department to follow up on such a project?</p> <p>  As for its relationship with Met &Eacute;ireann, the representatives from RT&Eacute; should tell us if there is anything in the contract between the two that inhibits Met &Eacute;ireann from expanding on its remit to share information to citizens on climate action and climate change?  Does anything need to be reconsidered in this area?</p> <p>  I have been very interested in some recent broadcast scheduling that I have observed.  John Creedon made an excellent three-part documentary called "Creedon's Weather: Four Seasons In One Day".  While I looked forward to watching it, it was scheduled in August, on a Sunday at 6.30 p.m.  On most fine evenings I am out.  Very few people would be inside then.  I am curious as to why such as valuable programme would be scheduled at such a time.  I should note this was in 2014 and I appreciate it was before Ms Forbes's time, but I felt that more people should have seen it then.  It would have been incredibly helpful for the public's understanding.  </p> <p>  Met &Eacute;ireann presented to the Citizens' Assembly and will have noted the assembly's further recommendations, including the one to which I made specific reference earlier.  Did it take the opportunity to raise with RT&Eacute; the recommendation that further communication would be required to get the information out to the public?</p></speech>

On the issue of funding, it is well known that we have issues around funding.</p><p>It is a problem for us at RT&Eacute; to really invest in content.  It is something we will continue to debate and discuss both here and externally.  <br/><br/>As for Operation Transformation, funding comes from the Department of Health for that programme, for instance.  It has been a supporter of that programme from the early days.  As there are ways we can work with Departments to make programmes in that vein, we can certainly look at things like that. <br/><br/>The relationship with Met &Eacute;ireann is hugely important to us and is one that is evolving.  The role to date has been very much around the weather forecast, and we have discussed among ourselves how we need to evolve that relationship into providing and working with Met &Eacute;ireann as to how together we can bring more information to the public, particularly on climate change.  This is something that we are currently working on and the members will begin to see its outcomes.<br/><br/>We must be very mindful of weather forecasts and information around climate change.  Both groups here probably believe that the weather forecast is not the place to have detailed information on climate change.  We are working on how we can create a slot or place, whether it is seasonal or monthly, to put more information out on this.  People will see more of this coming from us.<br/><br/>Over recent months we have developed a partnership with several universities that has enabled us to put together an online forum called Brainstorm, which is at <i>rte.ie/eile/brainstorm, </i>which features a whole range of articles put together by various academics.  Many of those articles relate to and discuss climate change.  There are ways other than television that we need to explore, whether with third parties such as academic institutions or with Met &Eacute;ireann where we can provide information.  This is an area on which we are actively working.</p></speech>

It is encompassed in the approach that we have taken since we put our strategy in place.  Our job is to provide to the Irish people with what we refer to as the authoritative voice on weather and climate information.  This must be founded on evidence-based scientific information.  I am taken by comments on how sometimes science is not as interesting to the public as some of us may think.  We are aware of this and that it is something that can turn people off.  It is all about storytelling, plain language and ensuring that people understand.  We must transpose the scientific information and transmit it to the public in creative ways.  I am quite happy with the summary so far.</p></speech>

We are constantly looking at new ways to fund and undertake these projects.</p> <p>  Scheduling is always contentious, even within RT&Eacute;.  As an ex-programme maker myself, I always want my programmes to go out in the best possible slot.  We are always fighting with one another about which programmes go out in which slots.  There is a whole scheduling area for the independent producers and our own producers.  They look at the available audience, its profile, and who might be there to watch programmes.  Sometimes they get it right and sometimes they get it wrong but what time our programmes go out is a contentious matter for everyone in broadcasting.  We all want our programmes to go out to the largest available audience.  </p> <p>  Something that is particularly important on foot of the advent of our new player is that our audience is accessing our programmes in different ways now and it is not merely the linear broadcast.  On the recently launched RT&Eacute; Player, we can see the number of people accessing our programmes in playback, non-live, and in a non-linear way is growing hugely, even over the past couple of months.</p><p>We have a job to do to make people aware of the player and how they can access programmes.  We are lucky that we have a back catalogue of programmes and an archive that is very rich.  It can even be seen in some of the programmes that appear on our player at the moment that some of the most successful programmes were made five or ten years ago.  There are different ways now to view programmes.</p></speech>

This is something that is encompassed in the type of collaboration that Ms Forbes mentioned and these are issues that we are already considering.

Where would we be today without serious science behind weather forecasts?  A few of the questions I wanted to ask were on the public perception and the socio-economic impacts of climate change and trying to get that across on RT&Eacute; to the ordinary person.  The terminology that we use in here can be quite off-putting.  I know the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, has a sound and vision scheme where it puts up certain titles or topics.  Will RT&Eacute; prioritise broadcasts from independent producers and programmes on climate action, climate change or climate information when people are submitting applications in competitions under the scheme?</p></speech>

We would be in favour of that.  It would be a good idea, not only for ourselves but for Virgin Media One.  Independent radio broadcasters would also be interested in that.  Local radio and independent broadcasters sometimes do not have sufficient funding to deal with some of these issues.  I believe a general consensus would be found within the broadcasting landscape for something such as that.  However, people would say the same about other particular issues but it is up to the committee to decide what its priorities are.</p> <p>  On the genres and how that is applied by the BAI, that is a matter for the BAI to decide.</p></speech>

A study published recently by Gluaiseacht analysed two weeks of broadcasts from "Morning Ireland", the most popular radio show in the country, as the witnesses will know.  It found that just 0.92% of the show was dedicated to environmental matters.</p><p>That says a lot.</p><p> I also want to ask RT&Eacute; about the recent programme that was on RT&Eacute; television which was sponsored by Bord na M&oacute;na but about which it was not pointed out that it was sponsored by Bord na M&oacute;na.  How did that happen in that way and how do we know that, for example, an oil company would not sponsor a programme about offshore resources?  RT&Eacute; did not make it known that the programme was sponsored, so how do we know that it will not happen again?</p><p> Somebody from Met &Eacute;ireann was on the radio recently and he or she said that we have no way of knowing what effects climate change in Ireland will have.  Surely Met &Eacute;ireann would know about the effects that climate change would have.  I cannot remember exactly what programme it was on but are the witnesses saying that it did not happen?  If they would like to say that did not happen that would also be interesting.  I am nearly certain it was somebody from Met &Eacute;ireann who was on RT&Eacute; and made that statement.  If the witnesses are saying that it was not, then they can do so and we will see what happens.</p></speech>

That is what this is about.  There are three elements to this, as I have said already.  First, the science is in formation so we are working with the best international research networks and the leading centres in event attribution to put in place a reliable, consistent and authoritative system to be able to describe whether we can detect the fingerprint of climate change for any particular event.  That is what is happening.  Second, we also want to ensure that is an operational system in terms of science, so that is being built as well.  Third is the way we develop the understanding and how we communicate attribution information to the public, and this relates to what the Deputy was saying.  Attribution information is slightly different from the normal weather information that we get.  We all live in a straightforward deterministic world and we do not live in a probabilistic world.  We cannot deal with probabilities because that is no use to us in reality if we want to decide whether we will have a picnic or put our sandbags out.  Attribution provides us with likelihoods and percentages.  For example, we could say that it is more likely that a particular event such as an intense downpour is due to a warming world.  That is a general comment but to focus specifically on a particular event in that manner is quite powerful information and is a wonderful way of being able to communicate the impact of climate change to the public.</p> <p>  I am not aware of the specific interview the Deputy was referring to, but the general communication that we would provide on any particular event would be to describe the general modification that has taken place in the dynamics of the atmosphere due to climate change and then to relate that to a particular event in the way that Mr. Walsh has pointed out.  In the absence of any specific attribution study on a particular event, it is very difficult to say that the particular event in question was due to climate change.  We tend to rely on the general commentary that describes how climate change can affect any particular weather event in a general way.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#EE00100"><p>It can be done in certain circumstances if a specific study is conducted into a particular event.  Mr. Moran has mentioned several times the moving of attribution from a scientific footing to getting the information across to the public in a way it understands.  There is much debate in the scientific community on the best way to do that.  One of the best ways I have heard it described is that we are basically loading the dice.  We have had weather patterns before and they have occurred randomly, but with human-induced activities, such as injecting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, we are loading the dice and the chances of particular extreme events are increasing everywhere.  In some cases we can say a particular event has been made 50%, 100% or 400% more likely, depending on the statistics and models.  It is more understandable to people that way.  Our activity has loaded the dice and made these events more likely.</p></speech>

"Morning Ireland" produces 250 programmes per year, and although my maths are not great, ten programmes from 250 programmes do not strike me as being terribly representative.  In the past month we have had the Minister with responsibility for climate action on to speak about the end of the COP summit in Katowice and we have had Ms Mary Robinson on to talk about her foundation and climate change.  Of course we could always do more but climate change and climate action form one of the subjects that "Morning Ireland" tackles.  I am afraid that without knowing the period in which the sample was taken, it is very difficult to be specific.  From my perspective, if we reported on a ten-day sample from 250 programmes, we would rightly be called out for it.</p></speech>

The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, did an investigation into it and found that it should have been stated at the end of the programme that it had been part-funded by Bord na M&oacute;na.  That was a mistake on our part and we put our hands up and said it should not have happened.  Quite honestly, we were pretty annoyed that it got through in the way that it did.  We instigated a review in RT&Eacute; of how it happened.  The production unit involved is very clear on the procedures for this type of programming.  I assure the Deputy it will not happen again.</p></speech>

I apologise as I have not heard everything that has been said.  I was attending a meeting of the Committee on Justice and Equality, and witnesses might know it is busy in here on Wednesdays.  I have read the opening statements.</p> <p>  My questions relate to some of the difficulties around the weather warnings, and I know this has been discussed.  There is confusion around the colour coding.  There is an RT&Eacute; remit and a broader remit for the State and its Departments.  People cannot properly differentiate between red, yellow or orange warnings and do not know what would be the proper behavioural response to them.  On the first day of the snow last year, everybody went to work despite there being a red warning.  There had been a change from orange to red but everybody was out doing what they do every day.  On the following day the warning continued to be red and nobody moved.  There was confusion around the proper behavioural response.  I know with weather patterns the situation is fluid and is based on the possible predictions.</p><p>Have we considered European norms in perhaps localising weather patterns or trying to integrate this with technology in a greater way?  Part of the problem is that if people overestimate a particular warning, they will underestimate the following one, even if it should be taken seriously.  It has definitely been the case with some people who have been injured and reckless, not only here but elsewhere.</p><p> Could anything be done from a public broadcasting perspective to alleviate such confusion so we could see an appropriate behavioural response?  It also lends itself to clickbait with some digital platforms, with weather warnings becoming sensational for media purposes.  I am not saying this is the fault of those present but it is a general and international concern with weather.  People like to know what is coming.  Is Met &Eacute;ireann examining the colour format it currently employs as people do not know and understand the proper behavioural response.</p></speech>

The warning system we apply is part of a co-ordinated European effort.  It is co-ordinated by EUMETNET through the MeteoAlarm system.  It is in line with the World Meteorological Organization guidelines and it is very much in line with the European norm.  The forecasting system underpinning that in terms of the numerical weather prediction modelling systems is based on the very best forecasting system worldwide.  It is the ECMWF forecasting system.  Our short-range forecasting system is subject to ongoing scientific development and is again the very best forecasting system on a very high resolution nationally.  We consider it our mission to ensure the systems are like that.</p> <p>  Red warnings are very serious and attention must be paid to them.  It is the same with orange and yellow warnings.  It is quite a serious matter, especially when we are dealing with high-impact weather events during extreme weather.  Our focus is on avoiding confusion and the mixing of messages.  We focus on this especially in the 48 hours leading into a severe weather event.  That authoritative source is important.</p> <p>  There were specific questions on any confusion that might arise with weather warnings.  Such warnings are advice.  They herald the possibility of a particular high-impact weather event in the meteorological sense.  We are of course at the interface between high-impact weather and societal response.  International best practice has identified weather warnings as the best mechanism to reach into the information universe in which we all tend to exist and grab attention or raise the awareness of citizens and decision makers so they can take appropriate action.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned confusion about warnings and clickbait.  Spurious warnings have been issued before but, unfortunately, Met &Eacute;ireann has no control over those.  We are very worried about that and we study them.  I have personally contacted various agencies issuing these warnings without any meteorological background.  We are very concerned about that.</p></speech>

We worked hand in hand with Met &Eacute;ireann and the emergency centre at the time.  We were ensuring that we got the information out to the public as quickly as possible, whether through live broadcasts or information being dispensed on radio, on television or online.</p><p>We worked hand in hand so that the information that was being given to the public was when and where we were getting it.  We all learned a lot from that situation and there have been various follow-up sessions.  Certainly, from our point of view, we endeavoured to ensure that the public was as warned and as aware of what was happening as we were, and we got information out there. </p></speech>

I refer to what Ms Cusack mentioned about the miscommunication that can occur.  Perhaps we should centralise people's information towards Met &Eacute;ireann.  It would be a worthwhile exercise because I honestly believe there is huge confusion.  As I have said, an overestimation leads to an underestimation, which can be fatal.  Confusion abounds because people will say a red warning issued but there were no consequences or they believed a red warning was issued when it might not have been issued by Met &Eacute;ireann.  As a consequence, people underestimate what is coming and that is a big issue.  I do not think that the public fully understands and obviously weather events will occur at greater frequency and force due to climate change.</p></speech>

Professor Ray Bates is a former head of research in Met &Eacute;ireann.  I wish to refer to what he said in an article published in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>on 22 December about a recent alarming report compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, on the difference between a 1.5&deg; and 2&deg; Celsius increase in global warming.  He said &quot;the IPCC SR1.5 report does not merit being regarded as a scientifically rigorous document&quot;.  Do the witnesses agree?</p></speech>

The main purpose for us being here today is to work on how we can improve the climate information we give to the public, and ensure that we convey a clear, consistent message to the public so we can support the wider agenda of climate action.  In Met &Eacute;ireann we focus on communicating the advice that we get from the WMO and the IPCC.  That is the bedrock upon which we build the information and advice we provide to the users, decision-makers, policymakers, politicians, and so on and so forth.</p> <p>  Having said that, in any discussion it is important that all views, and all evidence-based views and rationale, are taken into account.  This is an important aspect of the scientific debate that can take place on any scientific matter.  The findings are on how the climate is changing, how the world is warming and how all of that impacts on our weather.  The increase in frequency of extreme weather is very clear and unequivocal.  It should be taken as an unambiguous statement from Met &Eacute;ireann that the occurrence of extreme weather is on the rise, that the world is warming and that climate change is a reality.  </p></speech>

It would be very interesting to really delve into the science.  A friend of mine who is very interested in this area claims there is a concern that forecasting programmes or modelling, even with supercomputer systems, in the five to ten-day forecasting range find it really difficult to cope with the change in weather patterns caused by climate change.  In other words, the system is changing so much at the moment that some modelling systems are unable to measure some of the five and ten-day weather forecasts that we would expect to be able to do.</p></speech>

Part of the task of a weather forecaster is to try to provide information on what the weather may look like in the next five days, ten days, a two-week period or even a month.  Sometimes one could look at a weather forecaster and decide that in actual fact he or she is predicting the predictability of the atmosphere, which is a chaotic system and is referred to as a dynamical system.  The predictive capability and skill that we have, which is increasing at pace scientifically, is remarkable now compared with the past ten years.  Every year we acquire another one day's predictive capability by using the very best forecasting capability in the world called an ensemble system.  I will not go into the technicalities of the system.  Suffice to say, instead of using one forecast we run 51 simultaneous forecasts on a super computer thus allowing us to capture the chaotic dynamical nature of the atmosphere, and all possible thermodynamic outcomes that could possibly occur in the next one to two weeks.  This work is subject to continual refinement and tuning to capture all possible outcomes.  The ECMWF model, which is the leading forecasting model in the world, is a leader in this area.</p> <p>  As we trend into the future and move into a warmer world the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are going to change.  The nature of extreme weather is something that we are going to have to work on quantifying, and we refer to this as the future weather challenge.  Let us remember that there is a difference between climate and weather and I invoke the phrase that climate is what one expects and weather is what one gets.  This is because, as we move into the warmer world scenarios, in the coming decades, we will see the chaotic face of weather and atmospheric dynamics emerging in that period.  The science of meteorology and what we are learning from climate models are merging to encompass the capability, that we are learning from, climate models and forecasting models to improve our forecasting capability.  </p></speech>

To be honest, the representation of people from the environmental community has changed recently.  However, for many years, the dominant framing narrative in RT&Eacute; was always sceptic versus advocate to the point that really respected and decent people in the scientific, climate and environment community boycotted RT&Eacute; because we were only ever included to be pitched against the sceptic, which was fodder for a good story but unenlightening.</p><p>That was the reality and I would love to go back over the archive.

We aim to be fair and impartial.  We would be failing in our responsibility if we did not reflect that 97% of scientists agree that climate change is man made.  I cannot answer for what happened previously and I am grateful to the Deputy for acknowledging that things have improved recently.</p></speech>

It is better for RT&Eacute; to keep its editorial independence rather than go down the line whereby the Department funds programming.  The job of RT&Eacute; is to provide sceptical, critical, analytical storytelling and once there is funding for specific categories, or even areas of programming, or listening to any of us here saying that any Bill should get coverage, that is the ruin of our public service broadcasting.  Mr. Williams should go to the Department and get a licence fee increase, as some of us on this committee have recommended, and then use the funding.</p> <p>  As the head of Met &Eacute;ireann said, this is the biggest story to be told.  It is the biggest ecological, social, economic and environmental story of our times.  Surely Mr. Williams's journalistic skills help him to realise that and that this story must be told in increasingly difficult and interesting ways.  Get the funding separately.  If the funding is tied to the story, the story will not be told well.</p></speech>

This is a more scientific and hypothetical question.  We have already ascertained that climate change is a reality whereas we cannot say if weather events are caused or orientated by climate change.  Why is there no consistency in the change in the weather?  In 2010, we had a damnable winter freeze and the word on the street, not scientifically backed up, was that this was going to be every winter from now on because of climate change.  We have hardly had a night's frost since then.  We have had mild winters.  Last year we had a drought for the first time in ten years.  It is probably not possible to answer the question but we all know there are changes.  Our weather is changing because of climate change but why is there such diversity in the change?  How come there is no consistency in the change?</p></speech>

Largely speaking, when the atmosphere is warming, there is, on a very large scale, a fundamental change in the gradient between the tropics and the Arctic, to look at the hemisphere in a simplistic way.  One impact of that is it alters the dynamics of the upper part of the atmosphere, halfway up through the atmosphere to the jet stream.  The jet stream is normally kept in a strong, east to west zonal pattern but, when the gradient between the tropics and the Arctic is loosened or weakened, a lax or meandering pattern is created which can then produce this inconsistency in the weather.  One manifestation of this could be the fact that we are experiencing a polar solar stratospheric warming event at the moment, which is the second polar stratospheric warming event in the past ten months.  It is a manifestation of the same effect where the polar vortex is in a lax, meandering mode, producing the effects the northern hemisphere is experiencing at the moment.  This is producing an inconsistency, to use the language the Senator has chosen there.</p><p>I would be glad to discuss the issue with the Senator.  With the other committee members, he is very welcome to come and visit us when we can elaborate on the issue further.</p></speech>

It is interesting because I come from a part of the country where the only safe topic for discussion is the weather.  It is the one non-political issue about which someone can talk with a stranger.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on one point with the director general of RT&Eacute;.  I was interested when she said RT&Eacute; had a 94% penetration rate, which is fantastic.  RT&Eacute; has fantastic access to the public.  She also went on to say there was no substitute for public information campaigns.  Millions were put into informing the public in the United Kingdom about our impact on the climate and the environment and Sir David Attenborough's programme "The Blue Planet" had more of an impact than anything that had gone before.  Is it time to look at the issue differently?  We are judged thoroughly in the court of public opinion, by populist opinion and especially by what comes out of the mouths of those regarded as popular.  I hate to use the word "celebrity".  Is there a better way to communicate with the general public to tell them what individuals could do differently to have an impact and make a difference in dealing with climate change?  Sir David Attenborough did that and we now all look differently at our use of plastics.  People aged eight years to 80 have changed their behaviour after the broadcasting of "The Blue Planet".</p></speech>

The first thing we are hearing from the public is that they would like to know what could be done.  There is a need for clarity on the mitigating factors available to the public.  The use of plastic has been well discussed.  This country banned plastic bags a number of years ago and it has had a real impact.  There is a need for clarity on what can be done.  Thereafter it is not for me, or the people in this room, to decide what form that should take.  Once the mitigating factors in what can and needs to be done are made clear, we can put heads together to decide who should communicate the information and how.  I referenced road safety.  It was a good example of a collective coming together and making a real priority of ensuring the public knew what to do to ensure their cars were safer, that driving conditions were better and safety belts were being worn.  There was a combination of things to make that campaign work.  The first objective is to identify the things that can be done and how we communicate the information can be sorted out afterwards.</p></speech>

Considering Met &Eacute;ireann's positioning within RT&Eacute;'s scheduling, is there an opportunity to use sound bites to highlight the behavioural changes people could make that would make a difference?  Rather than having a big advertising campaign, there would be a continual drip, a daily feed, of information through short, sharp sound bites about the need for behavioural change.  Is that a possibility?</p></speech>

We have collectively committed to figuring out what information needs to made avilable and how we communicate it.  As I mentioned, the weather forecast after the news, for example, is hugely popular.  It is a very important slot and people watch in big numbers.  It is probably not the time for sound bites, but we need to consider how we use our websites, radio programmes, voices and faces.  We are working on this and need to find an answer.  We also need to be careful when we use the words "sound bite".  It needs to be based on fact and part of an overall communication campaign which is clear to the public that by doing X, Y or Z, we would make an impact.</p></speech>

By way of clarification, there is space for innovation.  As the director general said, we are actively working on that issue.</p><p>I would point out that our function is to provide climate information.  It is the hard scientific evidence-based information, which also supports the wider climate action agenda.  Any information we provide would have to be in support of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment's overall broader national climate action and communications approach and initiatives.</p></speech>

The hearings we are having today show a clear obsession with the weather.  If one follows that logically, the weather seems to be the mechanism by which one can communicate so much because Irish people are obsessed with it and one can use it as a tool with which to disseminate information to those who may not have a conceptional understanding of what climate change might be.  Therein lies an opportunity.</p> <p>  I am conscious that we cannot put too much of an onus on RT&Eacute;.  The organisation has such a wide remit and only collects so much from the broadcasting fee.  It would be easy for us to say RT&Eacute; needs to do more.  I note there is an audience council report from 2014 - I do not know whether there has been one subsequently - which showed clearly the need for greater messaging around climate change.  We must take in good faith what has been stated here today in respect of the various initiatives in which RT&Eacute; is involved through programming, through Science Foundation Ireland and in inculcating more stories through current affairs programmes such as "Morning Ireland".</p> <p>  The witnesses will correct me if I am misinterpreting the late Professor Marshall McLuhan's assertion that "the medium is the message".  I accept that the medium of television and the television schedule are limited.  I also accept the point made in respect of the weather slots and whether they present an opportunity to communicate a message.  I would contend that is probably not the case.  However, if Met &Eacute;ireann and RT&Eacute; are partnering through the RT&Eacute; Player, they have an infinite opportunity to message to countless numbers of people and therein lies the opportunity.  We are all now dependent on the player.  I cannot be at home at 9 p.m. or 10 a.m. but I can watch programmes afterwards.  The player is a major resource.</p> <p>  If we have meteorologists who are talking about the attributional effect - in that regard, we need to do more to use language that ordinary people can understand - and if we have Met &Eacute;ireann partnering with RT&Eacute; on the player to disseminate bespoke simple messages around the effects of weather patterns in three, four or five minute segments, it would become as popular as a YouTube clip.  There is no reason Met &Eacute;ireann could not use YouTube as a medium as well to get that message out.  We have an opportunity here.  This meeting has been informative.</p> <p>  My question arises from my lack of understanding of how Met &Eacute;ireann sees its remit.  While I understand the partnership with RT&Eacute; and the element of disseminating information, does Met &Eacute;ireann see its role as being an advocate for messaging around the dire impacts of climate change?  In its statement, Met &Eacute;ireann used the word "unequivocal" in relation to the evidence base that exists around climate change.  To take that one step further, does Met &Eacute;ireann see its role as being an interpreter of the science and a disseminator of a message in respect of that?  I sense some reticence - the witnesses will correct me if I am wrong - from Met &Eacute;ireann about its role.  I understand the partnership and the dynamic between Met &Eacute;ireann and RT&Eacute;.  We have all come to depend on the weather reports, which are part and parcel of our lives, but I sense some reticence on the part of Met &Eacute;ireann about where it sees itself in terms of the dissemination of the message to the wider populace.  I ask Mr. Moran to correct me if I am wrong.</p></speech>

That was an excellent question.</p><p>When one works in Met &Eacute;ireann, one of the key elements is to understand where the line is drawn.  This is an issue when one is forecasting the weather.  Our job is - this is the language we use - to support impact based decision-making.  We are providing weather forecasts but it is to support the Deputy's decision-making, the public's decision-making, the decision-makers' decision-making.  We do not just issue a forecast and walk away from it.  It is important to understand what decisions a person makes, what thresholds affect him or her regarding weather, and to take those into consideration when we parcel the information and form our messages.  How we interact with the audience is then flavoured by our understanding of how one makes one's decisions.</p><p> The same approach applies to climate change.  We are supporting impact based decision-making on climate change and that involves understanding at a community level, at an individual level and at a societal level what the thresholds are, what will affect one's planning and what affects one's decision-making, and then packaging the information in a manner that meets the person's requirements.  Some of those packages must be specialised.  Some of them and this scientific information need to be transposed, as the Deputy stated quite rightly, into plain language.  I quote words that have been used here today - "into the vernacular".  It needs to be part of everyday life.  This is important.  This is part of our role as scientists to be able to provide an explanation in the language that everybody uses.</p><p> I am sorry if the Deputy detected reticence but the key point is us struggling to try to explain what we do.  Part of the purpose of our statement is to explain clearly what we do.  We provide climate information conscious of what that information is to be used for.  We have to maximise the impact and the usefulness of that information.  It is a considerable asset but we do not tell the recipient what to do with it.  As scientists, we should not cross that line.  That is an important line that should not be crossed but we should inform ourselves as to what impact the weather or climate will have on the recipient.</p><p> Deputy Sherlock raised the issue of attribution.  In terms of plain language, I agree "attribution" is not a great word and we will work on that.  However, in terms of the expectations that have arisen regarding attribution, part of what we will be doing is explaining yet again that the attribution is not a cure all.  It is a valuable source of information but the way it is communicated and the understanding of that information is complex in itself also.</p></speech>

There are those who are much younger than us who are ahead of us.  There are also those who are in our age range and maybe older, who are voters.  They are consumers.  There is the causal link between weather patterns, the effects of climate change and the heating of the planet which is attributable to human behaviour.  If such link were more widely understood it could influence how they make decisions about such matters as how they consume energy and the type of car they drive.  Somewhere there is a role for Met &Eacute;ireann to link the two, for example, where the weather is changing as a result of planet heating that were we to do X it would have a bearing.</p> <p>  Deputy Heydon made the point about the daffodils in bloom in January.  We were going into the Christmas period at 12&deg;.  I asked people older than myself if they ever remembered Christmases of 12&deg; in their living memory.  The answer was "No".  These were people in their 70s.  That is not to say it has not happened in the past.  That is as a result of the heating of the planet.  It has to be, if the science is to be believed.  How one links behavioural change with that fact is where Met &Eacute;ireann has a role to play.  The Chairman will forgive me, if I have gone on too long.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Moran want to come back in on it?  It would help.  Met &Eacute;ireann is often mentioned here by members of the committee.</p><p>We want to work with Mr. Moran, should he want us to do so.  It is nuanced, but perhaps there is a solution somewhere.</p></speech>

The people who work in Met &Eacute;ireann are mathematicians, physicists, meteorologists, engineers, scientists and so on.  These are the core competencies of our staff which define the type of people we are and what we do.  When one looks at our mission, one will see that we really do not have a role in effecting behavioural change, monitoring emissions or dealing with policy issues in respect of climate action, but we do support the overall wider climate action agenda by providing climate information.  The overall message in initiating actions by society, communities, individual citizens or decision makers is that their actions will have to be motivated by the information provided.  We can contribute to the motivation in taking those actions by providing the information, but it is important to understand we are not competent to advise on what individuals should do on the basis of that information.  We work on the science and provide the projections and information.  There is a distinction.  At this stage that is our role and it is important that the public understand this.</p></speech>

For Ms Forbes there is the question of the audience council.  I do not understand how it works and do not expect her to answer that question.  Was 2014 the last year in which there was an audience council or was there another in the intervening period?  If there has been another report in the intervening period, is she getting the same feedback on the need for messaging on climate change?  She can revert to me at some other stage on the issue, if she so wishes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.145" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#NN00800"><p>I will happily answer the Deputy's question.  For the benefit of members, the audience council is overseen by the board of RT&Eacute;.  It is one of a number of councils under the auspices of the board.  The board puts out a call for voluntary members to be part of the council which in a given year fulfils a number of duties, as determined by the board.  It is important to say the council is not the only way we receive feedback from the public.  The report to which the Deputy referred was produced in 2014.  As far as I am aware, we have not used the audience council for something like it in recent times, but I will certainly check.  However, what we now have and may not have had in 2014 is much greater engagement with the public, members of which are quick and happy to engage via email.  We have an audience panel which we use regularly in considering topics such as editorial policy and various surveys.  We have used the panel to gauge what is important and what the audience would like to see more of on RT&Eacute;.  That is how we make temperature checks to assess what is relevant to the audience.  We also regularly have focus groups with our audience throughout the country.  That is where we hear from the public.  There are many radio shows which members of the audience ring to talk about a topic and one hears what is said loud and clear.  Therefore, the audience council is not the only forum in which we get the reaction of the audience.</p><p>I think if Met &Eacute;ireann did something such as set up a focus group on the dissemination of the message of climate change, it would yield some wonderful information.</p><p> To end on a positive note, there is an inherent trust in Met &Eacute;ireann, which is a key point and that public trust in Met &Eacute;ireann is its greatest asset - even though we do not always like the weather reports.   </p></speech>

I understand from Mr. Moran that the competencies of the Met &Eacute;ireann personnel are in the science area, their expertise is in the STEM professions.  We then have the problem of communication.  Met &Eacute;ireann has this superb resource, the trust of the public and yet it does not have the competency in communications to get the message across.  That concerns me.  Is this something that Met &Eacute;ireann could do?  Should the Government be resourcing Met &Eacute;ireann to enable it to communicate the message?  This could be the critical link.  This is what is missing.  Met &Eacute;ireann enjoys public trust, and has all the competencies and expertise in science, but all that knowledge is not being communicated to the public.</p> <p>  My second point is on attribution and impact-based decision-making.   I wish to raise the precautionary principle.  What I am hearing from Mr. Moran's response is that Met &Eacute;ireann is taking a very conservative approach to climate change.  However, there is the mechanism of the precautionary principle.  I wonder whether Met &Eacute;ireann uses or could advance that principle?  We all recognise here that climate change is happening.  As Mr. S&eacute;amus Walsh stated, there is a recognition of global warming and of increasing greenhouse gas emissions.  It is critical that the message is coming across to the public.  My sense is that Mr. Moran's conservative approach is erring on the side of caution.  Could the precautionary principle be used to move the issue of messaging forward in a more proactive way in order that the listener and those dependent on Met &Eacute;ireann's message are forearmed by that message, thereby getting the warning?</p> <p>  I now have a question for Ms Forbes.  My interpretation of Ms Forbes's contribution is that climate change is so complex that RT&Eacute; had better not do anything and not take action.  As Senator Marshall suggested, which I would support 100%, RT&Eacute; as a service provider instead could be doing lots of little actions, small sized messaging on how the consumer can take action.  That can happen through a whole array of programmes.  For instance, if we want to decrease the amount of emissions going into the atmosphere, we can drive our cars more slowly.  That reduction in speed will have an immediate effect.  If one takes a glass of water from the tap, one does not need to buy plastic bottles of water that have been stored for indeterminate periods.</p> <p>  Can RT&Eacute; move away from the complexity and recognise the problem?  Can it grasp the nettle and embrace it and decide that as the service provider, it will start to use every opportunity to inform the public as to what actions they can start taking right away?  Instead of just talking, RT&Eacute; can show the way to take action.  Could that be done?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#OO00500"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions and her observations.  It is important to state that we are not sitting here and saying the issue is so complex that we are going to do nothing.  I really hope that idea has not come across, because that is not the intention at all.  In fact it is quite the opposite.  I think what I said was that some of the areas around emissions and carbon are complex subjects and we have to figure out how we can best get that message across to the public.</p><p>That is what we are working on right now.  Going back to the Senator's point about how we can get actions out to the public, I mentioned that on Monday evening there was a very practical segment on "Claire Byrne Live".  There were four contributors talking about how to reduce waste.  They all gave examples.  That is just one example from Monday night just gone.  We are making much bigger efforts in that space but to go back to the point I raised earlier, there needs to be clarity.  We all need to be better informed.  We need to know that doing X will result in Y.  That is where more discussion is needed.  What is the message we want to get out there?  What are the five things that we can do as a society that will make an impact?  How do we communicate that?  That is the piece that is missing at the moment.  </p><p> We all have some bits of information.  We know that, as the Senator says, by driving more slowly we can reduce emissions but that is only one topic.  There is a lot of talk among kids about animals and what is happening to their habitats.  We need clarity around actions we can take to make an impact.  We can then get behind them and communicate them.  That is where there is a gap at the moment.  That is what we are hearing from our viewers and listeners.  They are asking to be told what they can do.  When we put out programmes around waste management or like that segment on "Claire Byrne Live" we get a huge reaction.  The public wants to know what it can practically do that will make an impact.  We therefore get behind that.</p></speech>

RT&Eacute; is organised in a very devolved way.  The individual programme teams take these challenges on for themselves rather than being directed from the top.  As we evidenced earlier on, members of staff themselves are very engaged in this.  They are looking for ways to tell this story.  Whether on "Claire Byrne Live" on Monday or on "Drivetime" on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 last week, the evidence is there.</p></speech>

I note that this is in line with the approach of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It is about a bottom-up approach.  This national dialogue on climate action is meant to engage at a local, regional and community level to ensure that the kind of transformation agenda that will be essential over the coming decades is implemented in a very effective way.  That is a key thing.</p> <p>  I want to very quickly touch on a few questions that have been raised.  Focus groups are an excellent idea.  This is at the heart of the impact-based decision-making approach.  Although it may not be visible, we have a serious number of seminars and various conferences with the public on an ongoing basis.  During these conferences and seminars we consciously bring in a diverse set of experts from the policy area, the political area and the scientific area.  We end up having discussions very similar to the discussion we are having today.  Our key communication goal is for the public and for those who are attending to have a real understanding of the weather that can achieve a personal attachment to how climate is changing and how it is expected to change.  That is a very powerful message and a very powerful communication goal to achieve.  That is the contribution we make.  It is a negative way to put it but the line stops at climate information.  We have a very significant role to play there.  This is part of a structured national climate change communications strategy.  It has to be part of that approach.</p><p>It is co-ordinated very ably by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  On the question that Senator Grace O'Sullivan had on the scientific approach we take, that can be described as providing the very best explanation out of the set of all competing explanations.  In a loose way, that is a description of how the science of meteorology and climatology works.  Largely speaking, it focuses on the consilience of evidence to arrive at the most reasonable explanation, the best competing explanation possible.  Broadly speaking, I would not see this as a precautionary principle.  It is identifying the most plausible and best explanation.  I hope that answers that question.  </p><p> On communication, again I am repeating myself a little bit.  It is analogous to the way that we provide weather forecasts.  We do that by having an authoritative voice and a trusted familiar source, and that is greatly enabled by our colleagues in RT&Eacute;.  We then provide timely, accurate, actionable information that is understandable so that people can take actions.  We do not tell people what actions they should take but we design the information so that it will actually provoke the action and then lead to the best societal outcomes.  That is analogous to how we are moving towards communicating climate change.  We are working on providing the most relevant, salient, understandable climate information to support the wider climate action agenda.  That is again, quite rightly and ably, being co-ordinated and driven by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I hope that I have answered all of those questions.</p></speech>

Macra na Feirme welcomes the opportunity to present the views of young trained farmers on this complex issue of climate change and to provide our perspective on the recommendations made by the Citizens' Assembly to the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  I am the national president of Macra na Feirme.  I am joined here today by Mr. Derrie Dillon, Macra na Feirme's agricultural affairs manager. This year Macra na Feirme celebrates 75 years of representing, supporting and developing young farmers to help them overcome the challenges they and their communities face.  Environment and climate change are a challenge but are also an opportunity, and young farmers are willing to play their part by embracing new science, technologies and management practices that will help make us climate leaders.</p> <p>  Today young farmers are establishing their businesses in the context of Ireland being a world leader in the area of sustainable auditing and carbon footprinting under the Origin Green programme.  The targets set out in both Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025 shape the future of agriculture in respect of production levels and the environment.  The multifunctional role and multiplier effect of farming means that along with the production of food, the EPA environment assessment in 2016 states that farmers and farming can provide valuable ecosystem services to society, such as safe clean water, regulation of nutrient cycles and enhancement of biodiversity.</p><p>When discussing agriculture's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, it should be remembered that Ireland has a small cohort of heavy industrial contributors of greenhouse gases when compared to the rest of Europe.  This exaggerates agriculture&rsquo;s output of greenhouse gases relative to our European colleagues and is often used to portray the industry in a negative light.  Telling the full story on climate change is very important.  Irish dairy emissions, for example, are the lowest in the EU at just over 1 kg of carbon per kg of milk solids produced and our emissions are continually declining on units of food our farmers produce.  From a carbon credit perspective, agriculture does not always receive its fair share of credit.  Grassland, for example, is an acceptable carbon sink from a scientific point of view and recognised by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO, but is not currently an accepted mode of carbon sequestration for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC.  Ireland is making decisions on greenhouse gas policy for agriculture in the absence of this key abatement resource. </p><p> Macra na Feirme appreciates the complexity of developing policies and strategies to address climate change.  The short timeframe in which the Citizens' Assembly considered and made recommendations on this critical issue is a cause for concern.  Time does not permit me to go through all of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  However, I would like to elaborate on recommendations Nos. 5 and 6.  Macra na Feirme has highlighted in its pre-budget submissions the need for action on developing positive policies on planning permission and REFIT tariffs for renewable energy.  These, along with financial tools, are required to help stimulate greater uptake of on-farm renewable energy projects including biogas from anaerobic digestion and the installation of solar panels on farm buildings.  To achieve greater investment in the sector, farmers who want to join together in collaborative projects should be facilitated to apply collectively under grant aid schemes to allow them to achieve economies of scale.  All feed sources for biomass production should be indigenous to encourage development of the supply chain.</p><p> On abatement measures at farm level, the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, includes a range of scientific advancements and measures around grassland management, the inclusion of clover in swards, nutrient management planning and sexed semen, to name just a few.  The three fundamental requirements for achieving the aforementioned measures are education and advice, policy and CAP supports to help gain traction among farmers.  According to Teagasc, widespread uptake of nutrient management planning could achieve a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 15% reduction in ammonia emissions.  The key to unlocking this potential is understanding how farmers digest, use and process scientific information.  However, environmental sustainability cannot be taken in isolation.  It is also linked to farmers' economic sustainability and equally important is farmers' social and mental sustainability. </p><p> We are sometimes led to believe that emissions reduction can only be achieved by reducing farming activity.  This type of messaging is incorrect and must stop.  The farm advisory service and various schemes, including the knowledge transfer scheme, the beef data genomics programme, BDGP, and the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, have all helped to engage farmers in a positive way and have led to emissions reductions.  Education, training and innovative industry projects have also played a significant role.  Macra na Feirme's Young Farmer Skillnet, for example, runs a successful young beef farmer sustainability programme that focuses on many of the farm practices that contribute positively to addressing climate change. </p><p> Macra na Feirme disagrees with recommendation No. 11 of the Citizens' Assembly report on a carbon tax on Irish agriculture.  It would be a blunt, counterproductive instrument, which would divert output to places where carbon emissions and costs per unit of food are higher.  Climate change is a global issue and must be considered in such a context.  Irish agriculture is exploring and developing proactive approaches to decreasing climate change impacts such as feeding strategies that maximise the efficiency of grass-based production systems, ICT in agriculture to aid delivery of sustainable intensification, improvements to animal health and welfare, sustainable land management that contributes to climate change mitigation and sustainable management of soil and forest carbon sinks. </p><p> Regarding the reform of the CAP, Macra na Feirme favours a move towards a combination of results based and management based payments as part of environmental and climate measures.  Results-based payments have many advantages, including directly linking payments to outcomes, achieving more specific goals, creating a common goal between farmers and conservationists and providing coherence in policy instruments at national and European level.  Future CAP measures must focus more on outcomes rather than being input driven and they must reward productive and less greenhouse gas intensive farming.</p><p> Macra na Feirme has commissioned research into the development of a framework for continuing professional development, CPD, in the agriculture sector.  Upskilling and developing human capital on climate change in the sector could return significant dividends.  Also, from an industry perspective, a significant number of solutions are possible.  Encouraging further research into the manufacturing process of fertilisers, for example, could yield significant improvements similar to those possible with the use of protected urea.</p><p> Young farmers are the new environmentalists, reducing their carbon emission through a range of scientific, technological and management advancements per unit of food produced.  Most importantly, whatever route is chosen, young farmers need a just transition period.  Ensuring that farmers have adequate time and funding to reduce their emissions without sacrificing the rural population and rural economy is vital and should be the focus of this committee.  To that end, a tax on agricultural production would actively draw funds and resources from those who need to be supported to reduce their emissions intensity.  Support, engagement and encouragement of our farming community to address climate change will deliver greater dividends for the environment and the people who live in our communities.</p></speech>

At the outset, I must say that it is disappointing that there are so few committee members here given that agriculture plays such a significant role in the context of climate change.  Agriculture is also the largest indigenous industry in the country.</p> <p>  We have had a long meeting today and the session before this was mainly focused on communication.  How should Macra na Feirme and similar organisations go about communicating the message on climate change within the sector?  In my opinion, the BDGP is one of the best initiatives in the context of climate change but only 50% of farmers joined that scheme.  How could we improve communications in the agriculture sector in order to increase the take up of schemes such as the BDGP?</p></speech>

We must ensure that the information that is available to farmers, which is plentiful and comes from a multitude of sources, is presented in a way that farmers can digest and understand.  A good example in the area of clean water is the asset programme that is currently under way.  Under that programme, 190 catchments have been chosen and various State bodies are coming together to consider possible sources of water pollution and are working with farmers on a one-to-one basis.  They are advising them and providing them with information but are presenting that information in an understandable fashion.  Farmers then have a choice as to whether to use that information.  I also referred earlier to our young beef farmers sustainability programme.  This is a 15-module programme delivered through Skillnet that has been running for the last two years.  Each year we have taken 15 of the best young beef farmers in the country and have tried to broaden their horizons and open their eyes to many of the advancements that are possible within the beef sector, including the genetic merit of herds, soil fertilisation, grass management and other measures that can play a positive role in reducing the carbon footprint of beef.  The Irish beef sector is the fifth lowest in Europe in terms of carbon intensity.  These two programmes are examples of how we could roll out some of the messages that we need to roll out to farmers.</p> <p>  Generational renewal also plays into this.</p><p>Deputy Sherlock referred to a cohort of young farmers who are more willing to take on the available advances in technology and advice.  It is about giving those young farmers the opportunity to get onto the first step of the ladder and make the most of this advice and advancements.</p></speech>

They are also the farmers of tomorrow.  We are locked into a carbon compliance regime over the next decade or so.  Currently, we are way off target according to some recent reports, even though some of our sectors are the most efficient in Europe, such as dairying and beef which is the fifth most efficient.</p> <p>  How does Mr. Healy believe the rise in emissions should be addressed?  A year ago, the Oireachtas agriculture committee produced a report on climate change to which Macra na Feirme contributed.  One of its recommendations was that Food Wise 2025 targets should be reviewed.  In view of increasing emissions and the Food Wise 2025 targets, how does Mr. Healy believe these could be balanced to get a reasonable and suitable future?</p></speech>

Farmers are dependent on the environment to give them the tools to produce foodstuffs.  There are many advances which could be used to address the rise in the emissions without necessarily changing the targets in Food Wise 2025.  Many of the mitigation tools, such as the Teagasc MACC, offer significant advances which can be made without necessarily hindering the increased intensification of Irish agriculture.</p></speech>

We need to step up what we are doing on the other side to ensure we are meeting our environmental targets.  While the production targets are not a problem, we need to ensure Irish farmers make the most of all the abatement tools available.  For example, changing the type of fertiliser used can bring about significant savings.  I referred to the use of protected urea in my opening statement.  Farmers continue to use calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN, instead of changing to protected urea, which is a more effective way of spreading nitrogen on soil, for some reason.</p> <p> There are 14 suggestions as to how farmers can improve their carbon intensification in the Teagasc MACC.  We need to go down each of these roads before considering changing the targets in Food Wise 2025.</p></speech>

There needs to be more carrot than stick.  As the environmentalists of the future, how can farmers be incentivised to construct wind and solar farms, as well as become more involved in the development of anaerobic digesters?</p></speech>

It has to be worthwhile for farmers, as well as for a community, which wants to go down the route of taking up the renewable energy challenge.  Wind farms are providing a return for those investing in them.  Several years ago, our national conference visited a farmer in Limerick who had set up two anaerobic digesters when there was a special grant available for investing in them.  He told us that if he did not have that grant in the initial stages, his anaerobic digesters would not have provided a return.  Considering this grant is no longer available and there is no adequate tariff for selling electricity back to the grid, anaerobic digesters will not provide a return on investment.</p> <p>  One recommendation from the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly concerns selling electricity back to the grid.  If there were an economic return from renewable energy, community-based projects would have a much stronger chance of succeeding rather than one-off investors.  If our local communities feel they have ownership of a project, they are much more likely to succeed.  The way policy is shaped, however, does not make it easy for groups to establish renewable energy projects.</p></speech>

After dairying, it is the most profitable agricultural sector.  Will agroforestry have a part to play in the future?  How could it be sold as being mutually beneficial to some farmers in the east?  There has been much negativity towards agroforestry in the west.  In order for that balance to be created, should farmers in the east be able to buy into planting a certain amount of forestry in order to gain from an income and sequestration point of view?</p></speech>

Macra na Feirme is in favour of agroforestry.  It has become a dirty word in some parts of the country.  One wants to avoid agroforestry being accused of destroying communities.</p> <p>  Agroforestry is attractive to young farmers and would deal with the large spruce plantations which some argue have taken over parts of the country.  Agroforestry involves planting native hardwoods, which should be encouraged.  As part of a survey for our CAP 2020 proposals, we found 56% of respondents indicated they would be willing to assign 1 ha of their farm towards agroforestry.  It comes back again to ensuring there is a sustainable return beyond the first 15 years.</p></speech>

Mr. Healy referred briefly to this in his opening statement.  Could he tease it out a little more and put a little more flesh on the bones?  How does he think CAP reform could play a significant role going forward in making not alone agriculture but also climate change sustainable?</p> <p>  Mr. Healy mentioned carbon tax in his opening statement.  My final question is what would Macra na Feirme's response be to the fee-and-dividend model, whereby revenue from the carbon tax is recycled to householders, with the potential for greater payments for rural communities?  He mentioned a few minutes ago rural communities from the point of view of renewable energy.  What attitude would Macra na Feirme have in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#WW00200"><p>I might answer the Deputy's first question and then get some clarification on the second.  Regarding the Common Agricultural Policy, the eco schemes related to the greening element of the payment are not very applicable to this country.  We would say there should be an advancement on the requirements within that element of the payment, but it needs to go down the road of being results-based rather than being a list of actions that a farmer needs to take.  Taking this from the point of view of climate action, we are the only country in the world that records carbon footprint on a farm-by-farm basis, which gives us a great starting point to show the improvement that can be made on individual farms.  If one tracks the initiatives being led in the IFA smart farming project that it does in conjunction with the EPA, it shows that major improvements can be made on farms.  From a Macra na Feirme point of view, therefore, whatever the scheme might be, it needs to be results-based and more targeted on the results we want to achieve.</p> <p>  To respond to the Deputy's second question, he referred to carbon tax.  That is just the carbon tax that is currently there.  As I mentioned, we need to support people to make the changes that need to be made in whatever section, be it residential or industry.  We need to ensure we do not prevent people from making the changes that need to be made to improve our greenhouse gas emissions.  From a farming point of view, this means a big carrot and a small stick, rather than a big stick and a small carrot.  When the Deputy mentions residential and rural communities, the same applies.  If we are to increase carbon taxes, we need to provide incentives.  This may go down the route of advice.  I know there was a lot of discussion on the last panel about communication with society.  More being put back into helping people to take the right steps and move in the right direction can only be seen as positive.</p></speech>

There has been much comment in the committee, in particular earlier today, on the knowledge and the role of youth regarding this topic.  The idea of Macra na Feirme's membership is the youth of a sector that is very heavily involved in it.  It is a great advantage and very important to the committee that Macra na Feirme has come before it.  It is said that the best wine is kept until last.  The witnesses are the last contributors, and when we sit down to write a report, often what one hears last is what is most prominent in one's mind.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  Macra na Feirme is a national organisation representing the agriculture sector but more so the youth and the younger generations.  Mr. Healy mentioned in his statement that we did not have an industrial revolution as such and that this perhaps exaggerates somewhat the percentage of agriculture's inputs to climate change.  I have read and heard this in every contribution that has been made by a farming body to both this committee and the agriculture committee but I do not think I have ever heard it or witnessed it being highlighted outside of this forum, this bubble.</p><p>Are farmers, farming bodies and farmer organisations communicating well enough with society in general?  I am not trying to portray a regime of making excuses, but I do not think the message, that is, the positives that have been done, is being communicated.  Mr. Healy made the point that we did not have an industrial revolution and that our agricultural emissions will therefore always constitute a higher percentage.  Other sectors point the finger at agriculture, and the agriculture sector then goes onto the back foot, into denial and into defence.  Could a better communication system within the sector be a start - as I said, not an excuse or a get-out - to working our way towards achieving a solution collectively?  With this in mind, Macra na Feirme represents the young, educated farmers.  Within this education system and the achievement of the green cert, is the scientific backup efficient?  Is there the knowledge within the agricultural education sector that needs to be passed on to young farmers when they receive their green certs when they are in that education system?  Is the scientific know-how there afterwards, be it in an advisory capacity or whatever else?  The solutions to these farming problems are through science.  Is the know-how and the technical backup for Macra na Feirme's young members available?</p><p> Macra represents the entire country.  Within discussions among its members, what kind of diversification is evident geographically?  What is ahead of a farmer in the Golden Vale and what is ahead of a farmer in the north west, north midlands or west are different.  They are two completely different planets, let alone two different sections of the country, and their problems and the potential solutions to those problems are miles apart.  How are Macra na Feirme's members interacting in this regard?  Is there unison or does the fellow in the north west, whenever forestry is mentioned, say he will not be the solution to the problems of the big dairy farmer in the Golden Vale?  Mr. Healy knows where I am coming from.</p></speech>

As farm organisations, we probably were behind the curve when it came to ensuring that our message got out there.  We are improving on this.  I was listening to the radio earlier today, around lunchtime, and there was a discussion about climate change.  One of our members dialled in to the radio show and gave a very eloquent and understandable explanation of the farming side of things.  It is about making spokespersons and advocates of all our members, not just me or Mr. Dillon.  It must be all farmers.  Taking society as a whole, all young people, no matter what they choose to be, can advocate for the environment, animal welfare or clean water.  They can support whatever has taken their hearts as something they wish to do, whether over social media or through written or various other methods.  We as a farm organisation need to get ahead again and ensure that our members are armed with the information and the ability to get the farming message across.  This comes back to better use of all the technologies that are out there.</p> <p>  Regarding the green cert, and having gone through the process myself only recently, the content is certainly there and contained within it.  Moreover, there has been a recent curriculum change to advance it even further.</p><p>The people educating our young farmers in our Teagasc colleges certainly have a love of agriculture but they also have an understanding of where it is going, the challenges facing it and the message they need to get across to our young farmers and what they need to instil in them.</p><p> I could not speak on the need for advisers on the ground once one leaves agricultural college but any of the Teagasc staff with whom Mr. Dillon or I interact have much scientific knowledge, be it the animal specialists, fertiliser specialists or any of the sector specialists.  It comes back to what I said about getting it into a format a farmer can digest and use so they can take it at their own speed and break it down and then over time they can implement the actions that are included on it.</p><p> On the final question, we are going around the country doing more consultations on our CAP strategic plan proposal.  Some of the divergence that has been mentioned between various parts of the country has come up in those consultations but young farmers in the eastern part of the country in particular have more of an understanding than those in other parts of the country such as the parts of the north west and parts of Cork that have a large number of trees planted that we need a more unified farming industry because, for example, dairy farmers cannot survive without beef farmers to rear their calves and they need tillage farmers to grow the grain that will feed their cows.  The same goes for beef farmers and all farmers.  All sectors need each other and there is more of an understanding there among young farmers on what could be considered the better land in the country that we cannot expect one area of the country to carry all of the weight when it comes to climate change.</p></speech>

The contribution in response to questions has been much better than the written statement because much of the written statement is basically the same as what the IFA and everybody else has said and it is really depressing to read it to tell the truth because there is no acknowledgement of the facts or of the reality of the situation which the witnesses are getting to in their responses to questions, which is welcome.</p> <p>  I refer to Food Wise 2025.  Meeting the requirements of Food Wise 2025 and meeting the climate change requirements are not compatible but I would like to see Macra na Feirme outline how it sees that they are compatible.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the Teagasc report and how urea fertiliser and forestry can mitigate climate change but are any of those improvements being made?  The tone of what the witnesses are saying is that they can help if we do it but we are not doing it.  Why is that?  Is it about payments or the Common Agricultural Policy?</p> <p>  I totally agree with what the witnesses said about renewables, that makes perfect sense.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#YY00300"><p>We can only fit so much into a five minute statement but I have often said that Ireland has never had an industrial revolution and does not have heavy industry and while agriculture currently accounts for 33% of Ireland's carbon emissions, if we do not take any further steps to improve that position then it will become 40% or 50% as other sectors improve their situation.</p><p>We certainly do not want to get to a point where agriculture is sticking out like a sore thumb as not having taken any steps forward.  It would be false to say however, that nothing is being done at the moment.  By way of comparison with the national mitigation action plan, the carbon emissions from agriculture peaked in 1998 and have been decreasing since until quite recently.  When the quota was removed in particular, it started to go in the other direction but that has coincided with a recognition that steps need to be taken to improve the situation.  Many of the actions I have mentioned are being carried out by certain farmers and the IFA smart farming programme has shown that they can work but I accept that we need to do more of what we are doing already and it needs to be implemented more widely with all farmers.</p><p> The Food Wise 2025 targets are not necessarily related to how much we are producing, it is the value of that product and I do not see why the value of the product we are producing cannot increase and account for much of the work in meeting those targets.  Over the last two years we saw that there were large increases in the value of Irish exports, particularly in 2017.  I saw earlier in the week that the value of Irish exports fell back in 2018 but that was almost solely based on the fact the foreign exchange rates led to a fall in the value of the Irish product which reversed the trend in the value of Irish exports.  Much of the work in hitting the Food Wise 2025 targets will come from adding value to the produce, whether that is dairy, beef or tillage, and making sure that we are selling to export markets that put a premium on Irish produce.</p></speech>

I return to the mitigation measures of forestry and urea that Mr. Healy was talking about.  He said some of that is happening now but more of it needs to happen.  What are the barriers to making more of that happen?</p></speech>

Lime is a fertiliser that allows for better utilisation of all the other fertilisers, minerals and elements that are in the soil.  That trend has reversed through an intense focus on the scientific value and the soil value for spreading lime so that instead of 10%, we now have 30% of soils at the correct pH for grass growth.  We will not be able to cover all of these abatement improvements at the same time but it is about picking the low hanging fruit and the ones that will get us the greatest improvement in the shortest amount of time and putting a similar focus on those as we have done with the spreading of lime over recent years.  That is how we create that culture change among farmers which is needed to get them to avail of those scientific advances.</p> <p>  Incentives could be put in place to take advantage of some of those.  We have made a proposal on sexed semen in our pre-budget submission.  Sexed semen is more expensive than conventional semen but if the use of same were incentivised in agriculture, it would mean that fewer cattle would have to be bred for dairy farmers to produce the replacement heifers they would need for their dairy herds.  They would have to breed fewer animals and the other animals could be bred as bulls for the beef industry.  It would amount to more efficient use of the animals that are already there.</p><p>Given last year's drought, we have probably seen a slight tail-off in the increase in animal numbers.  It is about incentivising and the BDGP mentioned by Deputy Deering is an excellent example of this.  It is about improving the genetic merit of the animals in our herds.  The improvements made through the scheme are being mirrored through the availability of information from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, which is leading the way in giving information to farmers that will allow them to make the right choices.</p></speech>

None of us likes change.  A large cohort of the farming population farmed in a different era with a different farming philosophy and a different focus.  The 7% of our farmers who are under 35 have gone through an education and knowledge transfer system that focuses more on the environment and is more climate conscious.  It links farming activity to the environment.  We will see change but it will take time.  It is difficult for farmers who are used to particular management practices on farms to change the habit of a lifetime.  If we can link environmental change and environmental benefits to efficiencies on farms and profitability for the farmers, it will be a win-win.  This will happen if we can show farmers there is a win for them in terms of profitability and sustainability as well as a win for the environment.  They will see a positive correlation between management practice, the benefit to them and the benefit with regard to climate change from the perception of Irish agriculture but it will take time.</p></speech>

Some of the abatement incentives include a monetary value to the farmer but it is about showing this.  Others cost the farmers money and perhaps they need to be incentivised.  A chunk of them will save the farmers money and improve their profit.  It is about showing this to the farmers.  Certainly this is where the one-to-one advice I mentioned earlier might come into it, whereby a Teagasc or other agricultural adviser spells out the improvements that can be made.</p></speech>

This has to be where we are going and for farming it is the only future.  It is the only really viable future not just because we all rely on the environment, particularly farmers, but because of the prospect of reducing costs.  It is about the prospect of having more diverse income streams, not just from a variety of crops and food income streams, which is one of the directions we need to go in, but also from agroforestry and tourism.  I see it from the point of view of training a new generation of farmers coming in.  Designing the new CAP around diverse and higher farming income and more environmentally sustainable farming is the only future for Irish farming.  To be perfectly honest, the current system does not deliver.  Do the witnesses believe the current system is working for young Irish farmers?  There is terrible fear and people are told not to listen to the Green Party and not to change Irish farming, as if it is great, but only 7% of Irish farmers are under 35.  It is a job where it helps to be young.  Is the current system working?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.205" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#BBB00600"><p>If we look simply at the age demographic of Irish farming there have been some small improvements in recent years.  The most recent CAP, which provided a top-up for young farmers, was certainly a step in the right direction but there are more challenges than what is coming through the CAP.  To be fair, in this country a value is definitely placed on young farmers and creating generational change.  The biggest challenge that faces many young farmers is access to land.  As Mr. Dillon mentioned, we have a huge cohort of farmers in their 60s, 70s and 80s who have known nothing else.  There is a fear that if they hand over the farm, whether to a son, nephew, daughter, niece or complete stranger, they have nothing left and no security for themselves.  As Mr. Dillon mentioned, there is a fear of change and the unknown.  A step we have taken in this direction is the land mobility service.  Older farmers who put themselves forward as people who want to take a step back or retire are matched with a suitable younger farmer with whom they can farm in partnership, lease the farm or work together.  It creates a link, trust and transition.  This is one measure we have taken to try to address access to land, which is the main issue for young farmers.  The CAP has gone some way to helping.  Something we have proposed for the next CAP is support for schemes such as this, which helped create the transition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#BBB00700"><p>I agree fully with Mr. Healy.  It is exactly the type of scheme and initiative we need to open up access to land and provide securities and other mechanisms to do so.  John Gummer, Lord Deben, the former UK environment Minister, now chairman of its climate committee, and farmer speaks very authoritatively on farming.  It is interesting to listen to him.</p><p>He said the UK opted for an industrialised, intensive farming system and is now rapidly retreating, not just because it realises that system does not work in terms of profitability.  The banks and everyone else benefit but the farmer does not in the end.  The farmers end up indentured to a very intensive system.  The soil and environment are shot and the UK actually has to go back to where we are, which is to smaller, family-based, less-intensive farms.  It is similar in New Zealand.  It opted for mass intensification.  It has land very similar to ours and has some similar social characteristics.  It is rapidly retreating because its water is gone.</p><p> Reference was made to what we value.  When I listen to Teagasc and, I hate to say, the farming organisations, and certainly the Department and the Minister, I realise they are all about intensification and rapidly trying to get to where England is and where New Zealand went.  I am pulling my hair out in the belief we should not do this because those countries are coming back towards us.  Why would we not stay where we are?</p><p> Let me outline why I asked whether the system is working.  We have to look at this from a rural development perspective.  I have always believed Macra na Feirme recognises the importance of community, getting farmers working together in a parish, working collectively and having a rural community.  Not only is the intensification model destroying the water, wrecking the soil and creating a system of indentured farming that is good for big business but not for the small Irish family farm, it is also failing to protect rural communities.  While we need to give young farmers access to land, do we not need to go a little further and shift away from the concept of achieving growth at all costs and having ever-greater intensification, which is all about the processors doing well and big industrial plcs calling all the shots and running things, which is where we are going?  I do not want to name names here but we all know who we are talking about.  Does Macra na Feirme, as a community organisation, not believe the shift needs to happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.208" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#CCC00200"><p>May I address the first question and lead on to the second?  The change in the farming demographic is much greater in dairy farming because it is a profitable sector.  I mentioned earlier creating greater value for the produce Irish farmers produce.  The beef sector might be producing a slim profit but, more than likely, 90% of beef farmers in Ireland are depending on the single farm payment to live.  The tillage sector has been reasonably good this year but has experienced much lower yields because of the conditions last year.  With regard to the horticulture sector, I cannot imagine what it would be like to see a kilogram of my carrots that I put my heart and soul into producing being sold for 49 cent in a shop.  We need to place more value on the food we are producing.  It is important that there be a secure food source for the populations of Ireland and the rest of Europe, which is why the Common Agricultural Policy exists, but we need to realise that, in 1970, consumers were spending 30% of their income on food and that this proportion is now down to 10%.  This is with much improved production processes, improvements to animal welfare, etc.  Scale is important for some farmers because it is the only way they can make a full-time living.</p> <p>  In our organisation, we ask whether a farmer with 100 cows would be better off with that number and operating extremely well, perhaps working alone, which might involve a small bit of labour from time to time, or whether he would be better off with 200, thus having to bring in extra labour and all that comes with it.  We are examining this.  This relates to the question the Deputy asked.  We certainly value the Irish family farm model but we must ask whether the Irish farmer is getting the correct reward for this.</p> <p>  With regard to climate action, 40% of the carbon attributed to food production, depending on the product, is associated with the waste of the product.</p><p>One could eliminate this.  I am not a science expert, but the figure is based on a study carried out by a Dutch university that Mr. Dillon and I saw when in Brussels.  The food waste element amounted to the equivalent of the production element of the food's lifecycle because we were throwing away so much.  That is where it might come back-----</p></speech>

The 400 cow farms we often see on arable land could switch the whole country over.  What sort of countryside would it create?  However, it is not just a matter of the limit.  We cannot opt for a Food Wise strategy that sees an increase in emissions, which is where we are going.  Environmentally, that is not on; we have to cut our emissions.  Even with all of the changes concerning ammonia, urea and lime, Teagasc is still projecting increases in emissions.  This has to change.  In making the change the environmentalists are the delegates' best ally because there are no better people to say it is wrong that carrots are being sold for 49 cent per kilogramme and to help to create a culture in which farmers have a better income in an environment in which we are reducing our emissions.</p> <p>  Deputy Deering asked about the carbon tax.  We have to be careful not to mix up the taxes.  There is a carbon tax on the general economy, which is currently &euro;20 per tonne, but that is a separate issue.  As we raise that tax, I grant absolutely that we have to look after rural areas by retrofitting rural houses first and investing in public transport for rural areas and so on, but I understood the tax Professor Alan Matthews was considering in his presentation to the Citizens' Assembly was much more specific.  It is a tax on the consumption of meat and cheese.  I envisage great benefits in reducing waste and it would not be the farmer who would take the cut but the retailers, processors and consumers.  If we could be certain that the carbon tax on the consumption of meat and dairy would not be taken from the farmers' share which needs to rise and that the revenue generated would go back into farm incomes, resulting in a net gain for the farming community, as proposed by Professor Matthews, and if we could devise a mechanism whereby the power relations in Irish agriculture changed in order that the farmer would not just be the price-taker taking the hit, would it not help rural development and farming?</p></speech>

If it could be guaranteed, it could very well have a positive impact but not being an economist, I do not know whether it is possible to have such a scheme.  On the placing of a carbon tax on agriculture, Mr. Colm McCarthy had an interesting piece in last week's <i>Irish</i><i>Farmers Journal</i>related to a point made in my presentation, namely, that climate action and climate change represented a global challenge.  We are producing the most carbon-friendly dairy and pork and, to my surprise, tillage produce, certainly in Europe, if not the world.  I cannot see the benefits of displacing production in Ireland-----</p></speech>

It was very useful.  Mr. Healy will remember that when Professor Sweeney was asked the question, he said every country, no matter how efficient,had to face up to the scale of the change required and the challenges posed in that regard.</p><p>Countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Australia will burn in a climate change world.  It is as if we are just living in a world as it is, and it is a case of us being more efficient than someone else.  Everyone will have to be engaged and everyone will have to reduce.  To be perfectly honest, as an environmentalist I do not buy the idea that we can expand because we are more efficient.</p><p> I am a great fan of anaerobic digestion, but I am nervous about what I see in Food Wise 2025, namely, a significant increase in poultry and pork production.  That was mentioned by the witnesses.  In Northern Ireland there has been an incredible boom in pig numbers.  They now have enough pigs to provide sewage equivalent to that from 12 million people.  That is the level of industrial output that is planned in that sector.  The anaerobic digestion systems come from America where there is an indentured agricultural system with the poor farmer who has a pig lot being on a minimal margin and often in a very precarious position.  If there is an outbreak of flu or anything else happens, the pig farmers are the ones who get hit.  Even though anaerobic digestion is green in the sense that one gets an energy crop, there are digestive problems and water problems.  In parts of the North we are seeing the water and other systems being trashed under the guise of doing a good or green thing.</p><p> I fear that UCC, Teagasc and others are pitching this here as part of a more industrial expansionary approach to agriculture.  They are putting a green label on it by saying anaerobic digestion is attached to it.  I would love to see local farmers coming together on a collaborative basis, but I fear it would end up as big industry.  Farmers would plough material into a big processing system that is the furthest from green.  I wanted to flag that issue.  We need to do research on that before we leap into an expansion of anaerobic digestion.  It could be sold as a green thing but it would be an industrial farming system in the guise of a green approach from which farmers would not necessarily benefit.</p><p> We should encourage more research on carbon tax to guarantee protection for the farming community.  We need to change the power relations, which is what the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and others are saying we need to do anyway.  That might be something on which we will need to do further research.</p></speech>

I know the Commission is looking at it on a European level to try to address it, but before we do anything else we must address the position of farmers within the food supply chain, because any further taxation is just going to be passed back to the farmer.  It is a fallacy to think that the consumer, processor or retailer will take that on.  Unfortunately, it will be the farmer who will get hit.</p></speech>

I appreciate their contribution.  Mr. Healy said in his presentation that grassland is not a currently accepted mode of carbon sequestration for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control, IPCC.  From my understanding, Ireland reports all emissions and sequestration to the IPCC, including from grassland.  The emissions sequestration must be accounted for in our 2030 EU non-traded sector targets as part of the EU nationally determined contribution to the Paris Agreement.  I would welcome a comment from him on that point.</p> <p>  The committee has heard from a range of sources about the importance of farmers getting the right incentives to reduce emissions.  The submission referred to the same theme, namely, seeking to link payments to outcomes.  What proposals do the witnesses have on how to make this happen in the overall sense?</p> <p>  Following on from what Deputy Eamon Ryan said about New Zealand, have the witnesses looked at what is happening there with regard to the inclusion of agriculture in their emissions trading scheme?  Given the economic challenges faced by beef producers, what are the views of the witnesses on the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly that we should support diversification?</p><p> What is the view of the witnesses, as young farmers and, as they said themselves, as environmentalists, on diversification?  What diversification mechanisms do they envisage for the young farmer in the future?  How can we expand our range and do things better?  Ireland is an island nation.  It is a great country for growing crops.  We should always look for a premium price because of the quality of what we can potentially produce.  I would welcome some comments on what is envisaged in terms of diversification.</p></speech>

We will check the position on grassland sequestration.  Things advance and changes may have happened since we first checked the position.</p> <p>  New Zealand was a topic of discussion at our recent committee meeting in terms of trading and the various things farmers could do to diversify such as renewable energy or solar panels.  If farmers were able to sell electricity back into the grid, it would provide some opportunity for diversification.  The credit for the reduction in carbon emissions would go to the energy sector as opposed to agriculture.  I do not know enough about the situation in New Zealand to give a good response but the situation should be examined to ensure that agriculture receives the credit it deserves for any improvements that are made by farmers or the industry.</p> <p>  In terms of results-based schemes, we are the only country in the world that is measuring the carbon footprint of farms with the carbon navigator.  That provides a fantastic basis for a results-based scheme where a benchmark can be set and the improvement coming from the steps a farmer has taken can be seen.  That comes back to including farmers in the design of schemes.  A Pillar 2 or rural development programme scheme that has been a great success is the Burren Beo scheme.  Farmers were involved in the development of the scheme and their knowledge and experience was acknowledged, but the scheme also achieves the results.  Benefits are provided for the farmer but the scheme also provides the benefits that were sought in other areas.  It is about working together and making a collaborative effort that could point us in the right direction when it comes to some of the improvements that were mentioned.</p></speech>

I commend Mr. Healy on showing there is a positive aspect to farming for the younger generation and ensuring that we have a workforce going forward.  We are all aware that labour is a scarce commodity in the agriculture sector.  I have listened to the questions asked by other members and I heard an interesting point Mr. Healy made that was not picked up.  I can see where he is coming from.</p><p>Outside of transport, agriculture seems to be the next sector hit in this country for carbon and climatic change issues.  We are considered a non-industrialised nation.  Britain had an industrial revolution in the 1800s and 1900s and there was growth in the likes of Germany.  Are we now in a situation, as a country, whereby we have to carry an extra burden to clean up the damage that has been caused?  Do we actually carry a heavier burden in cleaning up the air for the sake of other countries that created the problem, and continue to do so?  That is a good point.</p><p> We are going down the road of imposing further conditions on farming practices and so forth.  Are we being the extra good boys again in the EU family compared to the Dutch, Danish or French farmers?  Are we once again leading the pack in putting in stringent conditions about going forward in our farming practices?  That is where we are at the moment.  Bigger penalties are coming on to us straight away, when other countries might not be carrying out the same guidelines as regards climatic change.</p><p> Would the witnesses further comment on their views on anaerobic digesters?  I ask for further comment because I was disappointed to hear Deputy Eamon Ryan does not think they were a good solution for creating green energy.  He is saying they are going to create more damage.  My understanding about anaerobic digesters was that they were there to reduce the spillage of liquid manure into lands and produce green energy.  I ask for further comment on that.  Are the witnesses happy with the Government's plan?  I know from people going abroad that, in Germany for example, nearly every farmer has his own anaerobic digester, no matter what size the farm.  Half of those farmers' work day was keeping the thing going.  I asked the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, what was his plan for Ireland and he said, in the grand system, it would not be viable to put an anaerobic digester in every farmer's yard.  That is why the current Government has proposed regionalisation for anaerobic digestion.  I do not know is it every parish or what catchment area applies.  Is Macra na Feirme happy enough with the general policy as to the delivery of these projects?</p><p> Everyone is telling us what to do.  The Chairman should also be aware that climate change means the climate is changing in the seasons.  Should we not be reviewing practices as well?  We had to wait until last Sunday before the tractor and tank could go back out in the field.  Should we go back to the situation of giving trust back to the farmer?  There was livestock out around me on Christmas Day because the grass was growing.  Should we go back and let the farmers, who are the keepers of the land, know how to practise proper farming?  Are there any areas we should be reviewing?</p><p> We spoke about young farmers getting involved and taking over land.  What incentives would Macra na Feirme propose for older people?  We do not want to push them off the land.  There was a farm retirement scheme at one stage and I do not think it was attractive from a monetary point of view.  I do not know if it worked.  There are 50 year old farmers whose fathers are still the bosses on the farm, or if not the bosses, the deeds in the solicitor's office are in the father's name.  I thank the witnesses for their time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.226" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#GGG00200"><p>The same targets are in place for every country and agriculture has to face the targets that are ahead of it.</p><p>We need to recognise that agriculture is sometimes unfairly tarnished in Ireland, relative to other European countries, and people do not understand the full story as to why in France or Germany, or elsewhere in mainland Europe, agriculture may only be 10% of the carbon emissions when it is 33% or 35% here.  The targets are there, the percentage is the same and, because of the size of our industry, those targets are probably fair enough.  We certainly need to get across the message that Ireland is not an agricultural carbon blackguard just because it is at 33%.  We need to ensure that society at large understands the full context of the situation.</p><p> Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned the point where anaerobic digesters have capacity far above and beyond what could possibly be used by the anaerobic digesters that are there and that is a situation we do not want.  We do not want to have enough for 12 million people in an area with a population of 1.5 million or 2 million.  That seems a step beyond what is required.  Anaerobic digesters certainly have a role to play even in the positive impact they can have from an agricultural slurry point of view.  They make the nitrogen in the effluent more usable and available for the soil afterwards.  That is a positive I had not mentioned earlier.  Irish farms do not have the scale to have an anaerobic digester on every farm but certainly, as we mentioned in our presentation, community based schemes and the set up of co-operatives within communities to allow them to share in the benefits of having an anaerobic digester in an area may help to overcome some of the planning objections and give the local community a sense of ownership of the project.  Once there is a REFIT tariff that makes it economically viable for the farmer, it can be beneficial to all.</p><p> I agree with what was said about the issue of calendar farming.  We had super weeks at the start of January but we could not spread slurry and maybe we need to change.  There is a reason for calendar farming in that the scientific evidence shows that slurry does not need to be spread when the grass is not growing but, if the grass is growing at the end of December and the start of January, maybe we should be able to spread then.  By the same token, if the scientific evidence shows that, if there is a cold spell at the beginning of March, as there was last year, then we can swap the three weeks of spreading in December and January because the grass was growing and agree not to spread in the three weeks of sub-zero temperatures in March.  The scientific evidence is there to show that it will not be a positive for our water quality if we are spreading slurry at unsuitable times of the year but we can use that same scientific basis to have a bit of flexibility within the system to allow farmers spread more responsibly.</p><p> The farm retirement scheme worked for the number of years that it was in place.  There was a considerable change in the average age of farmers and in the age of farmers who were actually farming the farm.  A scheme that expected farmers to retire at the age of 55 was probably not going to work in the long term.  From the point of view of Macra na Feirme, something that is coming out of our consultations on the next Common Agricultural Policy at the moment is a retirement scheme, not necessarily an early retirement scheme, but simply a retirement scheme that would provide some security for the older farmer once they have handed over the land and control of the farm to the younger farmer.</p><p>Certainly, that could be something positive to be included in the next Common Agricultural Policy.</p></speech>

For example, public servants can now work until they are 70.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.230" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019011600002#JJJ00300"><p>My response to that is that a major point in favour of something like a retirement scheme is farm safety.  While younger farmers are no less likely to be involved in a farm accident than older farmers, the fatality statistics show that if an older farmer is involved in a farm accident, he or she is much more likely to die.  It is probably a result of the fact that a farmer at 30, 35 or 45, has that extra yard of pace and extra half second of reaction time that he or she may not have when he or she hits 70, 75 or 80, and a situation that the farmer could have got himself or herself out of when young, he or she is not able to get himself or herself out of anymore.  Just as the middle of the day is not a suitable time to have children on the farm, I know of no builder at 70 carrying a hod or laying blocks.  Farming is equally as manually intensive a profession as something like building.  They do not have to retire, but certainly they should have the option.  Farming, depending on the sector one is in, being more or less profitable, does not always give farmers the option of putting away a nice pension that they can rely on after the age of 65 or, as it will be by the time I get there, 70.</p></speech>

I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones because their interference affects the quality of the sound recording.  The committee will proceed in public session before moving to private session after our meeting with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, or in a break which we may have during our meeting with the Minister, depending on time.</p><p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, who is accompanied by Mr. John McCarthy, assistant secretary at the Department of Finance, Mr. Brendan O'Leary, assistant principal at the Department of Finance, Mr. Ronnie Downes, assistant secretary at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and Mr. John Kinnane, principal officer at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I thank the Minister for accommodating our request for an early meeting and I appreciate the work of his office in arranging it.  </p><p>The purpose of the meeting is to discuss some key issues, which I ask that we focus on due to time.  They are the committee's engagement on 15 December 2018 with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on its fiscal assessment report of November 2018, Brexit and the fiscal budgetary impact, and the committee's engagement on 11 December 2018 with the Department of Health on the issue of the significant overruns in the health budget.  On the final issue, we should note that we had requested a meeting with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but it was declined.  As I said, I ask members to try to stick to those three key areas in order that we can make the best use of time.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019011600002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it and discuss the matters it has raised.  On the outturn for 2018, for the first time in more than a decade our public finances are balanced in cash terms.  This is not an insignificant achievement given where we were only a few years ago.  The main budgetary metric for international purposes is the general Government balance, which will be reported by the CSO at the end of March.  Based on the Exchequer figures, however, a small general Government surplus is possible.  A small deficit of 0.1% was projected in the recent budget.  We are aiming, and believe we are likely, to deliver a surplus of 0.1%, which will represent an over-achievement of that target.</p> <p>  To achieve this Exchequer cash surplus, we used the 2018 revenue over-performance, although it was largely driven by corporation tax, as I have acknowledged.  This represents a positive development in reducing our overall debt burden as the day-to-day running of central Government is being met from within resources and we are not borrowing to fund these activities.</p><p>In 2019, current expenditure will grow by 3.9% compared with 2018.  In 2018, the equivalent growth compared to 2017 was 5.6%.  Much of this increase was driven by an overrun in the health sector.  If one excludes growth in health expenditure in the current area, total expenditure grew by 4.8% in 2018 compared to 2017.</p><p> Turning to the outlook for this year, in assessing our draft budgetary plan the European Commission, the body charged with formally assessing our compliance with the EU rule, has assessed budget 2019 as being compliant with the fiscal rules and has projected that we will achieve our medium-term budgetary objective this year.  However, this, of itself, does not represent grounds for complacency.  This is because our debt burden remains highly elevated at 105% of gross national income modified, GNI*, versus a comparable 87% for the euro area.  In that context, at budget time, my Department projected a balanced budget in headline terms, moving to a surplus thereafter.  However, given that the external economic outlook is deteriorating, the probability of a disorderly Brexit is rising and quantitative easing is ending, our policy approach should be to target larger surpluses to build up our budgetary buffers for when times become less favourable.</p><p> It is my intention to run budget surpluses into the future if the economy continues to perform strongly and to use them to reduce our national debt.  Furthermore, any windfall receipts that arise from the State reducing its involvement in the banking and financial sectors will also be used to pay down public debt.</p><p> A notable feature of smaller open economies is that they typically operate budget surpluses when operating close to potential.  This helps build up capacity for the future and helps allow steady improvements in public services.  This also runs the risk of increased funding being absorbed without risk of inflationary pressures and, furthermore, many of these countries enjoy a high stock of public infrastructure as investment is maintained.  Notwithstanding this, our public finances are moving in the right direction and this is testament to sound policies in recent years.  Our task, going forward, will be to continue to build on these hard won and difficult gains and to try to maintain stability and security in our public finances.</p><p> Some of the policies I have committed to implementing in this regard include the establishment of a rainy day fund.  In addition, by continuing to maintain a broad and stable tax base, I hope to ensure that the State continues to be financed properly.</p><p> The rate of VAT in the hospitality sector increased to 13.5% from this month.  This measure will allow us to reduce our over-reliance on increases in other tax heads, such as corporation tax, and allow the continued development of our tax base.</p><p> In recent years, different measures have represented a positive move in this direction.  In addition to the VAT change, measures include the introduction of USC and local property and sugar taxes.  These now fund 5.7% of overall Government revenue.  Furthermore, it is my intention to publish a set of proposals in the coming period to look at how we can further reduce our over-reliance on corporation tax.</p><p> At this point, I want to acknowledge the work of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on budget 2019, in terms of its assessment and endorsement of the macroeconomic forecasts underpinning the budget as well as for the analysis set out in the November 2018 Fiscal Assessment Report, FAR.  I welcome the observations of the council and I recognise its important role.  My response to the Fiscal Assessment Report will issue shortly and will be available on my Department's website and shared with the committee.</p><p> I acknowledge that I am in agreement with many of the points made by the council, including its assessment of the economy's strong performance to date as well as the key risks, mainly external in origin, it faces such as Brexit, rising trade protectionism and an evolving international tax environment.</p><p>One of the issues that arose at the meeting of the committee on 5 December with members of the fiscal council was the charge that my Department faces serious challenges predicting corporation tax receipts.  In fact, a widely recognised feature of our corporation tax base is its high concentration of receipts among a small number of firms, leaving this tax head much more exposed to specific developments.  A further complicating factor in forecasting this tax head is the budgetary timetable, which means that the second instalment of annual corporation tax does not fall until November, a full two months after the forecasts have been finalised.  </p><p> In addition, the Revenue Commissioners and my Department rely on information from companies about expected profitability, which can often be underestimated.  In a 2016 review of the challenges forecasting Irish corporation tax, the council indicated this is due to the concentration of receipts among a small number of firms, which mirrors our export sector.  IFAC has acknowledged that forecasting corporation tax has traditionally been difficult in Ireland.  The council tests a number of alternatives to my Department&rsquo;s methodology and these provide a slightly better outcome, although there is still a large variation versus forecast.  It concludes this suggests the importance of idiosyncratic developments in explaining annual movements in corporation tax</p><p> A second charge that was made at the meeting on 5 December was that budget 2019 was based on a relatively benign outcome for Brexit.  In chapter 6 of the economic and fiscal outlook document, however, alternative Brexit outcomes to the central scenario were explored.  The possibility of a no-deal Brexit has influenced policy decisions relating to our stated aim of balancing our national finances and investing in capital infrastructure.  This is also why I am adopting measures to build up our fiscal buffers to better ensure our economy can withstand the impact of possible future shocks.  By running a balanced budget this year and targeting budgetary surpluses beyond 2019, we are ensuring that we do not add to our elevated levels of public debt.</p><p> A third issue was the assertion that the medium-term spending projections lack credibility given the probability of expenditure overruns.  When preparing the expenditure allocations beyond 2019, the ceilings are prepared on a careful and contained basis, which maintains allocations across all spending Departments and which takes account of demographic factors in the areas of health, social protection and education.  In addition, the overall spending profiles include a separate, unallocated provision.  The amount is distributed across Departments in the context of the annual budget process, for example, in public service pay and pension agreements.  In adopting this approach to forecasting, my Department mitigates against the risk of simply restating ceilings and applying inflationary pressures, which would lead to expenditure baselines ratcheting ever upwards and pre-empt the space for better discussion of policy priorities.</p><p> I will give a brief overview of the outturn for 2018.  Total gross voted expenditure was just over &euro;63 billion, comprising &euro;57 billion in current expenditure and &euro;6 billion in capital expenditure, which is &euro;1.3 billion, or 2.1%, ahead of profile for the year.  Of the sum, &euro;1.1 billion and &euro;118 million relate to current and capital expenditure, respectively.  This is broadly in line with the projections for the year set out on budget day last October, when additional spending was announced for a number of areas, primarily health, housing and education.</p><p> These priorities are also reflected in the allocations for 2019, which were published in the Revised Estimates Volume last December.  This year, the Government has allocated a total of &euro;66.6 billion in gross voted expenditure, the vast majority of which is for day-to-day current expenditure, amounting to &euro;59.3 billion, with a further &euro;7 billion allocated to capital expenditure.</p><p>Funding for the key day-to-day public services of social protection, health and education together account for 80% of total gross voted current expenditure.  While the allocation for health for 2019 is more than &euro;17 billion, I am acutely aware, given the scale of this allocation, that over the past number of years, in particular 2018, overspends in this area have impacted on the overall resources available for public services.  With this in mind, there is ongoing engagement between my Department and the Department of Health on how we can best manage this expenditure and ensure that the provision of these additional resources is matched with increased levels of accountability and transparency in expenditure matters, in particular within the Health Service Executive, HSE.  Housing has also been prioritised for 2019, with an overall allocation of more than &euro;4 billion.  This represents a significant increase in year-on-year terms, in particular relating to capital expenditure, which has increased by one fifth.  The education allocation is up by 5%.</p><p> Looking at expenditure policy more broadly, the fiscal advisory review refers to the rapid pace of spending growth between 2015 and 2018 and notes this was largely driven by year-on-year increases in spending.  In assessing the council's criticism of recent expenditure policy, it should be noted that expenditure growth in the post-consolidation period has been significantly more modest than what was seen in the pre-consolidation period.  Between 2003 and 2008, gross voted expenditure increased by 63% whereas between 2014 and 2019 gross voted expenditure will have increased by 23% or just under 5% per annum.  We cannot take this for granted and I will continue to work hard to maintain a disciplined approach to the management of public spending.  If I were to listen to the many demands made from many different quarters, lobby groups and interest groups, all of whom raise legitimate interests on behalf of their members, and accede to even half of them, public expenditure would be significantly ahead of the rate to date.  We need to use this period of relative economic strength to be conscious of the great risk we face in Brexit and of the priorities ahead.</p><p> Returning to the higher than anticipated revenue generated in 2018 from corporation tax discussed earlier, these revenues are facilitating important Government initiatives, including support for capital investment.  Although there was a not insignificant once-off element to the increase in receipts in 2018, the over-performance also arose from a combination of enhanced trading conditions and increased product sales.  Corporate profitability has almost doubled since 2010 and experienced annual growth of just under 10% in 2017.  Capital expenditure can play an important role in our economy and is up by 24% this year to a total level of &euro;7.3 billion.  It is important to use the period of strength in corporation tax receipts to accelerate infrastructure investment in the areas in which it is most needed.  As far as expenditure management is concerned, the Government has a record of steady increases in support of the social and economic development of our country at much more sustainable levels than in the past.  Moreover, these planned increases are being delivered on budget and on time across virtually all areas of public expenditure.  I recognise that there are particular challenges and pressures within the health sector in which all practices are now being stepped up.</p><p> In conclusion, I am deeply aware of the growing challenge of Brexit.  I have outlined everything we have done to respond to that challenge to date.  Much of the commentary on our economy tends to fluctuate between the risk posed through overheating on the one hand and the challenges arising from Brexit on the other.  The context of all of this is, of course, the needs of our society and citizens.  As Minister for Finance, the best course of action open to me is to maintain stability in the public finances, build up our budgetary buffers for when times become even more difficult and balance our books.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I will focus on two issues in the time available.  The first is corporation tax, which the Minister addressed at length in his opening remarks.  The numbers are staggering with approximately &euro;10.4 billion in receipts in 2018.  To put that in context, the Government predicted in 2015 that receipts in 2018 would be in the region of &euro;5.5 billion.  It has almost doubled.  The report of Mr. Seamus Coffey in June 2017 stated corporation tax receipts could be expected to be sustainable over the medium term to 2020.  At the time he was working off the 2016 figures, which were approximately &euro;7.3 billion.  We are up 40% on even those numbers.  Given the growing dependence on the multinational sector and, in particular, on a small number of multinational companies to deliver these significant corporate tax receipts and the level of risk that poses to the public finances and the wider economy, is it time to review the sustainability of such receipts?  I ask the Minister not to rule that out immediately but to instead consider the need for a further updated report looking beyond 2020 and taking into account the recent boom in receipts to examine the sustainability of corporation tax receipts over the next five to ten years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019011600002#F00500"><p>We are looking at that very issue.  I outlined in my opening statement some of the difficulties we have from a timing point of view.  For the first time of which I am aware, I indicated at the end of last year that we do not believe the amount of the corporation tax collected for 2018 is sustainable.  We believe it is a one-off and that figure is &euro;700 million.  I am examining proposals on how to form a further view on the sustainability of corporation tax.  We have taken two actions to address that risk now.  First, we have built our tax forecasts for 2019 on the basis of a sum between &euro;900 million and &euro;1 billion lower than the amount collected in 2018.  Second, this risk is the key reason I decided to increase the VAT rate on the hospitality and service sector.  It is only through adopting such measures that we have a prospect of being able to reduce, in turn, our reliance on corporation tax in future.</p></speech>

It does not say whether it is the beginning or the end.  We are now in 2019 and there is a need to refresh that view and look again at sustainability over a longer term.  Will the Minister consider an independent report at arm's length from the Department of Finance?</p></speech>

I assure the Deputy that in my engagement with officials in the Department of Finance, it is clear that they are every bit as alive to the risks we face and they are able to provide an independent assessment of it.  I am conscious as I answer the Deputy that there is an institution which is independent of Government and which has a role in many of these matters, namely the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  However, I will consider his suggestion.</p></speech>

In recent times, has the Department carried out an assessment of the impact such an scenario would have on the economy - in the context of employment numbers, tax receipts and growth - in 2019 and 2020?  We have the paper from late 2016 that the Department produced in conjunction with the ESRI.  I am talking about the more immediate impact this year and next year on tax receipts, employment and economic growth.  Has the Department modelled that?  If so, will the findings be published?</p></speech>

In that analysis, we highlighted our best estimate of what a no-deal scenario would be.  It showed that the level of output in our economy would be approximately 3.25% lower after five years than would be the case in a no-Brexit scenario.  The analysis contains figures in terms of employment, outcomes and output.  The next point at which we would normally look at reviewing our forecast in the context of various risks would be in the stability programme update due in April.  However, since the Government and I published this work, a number of reviews were carried out in the United Kingdom in December.  These outline the UK authorities' most recent estimates of what would be the effect of the British economy if a no-deal scenario developed.  I have asked my officials to review those figures in order to see if we would be in a position to provide an update on the effect of a no-deal scenario beyond that which we have already outlined.  We have shared information and we issued a forecast.  That forecast was part of the budgetary process.  I will review matters in order to see if there is a need to update that further, particularly in light of the scale of the vote that happened last night.</p></speech>

The document also states that there would be a more immediate, short-term impact as a result of regulatory divergence, sterling depreciation and disruption to trade, consumer spending, investment, competitiveness and the public finances.  However, no numbers are provided in this regard.  What impact will a no-deal Brexit have on the economy in terms of tax receipts, economic growth and employment in 2019 and 2010?  Potentially, we are staring down the barrel of a cliff-edge, no-deal Brexit.  Does the Department have those numbers?  If so, will they be published?</p></speech>

As stated, particularly in light of the scale of the vote last night, it is important - from the point of view of the Oireachtas let alone that of myself - to review our forecasts far earlier than normal.  When that information becomes available, and I am looking to get it as soon as possible, I will publish it.</p></speech>

Our report will contain many caveats because we will be looking at figures that were issued by economic bodies in the UK a few weeks ago.  What they are trying to do is form a view of an event that has never happened before.  Never in history has an economy as large and as integrated with the rest of the global economy as Britain's left a single trading bloc.  The forecasts that have been made in the UK are based on many assumptions.  Not only would I have to build on those forecasts, there is also the challenge of having to factor in two matters.  That is what is giving us food for thought and it is why we are reviewing our figures.  One of the matters to which I refer relates to what would be second-order consequences of a disorderly Brexit.</p><p>We can model but we can only do so on the basis of what would be the effect on investment.  It is very difficult for us to be as clear as we would like to be regarding what could be the consequences of regulatory non-alignment because this is a new risk that is developing.  The second matter that we have to factor in is the fact that we are trying to understand - and we have work done on this in the event of a no-deal Brexit scenario - what will be the mitigative policy measures that would be taken and that, in turn, could reduce the net policy effects.</p><p>  To answer the Deputy's question on whether we are doing this work, the answer is "Yes".  We are doing it in light of what has happened.  Will that work be made available to the Deputy and the committee?  The answer is also "Yes".</p></speech>

I will outline the tangible result of such increased investment.  People never thought that almost 10,000 social homes would be delivered this year, that in the region of 8,000 units would be built and acquired or that we would support over 45,000 people in accommodation while their homes for life are being built.  People never talk in those terms.  Moreover, they erect billboards and speak negatively about things.  I very much welcome the increase in spending.  A great deal of funding went into resourcing local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in order to get all of those systems up and running.  As somebody who knows a little bit about housing - and I read all of the planning applications submitted to local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la - I can attest to the fact that there is a volume of applications coming through that has not been seen in the past couple of years.  I very much welcome the investment in the right place.</p> <p>  There has been much commentary on the national children's hospital.  While I have a view on the location, etc., I will park the issue for  today.  As a parent of young children who lives in Dublin, I am acutely aware of the stress and the concern that arises for people who have sick children in hospital and who live outside Dublin.  Under the plans for the new hospital, provision is being made for 380 individual en-suite inpatient rooms in order to allow families to stay with their children.  There will be a 53-unit family accommodation facility provided so that parents can be on site with their children.  When we talk about broad figures, we sometimes lose sight of the emotional support that needs to be given to people who live in this State.  I am acutely aware that the inflation in costs as a result of the construction aspect and our skills shortage has given rise to the overspend.</p> <p>  I would like to hear more detail about how closely the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is working with the Department of Health in order to ensure that the latter will not have as big an overspend in the latter part of this year as was the case in 2018.</p> <p>  What impact is the US tax reform likely to have on our corporation tax?</p></speech>

It is encouraging to see the scale of increase in the number of homes being built.  As I am well reminded from my engagement across the country and in my constituency, we still have a long journey to travel in this regard.</p> <p>  In terms of how much my Department engages with the Department of Health, from my point of view, at a political level, it is virtually every day.  From the point of view of my Department, significant engagement takes place each week.  What is particularly disappointing in terms of the scale of the overrun in the Department of Health is that in the previous two years we had made significant progress in reducing the amount required by the Department via Supplementary Estimate.  For a number of different reasons, we were not successful in maintaining that approach as we moved into this year.  Let me put that in context.  No Supplementary Estimate was needed in 2016 and &euro;195 million was required in 2017.  The position in 2016 and 2017 was a major improvement on previously.  The difficulty the Government and I faced in 2018 is now well known.</p> <p>  The HSE, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health now engage on a monthly basis with regard to how matters stand and do so in an even more intensive way than was the case in the past.</p><p>We now have a very clear idea by policy area in the Department of Health what figures need to look like on a monthly basis.  In light of what happened last year, it is even more of a priority for me than it normally would be.  </p><p> On the question about corporation tax, I have visited the United States twice since the middle of December.  On one occasion, I visited policymakers in Washington where I met representatives of the Department of the Treasury, Department of State and Department of Commerce.  Last week, I visited the west coast of America.  It is apparent to me that the overall policy package we offer on corporation tax and in many other areas, most notably how we manage data policy, is an offering that will continue to be very competitive in 2019 and beyond.</p></speech>

To get back to the Brexit issue, in his budget speech the Minister stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Across the Government the necessary measures to prepare for Brexit are being put in place.  These plans are based on a central case that there will be agreement in the coming weeks.   </blockquote> <p>Clearly there has not been an agreement.  The vote in the House of Commons last night, while expected, was extremely disappointing.  It is difficult to see where we will go from here.  I agree it is for the United Kingdom now to say where it wants to go but, nonetheless, we have to prepare as best we can for what could potentially be coming down the tracks.  My concern is that all the eggs of Government are in the basket of getting a deal.  Nobody wants to countenance the prospect that we potentially face a no-deal scenario, possibly at the end of March or a month or two thereafter.</p><p>I refer the Minister to the post-budget publications of the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO.  The office has done a significant amount of work based on an orderly Brexit being the central scenario for macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for 2019.  It states that &quot;no sensitivity analysis has been provided by the Government on the impact of changes to the Irish output induced by a 'hard' Brexit on revenue and expenditure projections&quot;.  Clearly budget 2019 was based on there being a deal, as the Minister has stated.  He also said he took into account the potential of a no deal scenario but this does not appear to have been factored into the figures.  The PBO made clear that analysis had not been done.  What is the Minister's response to what the PBO has said?  Does it impact on projected expenditure for 2019?</p></speech>

I agree with her opening sentiment that the result last night in the House of Commons is exceptionally disappointing and concerning.  As the Deputy stated, the responsibility sits with the British Government in terms of how it will move the issue forward and deal with the issues that developed in the debate.  In so doing, the Taoiseach outlined today during Leaders' Questions the needs of the Irish Government and the European Union in terms of how the issue moves forward.</p> <p>  It is correct to say, as I did in my budget day speech, that the central scenario for my economic forecasting was based on there being a deal because when I put together my budgetary arithmetic on the overall model, that looked like the most likely scenario.  As I said a moment ago to the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, I am now conducting a further assessment, particularly in light of the scale of the defeat last night, of any impact that could develop in 2019 in terms of the scale of that impact on our economic forecasts for this year.</p><p> On the Deputy's next question on whether I believe it will have an impact on our expenditure plans for this year and any decisions in that area, the answer is "No."  Our expenditure plans are laid out and I will provide a further assessment of the spending plans and our economic outlook through the stability programme update.  At this point in time, I am clear they will stand and believe it will be the case for 2019.  I will affirm that in my stability programme update.  </p><p> In terms of the sensitivity analysis the PBO referred to, it underpins the figures published in chapter 6 of our report.  Perhaps if I am in a position to give any further solid assessment of the impact of a no-deal Brexit in 2019, we can look at how it can be fleshed out further.  With regard to how we prepared for different Brexit scenarios, there are many different elements I would refer to.  The key one is we are increasing capital investment in the economy by 24%.  Normally when a Government tries to make decisions about major increases in capital expenditure, the increases kick in when the point of uncertainty has passed in the economy.  I timed the phasing of our capital expenditure to coincide with where we are with Brexit.  Also, in budget 2019 there was an allocation of &euro;115 million for different measures across different Departments to build on the investment we had in budget 2018.</p></speech>

It is good to see Fianna F&aacute;il policy was endorsed and accepted as prudent.  A 24% increase in capital expenditure is welcome.  It matters in terms of context what the baseline is, where it starts and from where it increases.</p> <p>  Has the Minister had frank discussions with the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Agriculture, Food and the Marine or Education and Skills about what they might need for their Departments in the event of a no-deal Brexit?  Has any other Minister requested additional money in the event of a no-deal Brexit?</p></speech>

The figures in the expenditure plans I have for 2019 are set.  I am confident, as we move through 2019, that they will be maintained.</p> <p>  On the question about engagement with other Government Ministers regarding the different Brexit scenarios, all of the engagement we have had to date has dealt with different Brexit scenarios.  Most of that engagement last year dealt with the central scenario, which was the assumption of a deal.  In the latter part of last year and the early part of this year, there has been a very high level of engagement with a number of Departments on expenditure needs in a no-deal scenario.  That has mostly been focused on how we would deal with some of the consequences of the need to get infrastructure in ports and airports in place more quickly than we assumed under an orderly exit.  I will have even further engagement in the coming weeks with colleagues, particularly in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, regarding different issues they could see developing.  </p></speech>

What happens in any given year and has been the case for the past number of years is we can change our spending profiles within Departments in response to events that occur.</p><p>There would be a need to engage in that in the event of a disorderly Brexit and there are a couple of ways in which it could be done.  We could look at where priority decisions need to be made in the context of the more imminent and urgent need which we would have or we could look at whether decisions need to be made on where current expenditure is allocated.  I will work with all of my colleagues on this matter.  I am very alive to the severe risk that a disorderly Brexit would pose to our economy.  However, as I stated to each of the Deputy's committee colleagues, if it occurs, a disorderly Brexit will be a unique event.  I will consider whether there is a need to review the understanding we have of a disorderly Brexit in the context of information that is emerging almost every day from the United Kingdom.  I stress that many of the information and predictions emanating from the United Kingdom are based on a higher level of assumption than would normally be the case.  When I have discussed the matter with the Government, I will make any updated information available to the committee and the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1332" speakername="Declan Breathnach" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019011600002#L00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his attendance.  I wish to first focus on the issue of oversight and improving budget scrutiny, which is part of the remit of the committee.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, criticised the Government's budget 2019 plans as not being credible.  According to its chair, Mr. Seamus Coffey, previous budgets stuck to plans but in the most recent budget the Government did not do so, with the budget day package being larger than previously signalled and containing significantly greater within-year spending increases for 2018 with little or no saving elsewhere to offset them.  Has the Minister issued a formal response to those concerns?  Has the Department studied the concerns raised in the fiscal assessment report?  What steps have been taken to address them?</p> <p>  IFAC also raised the issue of the Christmas bonus, pointing out that the budget is not realistic if it does not make provision for the Christmas bonus.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, recently commented on this issue.  I ask the Minister to consider committing to the Christmas bonus in next year's budget.</p> <p>  Health expenditure overruns have become commonplace.  The committee has discussed this issue.  What proactive steps are being taken to get to grips with it?  Is the Minister fully satisfied by the quality of budget information that his Department receives and uses to monitor expenditure trends in health?</p> <p>  Reference has been made to Brexit.  I ask the Minister to comment on the issue of illicit cross-Border trade, which will come to the fore in the case of a no-deal Brexit or otherwise.  I have been raising this issue since I was elected to the D&aacute;il.  A Grant Thornton report on illicit trade was published some years ago.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Act and the proposal of the Minister, Deputy Harris, to introduce minimum unit pricing will have a huge impact on retailers on the Border and beyond.  I spoke on this matter today in the Chamber and I ask the Minister to address it further.</p> <p>  It is clear that if we do not get a handle on the issue of carbon taxes there will be a flood of illicit activity.  That is already evident with regard to solid fuel.  It has been brought to my attention that at the current estimated 10% evasion rate on solid fuel, approximately &euro;12 million in carbon taxes and VAT is being foregone.</p><p>Such evasion could be greatly exacerbated by Brexit.  I do not advocate any form of border controls.  What steps are being taken by the Minister's Department to bring to heel the significant illicit trade in solid fuel and other products?</p></speech>

In each of the other two budgets in which I was involved as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the council did not raise issues of the kind it raised in the most recent report.  That is one of the reasons I take what it has stated so seriously.  I do not dismiss the views of the IFAC in any way.  The Government and I need to take on board its analysis when moving into this year.  I have not yet responded to the council but will do so in the coming days.  The response will be in line with my remarks to the committee today.  When I issue the letter, I will forward it to the committee as a follow-up on this meeting and it will be available on the website of my Department.</p> <p>  On the comments of the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, there is always an anticipation of and a need to fund a Christmas bonus.  One issue I must consider is how any new funding method which the Government may believe necessary can be factored into our budgetary calculations.  I look forward to discussing with the Minister how that could be done.</p> <p>  I completely understand the Deputy's point in regard to the Public Health (Alcohol) Act.  I am more familiar than he might think with how supply chains work in the retail business.  I understand how wholesale operators work and their ability to source any products, particularly alcohol, from multiple locations.  I know what the grey market is.  I assure Deputies that my involvement in it was always legal but I understand how it works because of my career before moving into politics.  I know that a change in an indirect tax can have a far greater effect than is commonly understood and does not solely affect the tax base within this jurisdiction.  I am aware of the comments of the Minister, Deputy Harris, on the Public Health (Alcohol) Act.  The triggering of its provisions is a decision for him.  I respect what he said.  In the run-up to that decision, I will discuss the potential consequences with all members of the Government because everybody needs to be aware that there may be consequences if the price of a key wholesale good moves out of line with that in other markets with which we are integrated.  This is an issue to which I will return.</p> <p>  On carbon tax, the situation highlighted by the Deputy underpins part of the reason why I did not move on carbon taxation in the budget.  In the second half of 2018 there was neither a consensus nor an understanding on what a move on carbon taxation meant or its many consequences.  I understand there is a need to raise carbon taxes and want to see how we can do so.  Those who advocate for an increase need to be more clear on its various consequences.  If our carbon taxation was out of line with that in other jurisdictions, it would change the costs of things that are very important to people's standard of living and would have an effect on other things within our economy, as indicated by the issue raised by the Deputy.  That said, for many reasons we need to try to build a model for steadily changing carbon taxation and to indicate to citizens and investors that the price of carbon will rise in the medium run.</p><p>That will be a challenging piece of work for this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.287" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019011600002#N00200"><p>To follow up on that, was the key reason the Minister did nothing about carbon taxes not that the Government was hoping to have an early general election, which could have taken place by now?  However, it was politically impossible.  I notice that the Minister, or rather the Taoiseach, is talking about the tax-and-dividend approach now.  This seems to imply that carbon taxation, which would hurt our poorer households, would eventually go back to people.  Is the Minister saying that there is a very significant chance we will have to have a revised budget in 2019?  Is that the reality, even in the present circumstances as the British Parliament goes into another important vote today?  The Minister presented us with a proposal for an omnibus Bill with 17 sections.  I asked him a question about that.  His questions have been deferred.  Has that been costed?  Has the Minister costed the impact of going forward with some or all of that legislation?</p> <p>  I will ask the Minister again to return to the question that Deputy Breathnach asked about the fiscal assessment report of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.  Was it not an astonishing critique of the Minister's administration of the Department of Finance?  The key points of that large report concerned 2018 spending, taken with the 2019 budget.  The report says the plans are "not conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management".  That is a very fundamental point.  Professor Coffey and his colleagues write that repeated budgetary failures "have left the public finances more exposed to adverse shocks".  The Minister has left us in more difficult circumstances because of his conduct of budgetary policy in 2018 and his plans for 2019.  As my colleagues have said, the report states "the medium-term budgetary plans are not credible".  The Minister has dropped previous medium-term plans and his current plans simply cannot be believed.  Is that not a fundamental problem?</p> <p>  When he was here, I asked Professor Coffey about net policy spending, as did one or two other colleagues.  It was quite clear that problems with corporation tax were inhibiting net policy spending rising in line with sustainable revenues.  The Minister does not have a system of sufficiently sustainable revenues.  That is the problem.  He is talking about doing a report on it.  IFAC did not say it to us, but elsewhere Professor Coffey has said that the Minister's fiscal approach has echoes of 2007.  Is this not an incredibly severe critique, from the statutory Government body meant to oversee the work of the Minister and his two Departments on a whole range of areas, of how the Minister has computed spending for 2019 and exceeded in 2018?  We gave the Minister some suggestions, like equalising diesel and petrol revenues.  The Minister was not prepared to get the additional revenue necessary.  One journalist noted that Professor Coffey is a hurler - he is a goalie, actually - and said he gave the Minister and his Departments a fairly severe rap of the hurley.  Is that not a fair assessment of the report?  It is a very damning assessment, given the era during which the Minister is in charge of the Department. </p> <p>  I wish to ask the Minister about health spending.  Is the budget oversight group consisting of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Health and the HSE up and running so that we can get adequate forecasting?  It was our committee, as the Minister will remember, and colleagues beside me who identified the huge lacuna in health spending for 2018.  The Minister had to come forward with a Supplementary Estimate of more than &euro;655 million.  Is he beginning to get a grip on that in any way?  Ordinary citizens are quite upset and horrified at the huge escalation in the cost of the children's hospital and the fact that every time we look at it, or any time Deputy Donohoe, the Minister for Health or the Taoiseach talks to us, the price of the hospital is higher.</p><p>Looking back at the record, the Minister's old constituency colleague, former Deputy Ahern, played a nefarious role in that whole matter by interfering in it and postponing the location and building of the hospital.  It could have been built by now. </p></speech>

The only commitment I have given is that if information on the likely effects of a disorderly Brexit on our economy becomes available to me, I will make this information available in advance of when I normally would, that is, in the stability programme update.  At no point in this meeting have I said that there would be a need for a new budget this year.  My spending and tax plans for this year will be kept in place.  As I said to Deputy Lisa Chambers, if we have to deal with new risks that develop this year concerning our response to a disorderly Brexit, I will work on those within the Government.  If we face an exceptionally serious shock, the key change will arise from the automatic stabilisers in our budget.  It will have an effect on where we are with regard to the challenge of balancing our books in 2019.  As that information becomes available to me, I will update the House on it.  The only thing I will say in that context is that our budgetary performance for 2018 is better than I have indicated to date or than I indicated on budget day.  I have acknowledged that much of that was driven by the increase in corporation tax in the fourth quarter and some of the corporation tax raised was not spent.  That higher level of corporation tax has not been built into our economic figures for this year.</p> <p>  Regarding what the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, has said about this budget, as I said, I take what the IFAC says seriously.  I am taking it on board.  The IFAC raised issues around budgets in other years.  Let us acknowledge that.  Clearly it has raised this criticism to a higher level in its recent commentary.  Whether it is a hurl or whatever, I will take whatever it has said on board and look at how it can be implemented in 2019.</p> <p>  In regard to whether our group has met to manage health expenditure, I note that my colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I have met twice on this topic in January.  I have engaged with the Department of Health on it.  We never anticipated sitting down in the way I have outlined until we have at least six to eight weeks' expenditure available to us.  It is only then that we will have a sense of any particular trends developing in any part of our health service.  We will be doing that.</p> <p>  In answer to what the Deputy has said about the budget, there were forecasts and expectations that every single budget I have been involved in would be an election budget.  That election has still not materialised.  The Government of which I am a member and the main Opposition party will continue to work together throughout 2019 to deal with the big challenge that we have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1311" speakername="John Lahart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019011600002#O00400"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for their service.  This is the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and we are entitled to slightly more detailed responses to some of the questions put by some of the previous speakers.  Let us look at a summary of the criticism of the Minister's budget.  Some of the critiques have been mentioned.  It was premised on the idea of an orderly Brexit.  It is pro-cyclical, with no evidence of counter-cyclical measures.  Moreover, the Minister has been promising budget surpluses since 2016 and he is back here today promising them again.</p><p>The improvements in the general budgetary situation in Ireland have stalled since 2015, and that stall has happened in spite of strong national and international recoveries and a supportive monetary environment internationally with low interest rates.  The Minister continues to be over-reliant on corporation tax despite continuous warnings.  In the period between June 2018 and September 2018, just four months, the Minister increased projected spending by &euro;1.1 billion.  His budget is not consistent with prudent budget management and he has introduced difficult to reverse increases in spending.  His budget involves failures which represent a repeat of the policy mistakes of the past and the public finances have been left in a more exposed position to adverse shocks.  His budgetary plans for the future lack credibility and he fudged any climate change measures in the budget in a week it was announced that Ireland was second worst in the European Union with regard to climate change and in respect of any other measures aside from the carbon tax.  The Minister's three-year budget ceilings are not working, with repeated procyclical, upward revisions to the ceilings.  Health spending and the lack of inclusion of the Christmas bonus alone, not to mind overruns in other Departments, pose upward risks to expenditure in 2019.  The Minister is dependent on windfall receipts, which are being used for day-to-day spending, while revenue growth has been supported by short-term cyclical developments.</p><p> Learning from the mistakes of the past is a common theme in his speeches.  Those who were there in the past can argue that the only person who said there was a problem coming down the line was a little known economist in UCD.  All the other agencies, including the Central Bank and the ESRI, spoke about soft landings.  However, the Minister has been getting warnings and they are escalating, particularly from the IFAC.  He did not refer to the PBO's report on the budget or the submission made by this committee.  For all the Minister's talk about prudence and having learned the lessons from the past, these comments are made not by journalists but by statutory agencies, as Deputy Broughan said.  The Minister has not given us a comprehensive response to a quite damning indictment of the measures.  In summary, he does not appear to be heeding the advice he is being given.  In further summary, he appears to be repeating the exact mistakes that were made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.293" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019011600002#P00200"><p>The Deputy made a number of points.  I am not sure where the questions were in his comments but I will respond to his points.  He also made an assertion earlier that I had not responded to a number of questions that were put to me.  That is not the case.  However, any Deputy who is unhappy with an answer I have given has the option of putting another question to me or to ask the question again, which I will answer.</p> <p>  Regarding the overall point made by the Deputy, I will give him another set of figures in that regard, notwithstanding the fact that I have made it clear that I acknowledge the views published by the IFAC and will seek to take them on board for 2019.  The other figures are, as I said in my opening statement, that between 2014 and 2019 gross voted expenditure increased by 23% in comparison to the period the Deputy refers to when the comparable figure was 63%.  He asked what I am doing differently from what was done previously.  The answer is a rate of current and capital expenditure growth that is significantly below what happened in the past.</p><p>The fact that in each of my budgets the criticism from some has been that the change in take-home pay has been only &euro;5 a week for many people shows that I have been careful not to put in place taxation policies that could contribute to an overheating of the economy on top of the income growth that is taking place.  The Deputy asked what is different in the current position from the period to which he is referring.  The two significant measures that are different, and which I put in place, are a significantly lower rate of expenditure growth and taxation packages which in all cases are below the cost of indexing our tax code and which many have argued are not adding to individuals' take-home pay.  One of the reasons I have taken that approach is that I am aware of the risk of tax packages that move in the cycle of economic growth.  It is the type of approach that happened in the past and it is one I am not maintaining.</p><p> More broadly, in my many years of dealing with this issue and with this committee, I have never yet heard a charge from a Deputy that I am spending too much.  That charge has not been levelled at me.  I have never had an appearance before this committee where the mainstream charge has been that the rate of total Government expenditure is too high.  The charge I always face is the need to spend more.  The Deputy's party in recent months has been calling on me to spend more than &euro;3.4 billion more.  As I am privileged to hold this office, the responsibility ultimately lies with me in terms of the decisions that are made.  What is different from the past are rates of expenditure that are significantly lower and income tax and social welfare packages that are considerably lower because the higher rates in the past ultimately proved to be unaffordable.</p><p> The Deputy makes the further point that if there are warnings, we should take them on board.  I aim to do that.  I have outlined what we are going to do this year, particularly in health.  I also point to other things that were in place by the end of last year such as establishing the rainy day fund and the fact that we finished last year in surplus as opposed to having a deficit.  The Deputy made a point that is incorrect, although he was repeating a charge that has been made by others.  It is the assertion that at various stages I said I was going to move to a surplus in a budget in which I was involved.  I have never done that.  At each point I have said I will reduce our deficit, and in each budget we have over-delivered on our target.  I have never said in a budget I have delivered that we will move to a surplus in that year and then missed that commitment.  That has not happened.</p></speech>

In fact, the IFAC made the point that the Minister committed to budget surpluses in 2016 for 2018 and in 2017 for 2019 so it is not my assertion.  None of the assertions I made is personal.  They are all from the reports of the PBO, the Governor of the Central Bank and IFAC.  This is not a political charge as this is the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.

I said two things: first, that the Deputy was repeating the assertions of others, which he is and as I have acknowledged, and, second, that in the budget I have delivered in any given year I have either met or exceeded any target I have set in that year from a surplus or deficit point of view.</p><p>That has been the case in my two budgets as Minister for Finance.  To return to the tone of all this, the Deputy is referring to institutions, one of which is independent of me, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, which has raised a particular issue for 2018 on unplanned expenditure which mostly centres on what happens in the Department of Health.  That change in the Department of Health was very different from the previous two years when I was involved in that issue, and I acknowledge that in 2019 we need to find ways of doing it differently.  That is what I am working to.  However, I stand by the point I made in terms of the rate of expenditure growth and the combined impact of tax and social welfare packages.  They are of a different magnitude to where we were at this point in the proceeding economic cycle.</p></speech>

The Minister has heard about IFAC's critique from other colleagues.  There are no two ways about it, that IFAC has taken off its gloves on 2019.  Other members have commented on how it says it is not conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management, how it is not consistent with prudent budgetary management, that medium budgetary plans are not credible and it goes on and on.  Does the Minister dispute the specific charges Professor Coffey and his team are making about budget 2019.</p></speech>

I do not accept that it was a reckless budget.  There are specific points in the IFAC report that I accept.  The ones I particularly accept, which the Deputy has outlined, relate to where we are with unplanned expenditure, particularly in health, and its impact on medium-term forecasts.  I accept those points.</p></speech>

It gives a full graph and highlights every one that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council believes lacks credibility.  It is very clear.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	Aside from some allowances for demographics, and a ramp-up in public investment, departmental ceilings are largely flat for later years.  This implies implausibly large and sustained decreases in non-interest spending as a share of GNI*. </blockquote> <p>It is saying that what the Minister is presenting is that the Government will spend less money than it will actually end up spending.  The fiscal advisory council is saying very clearly that the Government needs to spend more money in each of these areas, and that is the reality, but that the figures projected by the Department are not credible.  It is not just on health.  The only reason it said that is because the Department has only dealt with demographics and inflation but there are other pressures that will be in those Departments during those years.  Does the Minister not accept that?</p></speech>

Different Ministers for Finance and different Governments in the future - obviously, I hope the current Government continues for as long as possible - must make decisions each year in relation to their service priorities.</p><p>I have told the Deputy what I accept in respect of what it has stated with regard to the Department of Health.  In particular, I have said that I accept what it says about some of the consequences of this on the medium-term forecasting.  Where I differ is in my belief that some of the assessment undervalues the fact that any Government on budget day must be able to make its own policy priorities and must be able to make discretionary expenditure decisions.  Those must be funded and in many cases must be built on to medium-term forecasts that are published.</p></speech>

I will conclude my point and then respond to the Deputy.  From much of the thinking I have read on medium-term forecasts, my view is that it underestimates the fact that a Government of the day will have to make policy choices in three different areas, that is, does it retain services in a particular area, does it need new services or does it need to change levels of capital expenditure?  Therefore my view is that as future budgets are done, regardless of whether I or other Ministers have the opportunity to do them, the share of Government expenditure as a percentage of GNI* will at least stay constant, if not grow, and taxation decisions will have to be made in order to do that or decisions will have to be made not to do other things.</p></speech>

The figures the Minister is presenting for the latter three years have no value to this committee or to external people looking in because they are not credible because, as the Minister says, he will not reduce expenditure by 2.5%.  Why then present them in the first place?  He still has the flexibility to change the figures but to present figures that we know are rubbish because they all will be increased devalues the work of this committee and the work that is being undertaken by his officials.</p> <p>  I have two questions which I will lump together.  IFAC made stinging criticisms of the budget.  Did officials in the Department provide the Minister with any of that type of advice?  Hopefully they did.  I am not sure if the Wright report recommendation has been implemented that all decisions about budgetary matters by officials are written down and are available through freedom of information after a period, but I hope to God that some people are speaking up.</p> <p>  I refer to contingency planning for Brexit and one risk that has been highlighted in the IFAC report.  What engagement has the Minister had with Revenue officials?  What preparedness is taking place by Revenue officials?  At the British Irish Chamber of Commerce meeting that took place late last year, which the Minister, Deputy Creed attended, a senior Revenue official spoke of it doing contingency planning in terms of agricultural products that would need to be checked at the Border.  My question is genuine and sincere, now that we are 70 days away from a potential no-deal Brexit, which none of us want to see.  Is the Minister aware of Revenue undertaking any contingency plans about checks at the Border or customs controls?  We know that when the internal 2017 report was leaked by journalists, the Government told Revenue to stop preparing.  We are now 70 days away from Brexit.  Is there any preparedness?  Is the Minister meeting with officials?  Is the issue of Border checks or checks along the Border on the agenda?</p><p>Has the Minister had any discussions about that?  While I understand that Revenue officials will appear before the committees, at this point in time we have to have an honest discussion about this.   </p></speech>

We all worked very hard in the run-up to budget 2019, in the context of many competing pressures, to put together the best possible budget that could be implemented.  I take some specific points on board but I differ in that I believe this is a budget which, by virtue of the rate of expenditure growth, the moving to a balance and then a surplus last year, meets key needs within our economy.  I of course am aware of the heightened level of risk we now face but I make the point that most of the engagement the Deputy and I have had has been about his view that I should spend more.</p></speech>

He asked me whether I had met the Revenue Commissioners to discuss Brexit.  I met all of the Revenue Commissioners to discuss this growing risk in the second half of last year.  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance, some of our officials and I had a lengthy meeting about some of the scenarios we might have to deal with this year.  In advance of getting to this point, I had a very substantive engagement with all of the key members of Revenue on this.  I have had at least one further meeting and discussion with the Revenue Commissioners to discuss the point since then, and my officials have had a significant amount of engagement with the Revenue Commissioners on this.  This engagement significantly preceded today's debate.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether we have made any decisions on introducing checks on the Border.  The answer is no, we have not.  Any preparatory work happening is being done at locations I already have identified, or those identified by the Taoiseach, that is, key ports which take in the majority of our goods.  However, we are not doing anything outside of the public information I have shared.  Both of my Departments have had a very large amount of engagement with the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Public Works on how we can make this happen.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit occurring, we will be doing all we can to cope with the consequences that will flow from that from a customs point of view.  As I said to Deputy Michael McGrath, unknowns will develop in the area of the movement of goods and the potential customs consequences of that.  We will plan to deal with that as best we can but we are now in new territory.</p><p>These are the answers to the Deputy's questions.  </p><p> I will deal with the question of the advice given to me by my officials directly.  I cannot recall what the precedent is on sharing advice I receive from officials but I will tell the Deputy that I did not do anything on budget day that was outside of the advice given to me by the Department of Finance or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We faced cascading demands in the run-up to the budget and are aware of the challenges and vulnerabilities we could face now.  However, every time I appear before a committee, I am faced with demands to spend more.  I reiterate Deputy Pearse Doherty voted against the tax measures that have funded the additional expenditure the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is now criticising.  </p></speech>

I asked two further questions that the Minister should be allowed to answer.  They were about the recommendations of the Wright report, and whether all advice to the Minister is written down and available after the five-year period under freedom of information provisions.  It is important to clarify.</p></speech>

All advice given to me is available in written format.  We have a certain process within the Government and every decision I have to make is provided to me in written format.  The advice contains the perspectives of the relevant Department.  I have ample meetings and a large amount of engagement with my officials on, perhaps not every single decision, but on key decisions we have to make.  In that context I tease out many different options for each decision.  Every decision I make, as Minister for Finance, is in written format.  I do not know whether it is available within a certain time period.  If any of my colleagues know the answer to that they will tell me and if they do not, I will revert to the committee.</p></speech>

There will be no attempt on my part to shut that down.  If a member has used his or her five minutes and the Minister has replied in the full five minutes, there will be a second round to follow up.</p> <p>  For clarification purposes, the Minister should note that he is due before the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, rather than this committee again.  He mentioned that he would be before this committee again but I do not think that is the case.  We will have a break at 5.15 p.m. because the Minister is due in the Chamber then, and three more Deputies are waiting to come in during this round.  It would be great if they could all be heard before 5.15 p.m. in order to facilitate our colleagues, who have been here since the outset.  </p></speech>

The Minister spoke briefly about it when answering questions from other Deputies.  How is he proposing to get a grip on the health budget in the future?  Can he recap on some of the measures being taken?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019011600002#U00900"><p>While acknowledging the difficulties we had in 2018, I wish to make the point that for 2016 and 2017, we either did not have a Supplementary Estimate or it was significantly lower than was the case last year.  On the question of what we are doing to mitigate this risk, we are dealing with the development of the potential risk on a month-by-month basis as opposed to addressing it on a quarterly basis.  My Department is now directly involved in a process with the HSE and with the Department of Health that will take place every month.</p><p>That has not yet been triggered because we are only in the second week of January and I need to have a number of weeks of expenditure under my belt before we can do it.</p></speech>

While the Estimate for the year before that was not classed as a Supplementary Estimate, there was a Revised Estimate of &euro;500 million in 2016.  Therefore, the combined figure for the last two years is &euro;700 million.  While one can class the figure for last year as significantly lower, in 2016 some &euro;500 million was allocated in a Revised Estimate.</p> <p>  I have some concerns about the month-by-month monitoring that will now take place and how the system will work.  Perhaps the Minister might talk me through it.  Already there are monthly performance data between the HSE and the Department of Health.  If they are not able to indicate that there will be a significant overrun, what is going to be different in the monthly reporting system that is to be set up between the HSE, the Department of Health and the Minister's Department?</p></speech>

I am sorry I had misunderstood it.  At the discretion of the Chairman, I do not want the Deputy to lose any of his time for questioning because I got it wrong.  I will address what is different in how we will now do it.  There has been a process between the Department of Health and the HSE.  Now my Department will also be involved in it.</p></speech>

That is why my Department will now be participating in the process.  I have no doubt at all that if I had gone into the D&aacute;il to reduce health expenditure by &euro;645 million across 2018, it would have caused a significant reaction and had service consequences for which I would have been subjected to a lot of criticism.  Therefore, we are putting in place the process I have outlined for the Deputy.</p></speech>

At this committee in December Mr. Michael Tutty from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said:</p> <blockquote> 	Some &euro;700 million does not just suddenly arrive as the year goes on, there has to have been a shortfall right from the start in the figures.  We need to find a mechanism where correct or reasonable forecasts are given in the budget, rather than unrealistic ones. </blockquote> <p>Would the Minister agree?</p></speech>

However, in the summer economic statement and the update I gave in September before the announcement of the budget in October, I flagged that there was a health expenditure overrun.  In the summer economic statement I identified an expenditure risk which fluctuated during the year and was the subject of a lot of work, especially during the summer.  It led to the figure on which the Deputy is quizzing me.  I called it publicly as a risk, both in the summer economic statement and the stability programme update that preceded it.</p></speech>

The month by month reports between the Department of Health and the HSE are now to be shared with the Minister's Department.  What is the timelag in the provision of data?  Mr. Colm Desmond has said there is a timelag which makes it more difficult to estimate the size of overruns.  Will the Minister give us an indication as to whether the timelag is one, two or three months?  How old are the data discussed each month?</p></speech>

If he is talking about expenditure, the timelag can be between three and five days, but normally we know within one week what has happened in the previous month.  If the data are for income, the timelag can be considerably longer; it could be months.  This refers particularly to the challenge in collecting income from the insurance sector.</p></speech>

The first opportunity I will have to present a revised update on any policy decision will be in the stability programme update.  I am still anticipating that we will be standing by many of the macroeconomic choices and commitments I made, especially the rainy day fund.  That is my view, but I am mindful of the great risks posed by Brexit.  I am very mindful of the way in which it might impact on the budget and where we will end up with automatic stabilisers and either a balanced budget, a surplus or a deficit.  I will comment further on the matter in the stability programme update.  In the last two days I have met the Governor of the Central Bank and the chairman of National Treasury Management Agency and discussed where we stand this week in the context of Brexit.</p></speech>

That definition will require teasing out in the context of how the rainy day fund will work.  We are facing a great unknown in terms of what a disorderly Brexit could look like.  The plans for the rainy day fund stand.  I was due to take the legislation dealing with fund last night in the D&aacute;il.  If there is a need to make any change, I can deal with it via the update I will give in April or the legislation.</p></speech>

There are many options that will be open to me if we reach that point, but it is not my intention to do what the Deputy has indicated, nor do I anticipate any need to use the fund for bank recapitalisation.  In fact, across 2018 we saw the position on non-performing loans in the banks improve significantly by comparison with where we were.

I am willing to work with the Department of Health and the HSE to consider ways in which the issue can be resolved, but I am not willing to put in place any measure that would undermine the national wage agreement.  That has happened already in this D&aacute;il in another part of the civil and public service.  When in one part of the public service there is an increase in allowances or wages, within 24 hours there is an expectation that everybody else will receive the same.  I imagine Deputy Boyd Barrett will say to me that that is what he would want to see happen, but the challenge I would face is paying for it.  I do not want to see the national wage agreement unravel.</p></speech>

If I were to make any change in a pay rate, it would have to be done for everybody.  We made an agreement with many unions and said there was only a certain amount available for public pay in any given year.  If the integrity of that commitment was to be undermined, the need would crystallise immediately for money to be made available to everybody.  The challenges we would then face with unplanned expenditure would be immense by comparison with some of the issues we are debating.</p></speech>

I was talking to representatives of the INMO.  To cut a long story short, they stated the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had sanitised and gutted the HSE's submission.  It was then put together as a joint submission to the Public Service Pay Commission.  The HSE's submission to the Minister which is not the submission made to the pay commission stated retention was a big problem and that pay was a factor.  Essentially, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform gutted that submission because the Minister did not want to acknowledge the problem politically.</p> <p>  This is related to the criticism about not accurately estimating expenditure to be incurred.  The Minister is not facing the reality which then just comes back and bites him.  In this case, it is going to come back and bite him in the form of a nurses' strike.  The dogs on the street know that pay is at the base of the failure to recruit nurses.  For every four nursing posts advertised, there is only one application.  There are nearly 2,000 fewer nurses in the public health service today than in 2008.  We are not able to recruit them.  Meanwhile, the number of health managers is burgeoning.  The costs arise because the Minister is failing to address the underlying problem.  I would like a direct answer to the question as to whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform gutted or sanitised the HSE's submission that acknowledged there was a major retention problem and that the problem was related to pay.</p></speech>

I do not have time to quote them now.  The Minister's answer is not accurate.  The passages do not appear in the joint submission made to the Public Service Pay Commission.</p></speech>

Of course, there was engagement between my Department and the Department of Health on a submission on recruitment and retention.  It happened because my Department has overall policy responsibility for staffing, recruitment and pay for all public services.  As part of the process in that regard, we examined extensively the data available for recruitment and retention in the health service.  The Deputy has made a point about what is happening with the number of nurses in the health service.  The figures available to me indicate that nurse numbers have been increasing steadily since 2013, by on average of 2.2% every year.  The view reached on whether there was a recruitment or retention difficulty in the health service was not one that was reached by my Department but by the Public Service Pay Commission.  The commission stated it did not believe there was a general issue in recruitment and retention in the health service, but it went on to state it believed there were issues in the nursing sector, be they related to profession or geography, and recommended proposals to address them.  I accept that.</p></speech>

Essentially, key passages were gutted.  In the joint submission from the employers, namely, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE, all of the references to the retention problem were removed.</p></speech>

The body that adjudicated over that was not the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but the Public Service Pay Commission, which is independent of me.  Some of its report's recommendations caused challenges.  For example, it made a recommendation on changing allowances, which I had not done previously.  I have accepted its analysis.  My Department did not make a determination on the issue.  We are basing our analysis on an independent body that has an independent board.</p></speech>

That happens all of the time.  My Department had responsibility for some key areas.  We engaged with the HSE on the submission, as we will with every Department on its views on recruitment and retention, but with respect to the Deputy's good self, I categorically reject any view that we gutted that submission.</p></speech>

The Minister is misleading the public and being disingenuous by referring to a &euro;300 million cost in respect of the nurses' pay demands.  He is not acknowledging that there will be significantly increased tax as a result of that and the additional recruitment.  He is not acknowledging the savings that will be made in the payment of agency nurses, which runs at approximately &euro;2 million per week.  He is not acknowledging the fact that, to recruit nurses from overseas, we are paying foreign companies &euro;10,000 per recruit, and we are still not recruiting enough people.  Should the Minister not acknowledge that the price tag of &euro;300 million is an exaggeration that he is using to deflect from the legitimacy of the nurses' pay claim?</p></speech>

What I have said is the pay cost of their claim is &euro;300 million, plus the &euro;115 million to &euro;120 million that would be the consequence of meeting the need for increased continuing professional development hours.  These are the figures I stand by.  The increased wages would generate a higher level of tax revenue, but every other public servant would then come looking for the same increase.  The Deputy charges me with being disingenuous, so I will in turn ask him to acknowledge that, for every move made for one part of our public service, the cost will be many multiples of that because everyone else will come looking for the same treatment.  That has happened before and will happen again.</p></speech>

I have some sympathy for the Minister when he gets criticised for spending too much only for the same people to demand he spend more, but he cannot level that charge at us.</p></speech>

We proposed measures like increasing employer's PRSI, financial transaction taxes and wealth taxes, which would have generated the necessary revenue.  Is the IFAC not correct when it says that the Minister is not acknowledging the real costs that will be incurred and the expenditures that he will have to make?  To plug the gap, he is using unsustainable corporate tax revenues when he should be contemplating other areas of taxation like those I have mentioned, closing corporate tax loopholes and so on.</p></speech>

I would argue that many of his proposals would destroy jobs and investment in our economy.</p><p>As I will indicate in my letter, a key issue that should have been considered in the ensuing debate is that I made a decision to change a significant tax rate to pay for much of the additional expenditure that followed.  Of course, as the Deputy acknowledged, he voted for that.</p></speech>

In our post-budget scrutiny, it is right to acknowledge that, for the first time in more than a decade, our public finances are balanced in cash terms and we are in surplus territory.  It is no mean achievement by the Minister, his predecessor, Deputy Noonan, and the officials who have worked with them down the years that we have got the country's economy back on track to that extent.  It has been crucial for all of us, given the demands and pressures across society that must be funded.  I welcome the considerable increases in spending in our health service, housing and education and, through Project Ireland 2040, the crucial 25% increase in infrastructural capital spending.</p> <p>  Regarding the comments on the IFAC report, I am mindful of the fact that the European Commission, whose job it is to assess formally our compliance with EU fiscal rules, has assessed budget 2019 as being compliant and has projected that we will achieve our medium-term objectives.  That must be taken on board in any analysis of the IFAC report, which was published around the same time.</p> <p>  What analysis has the Department done of the impact on the economy of the increases in capital spending this year?  If the Minister answers that question first, I will then ask about corporation tax.</p></speech>

We did not build those second round impacts into our forecast in a significant way because they are difficult to forecast.</p> <p>  One of the increasing challenges that we are facing from an investment point of view, and one that is changing even more quickly than I had anticipated, is the growing number of large capital projects that we are competing with the private sector to make happen.  Even in 2018, there was an acceleration in the number of large projects that the private sector wanted to deliver.  This is something that, as we move through 2019 and become clear on where we stand with Brexit, will have to be a factor in our capital project decisions in 2019 and 2020.  The growing feedback that I have been given is that, for example, the electrical engineers whom we need to be involved in building our primary care centres and national children's hospital are the same ones for whom there is a growing demand in the building of data centres and other new facilities.</p> <p>  Given that development, I will flag an issue that we are reflecting on currently, namely, the question of whether we need to move the decision point for finally saying "Yes" to projects above a certain level to later in the process.  We are seeing a greater degree of change in tender pricing and credible estimates than would have been expected.  While that is happening for good reasons, it is having an impact on the public finances, for which I am responsible.</p></speech>

What is different for us now is we are not only competing for, for example, the engineers to do that work within the private sector in Ireland but also within the private sector across Europe.  Large companies, the skills and staff of which we need to deliver projects here, are looking at attractive big projects taking place across Europe and private sector projects within Ireland, and that is all going into the mix in the tendering decisions they make.  That is happening quickly now.  For example, across Europe we will see big changes in how other countries respond to the climate change agenda.  That will involve complex, intensive projects.  Those needed to do that work are the same people we need to deliver projects in our country.  That is a development that is happening more quickly than I thought likely across 2018.</p></speech>

On corporation tax and our reliance on it, what proportion of overall income is made up of corporation tax now compared with historical levels and to what extent is the increase in corporation tax based on underlying corporate profitability as opposed to one-off factors?  Would the Minister have data on that?</p></speech>

It used stand at 14% to 15%.  In terms of the degree to which that over-performance is now driven by one-off factors, our analysis is that there are a number of key factors behind the majority of change happening.  The biggest one is the fact that corporate profitability has significantly increased since 2010.  I refer to the corporate profitability that Deputy Boyd Barrett, if he was here, would point to as something that he is very much concerned about and something that he would view as being an example of economic inequality.  That increase in corporate profitability is being taxed.  If that corporate activity refers to Ireland, we are gaining our share of tax on that.  The second factor is that we have made a number of changes within our corporate tax code that will affect where we are from a revenue point of view.  Third, there are a number of one-off factors that are beginning to have an effect.  The most notable of these is the &euro;700 million that we identified last year.</p></speech>

The board&rsquo;s remit is to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital for the island of Ireland.  The proposed new children&rsquo;s hospital development is the most significant capital investment project ever undertaken in healthcare in Ireland, bringing together three children&rsquo;s hospitals in a modern custom-designed building to deliver the best care and treatments for Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children.</p> <p>  I was joined on the board by 11 other dedicated members with the collective skills and experience of major projects to deliver on the responsibility with which we were entrusted, namely, to build a world-class children&rsquo;s hospital on the site of St. James&rsquo;s campus.  The urgent need for a new children&rsquo;s hospital for the country has been recognised for decades.  Acknowledging the importance of the challenge ahead of us and the realisation that we were building a hospital that will care for sick children and their families for many generations to come, we set out a bold vision for the project.</p> <p>  The project aims to deliver one of the finest children&rsquo;s hospitals in the world and specifically a hospital that provides a truly supportive and therapeutic environment for children and their families.  It will also provide a safe and stimulating environment for staff, recognising the importance of wellness.  It will be a hospital sensitive to and positively enhancing of its urban setting and the quality of life of the local population.</p><p>Its layout, detailed design and construction quality will facilitate the optimum delivery of all aspects of leading current and developing clinical practice.  It will be a leading edge fully digital hospital.  It will be cost effective in terms of capital and whole-life costs, with sustainable solutions integrated into all stages of the project life cycle.  In that regard, we have targeted a Building Research Establishment environmental assessment method, BREEAM, rating of "excellent" and BER A3 standards.</p><p> On design team selection, with a clear vision for the project and an experienced executive team in place, the board put in place a structure and process for design team procurement, securing planning permission and the procurement of contractors to ensure the timely delivery of the new hospital, while working closely with St. James's Hospital in decanting buildings from the 12-acre site identified for the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  Following a comprehensive procurement process, we reached our first major milestone with the appointment of the design team in August 2014.  Thereafter, the design for planning was produced in a most expeditious manner.  A planning application was lodged in August 2015 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in April 2016.  This represented the crossing of a major hurdle for the project in the light of the previous experience with the Mater site.  The decanting of buildings from the 12-acre site identified for the children's hospital commenced immediately and an enabling works contract focused on demolition commenced in July 2016.</p><p> Importantly, shortly after receipt of planning permission, the procurement process for contractors began in June 2016.  A procurement sub-group had earlier been established to define the most appropriate approach to contractor procurement.  The group included our board, HSE estates and members of the Government construction contracts committee.  Given the history of cost overruns and adversarial behaviour on public sector projects, it was decided to consider alternatives to the traditional form of tendering.  Reference was made to lessons learned and evolving best practice in the UK and internationally.  The universal challenge in all was to replace adversarial cultures with collaborative ones.  The construction of terminal 5 at Heathrow airport is held up as a prime example of collaborative working.  Prior to its construction, the British Airport Authority, BAA, conducted a two-year study in which every major UK construction project of over &euro;1 billion completed in the previous ten years was investigated.  The two main areas identified by the BAA as contributing to the general poor performance across all projects were a lack of collaboration among project partners and the clients' reluctance to assume responsibility for project risk.</p><p> The procurement model for the national children's hospital had to align with EU procurement rules and work closely with established government construction contract forms.  Following deliberations over several months, which included presentation of the proposed option to the Government construction contracts committee, the strategy group recommended a two-stage tender process for procurement of contractors.  This process was and remains the accepted best international practice for procurement of large-scale complex projects such as the children's hospital.  Among the clear and defined benefits of the two-stage approach are that it attracted the desired calibre and number of local and international contractors to bid competitively for the project and it enabled tendering to occur prior to the completion of full detailed drawings for phase B, meaning that phase A construction could start two years earlier than if a traditional procurement strategy was deployed, thus allowing the bulk of costs to be secured at 2016 levels, that is, when they were tendered.  It also facilitated early involvement by contractors in the design development process, with critical input on buildability, contractor and supply chain integration, risk management and innovation resulting in the completion of a fully integrated design.  Critically, prior to commitment of expenditure on the main building works there is now certainty on cost and programme, with client and contractor risks reduced or eliminated.  The programme includes delivery of a fully commissioned and quality assured building.  The two-stage tender process has and will continue to foster a collaborative culture, eliminating traditional adversarial and opportunistic behaviour.</p><p> Stage 1 of the two-stage tender process involved the works being bid on on the basis of a preliminary design and an approximate itemised bill of quantities based on that design.  The contractors provided rates for all elements of the works.  Stage 2 included the designers and contractors working together to develop the design to completion.  The tendered rates were then applied to the final bill of quantities produced by our quantity surveyor.  The actual cost is determined by multiplying the final quantities by the tendered rates.  Where there is disagreement between our quantity surveyor &ndash; Linesight &ndash; and the contractors, it is resolved by the independent expert whose decision is binding on both parties.</p><p> Following our meeting in November 2018, the board made a recommendation to the HSE and the Department of Health that the works should proceed as set out in the agreed tender process and that BAM should be instructed to proceed with phase B, the main building works.</p><p> I will go through some of the detail on the cost but we can go into greater detail later on.  I will switch the two around in the sense that I will deal first with the construction costs at a high level.  The sum of &euro;570 million, which was included in the approval of the overall &euro;983 million in early 2017, increased by &euro;320 million up to &euro;890 million.  As I mentioned earlier, we had targeted savings of &euro;66 million.  At the end of the day we achieved &euro;20 million.  That added &euro;46 million to the project.  Statutory issues, such as fire regulations following the Grenfell fire and additional sprinklers, added &euro;27 million to the project.  Engagement with clinicians on the final design added a further &euro;21 million.  Between those three elements, &euro;94 million was added to the figure of &euro;570 million.  In essence, the result of the stage 2 process, that is, the design and development element, accounted for an additional &euro;94 million.  There were omissions in the design at tender stage that were brought into the final design during the design and development process at a cost of &euro;20 million.  The impact of the nine-month extension of the programme and the additional scope added &euro;90 million.  Then, as happens in construction contracts, there were additional claims from the contractors to reflect the changes in scope.  At the end of the day, through the intervention of the independent expert, they were settled and agreed at &euro;22 million, which takes us up to &euro;890 million.  We can go into greater detail on that later.  </p><p> As well as an increase in construction costs of &euro;320 million, there were additional costs of &euro;130 million.  These included &euro;50 million in VAT, additional costs on the satellite centres at Tallaght Hospital and Connolly hospital, staff, site supervision, design team, medical equipment and risk and contingency costs.  The final project cost is now &euro;1.433 billion, which is &euro;450 million higher than the figure of &euro;983 million approved by the Government in 2017.</p><p> Following the Government's approval of the investment decision, the phase B works and the main building works have now been instructed to BAM, with construction works of the main hospital on the St. James's Hospital campus to be completed in mid-2022.  Close to the end of my submission I address benchmarking.  In early 2014, the paediatric hospital board prepared a preliminary budget.  That is detailed on slide 11.  It showed project costs of &euro;800 million.  This was based on advice from AECOM, the quantity surveyors for the Mater children's hospital proposal.  The estimate included construction costs of &euro;2,500 per square metre, which was the appropriate cost at the time.  We were in a deep deflationary period at the time.  We allowed an inflation allowance of 3% per annum in accordance with the trend at the time.  In the AECOM estimate, which totalled &euro;800 million, there was an overall cost of &euro;2,875 per square metre.  An international benchmarking report completed by AECOM in October 2018 concludes that the average construction cost for an international hospital project similar to the national children's hospital is now &euro;5,951 per square metre, more than twice the estimated cost of construction in 2016.  Indeed, this is borne out by information from the industry on the decade up to 2022, which indicates that construction costs for large, complex projects in the Dublin area will have increased by up to 100%.</p><p> The cost per square metre for the children's hospital is &euro;6,500.</p><p>It is above the average of &euro;5,951 per sq. m but not above the maximum costs.</p><p> The timeline to deliver the new children's hospital from the appointment of the board in August 2013 to project completion in mid-2022 is a total of nine years.  I am satisfied that the board and executive team have set about the task in a competent and professional manner, putting in place the most appropriate structures and processes based on best international practice.  If we were to start again on a project of this scale and complexity we would adopt the same procurement approach.  Notwithstanding this we are deeply disappointed and acknowledge the very significant cost increases and the challenges these pose.  There are lessons to be learned regarding the wisdom of pursuing cost reductions on competitive tenders and ensuring the sufficiency of tender information, in particular, mechanical and electrical services at tender stage.  This would have ensured a more accurate prediction of actual quantities and costs at the tender stage and, to a large extent, would have reduced the under-estimation of costs at stage 1.</p><p> With cost and programme certainty now achieved, our focus is on ensuring that all parties work safely and collaboratively and deliver a hospital of outstanding quality in a project of which we all will be proud, namely, one of the finest children&rsquo;s hospitals in the world providing unsurpassed care for the nation&rsquo;s sick children for generations to come.  At the same time, we are mindful of the Government's concerns to ensure the project is indeed delivered within the agreed time and within the revised budget.  We welcome the planned independent review of board&rsquo;s processes and procedures.  Any issues identified will be dealt with speedily and comprehensively in the interests of successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds.</p><p> I thank the members of the committee for their attention.  My colleagues and I will be delighted to answer any questions they might have. </p></speech>

Will he explain why these overruns were not anticipated?  Was it a fault in procurement, tendering or both?  An expression of deep disappointment does not reflect the frustration and anger felt by this committee over what has happened.  We want to find out who was responsible for these failures as this is an unprecedented overrun in one of the largest infrastructural developments in Ireland.  The consequences of these overruns are not confined to the national children's hospital, but will have knock-on effects in all capital investment in our health service over coming years, including the National Maternity Hospital, the national forensic hospital, the National Rehabilitation Hospital, the building of elective-only hospitals as identified by Sl&aacute;intecare, the primary care programme and the replacement of equipment, which is necessary in all our hospitals, as well as the transitional funding that will be required to develop Sl&aacute;intecare reform.  It is not only a question of an overrun in the children's hospital, as it will be extremely damaging to all capital investment of the next few years.  Therefore, I would like Mr. Costello to answer why these overruns were not anticipated.</p> <p>  Second, what has the board identified as the premium for building the hospital at the St. James's site rather than a greenfield site?  There is obviously a huge cost in decanting buildings, as Mr. Costello described it, and demolition before construction was to take place.  </p> <p>  Third, why has the cost exceeded the international average and become the most expensive children's hospital in the world and one of the most expensive hospitals in the world?  What factors have led to that overrun?  Why were they not anticipated?  There are knock-on effects that will affect our health service.  What was the premium for building on the St. James's site?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.440" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Costello" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019011600002#M00300"><p>On the first question, we should be mindful of the fact that we are operating in a hugely inflationary time, having come from the recession through to the period of 2012 and 2013 and the decade after that, as I mentioned earlier.  It is likely that building costs will have increased by up to 100%.  We set out on a journey.  We had a deliberate approach in how we structured the project.</p><p>The two-stage tender process was internationally regarded as the best approach, whereby one goes to the market with a preliminary design and every element of the project identified but the quantities not finalised.  We went through the process and I earlier went through the advantages of going this route.  These are advantages which have accrued now and will in the future so that we are now at a stage whereby, through that process, we now have firm price and programme certainty.</p><p> I mentioned there were two issues in terms of lessons learned around seeking to get cost reductions when there was a competitive tender process.  In hindsight, there was pressure on the budget, mainly driven by tender price inflation, and pressure to reduce the costs.  People must remember that it is a huge project.  It is one of the most expensive hospitals in the world but it is also one of the biggest children's hospitals in the world.  It is important to remember that and because it is big, it is extraordinarily complex.  People might walk into a room and say a room is a room but the infrastructure behind the delivery of that room to deliver a fully digital hospital is absolutely enormous.  At the early stage of the design, the complexity of those services and the quantities involved were not fully recognised within the early stage tender.  That became clear as the design developed over 2018.</p><p> It is important to remember that the quantities that are now applied to the rates we got in 2016 are the quantities that are required to deliver the project.</p></speech>

For instance, there are 5,000 km of cable, of all different sizes, and we have rates for each type of cable but the actual quantum of it was not fully defined in the documentation.  It is now fully defined and, when we learned of the large increase, we sought an outside review to consider if we had over-designed the building.  The feedback at the end of that exercise was that the building is fit for purpose for a modern, fully digital hospital.  The quantities that have come out of that two-stage process are applied to the rates we got at tender in 2016 and that gives us the final cost.  Does that deal with that question?  In fairness, it is complex and difficult to understand because of the quantum but that is the nature of it.  We set out on the journey of doing a two-stage tender, which meant that at the beginning, the rates, by their nature, were approximate.</p></speech>

These are costs that would have occurred on any site.  For example, statutory issues arose around sprinklers and the Grenfell Tower fire and we had to comply with those changing regulations.</p><p> Regarding omissions in the bill of quantities, the scale and complexity of this job is that it has an area of 158,000 sq. m, which is the size of Dundrum Shopping Centre, and within those 158,000 sq. m, there is a great deal of complexity with the 6,000 rooms and the level of services involved.  Mr. Costello has spoken about the digital hospital.  This is the first public digital hospital in Ireland and that comes with cost impacts.  People might ask what is meant by a digital hospital.  It means that we no longer rely on paper records.  Everything is digitised.  We have electronic healthcare records so clinicians will use their iPads and tablets to connect with records.  Every piece of equipment requires an interface with the electronic healthcare records so everything is stored centrally.  That has an enormous impact for the design of the building to ensure there is resilience built into the hospital.  If the IT systems crashed the entire system would go down, whereas in the old days one might have lost a piece of paper.  In all the 6,000 rooms there are multiple data points for pieces of equipment and for staff to connect to, but each of those data points is replicated in case something goes down.  There is an A and a B.  They must go to a separate computer room rather than to the same computer room in case a computer room fails.  They also each need a separate power supply and back-up generator.  There is a huge amount of resilience and duplication in a digital hospital.</p></speech>

We did not design all 6,000 rooms at that stage because that would have taken us a further two years.  We got prices for everything so when our tenders came back in 2016 we had prices for all those pieces of equipment and IT points.  However, the quantities increased more than anticipated through the detailed design development.</p></speech>

Is the witness saying, effectively, he got the price of the cables but he did not know how many he would need?</p></speech>

The design was at a preliminary stage when we went to tender.  That is the way a two-stage tender works.  One brings in the contractors for their expertise rather than bringing them in when the entire thing is designed and then for the next five years the contractors seek to dismantle, in essence, and create opportunities for themselves.  In this case the contractor has worked collaboratively with the design team to finalise the design.  Yes, it is right to say the quantum of cables, taking that as an example, was not known until the full design was done.  I mentioned earlier it is 5,500 km of cables.  That is the quantum involved.</p></speech>

You asked why the cost has exceeded the average.  The average cost of the exercise that was done by AECOM was &euro;5,951 per square metre and in the children's hospital it is &euro;6,500.  The highest cost of the hospitals was &euro;8,000 per square metre.  To answer your question on why it is more expensive, Dublin is an expensive place to build at present but it is mainly because, and I spoke earlier about the vision, we set out to build one of the finest children's hospitals in the world.  It is also one of the biggest children's hospitals in the world.  There are elements in it that cost money.  In terms of providing a truly supportive and therapeutic environment for children and their families, all 380 rooms are private rooms en suite with space for the parents to sleep.</p><p>That is a quantum shift from what we are doing now.  We have also created gardens such as the rainbow garden in the roof, which is the length of Croke Park.  That is about recognising the importance of feeling in all of this.  Dr. Curtis will come in on that later.  We then talk about the sustainability.  It costs more to put energy-efficient systems in the building we are constructing but that will yield huge savings during the life cycle of the building.  We set out to build an outstanding hospital and there is a premium for doing that.  It is fit for purpose rather than too good.  It delivers on what we set out to do, which was to build one of the finest children's hospitals in the world.  </p></speech>

That includes money from other Departments to try to pay for the hospital, as far as we can gather.  The premium is excessively high.  I call Deputy Donnelly.</p></speech>

I have looked at this in some detail and when it comes to the costs I believe that Mr. Costello and the board have failed completely and catastrophically in their job and their obligations to the State.  The original bid from BAM came in at about &euro;640 million.  When the dust has settled, I do not think we are going to see any change from much less than &euro;2 billion.  When this is all done, I think the overspending will be somewhere between &euro;1 billion and &euro;1.5 billion - and it could be higher.</p> <p>  The fiscal space for the entire country last year was less than a billion euro.  Think of the work, the analysis and the oversight involved in deploying that &euro;800 million, or so, while Mr. Costello and his team in St. James's Hospital were spending more than that.  As the Chair said, a Cabinet memo from December began to outline the costs of that.  What will not happen includes additional hospital beds, new emergency cancer and cardiac facilities, primary care facilities, long-term residential units, accommodation in the community for people with disability, new laboratories, new operating theatres, investment in paediatric blood services, the second catheterisation laboratory in Waterford, a new emergency department and cystic fibrosis facilities at Beaumont Hospital and no development of appraisals and early planning for Sl&aacute;intecare capacity projects until 2022 at least.  </p> <p>  That is the reality of the incompetence and failure that I think we are seeing from Mr. Costello and his board in respect of the financial control of this project.  He keeps talking about a figure of &euro;890 million.  The figure the Taoiseach gave to the D&aacute;il was &euro;1.433 billion and the memo which the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, presented to Cabinet referred to &euro;1.73 billion.  Can Mr. Costello tell us the total cost at this stage?  I am not interested in phase one and phase two, above ground or below ground, kit out or commissioning.  What will be the total cost to the State by the time the doctors, nurses and children actually get to walk into this hospital?  Is it the &euro;890 million that Mr. Costello keeps talking about, the &euro;1.4 billion to which the Taoiseach referred, the &euro;1.7 billion stated by the Minister for Health or, indeed, a higher figure than all of those?  </p></speech>

I respect the fact that it is perhaps confusing with so many numbers.  It is certainly complicated.  When we talk about the contract with BAM, that is a figure, excluding VAT, for the construction of the national children's hospital at St. James's Hospital.  It does not include the satellite centres or design fees.  When we speak of the tender for BAM, therefore, that is solely for the construction costs and not an overall development cost for the project, which includes not only the national children's hospital at St. James's Hospital but also the satellite centres and the associated costs of staff, design fees etc.</p><p>Through the stage two process, that figure of &euro;640 million has gone to &euro;890 million.  We are talking about two different quantums of work when we talk about one and the other.  We are also talking about a shift of risk and getting to a place where there is certainty about a large complex project.  </p></speech>

Having looked through it in some detail, I think all sorts of costs have been left out.  I do not accept the rationale for the benchmarking that has been used, according to which the cost of &euro;2,500 per square metre four years ago now stands at &euro;5,500 per square metre.  The only explanation the witnesses seem to have given is that it somehow has become twice as expensive to build in Dublin.  However, the site cost has not gone up because the State owned the site.  Bricks have not become twice as expensive in three years and labour wages have not increased by 300% in the past four years.  I do not accept this increase.  When this project is finished, the cost per bed to the State will be twice the cost of the most expensive hospital ever built anywhere in the world.  How is it conceivable that the board is managing a project in which the Irish people will have to pay twice as much per bed as the most expensive hospital built anywhere in the world?</p> <p>  My second question on that relates to accountability.  If Mr. Costello was asked by a client to build a high-quality hotel that had to be cost-effective in terms of the capital used and he informed his client two years into the project that on the basis that inflation was high and he had underestimated the amount of bricks, wires, windows, beds and pipes needed, the client would have to pay twice as much for the new hotel as the most expensive hotel built anywhere in the world, he would be fired, his company would be taken off the contract and numerous court cases would be taken to find out what happened.  I am trying to understand how we will end up spending twice as much per bed as the most expensive hospital ever built.  How many of those involved in this project have lost their jobs to date and how many contracts, whether for quantity surveyors, mechanical and electrical works, building or site clearance, have been cancelled due to these cost escalations?</p></speech>

AECOM is a reputable international company with a reach across the world in terms of the data that it collected.  The information it has given us is supported by facts and figures from a range of international hospitals similar to the children's hospital.  At the end of the day, the information it has presented to us, which we are happy to share and which can be interrogated, is that the average cost for building a hospital of the size and complexity of the children's hospital is &euro;5,951 per square metre.</p><p>We are above that figure, at &euro;6,500 per sq. m.  They are the facts and we are happy enough to have that information to validate it.</p><p> In terms of accountability, we are a very accountable group of people.  Our board was appointed based on the skills required to deliver a project of this complexity and scale.  We appointed an executive team, headed by Mr. Pollock, and across the board the expertise on our executive team matches or is much better than what would be seen on any international project.  The project is managed really well; there are experienced people involved in it and we have set about our work in a structured way.</p></speech>

At the end of the day there are strict EU rules that govern procurement.  If somebody has failed to deliver a project or to deliver a project in a safe manner, the contract might be terminated, but so far there has been no basis to deal with any contract in that way because, apart from our management team and board, we now have BAM Ireland, H. A. O'Neill Limited and Mercury Engineering Ireland on our team.  They are three of the five biggest contractors in the country.  We have the resources-----</p></speech>

Hundreds of millions of euro was added because the amount of materials needed to build the hospital had been underestimated.  When it was sought to pull some of the costs back, amazingly, mistakes were not made in the other direction.  Some &euro;65 million in cost savings were sought, but less than one third of that figure was identified.  For example, if commercial companies were estimating the amount of equipment needed to build a hospital and it turned out that they had massively underestimated and given per square foot estimates half of what they are now, would any of these issues trigger legal or commercial conversations where very serious mistakes had clearly been made in design?  It appears that underestimations were made left, right and centre in terms of what was required to build the hospital.</p></speech>

Complexity never seems to mean that costs will go down.  As the Chairman said, complexity is difficult, but it can be anticipated and budgeted for.  However, it appears that it just means underestimation.</p></speech>

That is why the two-stage tender is international best practice.  When a project of this complex nature is started without clarity and without a shared vision or shared input into its design, what happens once it has been worked on for four years - this happens all the time - is that the contractors seek to improve their situation through perceived gaps.  The designers will never close all the gaps.  What we have done here is that we have brought the contractors in early and they have worked together to close all the gaps.  There is now certainty before we commit to the major part of the spend.</p></speech>

While Deputy Donnelly was teasing out the figures, it struck me that, whereas we all know that cost overruns can happen, in this case, the overruns are on a monumental scale.  If I was having work done on my house and the costs were escalating at this rate, I am not sure I would continue with the contractors.  The board seems to have great faith in their ability to deliver, notwithstanding that the costs keep increasing.</p> <p>  This question was asked previously but I want to get to the bottom of this matter.  In terms of the additional capacity for sick children, I fully appreciate and welcome that the hospital will have single occupancy rooms.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation only started to count the number of children waiting on trolleys just over a year ago.  Its figures would lead us to believe we have a capacity problem, which we clearly have.  Is it the case that the sum total of additional beds being provided is four?  Will there be only four additional beds?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.531" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019011600002#T00500"><p>I am happy to answer that question for Deputy O'Reilly.  I agree with her that there are challenges in respect of the existing hospitals which are trying to accommodate and meet care needs.  I want to clarify that children's emergency medicine is different from adult services.  I know that, unfortunately, the reason all but one of the children who are waiting this morning are in the emergency department is isolation.  We have beds in the hospital but they are multiple-use beds and because these children have influenza and other infectious diseases we cannot place them in the wards.  There is an absolute crisis.  We need to get the hospital built as fast as possible because of the additional need for isolation specific to paediatric healthcare.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question on the number being added to the existing bed base within the three children's hospitals, as a total number there will be 68 more beds.  It is important, however, to break down that figure in order that it is understood.  It is not just about numbers, but about the types of beds we are trying to introduce.  The most important figure relates to inpatient and day cases, for which there will be 44 beds.  Within that there are new beds for mental health and for children with eating disorders, of which we currently have none.  Most important, we will also have 60 critical care beds.  This will be the largest critical care unit on the island of Ireland.  It will provide paediatric critical care for all of the sickest children in Ireland.  It will provide the cardiac critical care for the whole of Ireland's services, because we are now providing cardiac services on an all-island basis.  It will also have neonatal intensive care and critical care beds.  That is a fundamental change.  The greatest challenge for us in paediatrics is dealing with critical care needs and getting really sick children transferred from the regions quickly when they need to be transferred.</p><p>There also are the isolation requirements.</p><p> As for what is new, another 24 beds are based within the paediatric outpatient urgent care centres and in the emergency department as short-stay beds.  We have demonstrated and already put them into Tallaght Hospital and we started to do so at Temple Street this year.  I can report that for the children waiting for emergency care, our access for admissions in 2017 and 2018 has consistently reduced throughout the TrolleyGAR system because of these new ways of working.  This hospital will address the critical need for isolation facilities for paediatric care, which has a greater demand for such facilities than in adult services.  This year, we will open up the services at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  By July, we will have opened an urgent care centre and outpatient unit at the hospital.  It will be the first time that there will be paediatric services in north County Dublin that will meet the vast majority of the requirements for that population.  We have major pressures in this area, particularly at the facility at Temple Street, because 124,000 children avail of our paediatric emergency care facilities and 48,000 of them make use of the smallest unit at Temple Street.  We anticipate that from this year, the investment that has been made in paediatrics will bear fruit and reduce some of the pressures being experienced at Connolly hospital.</p><p> We are dealing with a different way of working on the part of GPs.  As we have demonstrated, by having short-stay beds we do not need to admit as many patients as at present and consequently, the initiative should help to alleviate any bed capacity issues.  The initiative will be rolled out in Tallaght Hospital next year and then it will be rolled out in the hospitals.  We have a highly integrated phased approach to how we are going to transform services for children, particularly in the areas of general paediatrics, trauma orthopaedics, in which we have seen significant improvements due to the investment that has been made in paediatrics, and of course urgent and emergency care.  In line with the rest of the system and the Sl&aacute;intecare report, we are increasing the bed capacity but we are doing so in a very niche way.  It is not the same old, same old.  We are identifying and future-proofing where we anticipate the future healthcare requirements are.   </p></speech>

We gave the first phase to BAM Ireland.  However, during the second phase, if there was any reason that we did not want to go forward, including when we checked whether it was the best option for the project, we had the option of not going ahead with the contractor.  Earlier, I mentioned slides Nos. 18 and 19 and Mr. Pollock can explain them if the committee so wishes.  Following all of the interrogations that we did, and looking at the different options that we had, it transpired that the option of choosing BAM Ireland was by a large margin the best choice in terms of cost and certainty.  Given the increase in cost, our decision was not made lightly.  Our decision was based on the work that we had done and we made a recommendation to proceed on that basis.</p></speech>

Is he suggesting that other people could have contributed more to the massive escalation in costs?  Such a claim lacks credibility.  I have read the slides and as I am conscious that our time is short, I would rather that we did not go through them.</p></speech>

If that was me I would find such situation alarming.  If I was tendering for a contract to install a few presses I would wonder how someone else could do the job for substantially less.  I do not believe there are other people who could escalate the costs at quite that rate.  Perhaps they could if they thought they would be given a blank cheque for such work.  The board selected the cheapest bidder.</p><p>The initial figure was just over &euro;600 million.  It is now &euro;1.7 billion.  No one inside or outside this room would be surprised if it reached &euro;2 billion.  Did no alarm bells go off?</p><p> Mr. Costello has been in his position for five and a half years.  In that time, what sort of updates did he give the Minister?  Relatively recently, the Minister said in the media that the cost would be &euro;605 million and that he was fully confident the project would be delivered on time, on budget, etc.  The figure is now multiples of that and could be multiples more.  In terms of briefing the Minister, how many meetings did Mr. Costello have with him, what was the format of such meetings and was the Minister kept apprised of all of the cost overruns?</p><p> If I get the chance, I wish to go through the table that the witnesses supplied the committee in order to get some detail of how these figures were arrived at.  If Mr. Costello was not asking the hard questions about how this was happening, was the Minister not asking them either?  Notwithstanding the fact that we need investment, this is a substantial amount of money and it now appears that, on the back of an assertion that the costs would be controlled and certainly would not escalate at this rate, it will come at the expense of other badly needed projects.</p></speech>

The bid was competitive; it was &euro;131 million lower than the second bidder.  The EU procurement rules are clear in terms of pre-qualification.  Due to the complex nature of the project, we were anxious to get international bidders.  We were fortunate, in that we had a shortlist of five bidders.  We made a decision on the basis of cost and quality, so it was not all cost based.  The criteria were 75% cost and 25% quality.  Before bidding opened, we went through an assessment of quality.  In fairness to all of the bidders, the quality of the bids submitted was outstanding.  When the tendering process opened, the criteria on how to make an assessment were clear.  One follows the rules for months and then awards a contract to the bidder that comes through the assessment of quality and cost.  In this case, it was BAM.  It was a competitive bid.</p> <p>  Due to the way we are structured-----</p></speech>

Mr. Costello is saying that the board was obligated to go with the lowest bid.  That does not make any sense, as people should be looking for value for money, but if the board was not doing so, that is fine.  It was going with the lowest bid.  Does Mr. Costello now accept that it might only have been the lowest bid on paper and not in reality, and that the persons tendering for it were aware that the board would go for the cheapest bid and gave the board an estimate that was not realistic?  It does not stack up that the cost would move from the initial figure to the current one, and perhaps more again.  They would have known that.  They are in the construction business; I am not.  I do not know whether Mr. Costello is either.</p></speech>

They must have had a handle on how the costs could escalate.  When the board was considering the bids, did no one express concern that one of them appeared to be an outlier in terms of cost and might not be able to deliver this project for that amount?</p><p>It was far out of line.  The sum of &euro;131 million is not a small amount of money; it is a huge amount.  If one thinks about the people who are working in the hospital and how long they will have to work to pay the taxes necessary to generate the money to be able to pay for it, one is talking about massive amounts of money.  Did nobody scratch their head and think that there might be something hidden here or wonder how this was such an outlier?  It strikes me as odd that the board would simply opt to choose the lowest price bidder and nobody questioned that.  I would question it.  If it was even a small household project and if a bidder was making a significantly lower bid, I would question it.  I am trying to get a handle on what the thinking was at the time.</p></speech>

We do not have discretion in that.  We cannot say, perhaps, how somebody is thinking.  One cannot use that discretion.  The rules are very clear.  We do not have the discretion one might have if one was doing a project of a smaller scale that was not bound by EU procurement rules.</p> <p>  The tender figure from BAM was &euro;640 million and we have now reached a position where, as we go forward and seek to complete the project by 2022, we have a programme and cost certainty on a figure of &euro;890 million.  The &euro;640 million at tender stage excludes VAT of 13.5% and the &euro;890 million also excludes VAT.  As John Pollock mentioned, that is one of the figures that make up the &euro;1.433 billion.</p></speech>

The person making that bid is using the same materials and has the same criteria.  A reduction of 20% in respect of the nearest bidder is huge so there must be a reason for that.  Did you find out what the reason was?</p></speech>

Ultimately, there are different criteria as to whether it is a balanced bid.  If a contractor decides he is going to provide a square metre of block work at 10% cheaper than the competition, it is very hard to tell him that he cannot do that, or he might say that because he does not have enough work he is taking a 5% reduction on the project overall.  The reality is that contractors such as BAM and the other bidders are professional companies.  They would have put several hundred thousands of euro worth of work into preparing the bid.  At the end of the day, the bill of quantities was presented in a very professional format.  The bids came in during August 2016 and we only finally got through the assessment in March 2017.  A period of six months went into the quality and price assessment.  Unless one had very clear grounds, one would end up in court for two or three years if a contractor decided he had not been treated fairly.  In this case, from a quality and price point of view the tender was professional, as it was for the four bidders.</p></speech>

They were bidding for a very lucrative contract.  I asked Mr. Costello another question in respect of the Minister.  At some point in the proceedings, I would like to think someone in the process put up his or her hand to ask a few questions.  If it was not the witnesses, then maybe it was the Minister.  The Minister made public comments on the costs and he has now been entirely contradicted by the information we have at the moment.  It remains to be seen how large that contradiction will grow in the future.  How was the Minister kept apprised?  How was it ensured that he was briefed?  How many meetings were there?</p></speech>

The board reports in to the children's hospital project and programme, CHP&amp;P, steering group which meets monthly.  That in turn reports into the children's hospital project and programme board which meets bimonthly.  Our reporting on a monthly basis is through what is known as the CHP&amp;P.  Feedback is all done in respect of the board.  We meet every month.  For the period from the middle of last year up to the end of the year we probably met every week.  We did that because for months it had become clear that there was a challenge with the costs.</p> <p>  We first had to try to understand the basis of it and then work with our professional teams, our executive team and with the professionals we got externally to review it to ensure, as I mentioned, that we were not overdesigning the building and that the stage two criteria were being applied properly.

It goes back as far as late 2017 when the issue on the sprinklers was raised.  I referred to a sum of &euro;61 million earlier.  When that was presented as a possible additional cost to the CHP&amp;P, we got into a two or three-month phase of challenge in respect of what we could do to ensure that we did not go above the &euro;983 million.  We looked at many different things.  There has been a major ongoing challenge to keep costs to a minimum.  The structure is tough and it is robust.</p></speech>

Our sense at the time was that it might have been overdesigned so we commissioned one of the leading companies in the UK, DSSR, to do a full review of the mechanical and electrical services in order that we could confirm that they were fit for purpose.

Mr. Costello can see how it looks to other people because of the phrase that when one is in a hole one should stop digging but when there is a massive cost overrun, if one attempts to spend his or her way out of that, it does not look right to people.

Arup is our designer and we needed an external professional view and that was part of our due diligence.  The board took its decision very seriously because we had the option not to proceed with the project.  In a way that might have been an easy way out because we could have said that it was too expensive but we spent four or five months analysing this in every possible way so that when we came to our board meeting in November we could make this decision.  It was an enormous decision but it was not made lightly.  It was made on the basis that, despite the fact that the ultimate cost of the building was far higher than we expected it to be, we made a recommendation that we should proceed with it.</p></speech>

I will speak to them twice because I understand they will also appear before the Committee of Public Accounts on 31 January.  This was a major topic of conversation over Christmas and the new year when politicians have time to reflect and talk to people at length.  This will be a case study for years to come.  It will affect future projects, as the Chairman outlined, and it will have a considerable impact on future capital projects in health.  I was a member of the Government that made the decision to build the new children's hospital and it was the right decision.  I was a Minister of State when the then T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, and then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, allocated approximately &euro;450 million for the project and I was part of the Government that made the decision to go ahead with the project.  I would not have been part of a Government that would have made a decision to go ahead with a new children's hospital for &euro;1.7 billion because the impacts on other health capital projects would have been so dramatic.  We would have had to rescale and review the project and there is no way any Cabinet would have signed off on it in any way shape or form for anything near that figure or for even half of it.</p> <p>  I note the Taoiseach's recent comment, when answering questions about the hospital, that he had to choose his words carefully.  He indicated he believed the costs should have been anticipated and noted that this was the first time this model had been used to build something like this.  It was, he said, being done by a dedicated build board set up by legislation.</p><p>He said it was very disappointing that this had happened.  That must concern the delegates.  I believe the Taoiseach was being polite in his language because it was obvious to everybody in the Chamber and among the public that he was extremely annoyed.  As legislators, we are extremely annoyed.  Frankly - I am united with others in this - we will not stop until we get to the bottom of what happened.  We must learn from it, but we must also have accountability, given the scale of the overrun.  Members of the public are enraged and want to find out about the entire decision-making process.</p><p> Will the delegates remind us how the board is constituted?  On the reporting mechanism, I sensed that they were very uncomfortable with Deputy O'Reilly's second last set of questions.  Will they enlighten us on how the reporting mechanism works?  I presume the board is constituted as a public entity.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There are a number of critical decision-making milestones in the project.  Obviously, there is the awarding of the tender.  I have major concerns about the scale of the undercut by the contractor.  It sets off alarm bells.  There are examples in other projects, even large-scale projects, in this country which are well known.  That was one critical milestone.  Another was when the cost escalated to &euro;983 million, or whatever the figure was, and the decision to proceed.  Awarding BAM stage B of the contract was a critical decision and a milestone.  Then there is the escalation to &euro;1.4 billion and subsequently the Government memorandum refers to a figure of &euro;1.7 billion.</p><p>With regard to all of these junctures, I assume there is documentation which the board will be providing to this committee or to the Committee of Public Accounts about how this was communicated up to Dean Sullivan, who obviously needs to come before the Committee of Public Accounts, and to Jim Breslin and about the decision-making which will be described in the communication.  Will the board provide the committee with all of that relevant documentation in the next week or so?</p></speech>

That is a very honest answer.  I thank Mr. Costello very much.  The information behind those critical decisions will, dare I say it, help the board because, from a transparency point of view, it will help us.  We just need to get to the bottom of this.  We also, on behalf of the taxpayers, need to get to the process behind making a decision to proceed at the very top, from a Government perspective.  I know how it works at Cabinet.  I have been there.  We need information on those critical junctures, the decision-making, and the documentation that went up to Dean Sullivan and, subsequently, to Jim Breslin.</p> <p>  When it comes to those critical decisions, and particularly the decision to award the stage two contract to BAM, on what date was that decision taken?</p></speech>

As politicians, we deal with the HSE all the time.  I had been warned for months that I might as well forget about the 60 bed unit in Limerick hospital and the 50 bed unit in south Tipperary, both of which would be of concern to my constituency, about the national maternity strategy, about a rake of other issues in respect of primary care and all of that because they were gone.  I was told they would be profiled.  That is how the politics of it would work.  They would happen and they would be announced, but they would be profiled out over a number of years because of this overrun.  The communications in this regard went up through the system to Dean Sullivan on that date.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Prior to the signing of contracts on the urgent care centres at Connolly and Tallaght hospitals, two of our mechanical and electrical contractors got into financial difficulties.  One went into examinership and the other was liquidated, so we had to revert to the second-ranked candidates.  Prior to signing contracts with BAM Ireland, Mercury Engineering and Jones Engineering in regard to the mechanical and electrical, we had to align their programmes.

I do not accept that this is international best practice because of the circumstances in this case.  When it comes to best practice, we are not comparing like with like.  It is not apples and apples and oranges and oranges, it is a completely different jurisdiction so there is no best practice.  This is the first time ever and to be frank, we obviously have failed massively.  There are learnings here but best practice does not cut it.  The line that is being thrown out at political level to the effect that we are delivering the best children's hospital also does not cut it because the consequences for other capital plans and for people's health in this country are catastrophic.</p> <p>  I will come back on this but we need to get into the decision-making process to proceed with BAM based on the fact that it was so far under everyone else in its pricing and the escalation of costs that has resulted.  The &euro;983 million did not include ICT, electronic health records, EHR, family accommodation and a whole range of other things.  Politically, I am not sure how aware people were of this.  They were not aware of it in any way, shape or form.  When an announcement was made that &euro;650 million was to be spent on a hospital, that was seen as the cost of carrying out all of the work and cutting the ribbon and that is what people thought, including the witnesses.  That is what at least 95% of the members of this committee and the public thought was happening.</p> <p>  I have a specific question on governance.  On the actual specifications, Mr. Costello said in response to questions that the cost escalated because of the specifications, the requirements and the tightening up during phase B.  How were the requirements for the scale and expense of the requests for facilities that were being put forward by the current hospitals that are a part of the group coming through validated?  In future, I want to see each and every request and how it was validated.</p> <p>  I refer to the hospitals that are coming together to create this new hospital.  They obviously have requirements and that is fine but how did we validate the scale, the necessity and the cost of same?</p></speech>

Currently, there is very significant unmet need.  There are very lengthy waiting lists.  Some 45,000 children are waiting to be seen at an outpatient clinic, of whom 17,000 have been waiting for longer than a year.  There is probably a waiting list of between 12 and 18 months for a magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, scan for a child.  There are significant waiting lists for children who are waiting for non-urgent surgery, that is, elective surgery.  There are extremely long waiting lists, sometimes lasting years.</p></speech>

It is a specific question concerning private practice.  What facilities in the hospital are being built to be used to provide for care and treatment for children by clinicians in private practice?  What is the cost?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.665" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Emma Curtis" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019011600002#DD00700"><p>I can respond to that question.  The new children's hospital is 100% composed of single rooms, so no differentiation is made between a private ward and a public ward in the way there might be in an adult hospital.  Currently, the consultants we have in the hospitals have type B contracts, which means they are entitled to attend to outpatients in the hospital.  We have nine outpatient suites which are meeting that requirement.  Paediatrics has considerably less private practice than adult medicine.  I have to bow to Mr. Pollock, who knows what the construction contracts are.  However, that component is very small and it meets the contractual obligations we have in employing those consultants.</p></speech>

Could we get a breakdown of the 6,000 rooms?  We discussed the number of beds and the number of day-care facilities.  Could we get a breakdown in respect of the 6,000 rooms?  The general public believes that all that is being built for the hospital is 470 rooms.  I would like some clarification on the breakdown and purpose of the 6,000 rooms.  I understand there will be a need for medical personnel.  It might be helpful if the witnesses gave us an idea of how many clinics would be running at any one time when the hospital is fully operational, taking into account that there will be 6,000 rooms.  That is my opening question.</p></speech>

The committee members have that.  Sharing that information is no problem.  With regard to how we deliver paediatric services, it is important to understand that the vast majority of the services we deliver are outpatient-based services and emergency and urgent care.  The committee will note that in the planning for this hospital we have seen significant increases in provision for outpatients.  We would have a total of 141 outpatient rooms.</p><p>They are spread between the outpatient centres in Connolly and Tallaght in addition to the new children's hospital.  The vast majority of services can and should be delivered in paediatrics on the same day through outpatient facilities.  Again, that reflects how we are moving, with Sl&aacute;intecare, to much more nurse-led and health and social care professional-led clinics, not just consultant-based clinics. </p><p> We have considered the activity and planning and projected the future requirements and we have mapped them into the particular rooms.  We can give the members a breakdown because the mapping is based on different specialties.  Let me give an example.  Some clinics usually involve once-off visits.  Some 25% of the population are children and because we are dealing with all those with the tertiary needs and those who require the high-end specialties, many have multiple appointments.  Sometimes they come to our hospitals and spend the whole day going between the various specialties.  The cystic fibrosis children take up the whole day in one room because we do not mix them with others for infection-control reasons.  Sometimes one child can take up a whole day in clinic.  The breakdown accounts for this.  The activity and planning analysis can map this.</p><p> It is important to note a children's hospital is different from an adult hospital and needs very many auxiliary supports.  We have facilities for parents to stay in the hospital close to the critical care, or what we call "within dressing-gown distance".  The mothers and fathers and other family members are with critically ill children and we need to support them.  This is different from other cases.</p><p> It is important to note that the hospital is to be the only one educating future healthcare professionals in paediatrics.  All the undergraduates in medicine and nursing and the health and social care professionals will be based there.  The hospital includes the education centres to facilitate this.  We have developed these with the universities.  All seven universities will have some association with the hospital.  That has to be taken into account.</p><p> One must consider the sheer volume of support required.  In our planning, we have prioritised to ensure that all the clinical requirements are met.  We have sought and optimised the support structure.  That was one of the benefits of being co-located on a large medical campus, namely, the 50-acre campus at St. James's.  We have managed to achieve some efficiencies in this regard through shared services.  We are utilising services that are for the whole of the campus and not just for the children's hospital.  We have actually built in capacity to take on the maternity hospital also.  All these factors need to be taken into account.</p></speech>

An example concerns the assessment areas in the emergency and urgent care centres.  There are 54 assessment areas.  Those are really important.  That is how we actually get the children in and out in a timely manner.  We have ten assessment cubicles.  They are all single in keeping with the nature of paediatrics, which requires isolation.  There are ten even in the satellites and there are 34 in the emergency department.  Even with all those, there are treatment rooms and other supporting facilities that are important.</p> <p>  I assure members of the committee that we have had three external reviews of our activity and capacity.  These were commissioned by the HSE in our early stages of planning to test the robustness of the clinical planning and the requirements.  I give assurance on the requirements.  I am happy to give a breakdown and demonstrate how much of the hospital concerns the clinical aspect.</p><p>It is complicated because even the 60-bed critical care ICU will be the largest unit of its kind.  Many support rooms are needed around such a facility, including mechanical and electrical.  We can happily break that down for the Senator.</p></speech>

We anticipate significant increases in that, particularly because, as Dr. Curtis already identified, we have significant challenges around access to some paediatric services.  We have anticipated that the activity for our inpatient department will involve 24,000 cases annually and that there will be 26,000 day cases.  We anticipate there will be over 124,000 emergency department cases.  I can break those down into daily rates.  It would be a good point to demonstrate.</p></speech>

This will significantly help deal with our current challenges.  We know we have challenges with outpatient access.  This year alone, we will be able to offer an extra 7,500 outpatient facilities.  We will see the benefits of this investment starting this year, along with other service developments.  This is about how we are transforming the delivery of services to children.  While we are cognisant of the investment involved, from the perspective of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland we are confident the children and families, as well as the taxpayer, will see the benefits of this investment, starting from this year.</p></speech>

When the tenders were submitted, is it correct that a bill of quantities was also submitted as to how the costing was broken down?  Was the listing for each item the same for all contractors or was there a variation?  Did that variation mean a contractor which was including less in its tender document could, as a result, tender at a cheaper price?  I have been involved in a legal capacity in arbitration proceedings in building cases and I am very much aware of cost overruns.  I know where something was not specified, it becomes an additional item and normally costs far more than what was originally tendered for.  From Mr. Costello&rsquo;s own experience, he is also aware of the arbitration process.  Will he provide some clarification on this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.687" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Costello" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019011600002#FF00900"><p>It was not the first time a two-stage tender has been worked.  It has been used by the National Roads Authority, NRA, in early contractor involvement, ECI, contracts, as well as being used widely in the private sector.</p> <p>  In this case, we made a decision to get our quantity surveyor to prepare the bill of quantities.  It was not prepared by the contractor.  Accordingly, everyone is working off the same basis.</p><p>A bill of quantities went out to the contractors and a check was done to make sure a fair rate was applied to every single item.  The Senator will know from his own experience that there are arguments as to whether it is &euro;15 or &euro;20 for a four-inch block.  In this case, when the check was done on all the bill of quantities, it was deemed that the tender from BAM was balanced.  It was competitive but it was not below cost.  It was deemed to be a reasonable tender supported by a really high-quality bid.  BAM was not just bidding on a bill of quantities basis.  It had to set out how it was going to approach the job across all the different disciplines of health, safety and environment.</p><p> One thing on the positive side that was prescribed here relates to the local community benefits package.  We have always set out that the project should be a legacy project.  It is of such a scale that it should obviously be a legacy for childcare in the future but also for the local Dublin 8 area and the city generally.  Within the contract were things as diverse as the local employment benefits, but the quality of the submission that came back from BAM, and indeed the other tenders, was outstanding and supported its commercial bid.  I confirm that the bills of quantities priced by each of the bidders was the same bill of quantities.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.690" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Costello" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019011600002#GG00300"><p>They would, because many of the additional costs here are in mechanical and electrical services.  While we have had a lot of discussion about the main contractor and the fact that there was a competitive tender, a lot of the additional cost is in the mechanical and electrical packages.  People should have comfort and we are happy enough to share this information.  No more than the rules of EU procurement are very prescriptive, the rules around stage one and the bill of quantities, the development of the stage two process, and ultimately the finalisation of the contract price are also very prescriptive.  The revised quantity in the bill of quantities is prepared again not by the contractor but by our quantity surveyor.  The Senator will know that nowadays, with the benefit of building information modelling, BIM, and because of the complexity of this, the BIM model, in essence, takes the uncertainty out of it.  The BIM model will prepare the bill of quantities in association with our own quantity surveyor so there cannot be arguments over measurements because the BIM model verifies the quantities.  The ultimate quantity of every element of the job is absolutely clear.  This really complex BIM model means that someone can press a button to ask how many single doors are required and that information is there.  There is nothing ambiguous about this.</p> <p>  It is also important to note that of course there were some arguments, but within the contract it was agreed that the independent expert would adjudicate on those and his finding was binding on both parties.  At the end of the list here is an amount of &euro;22 million for the contractors' additional claims, but they are predicting all the challenges there will be on this project for the next four years.</p><p>Obviously, they are protecting their risk but, ultimately, a process was in place through the independent expert to deal with those.  </p></speech>

Could far more have been put into the original bill of quantities that was sent out to builders?  Mr. Costello talks about the additional costs associated with mechanical and electrical services.  Could far more have been put into the original bill of quantities when tenders were invited?</p></speech>

One of the lessons learned concerns the complexity of mechanical and electrical services.  There are 24 different systems across mechanical and electrical services from duct work to pipe work to medical gases and so on.  In respect of the 5,500 km of cable, there are different sizes of cables and we have rates for all of them.  As Mr. Pollock mentioned, in respect of a digital hospital, it is not just about having a socket on the wall, it is about how the cable is distributed within the building and back into the data centres and switch rooms after that.  There was significant complexity involved that took two years to develop.  We went out to tender in June 2016.  We eventually had the mechanical and electrical design completed in mid-2018.  An option we considered in 2015 was to go on the basis of completed design and then go to the market.  We would have been going to market two years later at a time of high inflation.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for coming along this morning.</p> <p>  This project is an emotive project nationally among professionals and the general public.  Anybody who has spoken with the parents of sick children over the past 20 years will say always that there is a burning requirement for a modern hospital.  In fact, the argument and debate has taken place over the past 20 years with little progress.  I mention that as a backdrop to what we are talking about now.</p> <p>  Tendering, particularly in relation to inflation, is a sensitive issue at present.  It does not take too much inflation in a particular area to increase suddenly and dramatically the cost of a project.  There are one or two questions that I would put.</p> <p>  First, in the number of tenders received, will the witnesses remind me what was the difference between the lowest tender and the highest tender, and the extent to which the specification was observed in each?</p> <p>  Another question relates to the &euro;890 million plus the ancillaries that affect other locations and sites.  Is the cost likely to increase further under any of those headings and, if so, to what extent?  I refer to the &euro;1.4 billion eventual cost.  To what extent can the cost be retained at that?</p> <p>  It is &euro;890 million excluding VAT.  I thought there was a clause somewhere that VAT was not chargeable on some State projects.  How does that apply to this case?  If one is building local authority houses, it does not apply anyway.  Maybe we could get clarification.  How much would the VAT be?  I do not want to get a calculator.  It is not too difficult a job but it is a contributory factor.</p> <p>  Were the various bids in any way date conditioned?</p><p>In many cases it is usual to specify that a bid will last for a specified time and then there is a question of what it will cost after that time.<br/><br/>Is the project in accord with international norms regarding the specification for hospitals of different categories, A, B, or C, for instance?  I ask because if we want a state-of-the-art world-class hospital, and the parents of sick children want nothing less than a world-class hospital, then we must be careful not to dumb it down before it even starts and create a situation where we expect to get it for half price.  It will not work that way and we will not get what we are looking for, which is the highest possible standards of care for sick children in the future.<br/><br/>To what extent did the hospital's internal quantity surveyor and evaluation show any discrepancies?  Did a discussion take place <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the various tenders?  Were they compared and if so, how?  Was it pointed out that tenders A, B, or C, had more or less than was required and so on?  <br/><br/>Was a request made or recognition given to the impact of inflation on various building works, whether it was in construction, electrical works or whatever and if so, what were they?  Were they marked as being of a particularly sensitive nature?  To what extent were they likely to change over a period of years?<br/><br/>How satisfied was the evaluation team that it was dealing with the best that could be done and that its efforts were not upstaged by any of the bodies involved seeking to increase the cost extent, scale or value of the project beyond what the board itself required?  <br/><br/>I am aware that since last July, the group has spent considerable time discussing what would be done next after it discovered the price overrun.  By what amount did it overrun in the period between July 2018 and November or December?  There definitely was an overrun during that period so was it wise to delay at that stage beyond acknowledging that there were cost increases in excess of what had been anticipated?<br/><br/>Were the cost levels anticipated at every level and potential increases identified at an early stage?  I refer especially to the lowest, middle and highest bids.  Is the board satisfied that at all times that each body which tendered was <i>ad idem </i>with its intention, namely, to put in place the most cost-effective building and facilities in line with the project's specification and regulations?<br/><br/>I am sorry to link all the questions together but it cannot be helped. </p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Pollock to deal with the challenge of whether it was wise to delay and the exercise we undertook to look at the options.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.704" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Pollock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019011600002#PP00100"><p>To return to the Deputy's question, in the middle of 2018 the cost overruns were starting to arise.  At that stage our board requested that the executive go back and look at alternative options for the project, conscious that we did not have to award the phase B works to BAM Ireland.  We had the option to tell BAM Ireland to complete the phase A works and go back out to the market so it did not have any entitlement to get the next phase of the project.  It was important for us to conclude the process to say definitively what the overall cost of the project was and in parallel with that, to look at what our other options were.</p> <p>  We looked at two other options, one of which was that we now had a totally completed design with all 6,000 rooms fully designed and detailed.  We had a fully detailed specification and bills of quantities, and everything had now been itemised out so we could have gone back out to the market with that and re-tendered the project.  The issue with that was that it would cost a further &euro;300 million, additional to the &euro;1.4 billion we are reporting today and it would also delay the project by up to two years.  We looked at a traditional model of procurement in going back out to the market and we looked at a construction management model of going back out to the market which might have saved us some time but this had not been done under the public construction contracts and an increased risk would fall back to the client.  Having done that evaluation, it was clear that far and away the best option remained to award phase B to BAM Ireland, notwithstanding the cost challenge it poses.</p> <p>  The HSE carried out its review of that process as well as our internal review.  We met with the HSE and we presented to it over two days challenging whether that logic still held up but the clear recommendation was that it would delay the project further and it would cost more so the best option in procurement was to award phase B at that stage.  That was the decision our board made in November 2018 which was subsequently approved by Government in December.</p></speech>

We shortlisted five companies to tender for it but notwithstanding that, in the end we only received four tenders.  The perception was that contractors would be falling over themselves for a project of this size but we only received four tenders.  However, it was important for us that we had managed to get international contractors.  Three international contractors made our shortlist, which sent out a message to the marketplace that this was a competitive process and that there would be high quality companies from abroad, which obviously delivered a competitive price at the end of the day.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, the contractors and the design team worked together to develop the design to completion and to remove the risk because risk ultimately comes back to the client.</p><p>We are pleased to see that the HSE has commissioned a review of the stage two process and the determination of the final cost.  That is due to start next week and will be carried out over an eight-week period.  That is another level of due diligence that will happen on top of the due diligence we have done ourselves.</p><p> In evaluating the tenders our quantity surveyors go through the bill of quantities line by line for every item.  They carry out an analysis, in this case across the four bidders, to see if there are any outliers in costs, percentage add-ons or whatever.  That is why the process took a long time, from October 2016 when the bids went in to the final award in February 2017.  Before the contractors know where they are placed, there is an opportunity to seek clarifications.  A very detailed questionnaire goes back from the quantity surveyor to each of the four bidders seeking a document clarifying perceptions.  For instance, if an item does not have a price, it will clarify whether the price is deemed to be zero.  There is a due diligence process that goes on around that.</p><p> There was a very robust process to make sure that at the end of the day they were in line.  In the case of the lowest bidder, because it was very competitive, its tender naturally got a lot of scrutiny to make sure there were no gaps in it.  If there were gaps, they were clarified to make sure that as we went on to stage two, the information gathered in stage one supported the proper development of a final price.</p></speech>

Within the programme that we laid out in the tender documents it was specified that while the contractor was completing the phase A works on the ground there would be a period of approximately a year to conclude the second stage, which is the phase B works.  That would then conclude.  That timeline was set out in the contract.  We did not pay any additional cost in relation to the programme and timelines.</p></speech>

Has the board also carried out an evaluation of inflation costs in construction, in building works and in electrical installations generally, both here and across the globe?

I presume the witnesses were conscious of that anyway.</p></speech>

If a contractor failed in any way during the construction project, it would have a major impact.  It was reported across the water that Carillion was building the Midland Metropolitan Hospital in the UK and because the firm went bust, the project will overrun by an estimated &euro;300 million and be delayed by a further three years.  People do not fully understand that consumer price inflation is very different from construction tender inflation.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland publishes on its website construction tender inflation figures on a half-yearly and yearly basis.</p> <p>  People say costs do not come down but they do at times.  From 2007, when the construction industry was running full steam ahead, the fall in tenders to 2010 was measured at 50%.  If a party bought a project in 2007 at &euro;100 million, in 2010 contractors would price it at &euro;50 million.  That is a major drop and people at that stage were trying to buy business and protect their organisations.  They were trying to use their balance sheet to trade.  They were looking to avoid adversarial claims in their approach to projects.  From approximately 2013 onwards, construction inflation started to rise at 3% and it has been trending now nationally at approximately 7%.  In Dublin it trends higher than that.  Our construction contractors priced the job in 2016 and they have absorbed the risk to date on the project.</p></speech>

The phase A works - the basement works - were done with the contractor having risk.  That will be completed on budget in the next few months.  That part of the job has gone well.  Again, one might argue it is relatively straightforward as it is digging a large hole in the ground and creating a concrete box in that but we are going to the next phase in terms of risk.  Given the size and complexity of the job, the contractors have undertaken a very substantial risk for the next four years.</p></speech>

It would be pretty obvious to BAM Ireland that there was no possibility it would not get the second phase.</p></speech>

Part of the current cycle is the characteristic of it being so inflationary, and as Mr. Pollock has stated, a two-year delay carries a tag of 6% or 7% per annum of an uplift.  If we were in a deflationary cycle, as we were post 2007, it is likely we would have made a very different decision.  As I stated to Deputy O'Reilly earlier, the analysis that was done prior to making the recommendation to go ahead factored in all of this.  One could make the assumption described by the Chairman but there is an opt-out clause.  Contractors do not always behave well and if the contractor took a really aggressive approach towards us, we could find while working with the design team that there was no collaboration.  Our contract is based on that.  The right answer in such a scenario is not to go ahead with another phase.  Sometimes this depends on money and we are talking about that today because it is very important.  In order to achieve project certainty, having had it tough to get to this stage of cost and programme certainty, it is important that everybody on the team, including contractors, the client and those relaying the requirements of the Children's Hospital Group, accept that it is fully defined.  Everybody must work together to honour this.  There is a contractual risk and associated responsibility in any case.  People must genuinely work together to ensure we deliver the hospital to a high-quality standard.  In the delivery, everybody should come to work and go home safely in the evening.  These are really important elements.</p></speech>

To go back to the discussion we had with Deputy Durkan, the market is inflationary.  Given the amount of ongoing work, there is pressure on contractors to get tradesmen.  There is an industry rate but in order to get work done, one must pay the cost.  All of that risk now goes on the contractors.  If the electrical contractor falls behind and needs 450 electricians and apprentices rather than 400, it would be at a major risk of penalty if there was an overrun.</p></speech>

The risk has been wholly costed in this and it is being borne by the taxpayer.  If this came in at the average price of a hospital, I would say it was fair enough.  A hospital is to be built and we would have agreed a price that was approximately how much it cost to build hospitals, so the risk would be with the contractor.  The reality is this will be the most expensive hospital built anywhere in the world.  Anybody in the country looking to build a house or extension, or who gets in a builder to do any work, can have a fixed-price contract that will put the risk on the contractor.</p><p>If they have been quoted by the contractor the highest price ever quoted anywhere in the world to do the work, clearly they are being hoodwinked and taken for fools if they think any of the risk, in a real sense, is with the contractor.  I just find it extraordinary that the board maintains we are going to have the most expensive hospital ever built anywhere on Earth but that we are very clever because the risk of the construction costs is with the contractor.</p><p> Will the board release the various reports to the committee?  I would be very surprised if several of the figures we are discussing were like-for-like comparisons.  For example, the board's initial estimate was based on AECOM stating in 2014 that the cost would be &euro;2,500 per square metre.  The size of the project is 160,000 sq. m, which gives a total construction cost of &euro;400 million.  I was a member of the finance committee when the national lottery was sold for &euro;400 million.  The conversation we had was that the &euro;400 million would pay for the national children's hospital because that was the estimated cost.  That is where it all started - at a figure of &euro;400 million.  If AECOM stated in 2014 that the cost would be &euro;2,500 per square metre for a building 160,000 sq. m in size, that gave a figure of &euro;400 million.  The board's representatives have said inflation was factored in and it was.  If one factors in inflation at a rate of 3%, the figure moves from &euro;400 million to &euro;460 million.  AECOM's estimated price would have given us a total building cost of &euro;460 million in 2018, yet the board states AECOM gave it another report in 2018 that stated the cost was not, in fact, &euro;2,800 per sq. m but &euro;6,000.  Somehow, within a short period of four years, the estimated cost per square metre had jumped from &euro;2,800 to &euro;6,000.  I do not believe that and fundamentally do not accept that they are like-for-like comparisons.  The material, labour and professional services used on a project of this size are not all being sourced in Ireland.  They are international commodities.  There is no way the cost of bricks and mortar and the amount of money paid to sparkies, chippies and engineers doubled in a four year period.  I just do not accept that it did.</p><p> There is a second report from Linesight that conveniently states there has been 95% tender price inflation, which fits in quite neatly with the massive overruns we are discussing.  Two international benchmarking studies are also referenced, one of which I presume is the Linesight report.  Can the board release to the committee AECOM's work in 2014 that started with a figure of &euro;2,500 per sq. m, giving a total estimated cost of &euro;400 million, the 2018 figures - somehow the figure moved from &euro;2,500 per square metre to &euro;6,000 - and the Linesight report that states there was 95% tender price inflation?</p></speech>

It is documentation that was submitted to the Department.  Our board was appointed in August 2013.  In late 2013 and into 2014 we were asked to prepare a preliminary budget.  That was the first one to which we referred in which the rate of &euro;2,500 per square metre was used.  The total project cost came in at &euro;800 million.  For clarity, with regard to like-for-like comparisons, when one starts to apply rates in areas, one must bear in mind that we are also talking about VAT on top, the additional costs Mr. Pollack outlined for the satellite centres and all additional costs in design fees and so on.  The Deputy stated a figure of &euro;460 million of the sum of &euro;800 million, but it is important to note that &euro;800 million was the starting point.</p></speech>

One is when there is no collaboration between the different parties involved and it is all done on a contract basis.  For example, the contractor may bid for a job potentially at below cost.</p><p>When one considers the turnover and profits of the top ten UK contractors, five were loss-making last year, in a boom time.  It is an aggressive business.  As Mr. Pollock said, it is a big attractive contract and many of the contractors are well skilled.  They believe that if one enters into a contract with an inherited design, there are loopholes-----</p></speech>

On that point - the profit margin of the main contractor - the initial bid was &euro;687 million.  It would have included a profit margin, an internal rate of return, a return on invested capital or whatever metric the contractor wanted to use.  There will be a net current value of the contract.  Given that there is an additional &euro;450 million and more since - nearly &euro;1 billion more - has the contractor's margin or total profit increased substantially, or potentially decreased substantially?</p></speech>

They may be reduced because of the pressures in the marketplace, but the mechanism is very clear and there is no real opportunity to increase the margin.</p></speech>

I ask the Chairman to request a like-for-like comparison from the board.  There are lots of figures, some of which include VAT, while some do not.  As I see it, there are four big chunks.  Phase A involved the below ground work, decanting buildings, getting the site ready and laying the foundations.  Phase B involves the building of the building.  There is a third piece which involves the commissioning, IT and all of the rest.  The fourth piece is tax, which is not terribly relevant because it is a percentage.  Am I right in thinking the figure of &euro;1.73 billion includes the cost of all of the construction works on the St. James's Hospital site, the satellite sites at Tallaght and Connolly hospital, commissioning, IT and all equipment at all of the sites, as well as all of the training required?  Does it cover everything, or could we potentially meet up here in one or two years when the delegates will say, "Well, it did not include the extra &euro;50 million for IT and the extra &euro;50 million we needed to move the employees across"?  Is every conceivable cost associated with opening the doors of the hospital included?</p></speech>

They are part of building a building.  If the professional fees for building a building go up, that is a construction cost.  Let us take VAT out.  The construction costs have gone up by about &euro;400 million, &euro;420 million or &euro;430 million, excluding VAT.  Would the witnesses mind working backwards - and they may not be able to do it now - on that &euro;1.4 billion?  We are tracking different numbers.  We started with the figure of &euro;687 million from BAM.  That figure then jumped and, by the time the final capital cost was identified, had gone up by &euro;346 million, so we were nearly at &euro;1 billion.  From the original bid by BAM, it then jumped from about &euro;637 million to nearly &euro;1 billion.</p></speech>

Were the witnesses at those meetings making sure that the Minister was kept in the loop, kept informed, and that the concerns of the witnesses were shared with the most senior person within the health arena?  I think we all understand the structure, so there is no need to describe that.  Were the witnesses satisfied that their concerns about the cost overruns had been fully made known to the Minister and he was fully across it back in August?  As there were meetings on a weekly basis, I am sure that would have caused some concern.</p> <p>  A number of the questions I was going to ask have been covered already, so I will stick to the ones that have not been asked.  Who owns the land that the proposed children's research and innovation centre is being built on?  Who will own the building and how will the construction be paid for?  Is it to be paid for through some sort of philanthropic fund?  How is it envisaged that will be paid for?</p><p> My next question relates to the naming of the hospital and the concern regarding a memo brought to Cabinet which alluded to the naming rights being sold.  The Minister moved quickly to say that he would not sell the naming rights for the hospital but he did not say he would not sell the naming rights for individual areas within the hospital.  Does this feature in the board's plans?  Notwithstanding the opposition of other parties in the D&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in believes there is good reason the hospital should be called the Kathleen Lynn hospital.  As in the case of many of our universities, is it intended to sell the naming rights for a particular area of research and so on and, if so, have any discussions in this regard taken place to date and do the witnesses have ballpark figures with regard to investment which they may be able to share with us?</p><p> With regard to the Crumlin children's hospital site, what are the plans for it?  Will it be available to the board?  I would like to return to an issue I raised earlier with regard to the additionality of beds.  Will beds in hospitals other than the three children's hospitals, for example, Limerick hospital, be closed on the basis of bed capacity at the new hospital?  Obviously, this would have an impact on the sum total of beds available for children.  Mr. Costello said in his opening statement that there are lessons to be learned in regard to the wisdom of pursuing cost reductions on competitive tenders and ensuring the sufficiency of tender information.  Will he identify those lessons, perhaps, in detailed follow-up correspondence?  Mr. Costello used the word "disappointment" in his opening statement.  I would use a much stronger word than that.  The lessons being learned are extremely expensive.  Has Mr. Costello communicated the lessons learned to the Department of Health and, if so, is he in a position to share that correspondence with us?  </p></speech>

It is important to speak to the broader health system.  From the get-go, the planning for this hospital has been a whole-of-Ireland approach.  There is a national model of care for paediatrics that underpins the policy position as to why we need to consolidate the high-end tertiary, quaternary requirements into one hospital and for it to be based in Dublin.  Through the HSE, we have been working with our colleagues across the system to ensure that we are planning in a collaborative way around children's health.  We have an integrated care programme for children, such that we engage not only with our colleagues in Cork, Limerick and Galway in the acute system but with colleagues in social care, community and mental health, which is important in terms of the experiences of First World countries with young people and mental health issues.  We have identified that there are services that could and should be done locally in the regional units.  The model of care maps the services that can be done in regional units and the services that can be done in local units and the required resourcing of them.  We have appointed a paediatric network lead, a surgeon, to work with the regional units on the appropriate utilisation of their beds.  This is about transforming children's health care.</p> <p>  The biggest transformation is around ambulatory services.  What we are putting out at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital is testing within the Irish system the feasibility of safely delivering outpatient, trauma, orthopaedic and urgent care in an efficient manner.</p><p>We would envision that in testing it in these units, it is something that the wider system could look at in terms of bed utilisation.  There is repatriation needed from the Dublin hospitals to the regional units, but only in a supported way.  We work closely with the clinician we have put in place in regard to the putting in place of education and supports in the regional units.  Increasingly, we are holding shared clinics in the regional units.  We are trying to keep services child and family centric so that service users can access services locally and only need to come to Dublin as required.  There is no additionality.  Cork has plans for a hospital.  In regard to the plans for the elective hospitals, we have been working with our colleagues in the regional units identifying the parameters that we use for the model of care to try to ensure the most efficient use of bed planning.  Cork is the only region that has identified additional plans.</p></speech>

It is important to record our appreciation of the committee's help in getting the legislation to merge the three children's hospitals through in 2018.  As of 1 January, Children's Health Ireland governs the provision of paediatric services in the Dublin hospitals at Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght and will open services in Connolly hospital in the middle of this year.  Under the legislation, the voluntary boards of Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals had to voluntarily transfer their assets and liabilities to the new entity.  The Crumlin hospital campus was owned by the board and it has transferred to Children's Health Ireland.  We can only use our assets to deliver services to children.  The future use of the campus has not been explored.  We will use it to deliver children's services until such time as the new children's hospital has opened and, as such, it will be occupied for the next four years.  We will have to engage in a planning process in regard to the future use of the site.  Following on from the merger, we see it as a planning option that we will put into place over the next few years.  We certainly have use of the site for the next four years.  Its future use has to benefit the children's hospitals.  That is the condition under which it was transferred and it is the only purpose for which we can use it.</p> <p>  On the naming of the hospital, I am happy to clarify that there is no proposal to sell the name of the children's hospital, which the Minister has confirmed.  We have already reported that there is a process to be engaged in for naming the hospital.  It will acknowledge the work that has been done to date and take into consideration nominations and submissions made.  We intend to kick off the process of naming the hospital soon.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question as to whether there will be an opportunity to have philanthropic fundraising for parts of the hospital recognised, that is up for consideration.  Many of the children's hospitals already do this.  On the children's research and innovation centre, planning permission has been secured.  The lands on which the centre will be built are owned by the HSE and so whatever is constructed on the land will be owned by the HSE.  As in the case of Crumlin children's hospital, funding for the children's research and innovative centre will come from philanthropic fundraising.  We see this as an ideal opportunity for naming one part of the building.</p><p>There are commercial elements that are feasible that we are exploring.  Those are only in the discussion stages and will work through the HSE and the Department.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.846" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019011600002#AAA00200"><p>On that point, I saw a posting on social media from somebody who was outraged at the suggestion that the naming rights for any part of the national children's hospital would be sold off.  The individual wondered, no doubt tongue in cheek, whether we could see the name of a brand of cigarettes being borne by the national children's cancer research centre.  The fact is that once that process is started, there is less and less control over it.  I could point to examples in the third level sector where this practice does not only represent poor value for money but also assists individuals in purchasing a certain amount of credibility that they possibly should not have.  I am referring to very wealthy individuals who, in a very tax efficient manner, channel money into certain causes.</p> <p>  That would concern me.  It could be said that it is done all over the world but we have only to look across the water to see what is being done over there.  We are not replicating that.  Just because something is being done somewhere else does not mean we should be doing it as well.  At this stage, given that the process appears to be advanced, does Ms Hardiman have a set of criteria to ensure that it would not, for example, be possible to have a children's cancer research centre with the name of a cigarette brand or, indeed, an obesity centre branded with the name of a fast food company?  Are such criteria in place?  If so, how were they drawn up and how will they be enforced?  </p></speech>

As part of the exercise we have done, and ultimately the report to the HSE, we have learned lessons.  As always, there were positives as well as negatives, and we identified two in my statement.  I will go through them a little.  On cost reductions, because we are in an inflationary cycle, the tenders received were higher than the pre-tender estimates.  In those cases, people invariably look for cost reductions.  Again, in hindsight, we are referring to looking for a cost reduction at a time when prices were still inflating at 6% or 7%.  A cost reduction might also be an alternative material.  While in that inflationary cycle, however, there is no guarantee that the cost reduction will come to anything and eventually one may end up back where one started.  That was a lesson learned in the cycle.  Those things cannot necessarily be predicted.  They were all done with good intentions and the contractors bought into it, but when we interrogated deliverability over the months, we found it was not possible.</p> <p>  The other question was on reporting.  We were meeting regularly.  I will ask Mr. Pollock to speak on that.  </p></speech>

At that stage, we gave it the quantity to cost escalation of &euro;200 million and stated that we would look at alternative options that could be pursued.  We spent the next number of months completing the two stage process of examining the alternatives.  At the end of October, they both came back stating that was the final price but, notwithstanding that, it was still the best option to proceed with the project.</p></speech>

We now have 473.  Across the sea, there was a report on the use of technology in the NHS.  The witness will find nobody else in here who is a bigger fan of e-health than me.  I say this consistently.  It was one of the things I concentrated on with regard to Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is to do with my background in technology.  There were decreases in clinical attendance as a result in the advances in technology, particularly with regard to children.  Ms Hardiman will have seen the report as it was released a couple of weeks ago.  Surely that will have an impact after we do the figures relating to bed usage, which I asked about in the last round of questions.  I am concerned about the use of technology, the figures I asked about earlier and the escalation.  How do we know all that is accurate?  How do we know we have made the specifications correctly?</p></speech>

I am glad to report we are implementing some of the changes at present whereby we are running virtual clinics without patients having face-to-face contact with the clinician but with the clinicians communicating to them either by telephone or by Skype.  We are also running trauma access clinics, for example, whereby clinicians are looking at the digital presentations and not having to bring the patient in but communicating.  We are demonstrating that, and as part of our planning we included a percentage for where we expect that technology to be.  Where it will increase, however, our clinicians will still have to be in a room communicating possibly with patients at home or with clinicians in Cork or Limerick.  We have identified that they still need to be in a space somewhere.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that there are still 380 beds in this hospital, as was projected at the time.  It is important that one of the things that definitely has deteriorated is our ability to meet our clinical demand.</p></speech>

Like many members of the committee I feel that Irish children have been neglected for a long time at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  I have reason to be there a bit myself, and I often send the Minister for Health photographs of the walls to remind him what it is like.  I look forward to this project reaching completion in 2022.</p> <p>  I am not a big fan of fellows learning on the job when they are getting paid to do a job.  It is quite shocking that Mr. Costello would say that a process has worked well when we are at the price we are at currently.  It is rule 101 that the difference between the tendering price and the contract price must be watched.  Who was watching this?  Was a team of quantity surveyors employed in the initial tendering phase?  Regarding the differential between the tender price and the contract price, I am assuming that a team of quantity surveyors was involved, and I am assuming that all of the work it did was therefore pointless if there was such a difference between point 1 and point 2.  Perhaps Mr. Costello can elaborate on that. </p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly was talking about this as I was coming in.  I missed the start of what she was saying.  Can the witnesses clarify that other than the three bits the witnesses identified as being operated by other people, the land will all be kept under HSE ownership?  Can they also clarify that no external private company will be contracted to provide services in the hospital?  For example, can we be assured that the cath lab, the minor injuries unit, if there is one, or whatever facilities there are will not be run by a private entity?  Can we be assured that we are not going to carve bits out and allow them to be operated by a private medical company despite being owned by the HSE?  It is something we will probably discuss in this term at the Joint Committee on Health.  I have seen an emerging trend of private companies operating in sites with HSE logos over the door.  It is something that concerns me.  Perhaps the witnesses could clarify that for me.  </p> <p>  Mr. Pollock referred to the change in clinical standards.  I assume he is saying that if some piece of equipment or infrastructure that will be of benefit to the hospital comes on board between now and 2022, the hospital will want to move with the times.  Technically, there could be another bill if a new type of magical cable comes out and the board will just have to pay it.  I am assuming as much.  We cannot predict that right now.</p></speech>

I am familiar with this within the system.  Having said that, we will obviously be contracting cleaning, catering and other support services, as would be expected in a hospital.</p> <p>  It is important to add that the hospital has been designed to be flexible in the next 20 years, to the degree that we can project where future technology is going.  That is very important because of the investment being made.  We have contributed to the design and obtained advice from other colleagues that have built hospitals on how to keep the design as flexible as possible because we know that services will develop.  We know that services being provided in the United Kingdom and internationally will be repatriated.  We have projected and identified where new service developments will occur.  I am glad to say we are actually making progress in new service developments that we will be able to accommodate.  While there is a risk and I appreciate new technology is moving very fast, it is important to give an assurance that the investment has been designed to allow flexibility to accommodate the new model of care.</p></speech>

We have identified where the key areas are; they are at the high end of critical care.  We have an ability to increase the critical care unit within the hospital.  The other area is ambulatory and outpatient services.  That is where the biggest changes are.  We have built flexibility into the hospital to accommodate the future projection of healthcare trends.</p></speech>

Skills in the areas of project management, construction, procurement, architecture, engineering and legal matters were sought.  We then employed a really capable and experienced executive team.</p></speech>

I am going through the stages of employing the design team.  Fundamental to it all was a clear process to carry out different stages, including procurement and employing the design team.  The big one, about which we are talking a lot today, was that after a year of deliberation on procurement, we settled on the two-stage tendering process as being the most appropriate for the job.  That was not because we had sat around and said, "This is it," but because it is acknowledged and accepted internationally as best practice in delivering large, complex projects.</p></speech>

I have asked him a very simple question to which I would like an answer as soon as possible because the witnesses or somebody else must have it.  If the witnesses do not have it, we have a serious problem in that the witnesses have not looked at the outcomes in terms of cost overruns in other countries involving the model they state is the best one.  That is my point.  At the start of this meeting, the witnesses spoke about cables.  They had a price for cables.  It seems insane that they had 5.5 km of cable but in their first phase of pricing, they did not know how many strips of cable would be needed and whether it would be 5 x 5 km.  How could they start off a tendering process without knowing how much wire they needed or without having a sum built in for that so that they could say it could go between X and X x 10?</p></speech>

First, we did deep analysis in terms of ultimately deciding that the two-stage process was appropriate for this project.  One thing that is certain and that has been learned in Ireland, the UK and internationally is that the model of traditional tendering where the client designs it without any involvement with contractors has been proven to fail repeatedly because the contractors invariably bid at or below cost and try to exploit the opportunities if there is a looseness in the contract documentation.  It is a very competitive marketplace.  With the two-stage tender, one works on the basis of a preliminary design, the contractor then works with the design team to develop that to completeness and the contractor takes the risk from that day forward.  There is any amount of literature about it that we are happy to share with the committee.</p></speech>

He is saying that the traditional model of tendering was not suitable in this case.  I understand completely.  If there is a theatre, we do not want to say that it will cost &euro;1 million, only for the builder to build it for &euro;1 million and then shave off &euro;200,000 by putting in a cheaper tile, wall or ceiling.  I get that, so Mr. Costello does not have to explain it like this to me.  My problem concerns the overrun and how the board did not see it, the fact that the overrun is so large and that Mr. Costello maintains that this process is the best one but cannot tell me how it worked out everywhere else.</p><p>I think Mr. Costello can understand my point.</p></speech>

We have 3,330 staff within Children's Health Ireland in the three locations of Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght.  We are glad to report that we have been funded for staffing for the opening up of Connolly, which is very helpful, and further service developments this year, which involve badly-needed investment in paediatrics.</p> <p>  Our projections are for 3,663 whole-time equivalents across the hospital and the two paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres.  We have developed a workforce plan to incrementally increase the workforce over the next year as opposed to waiting until the last year.  While we acknowledge staffing is one of the challenges in new developments, I can report that in respect of the model of care we are trying to implement, we have been successful in attracting people back to the positions.  We have advertised 14 consultant posts that have been filled.  I am pleased to say that in general paediatrics, 18 people applied, 12 were shortlisted, four were appointed and we put two on a panel, which is fantastic.  Therefore, we know there is a desire to return to the Irish healthcare system but it must be done in a way whereby there is investment in what is being done and we are transforming and making a difference in how we deliver our health system.  That seems to be able to attract people.  We have also been successful in planning nursing recruitment for the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly and, more importantly, the back-filling within the existing hospitals is well advanced.</p></speech>

We are joined from the Bar Council of Ireland by Mr. Miche&aacute;l P. O'Higgins, chairman; Mr. Conor Dignam, senior counsel and chairman of the council's human rights committee; and Mr. David Perry, barrister.  I understand they may have colleagues in the Gallery I also extend a welcome to them.  From the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, we are joined by Ms Eilis Barry, chief executive; and Ms Sin&eacute;ad Lucey, managing solicitor.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  I will shortly invite the witnesses to make opening statements but first I must draw the attention of witnesses to the matter of privilege.  Please note that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. O'Higgins to make the opening statement on behalf of the Bar Council.</p></speech>

We have put together a submission that the committee may have seen and it conveys the points we wish to make; I will speak to that rather than read it for the committee in order to highlight a few points.  Mr. Dignam will deal with any queries on what we suggest might be imperfections in the Bill as it currently stands but I will speak more to the main point in the submission, which is the suggestion that perhaps the model selected in the draft Bill is not the best way to go about addressing what is an important matter.</p> <p>  I should start by saying that it is to be welcomed that there is a legislative response to the important issue of Ireland being in default with respect to its international obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  It has been made clear in court and Ireland has accepted it in a number of cases.  Perhaps it is boring to say it but it must be said that the root cause of court delays is the fact that our courts are not properly resourced.  There are not enough appointed judges, registrars or support for the judges.  If this persists, it is likely the problems associated with court delays will also persist.  Nonetheless, it is proper to address the concerns raised in the Bill.</p> <p>  The Bill chooses a non courts-based model of providing compensation to those affected by court delays.  The Bill envisages there would be an administrative tribunal or body set up that would be staffed by a retired judge or judges, who would then adjudicate on the question of whether compensation should be awarded, and if so, in what amount.</p><p>The point we have offered is that while it might appear superficially attractive to take the function out of the courts, take it away from lawyers and, as it were, make it simplified and cheaper, and while those are legitimate and proper concerns, we believe that it may not be in the public interest, as we have laid out in our submission.  It may not be the best way of approaching this issue and delivering on the objectives the Bill is directed to meet.</p><p> One of the reasons is expense.  It is difficult to identify a good, valid reason as to why the Exchequer should be hit with the undoubted significant cost associated with setting up a whole new administrative structure, staffing it, paying salaries, paying for clerical staff, paying for an office through rent or purchase, and resourcing it.  For this reason we suggest that this is perhaps not the ideal way to proceed.</p><p> There is a pre-built, existing structure that is very efficient when it is working well, which is the courts.  We make the point in our paper that the Oireachtas, in earlier legislative provisions, decided that the best way to deal with meeting our objectives under the European Convention on Human Rights and providing justice for our citizens across a range of legal areas is to do it on the courts-based model.  For instance, section 3 of the existing European Convention on Human Rights Act allows a citizen who has been wrongly deprived of his or her liberty to go to the Circuit Court to make a case to be awarded compensation if he or she has been locked up unlawfully and suffered the indignity of being put into prison without just cause.  That was a legislative decision made by the Oireachtas, and the Bar Council of Ireland feels that it is difficult to identify a good reason the same model should not be followed here.  It is not known quite how many cases there might be of plaintiffs seeking relief for court delays.  There are likely to be more than those who would seek damages for being unlawfully imprisoned, but there may not be too many.</p><p> This is the other point.  Whatever about the issue of principle, it is difficult to see why it would be justified economically.  The pure, raw numbers make it difficult to see how it could be justified to set up an entirely new administrative structure for what may not be ultimately a large number of cases.  That issue, however, is a little bit unknown.</p><p> At the level of principle and given the potential legal complexity that is associated with claims for compensation for breaches of Article 13 and the right to speedy access to justice, and given that the European Convention on Human Rights has identified that these claims can be really quite complex, although not always, this is an issue that is best left to the courts that are well used to receiving submissions, weighing up competing interests and judging how best to give justice when there has been a breach of rights.  These are routine matters for a Circuit Court, High Court or District Court judge or whoever it might be to add to his or her bundle of cases.  There would not have to be the extra amount of training and costs associated with setting up an entirely new separate structure.  The Bar Council of Ireland believes that this can be properly dealt with under the existing courts structure.  That would be most fair to the citizen and best suited to the public interest with regard to these various headings.</p><p> There is also a risk, if one proceeds down the road of setting up a separate administrative body, that the body itself could be at risk of being judicially reviewed or having complaints made against it on grounds of delay.  It also could be challenged for making what might be thought of as unreasonable decisions if it decides to refuse an application for compensation or if it awards what the citizen feels is too little.  We believe that this is a further stand-alone ground for leaving these cases to the parties that are best equipped to deal with the issues, namely, trained judges who are independent and well used to dealing with legal cases and the complexity of legal issues.</p><p> We have made a number of recommendations in our paper, which members may have seen.  We suggest that these matters be left to the courts and perhaps a similar model chosen along the lines of section 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights Act.</p><p>The idea is simply to create the statutory remedy of going to court and allowing that to be done.  As to which court, it would be a matter entirely for the Legislature of course.  We do not believe there is any particular reason to depart from the pre-existing model of doing it in the Circuit Court or perhaps doing it in the High Court.  That is entirely a matter for the Legislature.  We acknowledge there may be different reasons for choosing whichever comment committee members might make.</p><p> It is undoubtedly an issue that has a degree of urgency in that Ireland is in default.  That is not inconsequential and needs to be immediately addressed.  We believe that delayed claims need to be considered and dealt with properly under the existing and well-provided established structure.  The ideal environment for the fair and just determination of these Article 6 breach claims is the court's model.  By taking that approach we believe there would be consistency in the law.  It is already being done in that way and we do not find the case persuasive &ndash; although it is a matter entirely for the Houses &ndash; for lifting it and creating an entirely new structure.  We do not find that would really be the way to proceed from a practical point of view, from a justice point of view or from a principle point of view.  I would be happy to take any questions on the issues arising.</p></speech>

We are a voluntary independent legal rights organisation that exists to promote access to justice.  We believe access to justice includes not only legal aid but access to the courts, to effective remedies and to fair, just and socially inclusive laws.  We welcome the opportunity to contribute to this pre-legislative scrutiny and we welcome that the matter will be put on a legislative basis.</p> <p>  We also view delay as the major inhibitor of access to justice.  From our work we see that delay arises in several arenas, including waiting times for legal aid.  The most recent figures from the Legal Aid Board show a waiting time of up to 42 weeks for a first appointment in the Blanchardstown Legal Aid Board law centre and more than six months in several other centres.  The processing time for social welfare appeals is a problem.  The most recent social welfare appeals report showed that the average time to process social welfare appeals was 23.6 weeks and 30.3 weeks in the case of supplementary welfare allowance, which is supposed to provide a basic safety net payment.  The most recent report of the social welfare appeals office states that 63.6% of oral appeals were successful.  The Court of Appeal was set up to reduce delay but individuals now must wait for up to two years before getting an appeal heard there.</p> <p>  We are keen for the committee to look at the issue of delay not only in respect of the contents of the Bill but as a systemic issue.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to commission an annual study on court efficiency and sitting times to provide accurate measures for improving access to justice.  We urge that this commitment would be fulfilled.  There is a real need to have accurate measures to measure improvements in access to justice.</p> <p>  A review of the administration of civil justice is ongoing.  It is being carried out by the High Court President, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly.  One of the aims of the review is to improve access to justice.  Clearly, the issue of delay will be looked at by this review group.  We submit that the outcome of this review should be of fundamental interest to the committee.  We ask that the committee would make access to justice a central ongoing feature of its work.</p> <p>  I will comment on the heads of the Bill.   We have seven basic points to make and I will go through them quickly.  Delays that occur before quasi-judicial bodies and tribunals should be included in the legislation.  This is important from the perspective of calculating when proceedings commence and should be taken into account in determining any compensatory remedy for unreasonable delays that arise in proceedings before such bodies.</p> <p>  Whether a delay in a particular case arises directly or indirectly through delays in a related case should not make any difference to the entitlement to apply for compensation and to be awarded it, if merited.</p><p> Our third comment on the heads of the Bill is that the direct linking of any financial compensation payable under the proposed legislation to the principles and practices of the European Court of Human Rights is problematic and undesirable.  We suggest that the removal of specific references to the ECHR and Article 41 under head 8 would provide a more fluid and flexible remedy for court-based delays.  In turn, we could more readily provide a remedy for any breach of EU law that might arise in that regard than the present formulation would allow.</p><p> The fourth point in respect of the heads of the Bill is that, as proposed, the assessor would be a retired judge.  It is unclear to us why there is a need for a requirement for the High Court to approve awards of compensation given that it is also the forum for the determination of appeals under the proposed legislation.</p><p> Our fifth point relates to multiple claims.  The proposed Bill is silent in respect of further delays that might accrue after an award has been made and if the proceedings are not determined by that time.  We believe that the legislation should provide clarity in that regard.</p><p> The sixth point relates to where a case is ongoing in any application for case management before the courts.  We believe that judicial notice could be taken of any determination under the proposed Act by an assessor that unreasonable delay has occurred and the reasons for same.</p><p> The final point relates to costs.  There is no provision under the heads of the Bill for the expenses of making a successful application to be discharged by the State or Minister.  Inevitably, this means that such costs will be taken from the award.  This could possibly undermine the effectiveness of such a remedy.  We are suggesting that this issue could be remedied by providing for a flat fee to a practitioner who assists the client to make a successful application.  Such a measure should, in turn, require the practitioner to undertake not to seek further payment for an award.</p><p> These are our summary comments on the Bill.  Ms Lucey will be happy to answer any detailed questions.</p></speech>

I was simply letting you know that I had to go away.  I need someone from the legal profession, whether I like it.  I am sorry that I have to rush out but I will thoroughly read all the submissions so that we are better informed.  I have much to learn about what it is all about.</p> <p>  I have one question.  The Bar Council briefing suggests the council finds it hard to understand, and does not see the logic in, the State reinventing the wheel by coming up with an elaborate new organisation when we could simply do it using the courts model, which would cost far less and would seem to be far less cumbersome.  Why does the council believe that the Government has come up with the idea to invent a new large entity rather than go down the route suggested by the council?  Why did the Government do that?</p></speech>

In fairness, I imagine they had legitimate objectives in mind.  Perhaps the thinking was to provide it informally in what would be a streamlined way and, bluntly, with no need to involve the lawyers.  I imagine it was out of a desire to make it as straightforward and as cost-efficient as possible.  I suppose that was the thinking.  However, it is our respectful view that perhaps choosing the model they have chosen does not best achieve that objective.  I imagine it was thought that was the appeal of that road.</p></speech>

It tends to go in the opposite direction most of the time.</p><p>Is it not blatantly obvious that this will cost more?</p></speech>

I would have thought it should be obvious, but it may be that the view was, if it was a court-based or court-caused delay, let us lift it out of the courts and have a compensation system for that delay.  We feel that would not be a strong reason to lift it out of the custom-built system that normally adjudicates on the question of competing rights, that being, the courts.</p></speech>

For every laudable objective, there is another behind or ahead of it in the queue.  It is a question of the Legislature choosing between competing interests.  If the ultimate objective is to solve the problem of court delays, that issue is more important than the narrow issue of providing compensation.  The first and foremost approach to tackling the problem should be addressing the root cause of delays, which is the under-resourcing of our courts.  That is the fundamental difficulty.  An holistic approach should be taken and the full problem should be tackled head on, but the issue of providing compensation where delays occur should also be addressed.</p></speech>

Does Mr. O'Higgins know the cost to the State of facilitating the running of the courts system?</p></speech>

Often, these matters would be cost neutral.  For instance, the courts system earns money from court pleadings and filing charges.  The more litigation there is, the more revenue comes into the central office from parties looking to get their pleadings filed.  In addition, the State earns a sizeable income stream from taxation on the professional fees of lawyers operating in the system as well as value added tax on those fees.  This is a point that we sought to make in our proposal to the Government, which thankfully the Government has accepted and decided to support.  That proposal is on attracting in foreign investment and legal services - we call it the Brexit initiative - to prepare for the strong possibility that the United Kingdom will be leaving the European Union at the end of March.</p> <p>  I do not have the exact figure for the cost of running the courts, but we should not lose sight of the fact that many of these measures would be cost neutral or have a positive cost aspect.  Some of the improvements and reforms in terms of adding to the number of judges and resourcing them properly would be self-financing.  It is not all about a bad hit on the Exchequer.  There are positive financial aspects to making these necessary reforms as well.</p></speech>

That commitment has been given and we understand it to be in train.  It will ease the burden, but it will not cure the problem.  It certainly will not address the problem of not having sufficient judges at the High Court, Circuit Court and District Court levels.  It is a start towards that, but more needs to be done under that heading.</p></speech>

It came from across the legal profession, including the solicitors' body and some law firms.</p><p>One of the objectives was to make it known and proclaim widely the fact that many firms, including law firms, chose to litigate their business in London because of the access to a common law country's legal jurisdiction with an overlay of EU law.  If the UK leaves in March or whenever Brexit happens - hopefully, it will not happen - it means that a number of parties, including corporations and law firms, will want to transact their legal business in Dublin.  Without being disrespectful to Malta and Cyprus, we would be the main common law jurisdiction left in the Union and would be an excellent choice for that business, which we are anxious to attract.  That has implications for foreign direct investment beyond legal services.  Hopefully, there will be a move away from London being the hub to Dublin being the hub, at least in respect of part of that business.  It is attractive from society's point of view and from the point of view of the Irish Exchequer.</p></speech>

Generally, people only do that once or twice in their lives.  Some people are lucky and never have to do it.  It is an extremely stressful process.  The good aspect of having the Bar Council and FLAC in attendance is that they are aware of the stress that the invocation of one's rights and having to seek justice can place on individuals.  Sometimes, people on the outside do not appreciate that.  Delay can have an aggravating impact on that stress.  Recently, a woman who was a complainant disclosed her identity in a rape trial.  One of the things she said after the accused had been convicted was that she had found the delay of four years, from her making her complaint to the years spent in the court process, extremely stressful.  There is a purpose behind the provisions within the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, on why there should be a speedy and effective remedy when delay has been introduced into the system.</p> <p>  My first question is for the Bar Council.  I may be wrong but, when we contemplate delays, there are two types in the court system, the first of which is the delay caused by a case not getting on for a period of time.  For example, it might not be listed on the first occasion or the next occasion.  The second type is the delay caused by a judge who, after hearing the case, does not give judgment promptly.  Are those the two types of delay we are considering?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.1034" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Dignam" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019011600002#T00500"><p>Yes, but I will address the Deputy's comments on the stress of court proceedings first.  In many respects, that is what is being directed by the jurisprudence of the ECHR.  An anomaly arising from the heads of the Bill is that a victim or complainant in, for example, a criminal trial who has suffered stress and damage as a result of delays in our system does not appear to be one of the categories of person who can seek compensation.</p><p>In relation to the delays, the two types of delay the Deputy identified are the ones which we have also identified.  These are, as the Deputy stated, the delay in a case getting on because of the shortage of judges or resources in the courts system to enable cases to get on when they should, and also the post hearing delay of a judge not giving judgment expeditiously.  Of course, the latter delay is not the fault of the judge.  That judge finishes one case on a given day, takes up another case the next morning and when he is finished that case, takes up yet another case.  The demands on judicial resources are such that it is difficult for judges to provide judgments in cases that they may have heard two, three or four cases ago within a reasonable and quick period of time such as to avoid any complaint or delay.  Those are the two principal types of delay.</p></speech>

In terms of the delay, what resources does a judge have in such a case to write his judgment?  By comparison, this committee holds hearings every Wednesday morning and produces six or seven reports a year.  Obviously, there are the Chairman and the members, but there are approximately four full-time members of staff assisting them in producing the committee's report.  What support does a judge have?</p></speech>

That is the extent of the backup that is available to our judges.  I suppose the point has to be emphasised that it is, of course, the responsibility of the judge to provide the judgment.  While that support is available to him or her, it is only support.  The process and work of delivering a judgment on a case which may have run for one or two days, or two, three or four weeks, is the responsibility of the particular judge who has heard that case.</p></speech>

We say that because the processes before the courts can be quite mysterious to the particular client.  Clients do not really understand why their case has gone back and another case has gone forward, why their case was put into a holding list while another goes ahead or why they have to wait for the respondent to do something in particular.  In that regard, to make that into a case for compensation will require the lawyers who were involved in the case to sift through those various elements of delay that can happen and waiting, and decide which ones were unreasonable, or which ones to say or claim were unreasonable, or which are not.  We do not see that one will wholly exclude the participation of lawyers and, therefore, make this a cheaper, more accessible system.  That needs to be taken into account.</p></speech>

It is a matter for an individual.  What we are talking about here is an individual trying to have his or her convention rights vindicated.  It is an assessment of whether or not that individual's rights have been breached by the State.  Presumably, the individual is entitled to have lawyers to assist him or her in that.</p></speech>

That seems to mean that an award has to be made in order for the right of appeal for the claimant to arise but, of course, one option which should be available to the assessor or whoever the decision-maker may be is to refuse to make an award.  The way the heads of Bill are currently drafted, they would seem to mean that the claimant may not appeal a refusal to make an award but the Minister may appeal any award which is made.  Once any money is awarded to a claimant, the Minister may appeal but the claimant may only appeal against a certain species of decision made by the assessor.  That seems to us to be inherently unfair in that it deprives a claimant of what is undoubtedly an entitlement and right under any system of law.</p></speech>

In FLAC's experience, there are significant delays in legal aid.  Before people even get in the door of the court, there can be delays of over six months in getting access to a Legal Aid Board solicitor.  The Legal Aid Board solicitors will primarily only be dealing with family law.  Then there is a significant number of people who are trying to recommend themselves who are lay litigants before the courts.  They contribute to delay because they find the whole process so difficult and so inaccessible.</p> <p>  There were serious hits to the Courts Service, particularly IT, during the recession.  There is a real need for there to be considerable investment in the Courts Service, such as the website to make forms and procedures much more accessible and to provide for the lay litigant who may never be represented before the courts.</p></speech>

We do not envisage that there would be an avalanche of such claims, but it is difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy.  There has been one guide to indicate that it is a significant systemic problem, as there have been a number of successful claims in the European Court of Human Rights, before the convention.  Ireland held up its hands in many of these cases and stated, "We are terribly sorry for the delay.  We are going to improve the position and get it sorted".  In the most recent one, as we have tracked in the paper, that was precisely the approach taken.  The court in Strasbourg stated that was not good enough as we had been saying this for four years.  It was acknowledged by Ireland that it had been in violation of Article 13 for a long time in giving an effective remedy to citizens.  This is a timely initiative that we, respectfully, suggest should be refocused.</p></speech>

If we read into the heads of the Bill, it seems to be envisaged that it will be largely a paper exercise in that there is a requirement that the decision be made on the basis of written reports.  There does not seem to be any obligation on the assessor to invite submissions or oral evidence.  We can deduce from the heads of the Bill that it will be a paper exercise and, therefore, carried out in private.  FLAC made a point and it is one that bears emphasis.  The heads of the Bill seem to envisage a streamlined process and we can deduce from them that it is to be largely a paper exercise.  The ECHR has stated the decision as to whether there has been a culpable or compensatable delay is one which involves a degree - sometimes a significant degree - of legal complexity.  On pages 10 and 11 of our main submission which members of the committee can read in due course we identify the considerations the ECHR has stated must be taken into account when deciding whether there has been a delay and what compensation it should attract.  Because of the legal complexity the ECHR has identified in this instance, litigants may require legal assistance, legal advice and representation in order to advance their claims.  It is our submission that it would be dangerous to have any system that would preclude an individual from availing of legal assistance or representation in advancing his or her claim.  That, in itself, could become open to challenge.</p></speech>

The delegates do not have to comment on the matter.</p> <p>  I express my condolences to Mr. O'Higgins on the death of his former colleague, Mr. Garrett Cooney, SC, who was a very fine barrister and played a very significant part in the development of the legal system.

Many issues have been covered, but I would like to ask a couple of questions.  The delegates called for more resources to be provided.  We hear all of the time that more resources would help to resolve many difficulties in public administration and bureaucracy.  Aside from that, can the delegates recommend ways by which the courts structure could be reformed to deal with existing difficulties?  For me, when I consider all aspects of the public service, including the courts system, the provision of more resources is not always the answer.</p><p>In terms of the administration of the courts system, does the Bar Council have ideas, in line with extra resources, on how the Courts Service could reform some of the clear inefficiencies in the system, some of which are caused by judges?  More judges may lead to an improvement but I do not believe it would automatically lead to better outcomes for people who would be affected by this legislation.  I would like to hear some initial thoughts from the witnesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.1075" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Miche&aacute;l P. O'Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019011600002#X00200"><p>The short answer is "Yes".  The Bar Council, as the representative body for barristers, is constantly engaged with the notion of systemic reform.  Yesterday, if not last week, we finalised a submission to a review that is under way at the moment on the civil justice side of the system, not the criminal side but the superior courts civil justice system.  Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, the President of the High Court, is conducting that review across a range of areas, for instance, judicial review, which is associated with supervising the powers and activities of lower tribunals and lower courts in the High Court.  It also includes the whole area of discovery, which is a big issue in litigation, including the costs associated with discovery, the delays that discovery brings and undesirable aspects of discovery.</p> <p>  We very much engaged with the process that is under way.  Various interested parties have put forward their views, not just lawyer groups but officials in the Courts Service and those involved in the system, with a view to trying to achieve efficiencies and improve access to justice, which is really what this should be all about, and also creating a situation where members of the public are informed about their rights so that they are encouraged to go to court and participate in what is a very important forum for the vindication of their rights.  These initiatives take many forms.  One simple path that we are following at the moment is an endeavour to try to make the law less mysterious and use plain ordinary English in legislation, regulations and submissions that barristers make.  There is an encouragement being given to people - I know this seems odd - to actually speak in the English language, rather than in obscure old fashioned legalese which, unfortunately, has been a feature of the system, certainly in the past and perhaps not only in the past.  The aim is to make the system more accessible and relevant to litigants and members of the public so that they will know their rights and have an opportunity to access the courts to vindicate those rights.  That is another project that is very much under way.  Much has been done under that heading but more remains to be done.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that this is not a simple case of calling for more money or resources to be thrown at the courts.  Just as I am sure those advocating for reforms on the health side would say the solution is not all about appointing more doctors, nurses, hospital porters or whomever.  It is about channelling those resources, improving efficiencies and reforming the system so that a better product is delivered and a better service is provided to members of the public.  We are very much aware of that and that is why we have not just called for an increase in resources but, in fact, a correct channelling of those resources.</p></speech>

In 2011, there was the judicial review system for accessing the High Court in bringing challenges to lower courts or tribunal decisions or decisions, for instance, under allocation of housing or social welfare matters and so on.  That system was overhauled and a new one, Order 84, was introduced.  There are further reforms under way to further hone and refine that but that is an important matter.  It is somewhat on a legal footing but, at its heart, it is simply an attempt to make the system more straightforward, understandable and streamlined and less costly.</p><p>That is one example; there is a range of others.  Judges are more aware of the necessity to speak in the English language and to communicate with people.  I do not suggest it is a fully achieved and concluded project, as some lawyers tend to slip into legalese occasionally.  I am sure I am guilty of it myself, inadvertently.  People take the view that the best lawyer is the person who connects with non-lawyers who are, maybe, at the back of court or in the audience.  We are very much conscious of that.</p></speech>

He also mentioned the cost to the State and establishing a structure would obviously involve a cost to the State.  Would the risk and cost to the individual of going to the High Court not be greater than they would be under a new model that could potentially vindicate their rights?  I would welcome the view of FLAC on that question and also on whether people would avail of an informal means of vindicating their rights if the costs and risks involved were lower than they would be if they were to take a case to the High Court where they might not be vindicated.  People fear engaging with the courts system even when they have a clear-cut case.  Perhaps people would be more likely to seek to vindicate their rights through structures outside of the system.  I would welcome the witnesses' thoughts on those points.</p></speech>

We are not suggesting it should be the High Court.  The reason we identified the Circuit Court as the appropriate court is that the Oireachtas has already identified the Circuit Court as being the appropriate court to deal with claims under section 3A of the Act.  From a consistency point of view, we do not see any good reason to depart from the model that was put in place by the Oireachtas as recently as 2014 when the amendment was introduced.</p> <p>  On the substance of the point, which is whether a court based system would be a disincentive to individuals, the first point to note is that there is an appeals process in place.  If the assessor model, as currently framed, is established, an individual can bring a claim to the assessor.  If he or she is successful in that claim, the award is then appealable by the State and the appeal goes directly from the assessor to the High Court.  This means the individual is then dragged into the High Court despite not wanting to be there.  Avoiding a court based model at first instance does not avoid an individual ending up before the courts.  For this reason, it seems to us there is no good reason the individual should not be permitted to go to court with his or her claim.</p> <p>  The second point is that individuals want their claims to be determined in a fair and transparent manner.  As I mentioned, the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, has clearly stated that the question of a delay and compensation for delay is one of complexity.  An individual does not want his or her complex issue to be determined by an assessor on the basis of paperwork and written reports.  Some cases will be straightforward but others will not.  The claimant will want to have his or her say in regard to whether compensation should be awarded.</p> <p>  Equally, the assessor model deprives the State of the right to participate at that first stage.  The claim is submitted and the State has no right to participate or make submissions on whether compensation should be awarded.  If compensation is awarded, there is then an automatic appeal on the part of the State, not to the Circuit Court or District Court, but to the High Court.  There does not seem to us to be the disincentive which Deputy Chambers mentions attached to a court based system as opposed to an assessor system.  It would seem to us that the assessor system provides for greater curtailment on an individual's rights and entitlements to have his or her case disposed of fairly and transparently.</p></speech>

Earlier, the Deputy asked how the courts system could be improved.  The current court system model is predicated on the fact that people will be represented by lawyers.  There is a lot that could be done in this regard in terms of simplifying forms and procedures.  These are matters that need to be taken into account in whatever system is decided on.</p></speech>

Ireland case before the European Court of Human Rights, which prompted the introduction of a civil legal aid system.  There is a huge question as to whether we are in compliance with that decision in terms of our current legal aid system, the number of exclusions, the time it takes to access legal aid and the financial threshold at which a person qualifies for aid.  This feeds into the efficiencies.  There has been an exponential rise in lay litigants going before the court, leading to judges having to spend a huge amount of time guiding the lay litigant through the system and procedures so they can at least get their cases heard.  While judges are very good at doing this, they do not really have the time to do it.  Often, cases are misconceived and people expose themselves to cost, which if they had had access to a lawyer they would have known at an earlier stage.  This is a cost on the system that a properly functioning legal aid system might diminish and improve efficiencies as well.</p></speech>

It is an issue of which Sinn F&eacute;in is very conscious.  In our pre-budget submissions in recent years we have advocated additional resources for the Courts Service to improve access to justice.

The idea of looking for compensation is new but it has been found that the most direct form of compensation for court delays in respect of stress, disappointment and so on is a financial award.  As to when it first came into the system, I am not sure.  What we have tracked in the paper is the number of cases that have progressed to the ECHR and the Strasbourg court has found that Ireland is in default and that remains the case.</p></speech>

The emphasis has been on an examination of the subject matter of the proceeding and the level of complexity involved in the proceedings.  The ultimate question that the assessor, the judge in the model we are suggesting, would be the relative causes for the delay and the justifications for it.  It is not simply a question of the ECHR case law making this clear or a question of looking at the raw level of the length of the delay.</p><p>Rather, it is a question of measuring the delay and assessing how culpable it is in the context of the nature of the proceedings at issue, what was at stake for the litigant and whether the justifications put forward on behalf of the responding party passed muster.  It involves measuring and weighing up justifications against one another with a view to arriving at an answer to whether the delay was unreasonable, has it been justified and is it just to award compensation by reason of the delay.</p><p> Something else that must be borne in mind regarding how the ECHR jurisprudence treats of this issue is an assessment of the impact the delay has had on the individual litigant.  Some litigants are stoic and can deal with a lot of delay, such as, perhaps, a young person who is not terribly bothered.  There are also people who are highly stressed, elderly or, perhaps, do not have long to live, or whatever the particular personal circumstances may be.  All of these feed into the measurement.  We do not suggest every case is hugely complex but many cases have these complexities.  The drafters of the Bill seem to acknowledge this because they have provided that it should be a judge or retired judge who is the assessor.  For this reason it appears to be common case that these issues are somewhat complex, or certainly have the potential for complexities.</p></speech>

This being the case and if it is not currently provided for, is there a need for some form of hearing or opportunity for the aggrieved parties to put their cases in person, or is it best that this remains a paper exercise as it is the most effective way of conducting it?</p></speech>

If a delay was very straightforward, such as that a case was heard on a particular date and it took three years to get the judgment there probably will not be a huge complex need to have somebody examine it and provide oral evidence.  However, in a long protracted case with many loops, a delay would need to be explained.  It could be unclear how the impact on the person could be understood purely on a paper basis without the opportunity to present direct evidence to an assessor as to what the impact has been and the importance of the case to the person on a personal basis.  It could also be on a commercial basis.  Oral evidence does have a value in this regard and to exclude it totally would seem to be incorrect.  There may be cases that can be perfectly decided on paper without any particular difficulty.  Both approaches are possible but we need to keep the opportunity for oral input into any hearing or determination.</p></speech>

A point that bears mentioning is that one advantage of not doing things in secret and providing an oral hearing, even if it is streamlined, informal and, I hope, cost effective, is there is tremendous value in litigants feeling they have had their day in court, whether that is full court, quasi-tribunal or whatever shape it takes.  There is a difficult to calculate advantage and positive element to litigants feeling they have had their day in court with barristers standing up for them and telling the judge there was a wrong done.  Even if they lose the case they come out of court feeling that somebody advocated for them.  These positive benefits will follow a transparent court or quasi-court hearing.  They will not follow if it is done in secret in an unnamed office purely on paper.  This is something else we believe should be borne in mind.</p></speech>

A section 3A claim for compensation for unlawful detention, which is directed into the Circuit Court by the ECHR Act, can only be made where there has already been a finding by a court that there was unlawful detention.  In such a case the substantive issue has already been decided and, in effect, what is being decided by the Circuit Court in this instance is the level of compensation.  Under the system being established in the Bill the first things that have to be decided is whether there was a delay, whether there was a culpable delay, in other words whether the State is guilty or responsible for that delay, and how much compensation should be paid.  Under the proposed system the first two elements, which are really the substantive findings that have to be made, are being passed to an assessor to determine on the basis of the papers.  To draw an analogy, it would be like having an assessor deciding based on papers whether a person has been unlawfully detained.  This would not allow the person to make full submissions or representations and would not allow the person alleged to have unlawfully detained the person to make submissions or representations on whether the detention was unlawful.  It seems anomalous to put a more complex issue, which is the compensation for delay, into an assessor system with the more straightforward issue of compensation for a detention that has already been found to be unlawful going to the Circuit Court.  That seems to give rise to an anomaly.</p></speech>

Obviously delays can be caused by a number of factors.  A delay can be caused by a simple complexity and it may not be unreasonable.  A delay can be caused by the resourcing issues we touched upon.  In some instances, delays can be caused by a judge not discharging his or her responsibilities adequately or quickly enough.  This question is addressed to FLAC and the Bar Council.  Are there areas the Courts Service or the Legislature need to address in terms of the administration of the courts?  Are there systematic improvements that can be made to the effectiveness of the courts in dealing with cases, aside from resourcing?</p></speech>

Funnily enough, we made a submission recently in which one of the observations that it is almost easier and more straightforward to introduce a case to the High Court than the District Court, which makes no sense.  Procedurally it is easier and more straightforward.  There is definitely very significant scope in the rules to streamline and make it much more straightforward to bring a case and get through the court system much quicker.</p></speech>

In many ways the most important court in the land is the District Court.  On the criminal side it is certainly the most important.  It is the court where citizens of the country have the most interface and contact with the criminal justice system.  Equally on the civil side, for people looking for debt collection, aggrieved at a dog barking next door or whatever it might be, the District Court is the most important because it is where the citizenry is in contact with the system most frequently.</p> <p>  We are trying to treat of these issues at superior court level but these points have even greater relevance and impact with respect the lower courts, where the business of the country is more frequently transacted with the citizenry of Ireland.</p></speech>

The first relates to FLAC's submission but the Bar Council of Ireland might wish to comment also.  FLAC identified an inconsistency in the approach.  It identified inconsistency regarding the European Court of Human Rights Act 2003.  I understand it is related to the fact that compensation in the Bill is based on ECHR principles and that it is a sort of compromise based on the arrangements across the various jurisdictions under the ECHR, some are very different economically, socially and legally.  Could the delegates comment on that?</p> <p>  Let me refer to another point FLAC made, which also applies equally to the alternative put forward by the Bar Council of Ireland.  I refer to a case where there is a delay in determining the quantum of compensation and where that compensation is determined by the High Court.  When such a case returns to the High Court under the process, there is a perception of a conflict of interest or of a lack of independence, even if there are different judges.</p> <p>  Could the representatives from FLAC address both of those points?  Could the representatives from the Bar Council of Ireland address them briefly also?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.1103" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad Lucey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019011600002#CC00200"><p>Our point on head 8 was on the quantum effectively being linked to the approach of the European Court of Human Rights.  Our point is that the State is really required to put in place a remedy that is effective in the domestic sense rather than replicate a remedy that might be available to a litigant who takes the very long road to get to the European Court of Human Rights.</p> <p>  The difficulty we perceive is that the quantum before the European court is quite different from what would be awarded by the Irish courts in similar cases but that is because the European court is doing a completely different job when it decides a case against the State than an Irish court or quasi-judicial tribunal when it decides on a dispute before it.  Often the European court will say it has decided there has been a breach of rights, in the view that the simple act of deciding the case in one's favour and declaring there has been a breach is adequate compensation or, as it often calls it, "just satisfaction".  It will often not provide any remedy in damages at all.  On other occasions, where it does consider providing remedy in damages, it is often an amount that might well be a very effective remedy in Bulgaria but that would hardly pay for one's flight from Ireland to Strasbourg if one were to go there to have one's case heard.  The same applies to legal aid.  That can be awarded by the European court.</p> <p>  It is like apples and oranges.  While we should be providing for apples, we have ended up providing for oranges, and that seems to be the proposal.  Consider the position if we were to reconsider all those cases that went before the European Court of Human Rights and found Ireland in default.  If we actually had a properly functioning system of compensation for delays operating in a domestic sense, there never would have been a finding against Ireland.  Therefore, the absence of a domestic remedy was the issue but there is now no need to bring in a European remedy and to try to transplant it into the Irish context.  To us, there seems to be no real justification for making the direct linkage, and that direct linkage is not made in the European Court of Human Rights Act 2003, which is the main legislation providing remedies for breaches of the convention.</p> <p>  The other problem we have identified, which is probably speculative to some extent, concerns the question of an excessive delay in obtaining a remedy for a breach of one's rights under EU law.  If somebody takes a case before the courts, where is he or she supposed to go for a remedy?</p><p>If machinery is already being put in place by the State for delays, why should it not accommodate delays in whatever context they arise, be it EU law or a breach of Article 6 of the convention?  Again, it seems to be a misplaced notion that this is purely a remedy that should stand in the European Court of Justice rather than before the domestic courts.</p><p> The other issue raised is the loop that seems to have been included in the legislation whereby an award made goes to the High Court to be approved and then to the same court for an appeal to be heard on it.  While a High Court judge will no doubt act independently if considering an appeal, it could create a perception that the appeals process is not wholly independent if the same forum that approves the award hears the appeal.  That is just a basic point.  Maybe it needs to be considered.</p></speech>

There is very little left to be said.  We made a point in our paper to do with a restriction that is implicit in the model selected for the Bill that we believe is either directly unfair or could potentially be unfair &mdash; that is, the provision in the same head that Ms Lucey discussed, Head 8, which states that in making an award of compensation, the assessor shall compensate the applicant only to the extent that he or she suffered injury, loss or damage because of the breach.  If that is intended to mean that one must produce a medical report to show a psychiatric injury or such like, for instance, it would be setting the bar too high and would cut away from a right to compensation people who have suffered stress, a loss of enjoyment of their life, or who have had an unnecessary disappointment visited upon them.  We believe that would be a mistake, and we have said that in the paper.</p></speech>

Where, for the sake of argument, the assessor would decide without the State being involved in the assessment, it would then go to the High Court without the State being involved and the High Court would approve the award.  The State would have a right of appeal against that award and the appeal would go to the High Court.  FLAC's concern is that the same court would be deciding on the award and the assessment.  We do not regard that, on the level of principle, as being a difficulty because High Court judges, day in, day out, have to exercise independent judgment and engage in independent decision-making.  Therefore, we do not see a difficulty with a High Court judge hearing an appeal where a different High Court judge has already approved the award.  This is because they would be hearing different arguments and would have the benefit of the argument made by the State.  What we do believe it underlines is that the drafters of the heads of Bill have identified that the question of compensation for a delay in proceedings is a very significant issue, so significant that it warrants the High Court being involved in deciding that the award is an appropriate award.  To us, that underlines that the matter is so significant it should actually be determined by the courts in the first instance rather than an assessor.  Other than somebody in drafting the heads of the Bill having identified it as a significant issue, we do not see any other reason the High Court could be involved.  If the High Court is to be involved in approving the award in the first place, why not simply have the courts determine the substantive issue and the quantum of damages?  I refer to putting it into the Circuit Court, if it is to be consistent with section 3A, or such other courts as the Oireachtas may determine to be appropriate.</p></speech>

I acknowledge at the outset that on the face of it, this might be a matter of concern for a few members.  I assure the committee that nearly all of these are of a technical nature reflecting the advice of the legal drafters in the Attorney General's office.</p><p>There are a small number of meaningful changes which reflect proposals made by some Deputies in the room today for which I am grateful, and which we will come to and discuss.  There are consequential technical amendments related to these.</p><p>Finally, I am tabling a small number of amendments to improve the Bill, specifically to clarify and strengthen the appeals process.  I will explain these.  There are also consequential technical amendments associated with these.</p><p>Overall, however, I am sticking closely to the Bill as published on substantive matters.  I have to do this as it is bound by EU regulation.</p><p> Amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment to the collective citation for the Planning Acts to refer to the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2019, rather than 2018.  As a general introductory point, the committee will have recognised that the approach to noise regulation process, public consultation, decision-making, publishing information, appeals etc. mirrors, where appropriate, the established and prudent practices which exist in normal planning.  People are familiar with it and it is tried and tested.</p></speech>

It proposes to insert a definition for &ldquo;balanced approach&rdquo; based on EU Regulation No. 598/2014.  It will also include the International Civil Aviation Organisation&rsquo;s agreed hierarchy of measures and the World Health Organization&rsquo;s night noise guidelines for Europe 2018.</p><p>The whole purpose of the legislation is to enhance the position for those impacted by aircraft noise.  The Bill is silent on the issue of health, which is one of the key reasons for this legislation.  There have been substantial changes in society&rsquo;s understanding of the impact of noise on human health.  It would be remiss of us if we did not reflect this in the definition as one of the guiding principles to which the competent authority must pay attention.</p><p>The WHO&rsquo;s 2018 environmental noise guidelines for the European region stated:</p> <blockquote> 	For average noise exposure, the [guideline development group, GDG,] strongly recommends reducing noise levels produced by aircraft below 45 dB, as aircraft noise above this level is associated with adverse health effects.<br /><br />For night noise exposure, the GDG strongly recommends reducing noise levels produced by aircraft during night time below 40 dB, as night-time aircraft noise above this level is associated with adverse effects on sleep.<br /><br />To reduce health effects, the GDG strongly recommends that policy-makers implement suitable measures to reduce noise exposure from aircraft in the population exposed to levels above the guideline values for average and night noise exposure.<br /><br />For specific interventions the GDG recommends implementing suitable changes in infrastructure. </blockquote><p>This is important because of adverse health effects among the exposed population.  Many individuals have to adapt their lives to cope with the noise at night, and vulnerable groups are more severely affected.  Therefore, we need to put what I propose in the definitions.  I will press the amendment because it is quite important.</p></speech>

We just did some rewording and tidied it up or whatever; it is practically the same so some of my points have been made.</p> <p>  I wish to highlight the importance of including a specific reference to "Night Noise Guidelines".  When the WHO emphasises health, it puts the spotlight on night in particular because sleep is critical to health.  In addition to drawing the Minister's attention to communities in Fingal, I draw his attention to those in Tyrrelstown and Mulhuddart, and also those in Dublin West, which are on the western approach to the airport and suffer severely because of noise.  People can live with noise during the day but at night it is really important that some restrictions be placed on flights to ensure night sleep is not interfered with.  I live in Mulhuddart, where, because of noise at night, I noticed it is almost impossible to leave a bedroom window open in the summer.  I can only imagine the noise level closer to the airport.  It is critical that what I propose be taken into account, irrespective of whatever future developments occur at the airport.  It is obvious that it should be included.</p></speech>

Given that the WHO report was commissioned by EU environment Ministers, it would be unfortunate if it were not referred to in some way in the Bill.  If the Minister's legal advice is that, in considering the definition of "balanced approach", we cannot extend the provision beyond what is already in EU Regulation No. 598/2014, it has to be open to us as parliamentarians to find some way within the body of the legislation, although not necessarily in the definitions, to refer to this very important work in the context of airport noise in the Union.  Perhaps we could determine for Report Stage whether there is another way of referring to the important report of the WHO.</p></speech>

On Deputy Daly's point on cost-effectiveness, there is provision in the Bill and regulations.  Health is certainly covered in the regulations.</p><p>Let me address the important issue of night noise.  Deputy Coppinger is absolutely right.  It is recognised.  The Deputy will probably be familiar with the reference.  It is very high up in the priorities in the regulation, a copy of which I have to hand.  Paragraph (2) states:</p> <blockquote> 	Sustainable development of air transport requires the introduction of measures aimed at reducing the noise impact from aircraft at Union airports. Those measures should improve the noise environment around Union airports in order to maintain or increase the quality of life of neighbouring citizens and foster compatibility between aviation activities and residential areas, in particular where night flights are concerned. </blockquote> <p>Therefore, addressing night noise is particularly targeted as a priority in the regulation.</p><p>That addresses Deputy Brendan Ryan's point.  The noise is taken very seriously in the terms of reference in the directive and the regulation.</p></speech>

This is an aircraft noise regulation Bill.  The entire purpose of the regulation is to restrict and reduce the impact of aircraft noise.  That is a given.  We know that it is supposed to enhance quality of life based on a hierarchical system.  That does not negate the point I am making, which is that we are not specifying health.  The Minister talks about quality of life, but that is not health specifically.  Obviously health is an aspect of it.  However, because of the impact and the emphasis put on this question by the World Health Organization, WHO, because it is so important, we need to specify that we are not just talking about quality of life as something abstract or nice or an additional extra.  It is an integral part of people's right to health.  It has a severe impact on their mental health, their well-being and their physical health if they do not get enough sleep and if they are intruded upon negatively by noise.  My point is that while we know the legislation refers to quality of life, nowhere are we specifying health.  It has to be specified if we are to give meaningful legislative scaffolding to the regulation.</p></speech>

Many of us do not believe that Fingal County Council is the appropriate authority to carry out this function.  We all believe it was chosen in a hurry because the Minister had left it too late to bring in a competent authority on noise regulation and as a result, the deadline was missed by the time he realised that the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, would not be allowed to carry out the function because it failed the independence test.  However, I am surprised that Fingal County Council passed the independence test given that it is paid rates by the airport and relies on the airport for part of its rates.  It is high time that we move away from having bodies regulate entities when they rely on those same entities for their income.  It is the same with the IAA and safety regulation, although apparently legislation is being introduced to break up the IAA for that very reason.  The Minister might correct me if I am wrong.  </p><p>If it is not appropriate in the case of the IAA and civil aviation regulation, why should it be allowed in the case of Fingal County Council?  Many Deputies are of this opinion, as are the residents who do not have any confidence in Fingal County Council overseeing matters because it relies on the airport for funds.  It does not inspire confidence in anybody.  The thinking is very much that it was a rush job by the Minister, and an 11th hour decision taken on his behalf.  That is the very reason why it should be replaced with the Commissioner for Aviation Regulation.</p></speech>

This is the section that deals with who should be the competent authority.  It is a key part of the legislation and this is probably the most substantial group of amendments before us.  The key job of transposing EU Regulation No. 598/2014 is to establish a competent authority which will be appointed to set up the rules and regulations for dealing with the impact of aircraft noise in line with the balanced approach.  The authority in the European Union is very clear on what the basis of the body should be.  I reiterate it states:</p> <blockquote> 	The competent authority responsible for adopting noise-related operating restrictions should be independent of any organisation involved in the airport&rsquo;s operation, air transport or air navigation service provision, or representing the interests thereof and of the residents living in the vicinity of the airport.  This should not be understood as requiring Member States to modify their administrative structures or decision-making procedures.  </blockquote> <p>A couple of years after saying that the IAA would be the body which would carry out this function, the Minister has done a massive somersault and is now saying that it will not be the IAA, but will be Fingal County Council.  There are several different solutions proposed as to how we should deal with this.</p><p>The Minister thinks it should be Fingal County Council and we will address that point in a minute because there are alternatives.  The first point I want to make is that we have to see what Ireland is doing in the context of what other countries are doing.  The Minister's proposition to appoint Fingal County Council not only does not meet the requirement for independence, as outlined by Deputy Munster, but is completely at variance with what every single other jurisdiction in the European Union has done.  We know that eight member states are not required to bring this in because their airports are too small.  Another eight member states have designated the Civil Aviation Authority, the equivalent of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA.  Those eight member states did not seem to have a problem with independence and that is the biggest group of other member states.  Five member states have designated a Government Department.  Two members states have designated multiple bodies, including a Government Department and a national agency.  Two member states have not completed it yet.  Three member states have designated one or more local, regional or federal authorities.  The stance Ireland has taken is utterly bizarre.  It is unheard of for a local authority to take on the national regulatory responsibility of a competent national authority.  </p><p> I will not labour the points made by Deputy Munster but the residents know, as does everybody, from dialogue with Fingal County Council that so much of the council's rate base and influence comes from the DAA that it impairs the council's independence and there is no question or doubt about that.  I have seen the Minister's responses on that, where he says it is not really 20% and is only 8% when all the income streams are taken in.  That is splitting hairs because it is quite obvious that the DAA is the biggest payer to the income of Fingal County Council.  The council granted the original permissions for the airport runway and so on, so it is safe to say that not only is it not independent but it could never even be perceived to be independent.  There is a huge problem with Fingal County Council.</p><p> I do not want to repeat the Minister's words back to him, but in answers to parliamentary questions over recent years, he told us that the IAA was the best show in town and all that good stuff, and he is now standing that on its head.  The reports that the Department gave us as to why it had to be Fingal County Council and why the other organisations were not suitable did not add up.  Nobody is suggesting the IAA but the Minister does not seem to have taken on board the game-changing recommendation of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR.  That is the favoured choice of residents.  It is not their exclusive choice because the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, may also be appropriate but most groups would prefer the CAR as the alternative to Fingal because the goalposts have now moved with the decision to split the IAA and the division of the commercial and regulatory functions.</p><p> The State is now on the cusp of bringing forward other legislation to have one single regulator for aviation which is a highly specialist and technical area.  We could bring it all under the one remit and the Minister chose not to include aircraft noise, a key regulatory function, under that brief.  It does not make sense.  The only answer we got as to why it was not suitable was that they do not have the capacity at the moment.  It is recognised that Fingal does not have the capacity at the moment.  The EPA would not have the capacity for dealing with this.  It is a highly specialist area.  The reason it fits better coming in under the CAR, with its aviation expertise, is precisely because the people who regulate aviation are highly skilled technicians.  They are of a pay grade and a level of expertise that is not replicated elsewhere.  It is not replicated in the EPA and it is certainly not replicated in Fingal County Council.  Fianna F&aacute;il's dressed up version of Fingal County Council is still Fingal County Council.  The suggestion that the council would set up an aircraft noise regulation division is not sufficiently independent from Fingal County Council.</p><p>In addition, an area set up solely for airport noise regulation will not be sufficiently busy to attract and maintain the level of expertise necessary to support this type of venture, if my point is understood.  That is critical if it is just airport noise.  In this group of amendments one of the solutions is the Fianna F&aacute;il idea of Fingal County Council setting up an independent noise regulator.  It is important to state, first, that the perceived link with Fingal is still there as it is still under Fingal County Council.  An office to the side, sitting in Fingal but called the airport noise regulator, will not be working morning, noon and night.  It will not have a critical mass of work or enough work to sustain the level of expertise necessary to be enticed into this outfit.  The only arena where one could get that is in the CAR, and it is not there at present.  Indeed, it is nowhere now.  However, that is the natural home for it and we must be clear about that.  Most of the residents' groups favour this as the alternative.</p><p> There was openness to the idea of the EPA possibly being considered as well.  It is not hard and fast but in terms of aviation expertise, the EPA is not really at the races.  Residents are highly aggrieved at this situation.  The Minister reports in other replies to parliamentary questions that the EPA has said it is not up to the job.  That is not true.  Residents have gone to the trouble of getting freedom of information responses regarding the EPA and its involvement in this, and there has been no substantial dialogue with the EPA in terms of whether it might want this function.  It is not true to say, as has been said, that the EPA does not want the gig.  The records show that it has not been asked about the gig.  It is important to put that on the record.</p><p> It is also important to record that concern has been expressed about the fact that the IAA submission to the recent airport noise plan by Fingal County Council was a little too deferential to the existing planning restrictions linked to the new runway.  It made the point that it was concerned about the operating restrictions.  That is beyond its remit.  This should not be the basis of the concern.  The concern is about the best way forward for reducing the impact of noise, not the airport restricting operations even though there is a knock-on in that regard.</p><p> For all those reasons the CAR is the best fit.  That is entirely in line with what most of the other member states have done.  We are setting up a new regulatory authority.  Everything is changing.  The impact on climate change, for example, means aircraft regulation is something that will have to be taken a great deal more seriously, and the impact of noise is a key component of that.  Leaving it out does not make any sense.  The points as to why it should not be Fingal County Council have been well made.  As to what else, the CAR is the best fit simply because of the technical expertise aspect and that level on the food chain, as it were.</p></speech>

My amendments are related to my view and that of my party and the residents.  They are based on my party's legal advice that Fingal County Council should not be designated the competent body because it is not independent enough.  An alternative body with the required independence is needed.  The Minister and his advisers have got it wrong.  It is no shame to admit that, even at this stage.  On Second Stage many of us asked the Minister to take on board what people were saying and to return on this Stage with an amended version of the legislation which took that on board.  We were not making it up just for the sake of it.  There is a real sense that it does not have independence, and there should be recognition of that from the Minister and his officials.</p><p>The two proposals in this grouping for alternative bodies are the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, and the EPA.  My preference is for the CAR but I am not hung up on that.  If the Minister or Department officials felt that the EPA was better from their point of view, I would take that advice.  During the debate on Second Stage, I spoke about the lack of independence and gave the ESB as example of true independence, where we have EirGrid, Electric Ireland and the ESB itself.  They all have separate independent boards with no mixed or overlapping functions.<br/><br/>What the Minister is proposing here is that the CEO of Fingal County Council - referred to as FCC in the Bill - will not be independent of the local authority itself.  That is a fact.  The Bill, as proposed, does not achieve functional separation between the competent authority and the local residents.  Deputy Clare Daly has gone through section 13 and the need for independence.  Article 3.2 goes on to provide that:</p><blockquote>	The competent authorities shall be independent of any organisation which could be affected by noise-related action.  That independence may be achieved through a functional separation. </blockquote><p>That is open to challenge because what is proposed here does not have that functional separation.  In respect of my amendments, my proposal is to go for the CAR as the competent authority.  My amendment No. 4 is about interpretation and it inserts &quot;CAR&quot;.  My amendment No. 6, in section 2, again on interpretation, deletes &quot;FCC&quot;.  My amendment No. 7, in section 3 on the designation of the competent authority, replaces &quot;FCC&quot; with &quot;CAR&quot;.  My amendment No. 10, in section 3 on the designation of competent authority, deletes lines 10 to 38 on page 7 and lines 1 to 12 on page 8 because that section deals specifically with a relationship with a local authority.  The best thing to do, therefore, is to eliminate those lines completely if the CAR, or somebody else, is designated rather than Fingal County Council.  My amendment No. 42 also just replaces &quot;FCC&quot; with the &quot;CAR&quot;.<br/><br/>I am not going to go over all that has been said.  There is general agreement across the board, even from Fianna F&aacute;il in respect of what it is proposing.  There is no acceptance that this is independent enough.  Something has to change and I will certainly be hoping to achieve that between today and Report Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.1152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2019011600002#L00200"><p>I will speak on my amendments in this group now as well.  It has been well flagged to the Minister, before Christmas in the debate that took place in the full D&aacute;il and in much of the correspondence that he would have received from residents who have studied this, that it is not appropriate that Fingal County Council would be responsible for monitoring and protecting residents in respect of noise.  It is not even the councillors, by the way, who would have any oversight as members elected by the residents.  It would be the CEO of Fingal County Council.</p> <p>  I will refer to some reasons for making this change, including the issue of expertise but also conflict of interest.  The reality is that the rates base upon which Fingal County Council is reliant immediately means that it is loathe to challenge any major developments in the airport in the way that would be potentially required to protect residents from noise.  The council is also reliant on development contributions and many of us who have been members of the council have seen that the airport is a major part of Fingal's overall development.  Nobody is saying that the airport should not develop but it is necessary to have some independent body involved which is not linked to its development.</p><p>In terms of expertise, the Minister has received correspondence from residents.  On 10 December, a presentation was made on the Dublin Airport noise action plan to the full membership of Fingal County Council, but that presentation did not even meet the requirements of the environmental noise directive.  It was meant to be a graphical presentation and include maps disclosing the areas where the noise limits were exceeded.  It is meant to show differences, the current position and the potential position if a new runway is built or an enhancement at the airport takes place, but none of that has been done.  Planning permission was given for the north runway and the construction contract awarded.  Therefore, at a minimum, one would expect the council to show difference maps and compare them with the existing position.  </p><p> The other issue is that noise levels increased dramatically between 2006 and 2016, but there was nothing in the plan to suggest Fingal County Council had done or was going to do anything about it.  It was very evident in the recent presentation that the council had taken quite a light touch regulation approach to noise issues at the airport.  On there being a conflict of interest, when the council grants planning permission to Aer Rianta, it receives &euro;21 million in development levies.  One can see, therefore, that it is implicated.  The authority that deals with noise regulation should be completely independent.  I am open on what that authority should be.  When I discussed the matter with some residents with whom I had been dealing, we felt the EPA would more be appropriate.  </p><p> On that subject, it was stated at previous meetings of this committee that the EPA would not be considered because it had not shown that it could step up to the plate.  It was also implied that it had indicated that it was not interested, which is completely untrue.  A resident made a FOI request to try to delve into this issue and it emerged that the EPA had not even been consulted.  No records showing that it had ever stated it was not interested were found in the trawl that took place.  Therefore, misinformation was given to this committee ruling out the EPA as a factor.  I can pass this information around if the Minister wants me to do so.  What was said was that discussions with individual members of staff had been checked and that they could not find any record.  All relevant persons in the EPA were asked if they had had any interaction on the issue and they had not.  Why, therefore, did somebody from the Department say they had?  It seems that residents are being given false information, for which the Minister should account.  </p><p> The Minister needs to listen.  Why would he not have the interests of residents at heart and appoint an independent body to regulate noise levels, rather than the planning authority which clearly has a conflict of interest and does not have the staff to do so?  I do not know if it wants to do so, but it would need to recruit a whole department.  I think it has enough on its plate in building housing during the worst housing crisis it has ever seen.  It seems that the EPA would be more appropriate, but I am open to the others mentioned in the other amendments.</p></speech>

The manner in which he has handled the matter to date has contributed to the anxiety, fear and worry of the residents who need to be protected.  He has left us in a position where there is an urgent requirement at the 11th hour to have this EU regulation transposed onto the Irish Statute Book.  The Minister has even missed the timeline he set out last July and continues to miss every timeline he has set down.  He changes as he goes along.</p><p> In February 2018, the Minister first indicated that Fingal County Council would be made the competent authority.  I raised concerns then about the council's capacity and whether it would have the relevant expertise to ensure it would be independent and address the concerns of neighbours and residents, while at the same time allowing the airport to develop and grow.  We cannot ignore that the airport directly employs 20,000 people and indirectly employs a further 45,000 people.  It is, therefore, of great strategic importance not just to the local economy and the livelihoods of many people living in close proximity to it but also to the economy as a whole.  We are an island nation and given the serious uncertainties arising from Brexit, we need to realise how important a role Dublin Airport plays.</p><p> As I said, we raised the issue of the expertise as opposed to independence of Fingal County Council.  If we were to go down the route that other Deputies are suggesting, we would decide that Fingal County Council and every other county council could not adjudicate planning applications independently or fairly because all planning applications have the potential to deliver returns by way of development levies or commercial rates if the building or development in question is allowed to progress.  We are effectively saying that every decision a council will ever take could be compromised because it would have a financial net benefit to the local authority.</p><p> I put forward my amendment in conjunction with my colleague who represents the area to ensure there is independence.  One of the reasons given for designating Fingal County Council as the competent authority as opposed to other entities such as the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, was the council's capacity to build a Chinese wall and have a dedicated, independent body operating within the organisation.  For this reason, we have tabled specific amendments on this matter to ensure there is independence.</p><p> I ask the Minister to indicate what will be done to ensure the necessary expertise and capabilities will be acquired, sourced or recruited for Fingal County Council.</p><p>What structure does he envisage within Fingal County Council if this legislation is passed?  Time is of the essence in this matter and that is the fault of the Minister and the Government rather than anyone on this side of the room.  We have a responsibility to ensure that a robust and independent regulatory regime is put in place to facilitate the sustainable growth of a major strategic economic hub on which tens of thousands of people within the constituency in which the airport is located and much further afield depend for their livelihood and income.  We depend on the airport to grow in order to facilitate further connectivity and our tourism industry.  How does the Minister propose to ensure that Fingal County Council will have an independent unit which will be adequately staffed by employees with the necessary expertise and capabilities to ensure that residents' concerns will be dealt with in a balanced manner as stipulated in the EU regulation?</p></speech>

It is a small economic regulatory body responsible for determining the maximum level of charges which may be charged at Dublin Airport.  It has no expertise or statutory remit in regard to environmental noise, environmental protection or planning and development, all of which issues are critical elements of the Bill.  Furthermore, it has no current capacity to or experience of running the type of extensive public consultations required by regulation EU Regulation No. 598/2014.  Importantly, it does not have the organisational capacity to absorb a substantive new function within a relatively short timeframe.  It is a small economic regulator with some additional consumer protection functions and has approximately 20 staff.  It simply is not currently equipped to undertake the role of noise regulator within any reasonable timeframe.</p> <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, was also considered as an option.  It has a statutory remit in regard to environmental protection.  It has an oversight role in terms of ensuring compliance by State bodies under the environmental noise directive in respect of noise maps and noise action plans produced by local authorities.  It is the considered view that the regulatory requirements under EU Regulation No. 598/2014 are very different to the licensing, audit and inspection role of the EPA.  The role under EU Regulation No. 598/2014 would represent a step change from what it is currently set up to do.</p> <p>  On Second Stage I addressed the decision to appoint Fingal County Council to this role and outlined the reasons I believe the council is the best fit.  I will briefly reiterate those points for clarity.  There is significant overlap between EU Regulation No. 598/2014, the planning process and environmental protection requirements.  In that respect, Fingal County Council is well suited to the job in light of its extensive experience in planning and development, land use planning and management, appropriate assessment, environmental impact assessment and managing large public consultations.</p><p>Providing the council with additional legal powers to regulate noise at Dublin Airport builds on its functions relating to noise under the environmental noise directive, END, and the planning code generally.  As will be discussed further under section 5 of the Bill, Fingal County Council will impose a levy on the DAA to cover the costs of carrying out its functions under this Act.  This will allow the council to bring in the expertise necessary to make evidence-based regulatory decisions on the most appropriate measures to be imposed at the airport.  It will also allow it to build upon its in-house capacity.  The decision of the noise regulator will be open and transparent, subject to appeal and judicial review.  I am satisfied that the proposal on the implementation of EU Regulation No. 598/2014 is wholly aligned with the long established multifunctional role played by all local authorities and, in my view, Fingal County Council is the most suitable body to take on this role.</p><p> I will answer the question posed by Deputy Troy because it took a slightly different line fromseeking to have a different regulator.  I understand the Deputy is concerned to make sure the regulatory process is robust, rigorous and immune from any inappropriate outside influence.  I share his concern and recognise that he has consistently pursued this objective.  In some ways, he has been the bane of my life for the past 18 months.  The Deputy can be assured that I posed the same questions to my officials.  The matter has been subjected to serious and rigorous examination, including legal examination.  The conclusion is that the current provisions in the Bill are sound and meet the requirements the Deputy addressed.</p><p> Fingal County Council will establish a new, well resourced and dedicated aircraft noise regulation office within the executive branch, which will include the appropriate noise expertise sought by the Deputy.  The office will be headed at a senior level by a director of services with all of the appropriate arrangements to ensure decisions are taken fully in accordance with the law, as happens in planning and development, for example.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government recently gave sanction to Fingal County Council to take on up to nine permanent staff for its new office.  I am confident that the council will have all of the tools at its disposal to reach a decision in line with EU Regulation No. 598/2014.  The legislation sets out the legal framework that the noise regulator will need to work to.  It is a matter for Fingal County Council to determine how best to administer that function.</p><p> I will respond to members' specific questions which share a common theme.  While I do not want to repeat myself, I am happy to do so.  Deputy Munster said that Fingal County Council is not independent and she seemed to indicate that the IAA was the preferred and original choice.  She also claimed that this has been a rushed job.  That is a fair comment in many ways.  We are absolutely satisfied that Fingal County Council will be independent.  We have examined the independence of the council.  I understand Dublin Airport accounts for 7% of its income and we are perfectly happy with that percentage.  That decision or verdict of independence is supported by the Government's legal adviser, namely, the Attorney General.  I remind members of one important fact.</p><p>It was the Attorney General's office that decided that the IAA was not independent.  That was the problem.  Presumably using the same criteria, which it obviously has, to judge the independence of the IAA and Fingal County Council, it has decided that the council is independent.  I cannot take higher or more compelling advice.  The Attorney General's legal advice is something of which we have to take heed.  Were we to defy it in any way, members would be the first people to come to me and say doing so was reckless.  The Attorney General has said that Fingal County Council is independent.  Even Opposition Members must consider that a serious point.</p><p> Deputy Munster said this was a rushed job.  I accept fully the criticism that it has taken too long.  I will put my hands up - the problems involved were not necessarily of my making, but I take responsibility for them.  That this has taken too long has been the result of various legal advices and other matters.  However, having been criticised for two and a half years for this taking too long and, after accepting that perfectly legitimate criticism and making haste in response, it is difficult to now be told it is a rushed job.  We are in haste and we want to get this Bill through quickly.  We are late.  It is important for many reasons that the Bill be expedited.  I am grateful to the committee members for at least assisting in that and giving plenty of time for a valuable debate on the merits of whichever body they believe would best be the competent authority.</p><p> I have probably dealt with the issue of independence that Deputy Daly raised, although I am sure she does not agree with me.  She referred to our "somersault".  It was good rhetoric, but what we have done is make a decision on the back of legal advice that the IAA was not the right body and then moved on to what we now believe is a very good body to do this work.  We are accepting the legal advice that was given in that regard.</p><p> The Deputy referred to EU member states.  Ireland is in line with other member states in its choice of competent authority.  Member states are notable for the diversity of their competent authorities.  I can see no formula, template or common theme.  There are five or six categories from which such authorities have been chosen.  The Deputy is correct in much of what she said.  For example, yet to designate are Belgium and Spain.  They will do so shortly, but we do not know which way they will go.  France and Romania have designated multiple bodies.  A government department has been designated by Austria, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.  The aviation authority has been designated by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal and Sweden.  Probably because the regulation is qualified by the numbers involved, it does not apply to Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia.  In common with us, Germany and the UK have designated local or regional authorities, so we are not an outrider completely.  There is great variety.  I do not know enough about the situation to know why every country chose particular bodies, but I expect those countries were considering the same criteria as us.  Their various bodies have different levels of independence.  To say that we are on our own is not true.  Germany and the UK have made similar decisions.</p><p>The rate base is 7% of Fingal's income.  Deputies Daly and Coppinger talked about the Environmental Protection Agency.  The EPA was consulted.  I do not know about freedom of information data.  It is useful to have it but the agency was consulted.  I can assure Deputies of that.</p></speech>

There was certainly communication with all those bodies.</p> <p>  I wish to respond to Deputy Brendan Ryan, who made the same point about the lack of independence or not being independent enough.  I hope I have answered that by saying that we have taken opinion on the matter from outside the Department, in particular, from the Office of the Attorney General.  It is important that we should get that from the office that rejected the proposal relating to the Irish Aviation Authority.</p> <p>  There is a common theme running through much of what people have said to the effect that I should take on board what people are saying.  I wish to say one thing that is important.  I absolutely commend Deputies Daly, Troy, Coppinger and Munster on what they are doing in representing the residents.  That is a useful and effective democratic procedure.  Undoubtedly what they have said has had an effect on the Bill.  However, I do not accept in any sense the criticism that I have ignored local residents.  My guess is that no Minister would have met more local residents.  I have not met them all - there are many groups - but I have met a vast number of residents from the areas involved as well as various delegations that Deputies have asked me to meet.  These are not people in my constituency but from north Dublin.  I welcome that and I have taken those views on board.</p> <p>  I have asked the DAA in various circumstances to meet these people and to take into account various points of view.  I believe it is the right thing to do.  It has taken some time and it has been useful but it is what a Minister ought to do and it is reflected in the Bill.  The points of view of residents are paramount and have to be taken into account.  There must be a balanced approach of course.  The idea that this has been done in any way regardless of their views or the real fears, difficulties and problems this may entail for them is not true.  They have had a welcome audience.  I have no wish to make this into some sort of pious statement.  There may be one or two whom I have not met but I have met a great many.  I have met several delegations and I have not been reluctant to meet them at all.  I hope that is reflected in everything I have been saying and in the Bill.  I think I have answered all the questions for the moment.</p></speech>

Let us look back on the reasons the IAA was not permitted.  It was because the authority failed the independence test.</p><p>I had asked the Minister to confirm whether legislation was being drawn up to break up the IAA.  I refer to the independence of the IAA in safety regulation.  If it is not appropriate in the case of the IAA and civil aviation regulation, why should it be allowed in the case of Fingal County Council and noise regulation?  The Minister also said that the CAR would not be equipped to take on the role of regulator and that there was no expertise.  Those same things, however, could be said of Fingal County Council.  Returning to the making of the decision, it was rushed into because of the circumstances.  It was an 11th hour decision to appoint Fingal County Council, but it also does not have the required in-house expertise.  At an earlier meeting, one of the Minister's colleagues mentioned about having to seek and bring in outside expertise.  It was also mentioned that nine permanent staff would have to be recruited to deal with this.</p><p> The other issue I want to take up also goes back to independence being the key.  People are looking for that and for transparency in decision-making right across the board.  That is all that communities are looking for.  They are looking for safeguards so that they can feel confident that their issues and concerns about health and well-being will all be considered independently and in a very transparent way.  The Minister referred to 7% of the income from Fingal County Council.  That is not small change in respect of the budget.  It is a substantial part of the budget of a council of the size of Fingal and yet it is being brushed off as something and nothing, as if it were spare change.  The key aspect here is independence and people do not have confidence that Fingal County Council has the required ability, expertise or, in particular, independence in decision-making.  Therein lies the problem.  There is no other reason for choosing Fingal County Council than the Minister getting into a tizzy when he realised the IAA was not suitable.  It was the 11th hour and he went with it.  People have a serious issue with that.</p></speech>

If we go onto the EPA website now, <i>www.epa.ie</i>, and then click into EPAMaps, it can be seen that in Tyrrelstown, which I looked up because it is a community very near me, the noise level during the day is 55 to 59 decibels.  It is in that contour.  The World Health Organization, WHO, recommendation is actually 45 decibels, so that is exceeding it.  Hollywoodrath, the new estate that people are going to be moving into very shortly and which councillors saw fit to put on the fringe of the airport with its associated noise level, already has a noise level of 60 to 64 decibels during the day.  Again, the WHO recommendation is 45 decibels.  At night, Tyrrelstown's noise level is between 50 to 54 decibels when the WHO recommends a level of 40 decibels.  I am giving those data because I could not have got them anywhere else except the EPA.  It seems bizarre that anyone could speak at a Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport and state that the EPA could not be considered to do this while it seems well positioned to do it, with extra resources and expertise.  That was the only way I could get the information to which I referred.</p><p>On the Minister stating that the EPA was consulted, this is about accountability in public life.  At a meeting in October, Mr. Gallagher, who is present, stated that a few existing agencies were looked at, including the EPA, which was quickly ruled out by its line Department and the agency.  He continued by stating that he supposed that was because of its inability to step up to the plate.  The freedom of information request, to which the residents only got a reply yesterday, asked for all of the correspondence between the EPA and the Department outlining why the agency declined to take on the role as the competent authority for the Aircraft Noise (Dublin Airport) Regulation Bill 2018.</p><p>The reply was that no records relevant to the request had been identified and, therefore, such records did not exist.  The reply referred to how information was sought on discussions with individual members of staff who may have dealt with such records and how an email was circulated to all staff asking them if they had any records or information relating to this request.  The reply also referred to a search of electronic databases and records held by the agency.</p></speech>

I do not think the argument about Fingal County Council holds up at all.  It is simply a question of the reality about the airport.  I would like to see a breakdown of the 7% figure.  Either way, it is a major employer and entity within Fingal.  Local authority managers are now called chief executives.  That says it all about their business philosophy.  The suggestion is that the council is going to be independent.  Fianna F&aacute;il seems to be indicating that it accepts Fingal will be the competent authority.  It seems the council is simply seeking some additional staff and resources to be put in.  That is going to be highly disappointing for residents.</p></speech>

Deputy Troy can clarify the matter himself.  I am simply trying to clarify it.  If that is the case, then it will be really disappointing for residents because there is absolutely no way it would work.  Let us suppose a new department was set up called airport noise protection and it had amazing experts in it.  Anything it would produce would potentially be overruled by the manager or chief executive in the interests of business and development.  That is the way it works - I was on the council for a long time.  It would be very difficult to have that conflict.  Why have such a conflict?  That is the point.  Why not take it out of the council and put it with an agency that is more suited to protection?  It seems to me that the EPA would be better suited.  I am open to the other agency mentioned as well but the EPA is better suited to protect residents.  I am keen to hear the reply from Deputy Troy on the amendment.</p></speech>

He was going through the downside for the Commission for Aviation Regulation, but his comments were in the context of the current situation and where CAR is today.  Deputy Daly outlined what has been proposed and why it is important.  She set out why the changes that have been proposed are so important in the context of the proposal for CAR.  The regulatory components of IAA are going to CAR and that is a game-changer.  We should really respond in that context rather than in the context of the Minister saying the organisation is too small and does not have the relevant competencies.  I am seeking a brief comment on the Fianna F&aacute;il proposal.  I do not think that does it.  It does not deliver the independence required.</p> <p>  I have argued about the lack of independence of Fingal County Council but I did not mention anything about the income from rates.</p><p>I made my argument based on the content of the regulation.  I read out Article 3.2 and Deputy Clare Daly read out Article 13.  Do the words contained in the regulation not have any meaning?  We read the words.  We are reasonably intelligent people and can say that words mean something.  The Minister's response is that everything is grand, but we are specifically referring to words in the regulation.  They must have meaning.  They refer to functional separation and being independent of the people who are affected.  If those words have no meaning, the Minister's response earlier regarding the balanced approach will have no meaning either because he is relying on definitions relating to the balanced approach in the regulation.  We are directly citing the words contained in the regulation yet the Minister is dismissing them as if they do not exist.</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Munster, there is legislation in the pipeline to break up the IAA.  That is obviously a matter of independence.  It is at an early stage but it will happen.</p> <p>  Fingal County Council has considerable expertise already, although it does not have all the expertise.  It has a considerable amount of expertise in various skills that will be necessary for the competent authority.  The Deputy spoke about the need for safeguards.  The Deputy is right, but there are safeguards in the regulation, in EU law and in the fact that at all stages the noise regulator and An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be carrying out public consultations.  There is a right of appeal if one is not happy with Fingal's decision and ultimately there is a right to judicial review.  We have an enormous number of safeguards.</p> <p>  On the issue raised by Deputy Coppinger, I am sure she is right that the EPA fulfils some of the functions, and it does extraordinarily good work, but it does not fulfil others.  It appears that, comprehensively, Fingal County Council fulfils more at present.  There were meetings.  We will resolve that problem for the Deputy.  The people from my Department who are dealing with this met with the EPA.  They will sort out the issue of whether there should have been or were records or not.</p></speech>

It may be shocking for people but it is not surprising in the context that we know the Minister and the Cabinet made the decision to appoint Fingal County Council prior to the enactment of this legislation.  It is a matter we have discussed before.  I have put it to the Minister that designating Fingal County Council as the competent authority, in advance of the Oireachtas approving it, is a pretty dodgy course of action to take, particularly when he does not have a plan B.</p> <p>  The simple fact of the matter is that nobody agrees with the Minister&rsquo;s proposition to designate Fingal County Council as the competent authority for noise regulation in the airport.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s attitude is a bit of a fudge.  Nobody has given the Minister everything he wants in terms of this.  The idea the recruitment for a unit has been sanctioned is not surprising.  What is more shocking about it is the level at which the Minister has pitched the recruitment grades.  It shows a total lack of understanding of what is necessary in terms of the technical expertise and ability of the people who will form the basis of this competent authority.</p> <p>  When I referred to a somersault earlier, the Minister replied that while that may be nice political rhetoric, it did not mean anything.  I put it to the Minister that it means quite a lot because it goes to the heart of the credibility of the information the Minister and his Department have given the committee and D&aacute;il over the past several years.  The Minister claimed he had taken this course of action because of legal advice.  Two years ago, having met the Attorney General who was a week away from finalising the seventh and hopefully last draft of the regulations, the Minister told me that there was broad agreement that the Irish Aviation Authority was best positioned to take on this role and to do it to the highest standard of professional competence.  He said it had a strong and internationally verified track record in the area of aviation security and inspection, functions for which it already had legal responsibility.  He also said making it responsible for noise regulation made sense.</p><p>That was discussed by the committee.  The previous Attorney General stated that the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, is best placed to deal with this issue.  It is a bit like the point regarding the EPA and the freedom of information request made by a resident.  It gets to the accuracy of the information that is given.  At the heart of this matter is deciding when we can believe the Minister and when we cannot.  If some of the information which we have been given is easily contradictable, how can we accept anything we are told?  Which answer should be accepted?  That is at the heart of this issue.</p><p> The Minister stated that he has met many residents.  Obviously, we appreciate the meetings he attended with residents but we are not raising the issue just to kowtow to residents.  Many people in the communities we represent depend on the airport for their livelihood.  Some very capable people have given their professional as well as residential input on the arguments and the merits of the proposition before us.  It is not grandstanding.  Nobody agrees with the way in which the Government has set this up in terms of Fingal County Council being the competent authority.   The points made by Deputy Brendan Ryan will come back to haunt the Minister.  The Minister cannot demonstrate a functional separation and that will be open to legal challenge.  Even the proposed staffing levels serve to strengthen any potential legal challenge.  We are digging an enormous hole for ourselves in terms of how it is proposed that this will be done.</p><p> In response to queries on why other organisations were not selected, the Minister read to us the notes in that regard which we were given a couple of months ago.  We read those notes some time ago and did not agree with them.  The points made in that have been reflected upon by members of the affected communities as well as by Oireachtas Members.  The key point in regard to the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, is exactly the point that has changed.  All the way along, everybody agreed the IAA is best placed in terms of aviation regulation.  At the 11th hour, the Government decided there might be a problem in terms of independence, so the IAA was axed from consideration.  That is where we were.  I referred the Minister to the level of expertise within the IAA.  It still has that expertise but the game changer is that it is being moved and split and the regulatory functions for aviation will be held by a new aviation regulator.  That is the key issue but the Minister did not address it.  The 2017 annual report of the IAA confirms that this idea was being looked at.  In the report the IAA pledged to work with the Department throughout 2018 to make this aviation regulatory function a reality.  On the previous occasion I raised it with the Minister, he assured me that it is well under way.  If it is not progressing quickly enough, that is not the fault of the Opposition or the people who will live with this decision for decades to come.  The process was under way but the Minister has not reflected that in the argument.</p><p> I agree that the EPA would be a better fit for the role than Fingal County Council as it is responsible for mapping noise, but it does not have any aviation expertise in terms of taking the balanced approach necessary in tackling the sources of noise.  The CAR would be better placed as regulator because it has expertise in all of the aviation rules and procedures except noise.  The Minister should not rule it out because it does not have noise expertise and then justify the selection of Fingal County Council by reference to its using the levies it will receive from the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, to acquire the necessary expertise.  The proposed staffing arrangements will not provide the necessary expertise.  I do not know why nine people are needed at lower grades.  Rather, a couple of highly skilled people at far more technical grades are required.</p><p> There is a real problem here.  We must cut to the chase.  It comes down to Fianna F&aacute;il.  Deputy Troy is correct.  He has consistently raised this issue with the Government in recent years, pointing out that the regulation must be implemented and why Fingal County Council is not suitable to be responsible for that implementation.</p><p>What Fianna F&aacute;il is proposing will not provide adequate protection.  It is not functionally separate enough.  I know that is what Deputy Troy is attempting to do, but even if the function of separation were there, it would not be sufficient.  There is not sufficient work in a stand-alone capacity for nine people, and certainly not at that level.  Much of the time they would not have anything to do.  It fits in more with aviation in that it is not a nine to five, 365 day a year briefing for this role, so if it were to be set up in that way, there would not be sufficient meat, as it were, to attract people of sufficient capabilities.  That would be a real problem.</p><p> The Minister did not answer the point about the other countries because he repeated back to me the points I had made, thus avoiding the principal point that no other jurisdiction has brought it in the way that we have.  Britain and Germany have not brought it in the way that we have.  What they have is either a local or a regional authority being set up, and let us face the fact that a German regional authority is bigger than Fingal County Council.  In each and every case, however, the Minister for transport of various state departments is also involved in the process and is part of the competent authority.  There is not one local authority on its own.  Therefore, no Administration has brought it in the same way that Ireland has and that point has not been answered yet.</p><p> We are looking for information and concrete answers to questions that are being raised here.  It is not just that we are representing the residents' views or providing rhetoric.  We are not getting the proper and accurate answers on this and it is not our fault that the rush is on now because the preparation was inadequate to begin with.  We are in a difficult situation and this stage of the process can be difficult for people to understand because there are not many votes and maybe we need to explain how that works because it is a bit confusing.  We are trying to move the debate on because the general points have been well articulated.  Most members do not agree with Fingal County Council and nobody outside of the Minister and presumably Fine Gael agrees with what the Minister is doing.  If that is accepted, then the alternative has to be looked at and the Minister has not listened to that.  That is what we are here to do-----</p></speech>

It is shocking that the Minister would go through with recruitment without the approval of the Members of the Oireachtas.  It shows a disregard for what might happen in this committee or the views of the members of the committee, and it is unacceptable to me.  It is equally shocking when the Minister gives out the list of the people who are to be recruited and their level of expertise.  The highest level is the director of service, the salary level for which is established and we know it.  The real expertise that will be needed to carry out the work of the competent authority will have to be bought in by way of consultancy.  Therefore, any organisation we choose could be quite capable of buying in the consultancy in the same way as in the proposal that seems to be on the table with Fingal County Council.</p></speech>

We need that as an economic driver of this country.  Unfortunately we are backed into a corner now.  This is time-sensitive, and the reason it is time-sensitive is because of the procrastination by the Minister over the last two years.  We want to take this Bill and improve it.  That is why we have put forward amendments in that regard.  Listening to the Minister's reply in the last few minutes I have concerns about the level of expertise of the staff members that have been sanctioned by the Department.  Quite frankly it does not matter to me whether the Minister's Department sanctioned them or the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment did.  The Minister is the person responsible for this piece of legislation.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that these members of staff have been sanctioned.  That is fine.  They have not been recruited.  However, I am concerned with the grade of staff that is being sanctioned.  In my initial contribution I asked the Minister to outline clearly how we could have confidence that the staff that would be made responsible for conducting and implementing this regulation would have the necessary expertise and qualifications.  The Minister is talking about planners and engineers.  I have concerns about that and I hope the Minister can clarify that.</p> <p>  It is also worth noting, and it has not been acknowledged by the Minister or indeed by any speaker, that there is an appeals mechanism here.  The appeals mechanism is An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Ultimately Fingal County Council is not going to be the final decision-maker.  There will be an appeals mechanism, that is, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and a further appeals mechanism by way of judicial review.  We do not want to have to go that far.  We reluctantly acknowledge given the work that has been done in relation to Fingal County Council, that independence can be established by creating a body within Fingal County Council by creating a directorate there which is not answerable to anybody else, which can act independently and which must have the required expertise, skill and knowledge to ensure that this EU regulation is implemented to the letter of the law.</p><p>The director would also ensure a balanced approach, that the residents&rsquo; concerns were addressed and that noise mitigation measures were implemented, while at the same time enabling the airport to grow and develop.  It is now at capacity and if we push this down the line, we will put its further development and jobs in the region at risk.  That is why we have proposed the amendments in the way we have and I stand over them.</p></speech>

Perhaps I misunderstand him.  In county councils throughout the State the director of services works under and is answerable to the chief executive officer.  Therefore, will the Deputy explain his position?  Perhaps it is my stupidity, but will he explain what is meant by an independent director of services within a council?</p></speech>

That the staff have been sanctioned by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government really enforces the argument we are making in respect of total interdependency and the inappropriate nature of the council in being the competent authority and the planning authority.  It is the body that comes within the budget of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The levels and pay grades announced are completely out of kilter with those in the rest of the area of aviation regulation, for example.  The pay grades are nothing like those within an IAA or CAR equivalent.  I refer to the high-level technical expertise needed in this area.  It shows a misconception or lack of understanding and is more prevalent in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government than the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport because, when we had briefings, the staff who attended from the Department responsible for the environment were saying the council could, of course, do as described, that it would receive a planning consideration and go to the Department responsible for roads or water services to get advice and factor it in.  It demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the point to state a competent authority has the right, when the planning authority goes to it, to state, "Thus far and no further."  The competent authority must be obeyed.  That the authority can be duly ignored by the planning system represents an unhealthy influence on the part of the Department responsible for the environment.  It actually undermines what should be the independent role of a noise regulator in that regard.  It is actually very unhelpful.</p> <p>  My other point is on the need.  It is the case that we need a competent authority.  That is absolutely true and we have long been campaigning to try to have one.  How time-sensitive is it and what would be the impact?  Who will suffer because of the delay?  The DAA, for example, is on record as stating it does not mind at all who the competent authority is as long as we get our act together and get the legislation through, thus providing for more clarity.  What we are saying strongly is that we all want to see legislation and see this process through, but we want to see it being set up on the right basis in order that we can do both.</p> <p>  A reply I received to a parliamentary question to the Minister in December referred to the plans for the new commission for aviation regulation.  It indicated that work was well under way.  It referred to a high-level project management board, to much due diligence work being done and to numerous working groups.</p><p>Discussions had begun with the trade union F&oacute;rsa.  It involved complex competencies but the Minister was looking at it.  There were a number of stages to be done but it was under way.  If we are doing the job we should be doing it right.  We need to do it right.  I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il.  We can set up a competent authority, but let us set it up in the flipping right way because this is going to be in place for years to come.  That is important.  The Minister has not really addressed those points at all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.1242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2019011600002#AA00200"><p>Finishing up on the issue of where we all stand, my impression before Christmas was that all parties barring Fine Gael were putting it to the Minister that Fingal County Council was not appropriate, that it was important to have complete independence, and that we had to be honest with residents.  That does not now seem to be the case because if Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael vote for the Bill as it stands, the council will be the competent authority.  We have to be upfront with people that this is what is happening.  I hope that will change before Report Stage as a result of dialogue with the residents, but that is where it stands now.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 9, which Deputy Troy just mentioned, provides that the director of the aircraft noise regulator section of the council shall not be subject to the direction of any other person.  First, as Deputy Munster has said, the CEO is the top person in the council.  Not only that, but page 7 of the legislation itself makes it absolutely and abundantly clear that the "the functions of the competent authority [...] shall be performed by the chief executive".  The chief executive of the council will override any other section in the council so Deputy Troy's amendment will do nothing to protect the regulator's independence.</p> <p>  On the issue of time, we absolutely agree that we do not want to delay necessary development but no matter whether one is recruiting for the council, the EPA or the Commission for Aviation Regulation, it takes the same amount of time so that argument is completely redundant.  The people with the necessary skills will need to be found regardless of which body is made the competent authority.  </p> <p>  Obviously Deputy Troy is the spokesperson for the biggest Opposition party and he has been doing the running all along, but there is no point doing the running and then falling back at the time when one is needed, that is, at the finish line.  If the Deputy wants to continue on with what he says he has been doing he needs to stick by the amendments which have been tabled such as, for example, amendment No. 6, which deletes Fingal County Council as the competent authority, or amendment No. 5.</p></speech>

Some people call it arrogance and some have said it was reckless.  It is not arrogant.  No staff have been recruited.  What has happened is that positions have been sanctioned.  That is prudent and a sensible thing to do in anticipation of what we expect to happen in order to introduce noise regulation.  It is not arrogance; it is just the approval of various posts which will require certain expertise.  It is very important to do that.  We should make preparations for something which, as everybody would acknowledge, is urgent.  There have been many delays, for which other people and I have been justifiably criticised.  In order to alleviate the difficulties and problems caused by that delay, it seems absolutely sensible that, in anticipation of Fingal County Council being set up as noise regulator, we should take measures in preparation for what is going to happen and advertise and sanction these nine posts.</p><p>That is neither unwise nor arrogant.</p><p> Fingal County Council will be bringing in additional expertise as needed.  It will bring in more specialists.  I will not get involved in the detail of whom the council brings in, and for what, because that is not my job.  It is up to the council to make those types of decisions.  To describe the approval for posts as arrogance, as Deputy Munster did, is absurd.  It is not arrogance.</p></speech>

I do not think that will be a problem.  When the Deputy says that I have repeated answers I have produced before, if she asks the same questions she will get the same answers.  I do not mind if the Deputy wants to go over the old coals of this long saga time and time again, that is up to her, but she will get the same responses.  Those same responses are the same reasons there has been a delay and I will give those responses every time she asks the same question.  That is fine.  People should be reminded of the difficulties we have faced but the reasons for them will be consistent.</p> <p>  I was asked if the delay is time sensitive and of course it is.  We want to resolve the uncertainty that exists.  The Deputy is representing a large number of residents here today, some of whom are in the Public Gallery, and they are welcome, but we want to make sure that the difficulties and uncertainties which they face and are living through, and I apologise for the delays, are ended.  It is time sensitive and those residents should know exactly what the consequences of what we are doing will be for them and we are determined to do that.  There is a lot in this directive which is balanced and in which those residents should find reassurance.  There is no noise regulator there at all at the moment.</p> <p>  I wish to address what Deputy Troy said.  His amendment looks for a robust body and his concern for independence is one which we share.  I do not envisage any great difficulty with having a chief executive in that situation because of the safeguards which exist.  It would be extraordinary if the chief executive were to do anything to compromise the independence because of the transparency of the process.  That would obviously emerge immediately and the safeguards which are there in the appeals mechanism which we have already mentioned, the commitment to public consultation through the appeals and noise regulation process and the judicial review to which we referred are adequate safeguards to make sure the transparency and independence is there.  </p> <p>  I also wish to assure Deputy Troy that resources and expertise will be brought to bear and, if there are mistakes, the appeal process will catch them.  This is a very thorough process.</p><p>It is a long and arduous process and people will be complaining for a long time to come.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has 18 weeks yet and there are four weeks for appeals, which is to protect residents and the consumer.  The length of time to make sure the process is transparent and thorough is built into the legislation.  That is why it is there.  It is irritating.  We have so many cases of An Bord Plean&aacute;la annoying people because of delays in its decisions but the flip side of that is that the public and all sorts of stakeholders are protected by this and everything is taken into account.  I do not think anybody needs to fear that the process is not transparent and full.  It will be very thorough and forensic.  </p><p> It provides for a new regulatory regime to assess, monitor and enforce noise management at Dublin Airport.  We have had various suggestions about the competent authority here today.  People have suggested the EPA; the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR; and the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, in a post-split situation.  All of them have a bit to offer and all of them have merit but on balance, I am adamant that the best choice is Fingal County Council.  I do not dispute that everything that has been said here today has merit but it is a bit more nuanced.  Fingal County Council has a great deal of expertise.  Overall, it has greater expertise and there is a better case for it than there is for the others.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.1250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2019011600002#CC00300"><p>The Minister made the point that if one asks the same question, one will get the same answer but the problem is that we have been asking some of the same questions and have got either no answer or contradictory answers.  The Minister failed to address that point.  The essence of the point that was being made was that over the course of the past two and a half years when we have talked about this issue, on some occasions, the Minister said "black" while on another occasion, he said "white".  Which one is the right answer when at various times, the Minister has given two diametrically opposed answers to the same question?  The point I made about the Minister referring to past information referred to his critique of the other agencies that might act as a competent authority and the briefing from his Department in November 2018 that he rehearsed for us today when he dealt with points and dismissed the CAR using the same line he took in November but where he failed to address the question he was being asked.  He has not reflected the fact that aviation regulation and the IAA's regulatory functions are being subsumed in this new CAR and that this is the body we envisage would take ownership of all regulatory functions relating to aviation.  The Minister cannot have his cake and eat it.  He cannot say that he is sorry for delaying the Bill, that he knows he is partly responsible for that and that we must rush it now because we are all to blame.  We are not all to blame.  It is not better to have bad law than no law at all.  We have to get this right.</p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister could help us.  He said that he is convinced that Fingal County Council is the best choice.  As we are not convinced of that, the answers he has given us have not overcome that.  Could the Minister give us an explanation of what the nine people will be doing?  As the Minister has looked at it sufficiently to state there are nine people at these particular pay grades, what does he envisage those people doing on a day-to-day basis?  How would it work?  How would it fit in with the rest of the local authority?  We are talking about nine people on various grades, which is not really sufficient at some level.  Could the Minister tell us what they would do to give us an idea of how it might address some of our concerns in terms of how this will work?</p></speech>

On the Chairman's point that this is supposed to be a collective process and that we are supposed to be advancing the debate, the answers are particularly relevant in the context of what staff do.  Nobody has stated he or she agrees with Fingal County Council, except the Minister.  Fianna F&aacute;il has tried to do a bit of both.  In fairness, in his amendment Deputy Troy did take out the reference to the chief executive officer and would give the director of the new unit full authority to deal with the competent authority on these issues.  I accept the point that he has altered the amendment in that the level of subservience to the CEO has been addressed by him, but I put it to him that it is still not enough.  Critically it is not enough in the sense that the level of technical expertise required to maintain such a unit would not fit with it.  In the light of what the Minister said, I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il to re-examine its amendment and for us collectively to come back to the issue on Report Stage.  I take the Minister's point that there are alternatives being proposed, but the best way forward is to agree on one and submit it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I am not expecting the Minister to micromanage any competent authority, but at the outset what I requested was an assurance that the criteria and qualifications specified would be outlined for the staff to be hired for the competent authority, be it an independent unit in Fingal County Council, CAR or whatever else, in order that they would be able to carry out the work required to be done.  In other words, will they have the relevant qualifications and expertise in aircraft noise regulation to ensure they will be able to adjudicate and ensure a balanced approach is adopted?</p></speech>

We do not expect the Minister to micromanage, but it is incredibly relevant.  Environmental sections of a local authority that monitor certain activities might have one, two or three staff working in them.  Nine staff working full time on aircraft noise regulation specifically is quite a lot, but on some occasions one might need many more.  What will the nine staff do?  The Bill tells us - I accept that we need to change it in other respects - that a planning application will be received, on which they will adjudicate.  How often will that happen?  Alternatively, a complaint might be submitted or they might produce a plan every year.  I wonder what else they will do or where is the overlap within the local authority in order to have clarity on how the Department envisages the competent authority working.  What other jurisdictions seem to have is much more of an IAA regulatory function, with a high level of technical expertise in the ongoing monitoring of aviation regulatory functions.</p><p>There might be an element of being pulled on those skill sets.</p></speech>

What I am trying to do is increase the democratic input of the Houses.  It would absolutely allow the Minister to continue to have the ability to make regulations and to inform the House after the event in the normal way but with two exceptions where the regulations must be brought before the House in advance of being made so the Oireachtas can have an input into those two clauses.  It is a provision we introduced on data protection and it is a good precedent.  This would not impact on the Minister or impede his ability to make regulations and lay them after the event except in cases involving a dispute resolution mechanism.  The legislation as its stands states the Minister may introduce regulations in this regard.  The amendment would require him to bring regulations under this remit to the House first.  The Bill provides for the appeals process to be decided by two Ministers of the Houses.  Rather than two Ministers deciding an appeals process, it should come to the House first for discussion.  We have taken this measure in other legislation to increase the democratic input in these two important areas.</p></speech>

I do not think it is necessary.  We have a very democratic way of dealing with these regulations already.

This is a measure that other Departments have introduced to improve the democratic process and allow the House have an input in important aspects of ministerial responsibility for laying regulation before the Houses.  These are two critical areas.  The amendment would not tie the Minister's hands.  It would force him to go before the Houses first and have the argument there rather than nodding through the regulation.  I will certainly press the amendment.</p></speech>

They are the most up-to-date noise guidelines for the protection and well-being of residents in the vicinity of the airport.</p></speech>

That would represent best practice in the monitoring of noise levels and their impact on surrounding communities.  It is crucial that the provision be included in the legislation and that it represents best up-to-date practice.  That is why I support my colleague in tabling the amendment and hope there will be universal support for it.</p></speech>

We do not want to have to come back and amend legislation where we can predict that there is an improved standard and do a good deal with insulation.  It is not possible to insulate a back garden.  We should consider outdoor, as well as indoor, noise.</p></speech>

EU Regulation No. 598/2014 makes it clear that the noise regulator must ensure regard is had to the 2002 environmental noise directive in monitoring noise levels at the airport.  We cannot alter EU Regulation No. 598 which ensures a consistent EU-wide approach to noise levels assessment.  I do not propose to move away from it and it would be impossible to do so.  As I said, the noise regulator will have the required expertise to decide on the most appropriate limits at the airport.  I do not propose to dictate to what the regulator should have regard.  It would be particularly difficult if the amendment were passed because it would contravene EU Regulation No. 598.  I, therefore, call on the proposer to withdraw it in the light of the 2002 environmental noise regulations.</p></speech>

It is not to remove the 2002 regulations but to add the 2018 guidelines which are the most up-to-date guidelines.  It would not contravene anything.  We have checked this out and researched the matter and our clear view is that it would not be a contravention but actually strengthen the legislation.  It would not remove anything from the regulations either.  It would not do what the Minister has said it would.  I do not believe it would cause additional difficulties.  If anything, it would ensure the noise regulator would have regard to the 2002 regulations and the 2018 guidelines, as well as future environmental noise guidelines.  We expect and assume that the noise regulator would do so.  Therefore, it makes perfect sense that the amendment be included in the legislation.</p></speech>

I do not imagine the Minister is seriously suggesting we would be kicked out of the European Union if we were to add this provision.  Is he?  The idea that we must keep something that is 17 years old and cannot update it when we are bringing forward new legislation is farcical.</p></speech>

The logic of what the Minister is saying is that, in effect, we should ignore scientific evidence that is known to cling to a bureaucratic measure.  Part of the reason this legislation has been delayed in its implementation in Ireland is the delays within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The amendment would not undo anything.  It would simply add a reference to the recognised reality in respect of current levels and the health impacts of aircraft noise, especially at night.</p><p>It is actually essential.  The Minister's answer will be frightening for people who are listening.  Effectively, he is saying that this is a bureaucratic measure and that we are only doing this because we signed up with the EU.  He is suggesting we can ignore all that good stuff about science and the actual reasons we are bringing in aircraft noise regulation and the health impacts.  He is saying we will not bring it up to date.  This is not a contradiction; it is an add-on.  It does not undermine anything.  It strengthens the Bill.</p></speech>

We cannot add or take away from this regulation.  I wish to comment on the 2002 environmental noise directive to which the Deputies have referred.  Obviously, it is open to the regulator to have regard to that when making decisions.  However, I cannot possibly do anything but ask the proposer to withdraw this amendment because it would be problematic if it were to be passed.  We cannot divert from EU Regulation No. 598/2014.  It is as simple as that.  We are not allowed to do it.  That is the legal advice we have and it is absolutely definitive.  I call on the Deputy to withdraw it.</p> <p>  If Deputies want me to look at it at some point between now and Report Stage to see if there is anything we can do, I can do so but I cannot possibly accept the amendment the way it is.

It sounds farcical to say we cannot add or strengthen EU regulations.  This can be dealt with in several ways by the proposer.  We cannot actually write in the regulation but we could list all the things in the regulation on Report Stage if we wanted to.  There would be nothing to stop us doing that.  It is ridiculous.  Perhaps that could be considered.</p> <p>  I have to leave shortly but I have put forward amendment No. 38, which deals with making health explicit in the evaluation of noise effects, as do a range of other amendments.  I will definitely be re-entering it on Report Stage because this goes to the heart of the entire debate.  The Minister seems to be sticking by bureaucratic strictures rather than recognising that he should be making changes.  If that is the case, it is 17 years old.  Much has changed and much has been found out since then.</p></speech>

Will the Minister and his officials be willing to share that written legal advice with members of the committee to allow us to review it in advance of Report Stage?  Are we simply to take it on the nod that the legal advice states it is contrary to this measure being included?</p><p>I reiterate that we are not in any way seeking to contravene or remove the 2002 directive but, rather, to update it to take account of the 2018 World Health Organization, WHO, environmental noise guidelines.  We are not seeking to remove anything.  It is an addition.  As Deputy Clare Daly stated, the amendment takes account of the improved scientific data produced by the WHO which form the basis for the 2018 European noise directive.  I ask the Minister to share with the committee the written legal advice which he states he has received.</p></speech>

I cannot support this amendment because I have received definitive legal advice that we cannot add to or take away from the provisions provided in the Bill.  I do not seek to counter the arguments that have been made for the amendment and agree that it would be very useful if the latest environmental noise directive was included in the consideration of the noise regulator but I cannot include it in the legislation because to do so would be inconsistent with all of the other European legislation.  In the light of what has been stated, we will reconsider the question and revert to members on Report Stage, which would be reasonable.  The Deputy is asking me to do something which I cannot do.  However, I can pose the question again and try to accommodate the Deputy in some way between now and Report Stage if that is possible.  That said, I cannot and will not agree to the amendment.</p></speech>

The committee has been left in the dark about the legal advice because it is privileged, but I assure the committee that that is the advice we received.  Sometimes, legal advice is the last thing I want to get.  It can be and has on many occasions been a nightmare for a Minister to receive legal advice but it would be a very foolish and reckless Minister who would defy such advice.  If I did not act in accordance with the legal advice, the Deputy would be the first person to ask me what I was doing.</p></speech>

However, the section of the Bill dealing with definitions does not only make reference to the 2002 directive; it also refers to decisions of the European Parliament and Council in 2015.  It is not that the Minister is dealing solely with the 2002 directive to which nothing has been added.  The definitions in the Bill make reference to material from the European Parliament and Council in 2015.  The amendment recognises the fact that we are now in 2019 and there is further regulation in this area.  The Minister might not be able to give us the advice he received but we can seek our own advice on the matter.  Is the Minister telling me that no other jurisdiction in the European Union has incorporated these guidelines in legislation or regulation?  I doubt that no country has done so.  Has the Minister examined the way in which the directive has been implemented in each jurisdiction?  The difficulty is that the Minister stated that his legal advice indicates that, for example, the Irish Aviation Authority may not be installed as regulator, but we know that eight member states have their equivalent of the IAA as the competent authority and the world has not caved in.</p><p>They have been allowed to do so as sovereign states within the EU.  The same argument applies in regard to the amendment.  Can the Minister give us that assurance which nobody else has?  I suspect that he cannot and we will have to examine it ourselves in order to find out.  I would be very surprised if we do not find it because the Bill goes beyond dealing with the 2002 directive by making reference to 2015 decisions.  We are asking that it take account of the 2018 guidelines.</p></speech>

It is unusual although not unprecedented for privilege to be waived.  Instead of members trying to deal with this in the dark, it would be very helpful for the committee in framing further or altered amendments for Report Stage to have the legal advice, or a synopsis thereof, in order to achieve the optimum regulation.  Could that be made available?  If the Minister is not willing to consider waiving privilege, will he give us a synopsis of the legal advice such that we can use it to work towards the same aim?</p></speech>

Obviously, I cannot breach privilege, but members will be given an accurate flavour of the legal advice.  That will be done in a spirit of goodwill such that members are not left in any doubt about what are the bones of that advice.  Would that be agreeable to members?</p></speech>

That was done in regard to competent authorities.  The Minister is relying on the fact that this cannot be done in Europe, so I presume the officials will be able to show us what has been done elsewhere in Europe in this area.</p></speech>

I expressed the view that it would be desirable for that report to be reflected in this legislation.  I am swayed by the argument of Deputy Darragh O'Brien that such an addition should be acceptable.  All members can take legal advice between now and Report Stage in order to make a call on it at that Stage.</p></speech>

The delay has meant that new and more up-to-date scientific guidelines have since been produced.  We are trying to take account of that and ensure that the new competent authority does likewise.  I know from the work of my colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, that some airports, such as Manchester Airport, take account of the new guidelines.  As proposer of the amendment, I accept what the Minister has stated and am prepared to withdraw the amendment.  However, I reserve the right to reintroduce it on Report Stage if we are not satisfied by the level of detail supplied to members of the committee.</p></speech>

The council officials suggested that the WHO guidelines would have to be transposed into primary legislation in order for the council to implement them.  We are the people charged with introducing primary legislation.</p> <p>  The Minister's suggestion is useful.  I hope that he accepts the bona fides of the proposers of the amendment which aims to strengthen the legislation by using the best scientific monitoring and best environmental guidelines available.  It is incumbent on us to do so.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il will also seek legal advice on the basis of what the Minister said.  It would be useful to meet his officials and the earlier the better if it is proposed to take Report Stage next week.</p></speech>

I am unable to accept it on technical legal drafting grounds as presented by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel which is part of the Attorney General's office.  It is, I am told, sufficiently clear from the recital in EU Regulation No. 598 that the balanced approach is a concept developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO.  As the regulation has direct effect from a technical drafting perspective, it is not required to be repeated in the Bill.</p></speech>

The other, the basis on which the Minister opposed the amendment, concerned the more recent World Health Organization guidelines.  The Minister's argument was against that proposal, but there should be no problem in including this one.  I would be happier to have it included in some shape or form than not at all.</p></speech>

Local residents feel left out of the process and have very legitimate concerns about planning issues, in particular, the retrospective changes in the planning of flights and other operations at the airport.  The Bill is extremely technical.  Can the Minister provide assurances that it does not provide for these changes?  If it does, will he point to where exactly in the Bill it is provided for because I have been unable to find it and would like to table an amendment on Report Stage?  It is vital that there be consultation with residents and that they be given an opportunity to air their concerns, be it about health, noise pollution and so on, in respect of which there are no safeguards provided for in the Bill.  There have been references in the media to residents having the option of moving out of the area.</p><p>Many of the residents have lived in the area for decades.  It is vital there is consultation with the local community.  I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment in order that consultation will take place.</p></speech>

Very often people are consulted and told what is going to happen.  I am sure Deputy Munster will agree that it is important that the residents are not only consulted in a transparent way but in a meaningful way and that this is knitted into the process.  Very often stakeholders are met in pecking order and the determining factor tends to be economic rather than social grounds.  It is important that the residents are stakeholders on an equal footing.</p></speech>

We have to be careful about taking possession of the argument that there are some people who are in favour of including the residents and others who are not.  Everybody is in favour of the residents having the maximum possible input.  The text which Deputy Munster seeks to amend is taken directly from EU Regulation 598 and I am unable to amend an EU regulation.  I agree that the local residents need to be included in the review.  The inclusion of local residents groups and individual residents is provided for in subsection (e) which states: " the stakeholders are consulted in a transparent way on the intended actions;".  Section 9 also provides for a 14 week public consultation on the draft decision of the noise regulator.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy, through no fault of her own, was not here earlier when we were discussing the issue of residents.  EU Regulation 598 states that if the assessment referred to indicates that new operating restrictions may be required to address a noise problem at an airport the competent authority shall ensure that the process of consultation with interested parties, which may take the form of a mediation process, is organised in a timely and substantive manner, ensuring openness and transparency as regards data and computation methodologies and that interested parties shall have at least three months prior to the adoption of new operating restrictions to submit comments.  It also states that interested parties shall include at least local residents living in the vicinity of the airport and affected by air traffic noise or their representatives, the relevant local authorities and representatives of local businesses based in the vicinity of the airport whose activities are affected by air traffic and the operation of the airport.  This is a direction to the noise regulator, which, I think, meets what Deputy Munster is seeking in her amendment.</p></speech>

I am sure that all members of the committee will agree that noise regulation at the airport needs to be an open and inclusive process that respects the real interests of local residents too.  I have provided for this in the Bill.  The Bill is fundamentally in favour of sustainable development of the airport in a way that balances the commercial ambitions of the DAA, the national economic interest, the needs of business, tourism interests and the legitimate rights of local residents.  I could have listed other stakeholders that are to be considered, but I did not.  One such stakeholder would be relevant airport operators, who are lower down on the list than the residents.</p></speech>

All of these amendments are seeking to include health considerations along with a big list of other stuff that also has to be taken into account.  When we made the point this morning, the Minister said that health is covered in the regulation anyway so there is no need for it and that was his first argument.  The Minister's other argument was that he will not add it in as part of this at this stage.  Those two points are, in part, contradictory.</p> <p>  It also comes back to the point I made earlier about cost-effectiveness.  For example, under the process of aircraft noise regulation, the Bill states, "the competent authority shall ensure ... the Balanced Approach" and it goes on, and takes into account the likely cost-effectiveness of the measure.  The Bill later states that the following combination of measures must be considered with a view to what is the most cost-effective.  All of these amendments are simply seeking to ensure that the impact on health is also factored into the considerations when the competent authority is adjudicating and implementing the balanced approach.  It is not tying its hands.  It is just saying it must be mindful in assessing whatever approach it adopts to include health as a consideration.</p> <p>  The Minister said he is going to come back in the context of Deputy Troy's amendment and the guidelines and maybe we can factor something in around that.  The point here, for all of these amendments, is we cannot have this Bill without any reference to health specified in it or any reference in it to the modern guidelines and best scientific advice, because the impetus behind this regulation is to deal with and restrict aviation practices and the noise they create to benefit the health of residents.  The idea that we could not put that somewhere in the Bill is mad.  I am not going to drone through the pages of other criteria that the competent authority has to take into account but it does not refer to health.  I am not saying we should take out cost-effectiveness and replace it with health considerations.  I am not saying health considerations have to be the only thing.  I am just adding it in as one of the factors that should be considered when the competent authority is doing its job.</p></speech>

The name of the Bill is the Aircraft Noise (Dublin Airport) Regulation Bill 2018.  If the health measures are not included, what is the Bill about?  I completely understand this is a national facility and we are looking at mitigating effects, but if health measures are not counted, what is the Bill about?</p><p>I support the points that have been made.</p></speech>

We dealt with health earlier and we agreed that point.  Health considerations are specifically singled out in the regulations.  I will read from the preamble:</p> <blockquote> 	The importance of health aspects needs to be recognised in relation to noise problems, and therefore it is important that those aspects be taken into consideration in a consistent manner at all airports when a decision is taken on noise abatement objectives, taking into account the existence of common Union rules in this area.  Therefore, health aspects should be assessed in accordance with Union legislation on the evaluation of noise effects. </blockquote> <p>It is very specific about that, so it is very important.</p></speech>

The proposed health impact assessment which is put in there is new wording.  We cannot introduce new terms to this.</p><p>Subsections (2) and (3) of section 9, as I have said, are directly from EU regulation 598 and, as I have explained, I am not able to amend in any way the requirements set out in an EU regulation.  That message has to be hammered through because that is legal advice.  I am not able to amend it in any way.  It is in the regulations.</p><p>The health of local residents is a hugely important and vital issue, as evidenced in the regulation.  I do not want to repeat this <i>ad nauseam</i>, but putting into legislation something which is already in the regulations seems strange and unnecessary, but it is important and not contradictory to say that and point out that it is in the regulation. </p><p>The health of local residents is hugely important.  Article 1 of EU regulation 598 sets out that the objective of the regulation is &quot;to facilitate the achievement of specific noise abatement objectives, including health aspects&quot;.  The very purpose of the regulation, and therefore this Bill, is &quot;to limit or reduce the number of people significantly affected by potentially harmful effects of aircraft noise, in accordance with the balanced approach&quot;.  Article 1 has direct effect, in addition to regulation 598 and other existing European noise and environmental directives which this Bill interlinks.  I am assured that health aspects are already embedded in this legislation.</p></speech>

There are a whole number of different amendments in this and the health impact assessment is an add-in, something different, and it would obviously put a more considerable burden, as it were, on the competent authority in evaluating these measures.  I do not have a problem with that because, if it were really doing its job properly, carrying out an impact assessment from a health perspective, something we do not do enough in this country, it would be precisely the type of impact assessment that should be done.  We are all used to environmental impact assessments but we are not so used to health impact assessments.  I realise that is raising the bar but that is appropriate in the context of this legislation, although I realise I am pushing the boundary on that.  I will park that for now, with the right to re-enter it, but, having genuinely said that, I do not accept what the Minister says about the other points on health.  We have been here for in the region of four hours, so maybe I am just not getting it.  On one hand, we are being told we cannot add something, then the Minister is reading something which specifies health aspects, then saying nowhere in our legislation is there a reference to health considerations but is then saying that he cannot take away or add anything.</p><p>Obviously, the Minister has taken it away because health is not mentioned anywhere in the Bill.  If it is so much an integral part of the regulation, which it clearly is, there is no impediment to specifying it in some format and I have not heard any good reason for not doing so.  I would like to explore the idea of a health impact assessment and I reserve the right to introduce an amendment on that.  The Department is correct, however, that that would be pushing it.  I do not have it in the definitions either and I would need to have it in there.  While that is a whole new arena, mentioning health is not.  It is much more straightforward.  It is striking that every Opposition committee member has said clearly that they expect health and the guidelines to be factored in in some format when we get to Report Stage.  I hope the Minister is hearing that message because Opposition members will get together to agree on amendments if the Department does not factor in health.  Hopefully, in the promised discussions in the next week, we can all come up with a wording with which we could all live.</p></speech>

Section 9(9) states &ldquo;the Minister may, by regulations made under section 6, prescribe dispute resolution procedures applicable to a dispute which arises between the competent authority and another person&rdquo;.  My amendment proposes to change the term &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Members have no control over this process unless we require the Minister to do that.  This has to be seen in the context of my other amendments which bring this aspect of the regulation before the House.  The amendment accepted earlier provided that the Minister had the right to make regulations and lay them afterwards, except with this clause concerning dispute resolution in which the House will have an input.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for extensive public consultation, technical discussions between the Dublin Airport Authority, the Irish Aviation Authority and slot co-ordinators, a robust appeals process and, finally, recourse to the courts for judicial review.  It was considered prudent to include in the Bill the power to make regulations in circumstances where further dispute mechanisms may be required, even if the need is unlikely, given what I have described, especially in respect of recourse to the courts.</p></speech>

It is interesting that the Minister referred to a robust appeals mechanism and access to the courts.</p><p>There are a few people in the Gallery who nearly fell off their seats when they heard that.  Access to the courts is prohibitive for citizens.  It is not a level playing field in that regard.  Sadly, people have borne a heavy burden with such cases in the past.  The way the legislation is drafted means the appeals process is not accessible.  There is no question that it leaves it in that arena which disenfranchises residents.  My amendment proposes that the Minister would have to deal with it.  As he said earlier, it probably will not arise all that much.  However, if it does, then my amendment would ensure the Minister would have to bring it before the House.  It is an important amendment.</p></speech>

One needs deep pockets for judicial reviews, however.  It is not like taking a court case where if one wins, one gets one&rsquo;s costs.  In a judicial review, one is paying the full costs.  It is only wealthy people who have that recourse.</p> <p>  I have some experience of disputes concerning Kildare County Council&rsquo;s planning decisions for Weston Airport.  Even in that scenario, which is minor compared to Dublin Airport, getting expertise can be expensive for residents&rsquo; groups which rely on voluntary fundraising.  A realistic mechanism has to be put in place to ensure there is an honest broker in disputes.  There is a validity in strengthening the provisions with this amendment.</p></speech>

I sympathise with the point made about costs.  However, the Minister has the option to intervene in a dispute resolution.  The term &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would probably put too much onus on the Minister.  The provision, as drafted, is adequate.</p></speech>

We must bear in mind that this section deals with what we will call the normal EU Regulation No. 598 application process which is slightly different from that in the various sections.  Part 3 deals with planning applications.  It involves normal queries and how the competent authority will deal with them outside a planning application.  The legislation states only the airport authority may, by notice in writing given to the competent authority, request the competent authority to assess a noise issue.  I am looking to ensure the airport authority or any organisation or individual impacted by airport noise would be able to approach the competent authority because as of now only the airport authority is allowed to initiate the process under EU Regulation No. 598.  The problem concerns the criteria.  On the one hand, the DAA may do so at its discretion.  That has to be changed.  What does &quot;may at its discretion mean&quot;?  What is the threshold?  What if the DAA decides not to go to the competent authority?  Who would stop it in that regard?  Why does the DAA have control over whether it should do so?  Should it not be mandatory?  If it is, what is the threshold?  The DAA must assess the matter in a manner that is transparent.  The two amendments are critical; otherwise, we are not specifying a route for persons outside the DAA.  I am adamant that the amendments should be accepted.</p></speech>

If we are talking about fairness and a balanced approach, other interested parties should have a mechanism outside the designated five-year period to raise concerns with the competent authority.  On us having confidence in the independence of the competent authority and if it can determine whether a request to intervene is warranted, we know that, unfortunately, in certain instances, there are people who make spurious requests.  We can look at what happened in the case of Apple where people made spurious claims and objections that held up the process.  I am not saying people would do so, but the competent authority should be allowed discretion to determine whether something warrants further investigation.  I support amendment No. 47 which would include a notice in writing by the airport authority or any organisation or individual impacted by airport noise, but it should be left to the discretion of the competent authority to determine whether the matter warranted further investigation</p></speech>

Even then, the noise regulator will be the one to determine whether or not the situation has changed significantly enough to warrant a review and if it does, that process will be open and subject to consultation and appeal, etc.  Therefore, the general public is still empowered.  There is extensive public consultation and an appeals process and the regulator is empowered to respond to non-compliance by the airport with enforcement of a noise determination.  Residents can go to the competent authority with complaints and the competent authority can and, obviously, will look at them.  </p></speech>

Again, it is about a balanced approach.  It cannot be for the DAA alone to decide whether to seek a review.  As things change, residents need to be able to do so and not just in the five-year period.  The Minister mentioned exceptional circumstances.  I have always supported responsible and reasonable growth of the airport, which is very important.  Residents and people in north Dublin also support this.  As I said to the Minister during meetings of this committee in the summer, the airport is a major employer and investor and a crucial part of our national infrastructure.  Having said that, impacted communities need to have a say as well.  It is important, particularly with amendment No. 47, that this balance is struck.  By putting this amendment forward, Deputy Clare Daly is striking that balance and showing a balanced approach.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Troy about possibly allowing the competent authority to decide on each case so that a complaint or observation can be made but that the competent authority cannot be directed to deal with every single one of them because someone could write to the authority every day, as happens from time to time.  We would still be giving the competent authority the discretion to decide whether the matter is sufficiently serious to take forward.  Amendment No. 47 strengthens the legislation and makes it better.  I see no reason the Minister would not take the amendment on board, whereas I can understand why he would not accept amendment No. 48. </p></speech>

If they do not have confidence in the regulator, we have a serious problem.  I think they will have confidence in the regulator, which is the objective of this legislation.  The regulator must then make a decision.  This section requires the DAA to prove a case and do a lot of work.  It is very burdensome on the authority.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.1487" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2019011600002#CCC00400"><p>There is a misconception on the part of the Department with regard to this part of the regulation.  The Minister talks about appeals processes as if everything that happens in the airport that has a noise implication goes through the planning process first, life goes on as normal and nothing happens outside either the noise plan that is produced every couple of years or the planning application when some major change is proposed and people have an input under Part 3 of the Act.  This legislation is about how the noise regulator does its job.  The Minister asks how the noise regulator would know whether there is an impact from noise.  At the moment, the Bill provides that the noise regulator can only intervene when the DAA goes to it.  There is no facility for a resident to do so.  What happens if there is a change to aircraft noise testing?  I live in River Valley and planes keep me awake at night.  There is no mechanism to address this because the matter falls outside the review that takes place every couple of years and the planning application.  I feel I am being negatively impacted by noise.  As this is specified, there is no route for me to go to the competent authority because the role of the competent authority is only to assess applications that come from the DAA, not from residents.  I thought the Minister would go along with this amendment because I thought the current provision was a clear oversight.  I did not think it was a big deal.</p> <p>  I take the point that amendment No. 48 may be over prescriptive.  My thinking on that one was that the competent authority may, at its discretion, comply with the request.</p><p>What I was doing there was trying to make sure that the competent authority at least dealt with the application.  I did not want to prescribe a big unwieldy process as to how it would deal with the assessment.  What I meant was that the competent authority would not be able to simply ignore the application.  It would at least have to write back to the person making the application and let him or her know that the authority was not invoking the procedure for whatever reason.  That was all I was thinking of.  I was not stating the authority would be obliged to invoke the whole 18-month aspect or anything like that.  Perhaps I did not get the balance right on that one.  </p></speech>

How that is stacked up in respect of the balance of rights feeds into that confidence.  As has been said, the Bill does seem to be very one-sided in how it is framed.  That undermines the very point the Minister is making on the confidence people might have in the regulator.  This amendment is the kind of thing that helps to create the balance that could feed into creating the confidence to which the Minister referred.</p></speech>

There is an obvious downside in that there might be an avalanche of complaints and difficulties.  What has been said about there being a case for what has been suggested as an approach has some validity.  I am particularly taken by the argument that those measures, those appeals which I mentioned, are not accessible to everybody.  We are trying to protect people who are vulnerable.  What I will do is try to meet members' arguments on Report Stage.  We will see if we can amend the Bill in a way that is acceptable and that gives greater access to the regulator for ordinary people to be able to complain at less cost than might be the case.  I am not saying we are going to produce money but we will try to make it more accessible.  I suggest that it be withdrawn and we will look at putting in an amendment.</p></speech>

If the Minister wants to come along and change that afterwards, if it is accepted, I will be openly part of that process.  For, now, however, the best way of ensuring access is that amendment No. 47 is passed.  If the Minister wants to improve it when we come back, that is fine.

During a briefing with officials, Deputy Clare Daly pointed out the inconsistency with the planning and development provisions.  While I am not accepting the wording of the amendments put forward by the Deputies as they have been drafted, the amendments I am putting forward will achieve the same object and catch all consequential amendments required throughout the Bill.  This will make it clear that any noise mitigation measures imposed as part of a regulatory decision by the noise regulator may only come into effect when the 28-day appeal period is completed.  Where an appeal is made, any decision of the noise regulator is put on hold until such time as the final decision is made on the appeal.  I thank the members.  </p></speech>

Again, this is partially linked to the last amendment we dealt with a minute ago.  It seemed to me that there were clauses in the Bill whereby a recommendation of the authority could be avoided for spurious reasons.  I am referring to delayed implementation.  I am not sure if the Bill is doing what I thought it was doing.  To be honest, I found it hard to negotiate what was being said in it.  It appeared to me that it was providing an out.  The Bill refers to deferring, &quot;for reasons stated in the notice, the coming into effect of a noise mitigation measure&quot;.</p><p>We are talking about the deferring of a noise-mitigation measure, or a measure that would enhance the environment for local residents.  It is suggested a measure would be deferred if not practical to implement.  How can we include a provision that stops the clause being used to delay and frustrate the implementation of a noise-mitigation measure?  I am seeking to include a provision meaning there cannot be a delay for ridiculous reasons, for example.  I was not entirely happy with my amendment.  I proposed the insertion of "if immediate implementation is not possible".  At all times we should be trying to have whatever decision the competent authority makes implemented immediately.  I am worried about a reference in the legislation to an ability to defer so I am trying to include something to cushion it by stating the only reason one might defer is if immediate implementation is not possible.  I did not know the correct technical term, or whether it should be "possible" or "practicable".  I am not sure but the amendments are trying to avoid what I describe.  I am not sure whether my amendments succeed or whether the Minister has others that might address the issue.  That is my current position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-16a.1531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2019011600002#FFF00200"><p>I see what Deputy Clare Daly is trying to achieve but we must be cognisant of the fact that some noise-mitigation measures would take time to implement.  For argument's sake, a noise buffer zone could not be constructed in a matter of a day, two days or three days but ceasing a certain activity might be possible within one, two or three days.  How can the Minister guarantee that when the competent authority hands down a noise-mitigation recommendation that clearly sets a realistic timeframe for implementation, it will not be abused or exploited in some way?  Preventing this is what we are trying to achieve here.</p></speech>

Could it be on the basis of cost?  If so, would that be acceptable?  Some mitigation measures in regard to inland water and sea pollution have been left on hold for many years because the money has not been available from the local authority to implement them, yet there was ongoing pollution.  Who will be paying the piper?  Has the Minister any thoughts on the reasons there could be deferrals?</p></speech>

It was somewhat difficult to imagine the circumstances she was describing.  I am not accepting these amendments because I do not want to tell the noise regulator when or in what circumstances measures to be imposed by virtue of regulatory decision should come into effect.  It will be a matter for the noise regulator to determine at its discretion and to detail its reasoning and its decision in a report.  One should remember the regulator can enforce compliance and bring court proceedings against anyone, including the DAA.</p></speech>

Both of my colleagues made excellent points and articulated the issue better than I did.  This is about noise mitigation so our objective is to get the noise-mitigation measures in place as early as possible.  I agree with Deputy Troy's point that implementation can take time, but stopping a certain activity could be done immediately.  That is why I included "if immediate implementation is not possible&rdquo;.  Obviously, the authority should have power where a measure requires a lead-in period but Deputy Brendan Ryan's point in this regard is exactly right in that if we are giving it the power of deferral, we have to include some caveats; otherwise it should not be given the power to defer because its job is supposed to be implementing noise-mitigation measures.  The Minister is the one who introduced the concept of deferring.  We are just trying to add safeguards, in a common-sense way.  We realise some things cannot be done overnight and that there may be a lead-in time but the authority has to be able to justify its decisions and there cannot be spurious reasons given.  I am not happy with the Minister's proposal at all.  I am not saying mine is the solution but what the Minister said in his answer is definitely not.  It was a worrying answer.</p></speech>

Deputy Ryan said that if a measure has been decided upon and the competent authority decides it is to be deferred, it must give a reason if it is not obvious.  Deputy Daly is trying to improve the Bill.  Nobody wants to put on a ridiculous shackle requiring the implementation in a day of a measure that is not implementable in a day.  That is not the purpose of the amendment.  The purpose is to ensure that, if there is a deferral, reasons must be given, be they associated with the cost, the timeframe-----</p></speech>

The regulator could state that ideally a measure should be implemented but that its implementation must be deferred because it believes the DAA does not have the money to implement it.

We want an independent competent authority that is capable of making decisions.  We all want that and nobody is being ridiculous here saying he or she expects everything to be implemented immediately.  There are practical considerations that militate against that happening but what we do not want is what Deputy Brendan Ryan highlighted, namely, the use of some nefarious financial reasons or other such reasons.  The Minister is the one who mentioned deferring.  It is written into the legislation that the authority is being given the power to defer.  We are not proposing taking that power from the authority but just proposing the insertion of the words "if immediate implementation is not possible".  Perhaps that is not the best wording.  It would overcome the problem of money being used as an argument.  Logistical arrangements such as those referred to by Deputy Troy would take time, which is different.  It is a matter of trying to strike a balance, and saying "No" does not deal with that.</p></speech>

For consistency, it is simply replicating similar decisions in the Planning and Development Act whereby the planning authority is always party to an appeal against a planning decision.</p></speech>

It makes reference to the process to be undertaken by the noise regulator under section 9 and replicates it to provide full powers for the board.  It also allows the board to undertake, as necessary and appropriate, an appropriate or environmental assessment in its consideration of an appeal against a regulatory decision.  The amendment ensures that in advance of noise mitigation measures or operating restrictions to be imposed as part of An Bord Pleannala's decision on appeal, the full requirements of EU Regulation No. 598 will have been met, while the board will undertake its own assessment.  The amendment also allows the board to adopt all or part of the report prepared by the noise regulator in its decision.</p></speech>

The board&rsquo;s report will include as appropriate the information set out in section 9(12) of the Bill, which the noise regulator would have also been required to include in its own report.  This includes details of the measures to be imposed, reasons for its decision, what options were considered, a summary of the data examined and a non-technical summary.  This is in line with the transparency requirements of EU Regulation No. 598/2014 and ensures interested parties are well informed as to the reasons for the board&rsquo;s decision.</p> <p>  Where the board is considering measures that were not considered or consulted on by the noise regulator, it must firstly prepare a draft report to accompany a draft decision.  The board must also prepare a final report detailing its final decision.  Furthermore, specific reference is made the requirements of the board to publish its draft report or final report along with its decision and a notice detailing how a person may have access to them.</p></speech>
