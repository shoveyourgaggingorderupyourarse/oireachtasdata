    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1650" speakername="Mark Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#A00200"><p>I am very pleased to open this public hearing of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on the topic of the constitutional future of the island of Ireland.  I warmly welcome the Senators who are members of the committee.  Senator McDowell has joined us as well.  This is the first day of our public hearings.  These public meetings are the second part of a process that began in July, whereby the public were invited to make written submissions to the committee.  On behalf of the committee, I sincerely thank everybody who sent in a written submission.</p> <p>  This year marks the centenary of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  While we are glancing back, we are looking forward.  The public consultation will look at the constitutional future of the island of Ireland in the context of the ongoing public policy debate on the issue, the safeguarding of the peace process and the future we would all like to see for generations to come.</p> <p>  As part of the public consultation process, we invited submissions from individuals, interested groups and organisations from all over the island, from all communities and all traditions.  The committee encouraged all those traditions to put forward their views, whatever they are, in order that we could hear about their vision for the future.  The Seanad Public Consultation Committee acknowledges the important work of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Seanad public consultation process was as follows.  We wanted to: listen to the views of young people throughout the island of Ireland, including the voices of the communities and traditions of Northern Ireland, on their vision for the future; examine the criteria for referendums and the lessons of referendums held here and in other jurisdictions; and consider the societal and economic opportunities and challenges that should be considered, such as all-island healthcare, all-island education, housing, climate change, biodiversity, culture and language, sport, reconciliation and the important question of the subvention in Northern Ireland.  Following on from all of our hearings, we will issue a draft report, which will be prepared by the committee and published as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I welcome the members of the Public Consultation Committee.  I will name them all.  There is the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Joe O'Reilly, and Senators Frances Black, Victor Boyhan, Pat Casey, Emer Currie, Vincent P. Martin, Mark Wall and Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile.  I thank Senator Gerry Horkan, who is substituting today for Senator Casey.  Most importantly, I welcome our witnesses.  We are here to listen to you, the young people, who are representing the voices of many throughout this island about the future you would like to see for this island for the next 100 years and beyond.  I welcome Caitlin Thompson, Eoin Forkan and Eoghan Flood from For&oacute;ige and Frederique Offereins and Conor McAuley.  Thank you, Conor, for being here.  I welcome Roisin Myers from the National Youth Council of Ireland.  We have Eoin Millar, Holly Clyde and Kate Lynch from the Northern Ireland Youth Forum and Niamh Mallaghan, who will speak on the theme of youth advocacy.  I welcome you all sincerely and thank you for all the effort you have put into drawing up your thoughts on how we should move forward.</p> <p>  I will now read out the legal briefing.  This is standard practice at all formal sittings of all committees.  I remind you all that it is a long-standing parliamentary practice that you should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if your statements are potentially defamatory in respect of any identifying of a person or entity, you will be directed to discontinue your remarks.  It is imperative that you comply with such direction immediately.  For our witnesses attending remotely, there are limitations on parliamentary privilege.  I remind Members that they are allowed to participate in this meeting only if they are on location in Leinster House, which they are.</p> <p>  I first call on Caitlin Thompson from For&oacute;ige.  Caitlin, you are most welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caitlin Thompson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#A00300"><p>Good morning, a Chathaoirligh, committee members, Senators and fellow young people here today.  My name is Caitlin Thompson and I have a voice.  We, the young people sitting in the Seanad, have voices, important voices, and our voices deserve to be listened to.  I want to talk about the significance of our being here today, including our voices in this discussion about Ireland's constitutional future and ensuring we continue to have an influence on the processes that could radically affect our future and the future of this island.</p> <p>  Ireland has come a long way since the days when it was the case that "children should be seen and not heard".  Young people's presence in the Seanad Chamber today compounds just how archaic that statement is.  It shows how much we have evolved from those traditional, limiting and conservative views from our parents' and grandparents' times.</p> <p>  I speak from my experience when I say that young people today are inclusive and accepting and demonstrate immense generational development.  We focus on treating all people as people.  These values are all needed in decision-making, political conversations and the question of constitutional change and a possible united Ireland.  As young people, we are part of the solution because we see the world through the proverbial youth-coloured glasses.  We are important for what we bring to the table today, not just when we are older and in positions of leadership then.  In fact, young people are ideally placed to play a leading role in this conversation here and now.</p> <p>  I am fortunate to have the invaluable opportunity to act as youth observer to the board of directors of For&oacute;ige, elected by my peers around the country.  This experience is instilling in me a deep understanding of the inner workings of the organisation.  It contributes to my development through building my skills, such as confidence, communication and critical thinking, but is also positive for For&oacute;ige, making it more inclusive and future-forward by having young people represented and able to influence the organisation's direction at this high level.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that there are many young people who may not always have the opportunity to have their voices heard.  It is for that very reason that it is important to enlist other young people to act as advocates for their peers and to make sure we give opportunities and support to young people from all walks of life to participate in order that youth voices are included in the decision-making processes of important political decisions that affect our future.  What could have a greater impact than the decision process of Ireland's constitutional future or the chance of a united Ireland?  Young people, time and time again, display our stellar ability to take the initiative and to do our research on topics that matter to us such as climate change, social injustice and so forth.  This ensures we have a level of understanding and allows us to speak factually on issues that affect not only us but all of society.  Our pursuit of issues that we care deeply about highlights our ambition to be included in and to meaningfully influence the decision process.  Perhaps this means allowing young people to vote at the lower age of 16.  We are passionate about building a future that is fair and just for all.</p> <p>  In recent years, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has supported young people's voices, as seen through Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and the initiatives around youth participation in decision-making.  This has led to real change for young people such as the comhairle executive's successful campaign for a youth travel card.  This highlights how a positive relationship between young people and decision-makers at a local and a national level can contribute to forward-thinking change, but all are striving to achieve a common goal.  As the old Irish saying goes, n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile: we are stronger together.</p> <p>  I invite the committee members to take a look around the Seanad Chamber today.  The faces they see are the future of our island.  The decisions made today and tomorrow are decisions that will ultimately alter and shape our lives.  If we do not encourage and engage our young people to participate in our democracy, we risk an Ireland where young people are enticed abroad by better financial and lifestyle opportunities and where they feel more valued.  There is no more important decision that could affect young people's future than the possibility of a change to the island itself.  The way that young people experience Ireland, North and South, will be different from the experiences of older people, and the history and memories they have will shape their perspective.  A nation that does not listen to my voice, the voices of the youth, is a nation without a future.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;: encourage the youth and they will get there.  I thank the committee for listening to my voice today.</p></speech>

Next we have Eoin Forkan from For&oacute;ige who will speak on the role of youth work in uniting communities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Forkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#B00200"><p>Good morning everyone.  I am 17 years old and I am from County Mayo.  What I want to talk about today is the importance of youth work and its role north and south of the Border.  It can play a vital role in the future of this island and I will explain why.  I will begin by telling the committee a bit about myself.  I have been involved in youth work since I was 13 when I joined my local For&oacute;ige club.  I have seen from my experience and that of my friends that youth work provides important spaces and opportunities for young people.  In my home of north Mayo For&oacute;ige gives young people a safe space outside of school where they can make friends, meet up, discuss their ideas and relax in a setting that may not be possible in all homes.</p> <p>  In rural Ireland especially, a youth club helps to open up the country to young people in a way schools often cannot.  It allows us to go on trips and meet like-minded people.  We can join For&oacute;ige's special interest clubs or attend events such as balls or regional conferences.  It also lets us meet the local adults who volunteer to run the clubs.  It helps us to feel more connected to our communities.  In short, youth work gives young people a place to be themselves and have a sense of place and belonging.</p> <p>  My involvement with youth work has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, giving me opportunities such as speaking at an international conference at the University of Galway and being here today.  It has also allowed me to meet peers from various communities and backgrounds and not only those I meet in school or in my neighbourhood.  Having grown up in rural north Mayo my experience with cultural diversity was limited to say the least.  During my time in For&oacute;ige I have got to know an incredible variety of people from diverse backgrounds.  I have worked alongside young people with ties in Poland, Nigeria, Iran and Britain among many others.  Getting to know this diversity of experience and opinions has been hugely beneficial to my perspective.  For me this is the value of youth work.</p> <p>  In Northern Ireland it is still common for young people from different communities to attend separate schools, socialise in different locations and play different sports.  When someone enters through the doors of a youth club they have an opportunity to drop all their labels and just be themselves.  In my experience youth work allows young people to come together outside of all the different groupings, discuss the challenges and issues that affect them and work together to find solutions.  For example, in the spring young people in For&oacute;ige recommended that all affiliation fees be waived for any Ukrainian refugee wishing to join.  Within a month this decision was agreed and formalised by the board.  Youth work gives young people from all backgrounds the time and space to collaborate on issues such as these.  The opportunities provided by youth work for discussion and problem-solving will play a vital role in the future of the island because they support a foundation for uniting various communities.  Through youth work we have the chance to discover what we have in common and what brings us together.  When we work off our commonalities as opposed to our differences we can achieve great things.</p> <p>  Youth work is hugely overlooked in the development of young people.  We speak mostly about school.  Of course school is important but it does not allow young people as much freedom to choose what we want to learn, including important skills we will need in our future such as leadership, empathy or citizenship.  The scope of education needed for life expands beyond the classroom.  Youth work has the space to fill these gaps.  Youth work has made me more openminded and empathetic.  Most of all, it has increased my confidence in ways I could never have imagined.  If you had told 13-year-old me when I first joined that I would be speaking in front of you today in one of the most important buildings in Ireland I would probably have called you delusional.  This just shows the impact of youth work.</p> <p>  The role of youth work as a form of education does not only benefit young people.  It also provides an invaluable learning experience for the adult volunteers who run the clubs, giving them an opportunity to be involved with their entire community across generations.  This collective learning in our communities will help to bring us together throughout the island.  Improving the quality of our future leaders will make approaching difficult questions about Ireland's future easier.  I hope the future of this island is one of peace and prosperity with young people at the centre.  I thank the committee members and other witnesses for listening to me and I hope they enjoy the rest of the day.</p></speech>

Now we have Eoghan Flood who will speak on the view from the Border counties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoghan Flood" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#B00400"><p>Good morning everyone.  I am 18 years old and I am honoured to share my view on a united Ireland as a young person from the Border counties.  I grew up in Monaghan and I am now studying in the Ulster University in Derry.  We could say I have seen both sides of the coin.  In today's political reality it is increasingly likely that politicians North and South of the Border will have to be open to discussing the possibility of a 32-county Irish state.  Of course they will have to ensure there are equal rights and equal opportunities for all its citizens.  A process such as this is easier said than done and it will take a lot longer than some hope.  The people of Ireland on both sides of the Border and their elected representatives need to take this into account before dates and goals are set.  We cannot rush into any decision if we have not even started the conversation.  We need to talk about the issues openly before we come anywhere close to having a referendum.  This is why it is important that we are here today to speak about the options facing us.</p> <p>  I have grown up in a Border parish in north Monaghan where a united country has been a desired hope for many locals.  Unfortunately many do not see the process as involving the citizens of Northern Ireland in a meaningful way.  They assume that Northern Ireland would just join the Republic when, in fact, any such process should be about bringing the two together.  I have realised the questions that must be asked to satisfy people on both sides of the Border.  These may be very uncomfortable for some but they are essential to achieving a united country.  Can we agree on a new capital of Ireland, such as Sligo or Derry?  Can we create a new flag to unite North and South of Ireland?</p> <p>  There are very few groups throughout the island of Ireland that bring together people from all communities.  The only one that clearly comes to mind is the Irish rugby team.  It is unfortunate that even sport is divided.  Why can we not include everyone in every sport?  The GAA does openly include unionists but it is still seen as an nationalist sport.  Other types of social groups or activities are also divided.  Living by the Border I have not had the opportunity to mix with young people ten miles away from me because we all attend different societies and clubs.  On top of this there is no straightforward transport system in the Border counties to facilitate young people moving back and forth easily.  Small things such as these are vital so we can start to make it easier for young people to get to know each other.  We have to provide meaningful unifying opportunities for all.</p> <p>  I have also come to the realisation that many in the North perceive healthcare in the UK to be very good compared to the system here.  Many young people I have met in Derry have said they would be open to a united Ireland but only if free healthcare was guaranteed.  If we move towards becoming a united country we will have to work out how to integrate two different systems in a way that works for everyone.</p> <p>  Growing up in a Border parish in County Monaghan the Troubles had a huge impact on my upbringing.  It is clear that support is needed in the Border region.  It is essential for two governments North and South to create schemes that allow young people on both sides to come together regularly.  PEACE funding is very important to support this work and must be safeguarded and continued.  I am glad to see a good start to this with the new PEACE campus being built in Monaghan and the announcement of additional funding in the budget on Tuesday.</p> <p>  It is 100 years since the creation of the Irish Free State and the creation of the Border with Northern Ireland.  In this time so much has changed on both sides of the Border.  It is now time that we really focus on making a start, put in the time and investment and develop the working systems of the two states.  Moving beyond the focus of a 32-county country, it is now time to start the process of working together to put a stop to violence and stop focusing on the differences between people and instead show the passion we have for a united island.</p></speech>

I will call next Ms Frederique Offereins, who will talk about the challenges we all face in the decisions we need to make.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Frederique Offereins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#C00300"><p>What does the constitutional future of the island of Ireland hold?  It holds a reflection on the decisions we make today.  It holds the lives of my generation and of all those to come.  It houses the prosperity and the growth of this island, whether that be with or without a united Ireland, but really, it is as simple as that.  The future is a matter of us growing older and of us living our lives, a simple human process which is made easier by the support we receive from one another.  If we look on our lives with such a simple viewing glass, I invite the committee to look at the matter at hand with the same lens.  I ask it to envisage a society in which any political stance is removed and there is no backwards mindset, where we look forward into the sun and leave the shadows behind us.</p> <p>  We educate people from all around the country on what a peaceful unity between the North and the South can and should look like.  The only way to do this is by taking a step back and realising what is truly important in our lives.  An article from the Human Givens Institute outlines that each human being must fulfil a certain nine emotional needs.  When we strip back all the man-made problems in the world, we are left with these nine basic needs.  Energy is simply energy.  We can use it well or we can use it badly.  We can minimise the amount of energy that is wasted by elements of society by rebelling and fighting and instead guiding them towards more beneficial ways of spending this energy. </p> <p>  Catholic, Protestant, North or South, our focus should be on ensuring that our basic emotional needs are respected and are met.  In order for society to benefit from living on this island, it is important to stay focused on these needs, as it gives us a different purpose to fulfil rather than fighting and constantly fearing a change that is ultimately to come. </p> <p>  Within Northern Ireland, there are conflicts rooted in Catholic and Protestant communities.  How can these two religions live side by side peacefully on the rest of the island and in the rest of the world, yet a different religious belief divides Northern Ireland so severely?  It is a division which many people might not even be aware of in this country.  In a united Ireland people of these religions would be allowed to practice their beliefs freely.  They would still keep their identities and ways of life but in the diversity of culture and beliefs would be a nation that could prosper.  As a nation, we must include the communities within Northern Ireland, which are still victims of segregation and sectarianism, and whose basic needs are constantly being compromised.  I feel that now is a better time than ever to strive for reuniting the people from the entire island after generations of political and religiously-driven segregation.  The future of Ireland is important to everyone in this room, but particularly for this upcoming generation, which remains largely uneducated on the current status of our island, including the Troubles which continue on in Northern Ireland, Troubles we must start to involve ourselves in.  </p> <p>  What is the first step?  The first step is educating and you educate through simplicity.  We must show those who are stuck in the past what is really important and what will allow us to move forward, which is focusing on our basic human needs and helping each other to achieve those.  We must take this stripped-down version of our lives and we must encourage everybody to realise what is truly important: the safety of our lives and the well-being of the future generations.  We must remind them that we all have the same unanimous goal, a goal which can be fulfilled when we work together and when we work on our needs.  </p> <p>  Take a look at our national flag, for example.  It stands for inclusivity.  I, myself, was not born Irish, yet I have never felt like a foreigner in this country.  Such is the acceptance within this country to live side by side harmoniously.  Yet, we remain completely alienated from the Six Counties, which lie just across the Border.  We cannot continue to turn a blind eye to these Troubles, because they are more the responsibility of the UK than of Ireland.</p> <p>  One of the biggest assets of my generation is our ability to accept change and adapt to modern ways of life.  If you were to ask a teenager who was walking down the street the question, &ldquo;Why is our island divided?&rdquo;, I would say that they could not give you an answer.  In my opinion, that is because the division is only caused by generation upon generation being ill-informed and being unwilling to change by staying stuck in their old ways, in the past.  This is because much of the time, that is just what is done.  Yes, this is a past that needs to be remembered but it is no longer relevant to the modern way of life and we must overcome it by putting our differences aside and embracing them.  </p> <p>  In difficult times our responses have a purpose, but these are no longer difficult times so that response must be altered.  I ask each member of the committee to picture himself or herself with only days left in his or her life.  He or she can look back on each crossroad and each decision he or she has ever made and, more importantly, how these decisions directly affect an individual's life.  He or she would hopefully look back on times like these with a positive outlook on how we attacked this issue at hand, which was through unity by diversity.  I see a nation that can prosper from side-by-side living, where both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland can benefit from supporting each other while still allowing individuality.  It is time that we heal as a team or we suffer as individuals.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor McAuley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#C00600"><p>I thank the committee for being here today to listen to me.  The future of Ireland should be an all-inclusive one, where community surroundings are adapted to suit people&rsquo;s needs so they that can live and work independently.  Equality on our island of Ireland is a must.  This means fully accessible transport throughout Ireland and not being left on a roadside because an inaccessible coach turns up or being left in a train station because it is unmanned, or having the person you booked 24 hours in advance not show up.  Recently, our Government in the South invested in 41 new rail car carriages that disabled people still will not be able to get on independently and still will have to book 24 hours in advance.<br/><br/>On the issue of suitable, accessible housing, one person in eight on the island of Ireland has a disability and housing should be adapted to their needs.  Local authorities need to include community support systems.  Personal assistance is necessary to support living and inclusion in the community.  People have also been on waiting lists for social housing for years and this needs to change.  Youth services should be made all-inclusive so that no one feels isolated or alone, because mental health, I feel, is a disability in itself.  We need more access to these services.<br/><br/>Hospital services are severely delayed and diagnosis of conditions are taking so long that it delays supports being put placed to help somebody with their disability.  If there is a service available through the NHS that is not available through the HSE or <i>vice versa</i>, we all should be able to access it on either side of the country.<br/><br/>Counselling also should be made more available and quicker to access for people with disabilities.  In my own experience, I have been sent to appointments up a flight a stairs in buildings that the HSE use.  I have had to ring to change those appointments to suitable venues that are further away.<br/><br/>The Government, when introducing the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, said that the cost of living is approximately &euro;350 a week and rising, yet it expects people to live on a disability allowance of just &euro;220 or even less in the North of Ireland.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance should not be means tested, because carers are either underpaid or not paid at all.  Most people are carers not through choice but through circumstances.  When education stops, so do personal assistant, PA, hours and people with disabilities are left fighting yet again when they need their PA most in order to help them live and work independently.  <br/><br/>Workplaces should be more accessible and inclusive for people with disabilities and they should be able to get easy access to PAs in order for them to contribute back to society.<br/><br/>There should be more incentives for companies take on people with disabilities.  I hope that the laws that have been implemented in recent years are put into practice so that all the people of Ireland, regardless of disability, religion, sex or nationality are treated equally, with the respect that we all deserve.  I thank the committee for letting me speak here today.</p></speech>

We will have five more contributions but before then I would like to invite Senators to briefly ask questions.  The first Senator who has indicated is Senator Boyhan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#C00900"><p>I will be brief.  First, it is marvellous that we have these youth voices before the committee.  We have spoken about minority voices in Northern Ireland.  We have spoken about Northern voices and minority voices in the South as well.  I am awe-inspired, as I think we all are on this side of the House, to see this Chamber full of young people and to hear the voices of youth, which are strong.  I have one question, but before I do, the recurring themes of the five speakers before the committee today are clear and consistent.</p><p>These young people are from all sides of this island of Ireland and this is also part of this wonderful process, and I pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach in this regard.  </p><p> To touch on some aspects of what was said, "diversity" was the strongest word used.  Then there were also references to equality, inclusivity, unity, acceptance and accepting.  These words recurred continually in all the speeches.  Young people want to be part of the solution, and that came through loud and clear from all around the Chamber today.  References were also made to a future for the island of Ireland that is fair and just.  </p><p> That is a summary of my takeaway from the contributions that were delivered powerfully, impressively and emotionally by the witnesses.  I say, "Well done" to them all.  I have one question.  Identity is an emotional response.  It is a powerful response, and we all have our own identity that stems from where we come from, our past, our tradition and our culture.  Turning back to the keyword, "identity", I ask the witnesses to share with us, in a few words, what they think identity means to them and if they see a greater acceptance in this regard.  I ask this because we talk about diversity, respect, inclusivity and a united Ireland, but I would also like to talk about united minds and hearts.  If you win hearts, you win minds.  Therefore, I ask the witnesses to touch on the keyword of "identity", what it means to them and how they understand this concept in their contexts.  </p></speech>

The Senators will ask all their questions collectively first and then any of the witnesses can indicate if they would like to respond.  They do not have to respond, but they can indicate if they wish to do so regarding any of the questions raised.  I call Senator Black.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1632" speakername="Frances Black" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#D00300"><p>It is an honour to be here to hear the witnesses' voices.  I felt so emotional listening to them that a few times I nearly burst into tears because they were so inspiring.  I feel our future in this country is in safe hands because we have young people like these here with us.  It really is a privilege, and I thank them all.  Some of them have travelled from far and wide to be here.  I also thank the Cathaoirleach for pulling all this together because it truly is a wonderful day.  It is the beginning of something new and fresh.  Eoin mentioned conversation.  This is the conversation that needs to be had.  Thankfully, these young people are all here today to have this conversation.  We should not be afraid of this conversation any more.  We must have it.  We must talk about planning and preparing for possible constitutional change in future.  There definitely has been a shift in this regard.  A huge event is happening in the 3Arena concerning having this conversation with all parties.  It is so refreshing to hear all the voices here today.  Ireland's future is in their hands, and it is in safe hands.</p> <p>  Turning to my questions, reference was made to the fact that many young people in the North of Ireland have limited opportunities for cross-community interaction because, and this is contained in the submission that was given, they attend different schools and play different sports.  What do the witnesses think could be done to promote greater contact and understanding among young people, North and South?  How can Governments, North and South, better support voluntary organisations, like those represented here today, in working with young people?  Those are my two questions.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1688" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#D00400"><p>I thank everybody who has spoken so far.  It has been enjoyable and informative.  This must be a conversation as well.  We are here primarily to listen.  In our capacity as members of this committee, it is important that we do listen.  Therefore, I wish to try to tease out some of the issues raised.</p><p>Caitlin spoke about voting at 16, and appropriately so, because we have tried several times in this Chamber to get the vote for young people aged 16.  Unfortunately, we have not been successful.  If and when a referendum on constitutional change is called, and in the context of what we saw happen in Scotland, where an energised youth movement was witnessed around the independence question, do the witnesses think 16-year-olds should be afforded a vote?  I ask that because, without getting into clich&eacute;s or platitudes, the future is at the heart of this question and therefore young people really do have a say as it will be them who will be living in that changed society for the longest time.  </p><p><b></b>Eoin spoke about his experience of youth work and this was an important angle to bring to this debate.  Living in an interface community in east Belfast, my experience of youth work was that it was vital in bringing people together.  Even during some of the most challenging times around contentious parades and public disorder, youth work never stopped.  Despite all the noise at the higher level, or the older level, youth work always continued and young people always met.  Therefore, the activity of youth work, and empowering and informing young people and creating engaged citizens, will mean they will naturally gravitate towards this question and other major ones as well.  </p><p>Eoghan, my friend from Monaghan, raised a few points around a flag, transport and healthcare.  These are all fundamental aspects and all questions we will need to get into the nitty-gritty of in the coming while.  He also spoke about the impact of the Troubles on the Border and I do not doubt that for one second.  I refer to the impact of the Troubles on communities along the Border.  I wonder, however, if the greater impact in respect of damaging communities along the Border has been that Border itself?  Before the conflict even started, those communities were neglected, suffered from underinvestment and were deprived.  Now, some 25 years after the Good Friday Agreement, we are still seeing those communities falling behind infrastructurally and economically regarding investment and job creation.  Therefore, without diminishing the point made at all, because the conflict had an impact on Border communities, I do wonder if the actual root of the damage is the Border itself.  </p><p>Conor spoke about the Government investing in new rail carriages and made the point regarding them being inaccessible for many people.  This is a fair point, well made.  I wish the Governments, North and South, and indeed across the water in London, would spend a few pounds in extending railway lines into communities like Monaghan, through Sligo, up into Donegal and on to Omagh, Strabane and all those places.  This will be important as we debate constitutional change, because I hope this will not just be about change, but about change for the better.  I could also not agree any more with our contributor who spoke about unity and diversity.  This is a positive sentiment as we head into the future and one that I hold true to.  I thank everyone again.  </p></speech>

Regarding the For&oacute;ige submission, I had the pleasure of working with the organisation in Blanchardstown, specifically with Miriam Ryan and the team there.  I am originally from Tyrone.  I grew up in a house that was committed to youth work.  We had a youth club.  I did not have the same opportunities when I moved to Dublin.  Therefore, I completely agree with what the submission states regarding youth work allowing people to focus not on differences but on commonalities.  This aspect was fed back today in the presentations by saying there were no labels.  We need to see more of this, in the North and between the North and South.  We do not need to place too much pressure on it, because it will happen organically when we bring young people together and let them discuss issues collectively.  I have seen that happen first-hand in Dublin 15.</p> <p>  I hope today is the day we start to move this conversation on from whether we want a united Ireland to the issue of the united Ireland we want.  I agree completely with Eoghan that this is easier said than done.  It was stated in the submission that young people are a massive part of this process and that they wish to be involved in the nitty-gritty, in discussing the issues and to be part of our journey in seeking how we can bring together the best of both jurisdictions, based on the values of peace and reconciliation.  How do we ensure young people do not just engage in this conversation in a romantic sense?  How do we ensure young people are part of the journey in exploring how we can make this happen?  I say this because we need a framework for the great amount of work that will be involved in this endeavour.</p><p>I thank our guests for coming in today.  It is an historic and momentous day for us, and I hope it is the day the conversation starts to move on and they are part of that.</p></speech>

Senator Boyhan talked about how great it is to hear the voice of youth in this Chamber.  As the youngest Senator present, I want to say, among all of my distinguished colleagues, how great it is to represent the voice of youth on this side.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair for organising today and ensuring that dialogue happens.  As previous speakers said, we have had a very significant week with the launch of the Northern Voices exhibition to highlight minority voices and different voices heard in this Chamber which, for the 100 years that it has existed, has always been the essence of what should happen.</p> <p>  In discussing the constitutional issue and our island, one thing that worries me is at this very moment in time we have an Assembly that is not doing exactly what we are doing &ndash; meeting, speaking and exploring the thoughts that the witnesses have done today in such a careful and thought-provoking manner, bringing it to the level that we need for discourse.  Mr. McAuley spoke about the need to address basic disability services and transport, which is what people care about.  Looking at the census results from the North this week, that is what people care about.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on the fact that while they are discussing these issues, the adults in Stormont cannot get themselves in the room to hear each others&rsquo; voices and discuss issues.  Does that worry them?  What does that mean for the constitutional issues we are discussing?</p></speech>

On encouraging young people to come together across communities, they go to different schools and play different sports but especially in sports, much of that is just from what their parents did and their parents&rsquo; time and they have just continued what their families have been doing.  However, youth clubs, for example, do not have a history of sectarianism and being split with one for unionists and one for nationalists.  Youth clubs are a great space to bring young people together.</p> <p>  Governments in the North and South can support them with more funding.  Much of For&oacute;ige's funding is tied up in projects.  We run many youth projects in disadvantaged areas.  It is hard to get funding for clubs because it is all tied down in projects.  Governments could provide more ore undenominated funding to these clubs.</p></speech>

It was interesting to hear their side of things.</p> <p>  I would like to address Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile&rsquo;s comment regarding my posing the question to the committee on lowering the voting age to 16.  It is a controversial topic and everyone has their opinion.  However, when we look at it, it is our futures that we are affecting.  The Senator asked when it should be and whether it should be like the Scotland referendum.  It is important now.  It is important that we weigh in, which I mentioned in my statement.  It is more important because we have the abilities.  Maturity might be a question, but we are here today representing young people.  We would not be here today if we did not want that constitutional change.  By representing ourselves, we prove that we have the ability to be part of voting society and democracy.</p> <p>  I also wish to address Senator Boyhan&rsquo;s point on identity.  Identity is important in our world and we see that.  Every young person and member in this room has their own identity.  Identity is your characteristics, how you treat other people, how you converse with other people, how you benefit the world in a better way and how you contribute to society in a way that you can develop and engage others.  Identity is the most important aspect in our conversation on constitutional change.  </p> <p>  Regarding united Ireland, we all have our identity and that is important.  Looking at each other, we can see past religion or race and see each other for who we are and what we do.</p></speech>

I completely agree that the Troubles had a big impact on business and industries in the Border are but there are only two ways of fixing this.  It is about putting the recognition out there and providing funding and grants for businesses in the Border region and the transport facilities to get people around there so they will want to come and live there and not be scared of the Border.  Many people have been scared of the Border.  They still are scared of the Border and a united Ireland.  This is how it is done and we need recognition of this region in the whole of Ireland, not just in the Border counties.</p></speech>

I wish to comment on the Senator Currie&rsquo;s last point.  It is important to start off with basics; that is how we will get a united Ireland.  We all want to go for the bigger picture, but we have to start off with the small things first and build our way up.  That was a very good point, because we need build together as communities before we can go ahead and crack on.</p></speech>

I want to continue on Ms Thompson&rsquo;s point on identity.  It is very important in the conversation now because it is something that does not go away.  We will all always hold onto our identity.  Those who are scared of a united Ireland or something else that might happen will always still have their identity.  Physical individuality will not change, whether people are in a united Ireland.  That identity is then something we can all learn from.  We can speak to each other and learn from our own cultures and backgrounds.  That will help with moving forward.  It is very important that we stay in touch with our own identity and stay true to who are when we are moving forward on it as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Roisin Myers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#E01200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation and opportunity to speak here today concerning the constitutional future on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>  We live in an Ireland that currently has the youngest population in Europe, with more than one third of our nation&rsquo;s population being under the age of 25.  These young people are our country&rsquo;s future.  It is vital that they are enabled to develop the necessary skills to enact change, engage with global and national issues, learn the importance of teamwork in community involvement and understand the power behind their voice.  These skills are nurtured through experience and taking a hands-on approach.  </p> <p>  Organisations throughout the Republic of Ireland and Europe use vital funding, such as Erasmus+, to provide young people with opportunities to engage in international youth work.  Erasmus+ is the EU programme for education, training, youth and sport.  It has a budget of &euro;26.2 billion for all of Europe to fund learning mobility and cross-border co-operation projects for 10 million Europeans of all ages and backgrounds.</p> <p>  I am speaking this morning as a young person who has had the privilege of engaging in youth work, both at a national and international level.  I wholeheartedly feel that this youth work has been crucial to utilising my voice as a young a person and in developing my opinions on topical affairs.  I developed these opinions through going out into the world and conversing with fellow young people from a diverse range of multicultural backgrounds.  Examples of this youth work include working with the NYCI, through the Young Voices EU Youth Dialogue and travelling internationally with the European Youth Parliament.  Attending events like these open many doors for me, including my attendance in the Seanad this morning.</p> <p>  As well opening my eyes to a world of opportunities, taking part in international youth work shaped who I am as a person.  Providing a space for young people to explore and discuss topics that are highly relevant in today&rsquo;s ever-changing world instils a sense of empowerment and nurtures self-confidence within young people.</p><p> International youth work acts as a stepping stone into our future.  It creates bonds between various countries and allows young people to challenge their personal biases and become more tolerant and understanding of other cultures and communities.  Listening to various experiences enables them to consider perspectives that they otherwise would never have given thought to.  The benefits are truly endless so it deeply upsets me that passionate and diligent young people from Northern Ireland could not avail of the same opportunities I could solely because of a lack of access to funding.</p><p> Post Brexit, the UK Government replaces EU funding with an initiative called the Turing scheme.  The scheme aims to act as a global mobility programme for students from a variety of institutions such as colleges, universities and schools.  The scheme is an inadequate replacement for the Erasmus+ programme as its structure is systematically exclusionary and creates a gap that many young people outside of the formal sector fall through.  The vast majority of the opportunities that I have availed of are unrelated to my formal education.  The Erasmus+ programme has always had a reciprocal nature of disregarding fee differences between participating universities.  Previously, this made the prospect of studying in the UK, where fees are high, attractive to foreign students thus increasing social mobility among youth from across the globe.  The Turing scheme has no such nature which means that European students, including those from the Republic of Ireland, are discouraged from going to the UK for study placements.  Also, students with a British passport must apply for a long-term visa to live in a Schengen state for more than 90 days in an 180-day period.  This can be a costly process that requires proof of economic solvency, which many students do not have.  Why is the replacement for EU funding targeted towards marginalised youth and the non-formal sector?  In order to move towards a future in which there is collaboration and strong relationships on the island of Ireland, actual mobility and social mobility should be guaranteed for all irrespective of their geographical background.</p><p> In conclusion, I will make a few suggestions to the committee.  First, funding should be allocated for which organisations can apply to fund collaborative efforts between young members from the North and South of the island.  Second, a unique framework should be devised that would allow youth organisations to work together.  Scouting Ireland is an example of an organisation that has managed to adopt an all-island approach, although it has not been easy.  Progressive changes like this allow for unity within groups.  In Scouting Ireland, scouts are not viewed as being members of Scouts UK or Scouting Ireland but rather as representatives of their respective counties.  In creating these cross-Border links there is a widespread feeling of unity, connectivity and solidarity among members.  My suggestion would encourage other organisations to follow suit.  Finally, I would like to see a continuation of discussions between young people on our constitutional future on the island of Ireland.  Conversations in which a multitude of perspectives are heard, such as those occurring today, allow for understanding and creative thinking.  I propose that a committee of young people be formed to continue these progressive conversations.  Giving a seat at the table to a diverse group of youthful voices is crucial in aiding decision-makers to create sustainable policies that adequately cater to all.  It also gives young people faith in the future because they feel listened to and believe their views are taken into account.  Providing a formative space for understanding policies supports young people to see themselves as co-designers of policy processes and outcomes.  We can only begin to move forward if all sides are listened to.  Is f&iacute;or an seanfhocal, n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  I thank the committee for its attention.

It has been invaluable to hear their opinions.  I am a charity trustee and the treasurer for the NIYF.  Our purpose is to promote the youth voice, which we were established in 1979 to do.  We promote the youth voice in a variety of methods through &quot;have your say&quot; days and by directly engaging with decision-makers.<br/><br/>Today, I will focus on children's rights, which are a key part of my vision for the future.  Primarily, the main form of children's rights comes from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC.  The United States of America is the only state in the whole world that has not ratified the convention.  Saudi Arabia, North Korea and even Somalia have ratified the convention.  I believe it is crucial to use diplomatic links to enshrine the convention within the United States of America.<br/><br/>Closer to home, the UNCRC has four general principles: the best interests of the child; non-discrimination; having a say; and survival and development.  I doubt that any person would disagree with the importance of these principles and the requirement for a modern society to look after its youth.  The UNCRC also has other optional conventions that further enshrine children's rights.<br/><br/>A periodic review is currently being conducted for the United Kingdom.  The NIYF's submission is our youth manifesto for change which utilises a rights-based approach for our key themes.  The thematic manifesto has been compiled following research we conducted over the past five years, and after meeting stakeholders and conferring with young people on the document.<br/><br/>Currently in Northern Ireland there are approximately 500,000 young people aged 25 and under.  This is new information that was recently released following the historic census results, and other results were published there as well.  It seems that children and young people make up between one third and one quarter of Northern Irish society with lots of varying identities.  Regardless of identity, one thing that must unite us all, young and old, is rights.  We know they exist but education is properly lacking within the specific realm of children's rights.  We know that we have the right to vote if we have reached the age of 18, and that we have the right to life, privacy, etc.  Through our own research we have realised that children and young people are unaware, through no fault of their own, of the special rights afforded to them.  Do rights truly exist if one is not aware of them?<br/><br/>I was first made aware of the UNCRC when I was 16 years old.  I had returned to school after the Covid lockdown.  That summer was a mental and hectic period.  I found it challenging, but it helped me to grow and made me more resilient.  I saw a notice that the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, NICCY, was looking for youth ambassadors.  NICCY is the Northern Ireland equivalent of the Ombudsman for Children in the South.  I decided to apply and was lucky enough to get accepted.  Only for such good luck I would not have known my rights when they were still afforded to me.  Now that I am 18 years old, I fall outside of that scope.  I only had two years in which I was aware of my rights and was able to talk to decision-makers knowing the power that I had because of this document.  The Children's Law Centre stated in its submission to the periodic review that there were &quot;systematic failures, with no comprehensive framework to provide strong protections for children's rights in Northern Ireland&quot;.  Why does that matter?  States must respect, protect and fulfil the convention regarding all of the decisions that affect children and young people, but we have seen regression in certain states.  We know that children and young people are utilised as soldiers in certain areas so not only is their right to life and play removed but their childhood is also ruined, and childhood is a precious and truly once-in-a-lifetime thing.  We have also seen that rights have been made harder to access in terms of knowledge and implementation.  We have seen rights being taking for granted such as the overturning of abortion rights via Roe <i>v.</i>Wade in the United States.  We need rights in order to have a meaningful and powerful future, regardless of what the constitutional arrangements are.  Therefore, knowledge and empowerment are crucial.  When children and young people are aware of their rights, they know when some entity has wronged them and can seek redress to make a more fair, equal and just society.<br/><br/>Young people are not just the future because we are here and we are now.  I thank the Chairperson for inviting us.  I do not have a view on constitutional change but regardless of what happens, children's rights must be protected and enshrined in law everywhere.  I thank everyone for their time.</p></speech>

I am a youth apprentice at the NIYF.  Today, I will talk about the importance of apprentice roles and their impact on young people.  An apprenticeship is a paid job that offers a hands-on leaning experience with professional help and mentoring.  Last May, I started as a youth apprentice at the NIYF along with two other apprentices.  My role consists of shadowing qualified youth workers, helping to deliver group work and getting to know basic housekeeping such as checking emails and other aspects of being an employee before going out and working full-time.  Experiential learning is a massive part of my job along with constant reflective practice, which is definitely drilled into me in my community youth work degree.</p> <p>  I decided to apply for the post because I had thought for a while that I should move jobs in order to gain more experience for university.  Previously, I worked in a youth club in my local area as the youth support worker in charge but I felt that I was not ready for full-time employment and was unsure of where to go or what to do.  Luckily, a family member sent me the job application the day before the deadline.</p><p>At that point I did not know what being an apprentice meant but I thought I should just go for it.  What was the worst that could happen?  I quickly settled into the Northern Ireland Youth Forum due to how welcoming the staff are and the atmosphere in the building.  The forum has supported me in ways I have never been supported before.  We are forever doing check-ins to see how everyone is and what is going on.  It helps track our journey and we can reflect on it.  In the youth forum I work on the housing and homeless team, which is close to my heart.  I, along with another apprentice, go out to shared accommodation across Northern Ireland to deliver group work and build relationships with young people who have been through similar experiences to us.  We are intervention workers while the third year apprentice is a prevention worker who goes out into schools to do workshops on how to prevent homelessness and make young people aware of their rights.</p><p> Apprenticeships provide opportunities for young people aged between 16 and 21 years and in some cases those aged up to 25 years.  This includes my workplace.  Not only do they build pathways of opportunity for young people but they also combine academic and technical instruction with paid work.  It gives young people a chance to experience working life while being provided with a wage and valuable skills, including effective communication, active listening skills and organisational skills.  As an apprentice, you receive mentoring by professionals.  This gives young people an idea of what a career as a youth worker is like and helps to find your specific interests.  They also provide young people with an incentive to work hard and develop new skills and qualities that lead to well-paying careers.</p><p> For young people, apprenticeships can be motivating, practical and affordable.  They are motivating and practical because young people enjoy learning by doing and they are affordable because you can earn as you study and learn - that was not actually meant to rhyme.  Rather than other young people diving straight into full-time employment after education with no training or mentoring, apprenticeships enable mentors to provide support and allow young people to overcome challenges.  Mentors play a positive role in the development of young people and helping them to get to know themselves more through personal and social growth.  The mentors give out constructive advice that helps to develop confidence and independence when moving forward in the workplace.  Apprenticeships are also cost-effective and bring positivity into the workplace.  There is funding from the government to help towards paying apprentices, and more businesses need to be made aware of the advantages employing apprentices bring.  Some of these advantages include that young people embarking on apprenticeships are willing and eager to learn and contribute new ideas for the company.  Their positive and fresh approach will have a domino effect on other staff members, which can help revitalise an organisation.  According to a recent government study in the UK that was carried out by YouGov, 78% of employers said apprentices helped them improve productivity.  Registered apprentice roles last around four to six years and youth apprentice roles last one to three years.</p><p> I will share a few quotes from my fellow apprentices Demi and Shannon, who are not here with us today.  I asked them both them same questions, namely, what is important about having youth apprentices and what is the importance of having youth apprentices for young people.  For the first and second question, Demi said that as a youth apprentice she finds it important to use her life experiences to help other young people realise their full potential and break generational and societal expectations put upon them.  She said representation is important, including having young people see other young people who have experienced similar challenges and overcoming them to be in a position of influence and empowerment.  Shannon said it gives someone with lived experiences a chance to use them in a more positive light and it shows they are not alone and can make it.  My ask to decision-makers in the room is to create more awareness of youth apprentice roles and make them more available and accessible to young people to provide the opportunity of earning a wage through experiential learning.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

I am a Northern Ireland Youth Forum executive committee member and I also work as a part-time youth community worker in the north Belfast area of the North of Ireland.  Working in the deprived area, I have had first-hand experience of trying to challenge sectarianism and the organisations and paramilitaries, or both, that are targeting young people.</p> <p>  Growing up in my community, sectarianism ran rife and this caused severe riots and civil unrest.  I normalised and internalised every stereotype and made a list of everything I thought I could not do and did not deserve due to a religious identity I did not choose to be born with.  It is truly heartbreaking to see the cycle can repeat, with the young people in my community facing that same reality, but why is that still our reality?  Many give the expression of sectarian perspectives as a result of transgenerational trauma for young people born after the Troubles, but this is not good enough.  The ideologies held by the older generation immediately affect young people as they are impressionable and want to be accepted into the community they are born into.  The Belfast Good Friday Agreement was monumental as a peacemaking document, but when we look at the language and clauses, it is heavily dependent on the future young people of the North of Ireland.  Without good role models, how can we fulfil the legacy of that document?  People in power and decision-makers have at times not modelled the behaviours outlined within the agreement to inspire young people to adopt a differing mindset.  Governments at times cannot work together and rights-based issues such as an Irish language Act, marriage equality and abortion rights act as a barrier to doing their elected responsibilities and duties.  In youth work there is a government-funded strategy entitled Together: Building a United Community, T:BUC.  I beg to say our policymakers may benefit in being participants on these programmes and not the young people.  This could be an example of the trickle-down impact of our decision-makers and may give us a reason to see the impact of a sectarian mindset in communities.</p> <p>  Paramilitaries continue to have a presence of power and control in communities.  Young people are often targets of this, do not feel safe and can at times be influenced to do certain things.  How do we get a safer North of Ireland?  There are government initiatives helping us as a society to work together to bring about an end to paramilitary influence in the North of Ireland.  These groups being able to cause less harm to communities is a key priority.  Though I recognise the hardships government has faced due to the pandemic, political deadlock and now the cost-of-living crisis, unfortunately, I see none of these amazing goals outlined being achieved or attempted within my community.  As a youth worker rooted in cross-community work and reconciliation, our society and youth settings should be for everybody to be able to access a safe space within their community to seek opportunities.  Again, this is unfortunately still a fantasy for many young people in north Belfast.  As I live on an interface, I walk to and from work in fear for my life and the lives of young people aged as little as seven years because of paramilitary groups influencing and instructing young people to riot at our gates by throwing fireworks and even throwing weapons like knives.  It is easy to make decisions from a chamber or presumptions from your sofa, but to engage with these young people can make a real difference that leads to the creation of meaningful change.</p> <p>  Today, I stand as an example that you can break free from the list of norms young people are being taught.  I am giving a voice to those who seem voiceless, and showing them religion does not define your capabilities or how far apart your eyes are.  I am asking decision-makers in Ireland as co-guarantors of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement to review their approach to paramilitary influence on communities and how we as a collective can work together to tackle paramilitarism.</p></speech>

I am elected honorary secretary of the Northern Ireland Youth Forum.  I am here to speak about youth advocacy.  That means young people like me sitting in rooms with decision-makers and having a say on the issues that affect us.  Obviously, this meeting is a fantastic example of something like that and the first one I have been lucky enough to come to in the South of Ireland.  This currently happens in a very limited capacity through work like the Northern Ireland Youth Forum.  I have been in rooms in Stormont many times.  I have been to Westminster and met with councillors, but that is not the norm.  I am extremely lucky to be involved in this organisation and have those opportunities.  Young people are consistently telling us they are not being heard when it comes to pretty massive issues, including mental health, the Covid-19 pandemic - we did a massive piece of research on that where young people were saying they do not care about us at all - voting rights, which were already spoken about today, and peacebuilding.  For the future of Ireland, I hope young people are brought into these conversations as valued members and not just for the sake of trying to appease the youth but to enact meaningful change.</p><p>Why would you ever try to decide something on behalf of another person without talking to that person first?  I am not going to make my mate dinner without asking them what they fancy.  It makes no sense to leave young people out of this conversation.  This issue is particularly bad in the North where our government parties seem to decide every five minutes that they do not want to work with each other.  When we ask decision makers to enforce change or even to have a conversation with us, the excuse in recent years has often been that the government is not actually sitting so nothing can be done at the moment or that it has just started back up and so has more important things to do.  If we are lucky enough to have a functioning Executive, we have to fight against the green versus orange issue to get any change whatsoever.  For young people in the North, this is not only incredibly frustrating, but is keeping our society from progressing to any acceptable degree.  Personally, I am coming to the end of my university degree and my family is constantly telling me that I should leave the North because nothing is ever going to get resolved and I am just going to get stuck in the past.  That is awful.  It is my home but my family is telling me I will be better off somewhere else.  </p><p> We have sat in rooms with politicians and realised very quickly that they had us there for a meeting simply for the photo opportunity or good PR.  They think that, because we are young people, we do not have anything important to say.  Perhaps they just do not care that much.  Sitting here today, I have heard all the young people make fantastic speeches and points.  We have important things to say.  Especially when you are under 18 and cannot vote yet, politicians do not feel they need to appease you through having conversations with you.  It is incredible the change we can make whenever we are actually taken seriously.  We are valuable and contributing members of society and we can fight to have our voices heard.  I have seen young person after young person come though programmes like the Northern Ireland Youth Forum and fight for change in their communities and their country.  Whether decision makers listen or not, they will continue to fight and to make change.  It would just be a whole lot easier if the decision makers helped out in the first place.</p></speech>

There was a lot to absorb in it.  There were a few takeaways for me.  Ms Myers spoke about the really important issue of EU rights, entitlements, protections and so on.  I wonder whether she sees what we are debating today with regard to constitutional change and our constitutional future as an important issue for young people in the North who have been deprived of a lot of those rights, protections and entitlements.  The prospect of coming back into the EU through constitutional change may be an important consideration for young people in that debate.  Perhaps young people have not thought about this issue before.  It may not have really interested them but if reunification meant that they could come back into the EU, would that be an important driver in the debate?</p> <p>  Mr. Millar gave us a really important reminder regarding the whole issue of rights.  Any society and any republic has to be grounded in rights.  Senator Horkan and I had a quick chat about affirming or declaring rights but implementing rights is the real challenge and issue.  An important right for young people all around the world, now and throughout history, has been the right to self-determination.  That is a really important consideration because it is the right of young people to be actively involved in considering the type of society they want, although they also have the right not to be involved in that debate.  That is connected with the issue Ms Mallaghan spoke about with regard to young people being heard and given a platform.  When you assert your right to self-determination, you have an important role to play in ensuring you kick down the doors and get access to the rooms you need to be in. </p> <p>  Reference was also made to the issue of housing and homelessness.  This is a massive issue North and South and not a day goes past in this room on which it is not raised and discussed.  Within the context of future constitutional change, there is a debate ongoing on the issue of a constitutional right to housing which would give people a legal right to a home and whether it is something we should be considering.</p> <p>  There was a wee bit of a challenge made to us.  I worked in an EU-funded cross-community programme in north Belfast.  Ms Lynch is right.  While we do this as individual members - and I am not being defensive because it is a fair challenge - it would do not harm for this committee to not just bring people into this room, but to go to north Belfast and meet some of the young people she is talking about and hear about the projects they are working on.  I would love to do that.  Is &eacute; sin mo mh&eacute;id.  </p></speech>

It is really valuable to have them here.  Perhaps some more of our own Members could have been here, although they may be watching, but I have never seen the Seanad Chamber this full.  It is never this full.  You can tune in any day of the week and you will never see as many people in this room.  The fact that the witnesses have all turned up and are here and that they have got involved with organisations that gave them the opportunity to be here is fantastic.  I have no doubt that, in five, ten or 15 years' time, we will see some of their faces in this Chamber, in a new chamber somewhere else or in the D&aacute;il.  There is no doubt about that.  Most of us were involved in youth politics in our younger days.  I was.  I remember watching Senator McDowell setting up a brand-new party when I was growing up and when he was younger than he is now.  Senator Cassells and I were both in &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il and, when that was set up in 1975, it was to challenge the main party rather than to be a patsy and to say that everything in the senior party was fine.  S&eacute;amus Brennan set it up to challenge the senior party.  It is really important that the witnesses are here and, for me, this is more of a listening exercise than a time to make long speeches.  However, I do have a few points to make, reflecting the fact that I was listening.</p> <p>  I will not be available this afternoon because I am going to Germany Unity Day, which celebrates what is probably the most recent example of a unification process close to home.  The day is technically Monday but the ambassador is having a small function this afternoon.  It is fitting that we are here on the day that, so many years ago, East Germany and West Germany reunited.  It had to go through a process to bring two systems and two peoples that had been divided for a long time together again.  It provides a practical example.  It is important to reflect on the Taoiseach's objective of a shared island.  It is not about threatening or questioning anybody but determining how to share the island and, for example, how to merge our health services.  </p> <p>  There is an issue in border areas right across the world.  If a government invests in a border area, half of the people who benefit are not in its territory.  That government is spending money for the benefit of people who cannot re-elect it.  This can be seen in local authorities and at national and international level.  Border areas will always suffer because, if you put money into the centre, everyone around there can vote for you.  If you put it into north Monaghan - and I have a great-grandfather from Monaghan - some of the spillover will not benefit your jurisdiction and the people who can re-elect you.  It is the same on the other side of the Border.  That applies in Germany, Spain, Portugal or anywhere else.  Those challenges have to be overcome.  That is where things like the PEACE programme and other things have helped.  </p> <p>  I am on the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  We have done a lot on low-floor buses and so on but the idea that we are buying any transport infrastructure that is not accessible to everyone is completely unacceptable in this day and age.</p> <p>  I have a question.  I took on board the points made on voting at 16.  When I have campaigned as a candidate in local elections and, more recently, in general elections, I have found people who are aged 22, 23 and 24 who are not registered to vote.  How do you engage?  It is a challenge.  The witnesses are here and engaged but in the South of Ireland we have recently seen young people who should not be driving at all ramming Garda cars and not participating or getting involved with organisations like those here today.  How do you get those people engaged?  How do you get people who are very comfortable and in very nice areas but who cannot be bothered voting or registering engaged?  When a referendum on an issue they are interested in comes along they may register but I have found people of 23 or 24 who have just not bothered.  That is a challenge I am asking the witnesses about.</p> <p>  I have another question for all of the witnesses.  If they were around the Cabinet table tomorrow, as Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste or Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, what would they like to do first?  What would be their number one and number two priorities?  We have come a very long way as a country.  I was looking at the number of people who did the leaving certificate in 1923.  It was 700.  There are now approximately 60,000.  We have brought our country a long way but the past is the past.</p><p>We need to build on what we have achieved.  With all of the representatives' help, involvement and advocacy, we need to make it a much better country for everybody on the island.  We need to create a state that everybody wants to be part of as opposed to being part of a different state.</p><p> I may live in Dublin but I have two grandparents from Mayo.  Mr. Forkan may have noticed that our names are not that dissimilar.  I do not know if somebody spelled my name or his wrong a million years ago, but perhaps we are connected somewhere.  Equally, while my grandmother was from Ballina, her father was from Monaghan.  We are all more connected than we think we are.  We probably have a lot more in common than divides us.  At the same time, I can see Ms Lynch's point about the impact of tribal behaviour when people say "we are good and they are bad; you cannot talk to them or deal with them."  This is what results when people have been brought up never knowing others.  We heard the comment about eyes being too close together or not too close together, or whatever it was.</p><p> It is important that people talk.  It is important that people listen and engage.  My challenge and my question to the witnesses is to set out what would they like to do if they were in power, and not just here for a day.  If they were here and had to get re-elected in three, four or five years' time, what would they say are their top priorities?  With regard to youth engagement, how do we engage with those who are not here and are not involved?  This is a problem in parts of the island from North to South, and from well-off areas to disadvantaged areas.  I thank all of the witnesses for being here.</p></speech>

I mentioned youth work and the importance it played in my early life.  I do not feel that here in the South we are investing enough in universal youth services.  I believe this has become more of an issue in recent years.  If we were giving enough funding to universal youth services, it would pay dividends.  It would certainly help to fuel this conversation.  I really see value in a 32-county approach to youth work.  We also need more adult volunteers.  There needs to be more awareness of getting adults to participate.  They are an essential part of this as well.</p> <p>  With regard to Lanark Way and the interface, I am aware of how much youth workers did last year in holding people back and persuading them that returning to the past is not the way for the future and is not the way for progress.  I absolutely hear Ms Lynch's point, and I will return to this shortly.</p> <p>  With regard to Mr. Millar's contribution, we should take it as an action point for today that when we look at the framework and the size and the scale of the work we must do in approaching constitutional change, children's rights must be a key part of that.  This applies not just here on this island but also in the international context.  I really appreciate Mr. Millar highlighting that knowledge, empowerment and awareness of rights must be part of that.  This is the beauty of what we are doing now.  We can write the vision for what we want.</p> <p>  I completely agree with what Ms Clyde said about apprenticeships.  I am pleased that she has a pathway that is working for her.  It can work for many other people too.  Just last week our Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, announced more apprenticeships in farming.  One of them was in sports turf.  I did not really know what this was, but I learned that it involves work in places like golf courses.  The number of different apprenticeships will increase to approximately 100 over the next couple of years.  Again, it must be a key feature of our framework, our vision for apprenticeships as a pathway and the creation of opportunities.</p> <p>  I completely agree with Ms Mallaghan about the Assembly.  The Assembly is not optional.  Power-sharing was set up because when we share power, we share our problems and we realise that we have so much more in common than we have in terms of our differences.  Using those differences to collapse the Assembly, and to create a cycle of collapse and crisis, is not doing anybody any good.  At a time when we are facing a cost-of-living crisis, the witnesses' elected representatives are not able to do the job they were put there to do.  I absolutely agree with the witnesses that it is time for politicians to stop letting the Good Friday Agreement down, and to work it as best as possible.  I will not just concentrate on the politicians in the North.  Over the past 25 years there were three strands to the Good Friday Agreement and they all need to work together.  All of those institutions have to be worked with a permanency.  We need to see a recommitment to that permanency as we approach the 25-year anniversary.</p> <p>  With regard to the youth workers' voice, we need their voice for this conversation to be effective.  In that spirit, we would welcome any suggestions and any ideas.  It goes back to what I said previously about how young people are part of this conversation.  They help us to create a vision that brings people with us while we are talking not just about what a united Ireland is in conceptual terms but also about what that actually means.</p></speech>

I thank the representatives for their contributions.  We need their voice, as my colleague has said.  The issues that we are talking about here today impact young people enormously.  Sometimes we in Government Buildings live in a bubble.  We are nearly institutionalised.  I may be repeating myself but this is why it is so important that the witnesses are here today, and talking in particular about basic human rights for children.  It is vital that we really bring that to the fore and prioritise it.  It really impacted me to hear that young people are not aware of their human rights.  There is something not right with that.  Where is that coming from?  Why is it not made a priority?  Why are the adults not making it a priority?  I thank the witnesses for raising these issues.</p> <p>  Ms Lynch's presentation was powerful.  Young people, particularly in the North, have a multitude of challenges.  As my colleague Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has said, I would definitely love to hear more.  It is shocking to think that 25 years after the Good Friday Agreement, people are still afraid to walk down the street because of issues related to the conflict and the problems the witnesses have spoken about today.  That is really shocking and it is not as it should be.  I support my colleague in trying to organise a trip to north Belfast to hear the voices of young people.</p> <p>  I said that I would not talk for very long, but I have a few more points to make.  The polls say that younger people are more likely to favour constitutional change.  I am raising this as a general question.  The witnesses may or may not choose to answer it.  Ms Myers mentioned a forum.  I would love to hear a little more about that forum and how she would see it happening.</p> <p>  Ms Clyde referred to apprenticeships.  There is no doubt that in the North and in the Republic, we lose many bright, young and ambitious people.  What can we do to stop losing young people?  How do the representatives believe we can encourage more young people?  Apprenticeships are so important.  It is like the heart of our culture and of what goes on.  What can we do to encourage more people to go into apprenticeships?  What can we do in general to stop this brain drain?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe that constitutional change would create new opportunities for their generation?  That is the question I would like to ask today.  I thank all of those who have made wonderful presentations.</p></speech>

I hope I do not change it.  A number of things struck me.  Mr. Millar took an agnostic attitude to constitutional change.  He has different priorities.  Ms Clyde concentrated on the bread and butter of apprenticeships.</p><p>At the same time, we are having a discussion here about identity and constitutional change.  There are a couple of things I think we need to face up to.  Yes, there could be a poll in Northern Ireland in five or ten years on Irish unity but unless we actually have some idea of what Irish unity is about, it will be like the Brexit referendum in England.  People will vote for a principle and then find out that they did not solve a lot of problems.  If we look at what is happening in England at the moment, we can see all the results of that.</p><p> I take the view, and Eoin Forkan made this point, that we have much work to do to actually establish reconciliation on the ground before we simply start talking about an abstract united Ireland or non-united Ireland identity, or whether a person is British, Irish, Northern Irish, none of the above or whatever.  One thing that struck me, and I am going to be controversial now-----</p></speech>

I am taking the point from all the For&oacute;ige people and everything else that youth work is hugely important because it allows people to break out of the channels into which denominational education puts them.  However, it is both North and South, by the way.  This is not a Northern Ireland issue alone.  Can it be right that if a priority is learning to live with people with different identities that people go to a different school?  I pose this question to anyone who is willing to answer.</p> <p>  Looking back over the education they have received so far, especially between the Christian faiths, is there anything now at this stage that really would make a difference if the witnesses' school was simply a Christian school or a non-denominational school?  Is there anything they have learned that is of particular value because they were at a Protestant, Catholic or non-denominational school?  In other words, is it important that we continue with denominational education?  If we are going to have denominational schools, we are going to have denominational sport to an extent.  Then we scratch our heads and ask how come all the Catholics are playing Gaelic games and all the Protestants are playing soccer and some of the wealthier people are playing rugby.  We have to ask ourselves whether denominational education serves any useful purpose either North or South.  This is a big problem for us in the South as well because the churches still have control over a lot of education.</p> <p>  I want echo what Senator Currie said that we cannot have a certain situation.  I was part of the Good Friday negotiations and the St. Andrews negotiations where the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in eventually came together and we had the Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness partnership arising out of it.  However, one of the things that is in the Good Friday Agreement and that is still in the St. Andrews Agreement is, as Senator Currie said, this notion that a person can opt out.  A person can say, "I am sorry, I am not concerned with hospitals or schools; I am more concerned with abortion", so we have no Parliament or no Assembly.  He or she can say the Irish language is too important for him or her to put back for a while so we are not having a discussion about finance, health, education or the other things.  Maybe the time has come when we talk about constitutional change to change that bit of the Constitution where people cannot just opt out of politics and use a veto on each other.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on that.</p> <p>  Lastly, I will mention the European Union.  On both sides of the Border, a majority favoured staying in the EU.  It strikes me that everything good that has happened on this side of the Border has happened largely because of the EU.  I really think that Northern Ireland's interests are to be back in the EU, however that happens, be it in an Irish confederation sharing our membership of the EU or whatever it is.  Do the witnesses agree with that proposition?  Northern Ireland should get back into the EU because it seems to me it has done us huge favours.  When we were out of it, we were floundering.  Our population was going down.  Now things are good, or rather better.  We should be talking about trying to get Northern Ireland back into the EU.  Do the witnesses agree with that?</p></speech>

My son was in here this morning.  He is 20 and a wheelchair user.  He had to go through a health and safety briefing of the building.  I watched the witnesses' contributions on the monitor, however.  I am delighted that they are here.  They made a very important point about young people.  Believe it or not, I was once a young person.  I did my leaving certificate in 1984.  Do not add up the numbers.  That is the equivalent of A levels.  I went to Trinity College Dublin.  I represent Trinity graduates now as a Senator.  I was in the school of education in Trinity and we had sister colleges in Belfast.  We had St. Mary's teacher training college on the Falls Road and Stranmillis University College with people from both communities.</p> <p>  As a young fellow from Dublin, I went up on the train.  We had a couple of exchange weekends and my goodness, Belfast in 1984 to 1987 was a revelation.  I do not know if these places still exist but we used to go to the Botanic and the Eglantine or as they were known then, the "Bot" and the "Eg".  One of my favourite places was Lavery's.  I see some flickers of recognition.  I think I might have left some graffiti in the bathroom.  It was an extraordinary experience for me as a young man to go to Belfast in the 1980s and make the friendships that we made.  I had friends from St. Mary's and from Stranmillis.</p> <p>  I am sure everyone is familiar with "Derry Girls" and some of the issues around cross-community identities where people in one community might keep the toaster in the press while others have it out in the kitchen.  I can tell you, we noticed straight away coming from Dublin that everybody in Stranmillis and St. Mary's were much better looking than we were, and they had better record collections.  We made friendships.  I remember I met one girl in particular who was in Stranmillis.  She brought me home to her house and the first thing I noticed when I went in was that they had a picture of the Queen on the wall.  I had only ever seen Queen Elizabeth on the television but there she was on the wall of the house.  That girl's father was very suspicious of me.  I do not think it had anything to do with my political views or what community I came from but eventually I kind of-----</p></speech>

I took exception to that.  We forged all of those friendships.  I am still friends with some of the people I met 30 years ago.  We did that against the backdrop of RUC land rovers, armed RUC patrols and checkpoints, the Ulster Defence Regiment going around in armoured personnel carriers and the British army.  That was just part of the backdrop because for me, the most interesting part of that experience was meeting our fellow islanders and realising that there is nothing to be afraid of.  We can celebrate each other's identity and reach out and embrace each other.</p> <p>  The reason I say this is because after I graduated from Trinity, I did a really stupid thing.  I joined the Army.  Now, as a grown-up, I realise that I would not recommend it to everybody.  I found myself suddenly on the Border.  I remember a particular checkpoint just north of Monaghan town in what we called the salient going into Fermanagh and south Tyrone.  There were a stream of cars coming South.  It was coming up to 12 July.</p><p>There was a kind of traditional exodus.  It was a very warm evening and the windows of the cars were rolled down.  We were at the checkpoint where I remember a child pointed at me from the back seat of the car and told his Daddy and Mummy to look at the wee Irish Brit.  I thought it was very funny because, for that child, "Brit" meant somebody in uniform carrying a weapon.  Having been on, if you like, the front line - without being too dramatic - we went from a situation in which we were carrying firearms on the Border or in the towns, villages, streets and byways of Northern Ireland to one in which that, to a greater or lesser extent, has been eliminated.</p><p> As part of my military service, I served in the Middle East and saw communities in Lebanon that were divided along sectarian and ethnic lines.  I was at a meeting in Beirut where we saw Sheikh Nasrallah of Hezbollah talking about having the Koran in one hand and the Kalashnikov in the other.  I remembered hearing talk in Ireland about having a ballot box in one hand and an Armalite in the other and I realised people all over the world are exactly the same.  One of the problems in Lebanon was the fact that communities were educated separately and kept apart.  It created suspicion, fear and conflict.</p><p> My last overseas experience was in the former Yugoslavia.  My good colleague mentioned West Germany and East Germany.  I do not mean to be alarmist but I do not believe Ireland is analogous to East and West Germany.  It is more analogous to the experience I had in the former Yugoslavia, in Bosnia, because of the highly developed identities, traditions and cultures that cannot be amalgamated.  We have to live together by whatever means.  Senator McDowell has promised to send me an article he has written about all of the different models for how we might do so.  It is very important to remember that we are all the same, essentially, and that there is nothing to be afraid of.</p><p> Whatever happens on this island in the next ten or 15 years, it will not be Senator McDowell, me, or anybody here - I will not mention the older people - who will have to navigate that.  It will be the young people such as those in For&oacute;ige, the National Youth Council of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Youth Forum, my 21-year-old and 20-year-old sons and my 18-year-old daughter.  They will live the next step of the peace process.  I echo my fellow Senators' sentiments to get involved.  I know that I am speaking to a group of people who are already involved and engaged, but there is faith among those of us with the grey hair-----</p></speech>

If we get it right, it will be a considerable success.  Of course parts of it will be messy, whatever happens next, but we can celebrate in that mess together.  It is for all of us on this island, in whatever form or model it takes, to move forward together.  If we talk to one another and reach out to each other, it will be a great success.  If we do not, I can tell the committee from my experience, here and internationally, that we will have problems.  There are unfortunately, in the Republic and in Northern Ireland, some voices who will say it is too soon to talk, ask that we not go there or say that they will not talk or will opt out.  That is the antithesis of our future.  We must start talking now about our shared future.</p> <p>  I am delighted to see my Northern counterparts here.  I learned a great many new words in Northern Ireland such as scundered, foundered and wee spides.  Are there any wee spides here?  I hope not.  The witnesses are very welcome.  The educational system is keeping communities apart.  Certainly my experience in the 1980s was that there was cross-community mixing in places such as Lavery's Bar and in the university experience.  Is that still the case?  Is social life in Belfast demarcated along lines or is it completely open?</p></speech>

I was especially taken by the contributions of the second group.  I will touch on the significance, importance and strength of identity in the greater debate.  It is very important and it reoccurs in all of the submissions we have received.  It is a simple word but it is powerful and it means different things to different people.  I know we have all talked about identity with regard to inclusivity, equality and all of those issues, which is great.  It is a common denominator with most young people of the witnesses' generation.  That is positive and we very much promote it in this House.  However, what does identity really mean to the witnesses as people from Northern Ireland?  Is it an obstacle in embracing something bigger and more powerful with regard to unity?</p></speech>

I will first refer to Senator Horkan's questions on what I would first act on if I were put in government right here, right now.  I would act on the Mental Health Act 2001.  Mental health issues have been exacerbated due to the pandemic, especially among young people.  This Act has been lying idle for many years.  It was first brought up and signed on by multiple politicians in 2001.  The committee reconvened on it multiple times in the past few years and, yet, it has still to be implemented.</p> <p>  This Act would be revolutionary for young people.  It would allow them to access mental healthcare, which is desperately needed, especially in lieu of recent events surrounding Ireland's mental-health sector for young people.  It would give them access to mental healthcare of their own volition without needing to consult a doctor or have their parents or guardians involved.  It would be amazing and revolutionary.  I still wonder why it has not been implemented.  It is vital and very much needed.  I strongly believe that physical health is just as important as mental health.  Why are we staying so idle when our young people are bleeding out?  It is shocking. </p> <p>  The Senator asked what we would do to engage young people in voting, especially people who are of voting age and have not registered.  I would make it mandatory for schools to have members of the Garda come into school to speak to fifth and sixth years who are coming of age or of age to vote.  They could set up a quick event in which people could register to vote.  It is a very simple and quick process that would help many people.  The process can be tricky and confusing to go through on one's own and this would mitigate many people avoiding voting.</p> <p>  I think Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's question was misconstrued within the line of communication but I wish to refer to it.  I think it was something along the lines of EU funding being an incentive for young people in Northern Ireland to vote to rejoin the EU.  I agree that it may well be but I was speaking about the here and now, and the very near future.  We require funding for young people, irrespective of their geographical background.  Whether they are from the north or the south of the island, they require attention.  In order to move towards a more peaceful and understanding future between the two sides, an equal and level playing field is needed.  Young people should be offered opportunities to engage in national and international youth work, irrespective of where they are from.  That is what I was talking about with regard to requiring funding from the EU.</p> <p>  Senator Currie is preaching to the choir.  She was speaking the language when she said we needed more adults and volunteers to man youth organisations.  To travel to an event with the National Youth Council of Ireland, I have to get up at 5 a.m. to catch a train at 6 a.m., to be in Dublin for 11 a.m. for an event.</p><p>It is extremely exhausting for me.  There are not enough facilities down in Cork, where I am from.  I am from a town but have to catch a train to travel to the city just to get to my local group.  There is no group for me at a sufficiently local level to allow me access within my community.  I have to take a whole day off school.  This is a huge demand for me given that I am doing the leaving certificate.  It is incredibly taxing on my student life, yet I am so passionate about this that I am willing to take the risk.  We absolutely need more engagement down south for everybody, especially regarding the training of people to look after these youth events.  Many young people, being under 18, cannot attend the events without adult supervision.  There is no incentive for them.  It should be mandatory that we provide more training events, widespread throughout the country, for adults to engage in youth work.</p><p> Senator Black asked about a forum I suggested.  I do not just suggest a forum as a one-off event.  I suggest that a committee of young people convene to speak about issues that will affect young people's futures.  To move towards a brighter future in which we have a level playing field for everybody, we need to have a say on all these issues.  As committee members can see, a wide spectrum of issues have been raised regarding the constitutional future on the island of Ireland, but these issues need to be talked about in more depth.  We need to have young people to consult on these issues.  Therefore, I propose an ongoing initiative, not just a once-off forum.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Millar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#M00200"><p>I will try to be as brief as I can, given that others have to speak in regard to the questions.  For Northern Ireland, the EU has funded something magnificent, the Peace Bridge.  That is really symbolic of the work the EU played not only in peace-building but also in fostering good relations.  None of us here had a say in or got to vote on Brexit.  I am now here and believe we are lesser off as a consequence.  Being European forms part of my identity.  I would say I am European, Irish, British and Northern Irish.  I am a plurality of things in that regard.  No one is more important.  My sense of being European does not trump my sense of being Northern Irish, and my sense of being Northern Irish does not trump my sense of having a collage of identities.</p> <p>  Senator Currie stated power sharing is a way to share our problems.  I truly agree.  As I said in my opening statement, I do not really have a view on the constitutional future.  Actually, 17 MLAs with the Northern Ireland Assembly do not have a say like that of those who designate, be they nationalist or unionists.  When it comes to the petition of concern, their vote is meaningless.  It is weighted in favour of cross-community majorities.  We need to tackle the needs of the people I am referring to and enfranchise them.  They comprise a growing group in the North, for better or for worse.</p> <p>  With regard to votes at 16, our organisation, Northern Ireland Youth Forum, has conducted research in partnership with the Electoral Commission.  We found it all bubbles down to education.  There is a lack of political education.  There is a lack of education on matters that make young people active citizens in society.  Schools should set you up not only to be good at mathematics, English, languages and other subjects that are so crucial to the development of humanity but also to engage in the development of civic society as a whole.</p> <p>  On the young person's forum and Senator Black's comments, the others also have a key say.  Arguably, there is no majority in Northern Ireland now.  There is no nationalist, unionist or other majority.  The others are the ones who will decide the future of this island.  They really need to be talked to in tandem.</p> <p>  With regard to schools, there is another big, separate issue.  People go to school and youth groups and then go back to their own communities, which have their own leisure centres and playing parks.  It is a question of ours and theirs, us in them.  Even this division of infrastructure causes issues.  I know that, as a member of my community, I was not engaging with people from the other side.  I find that Northern Ireland, regardless of where you come from or your background, is one community.  We all care about healthcare and issues concerning schools.</p> <p>  With regard to the Northern Ireland Assembly and the recent election, the Members were elected in May to do a job.  There is no excuse for not doing that job.  It bubbles down to the fact that they are our representatives.  If those people who are meant to be representing wider society are incapable of doing a job, it is an issue.  Seeing the younger people here today, I feel they, I and everyone across Northern Ireland and the wider island should be up in the Chamber.  The main issue is the fact that the majority of MLAs in Stormont want to work for their communities and address the cost-of-living crisis.  We are entering a winter that will be very difficult for families, and there is a party that decides, through its mandate, not to take its seats.  This is why the assembly needs to be reformed.  Institutions need to be reformed.  That will lead to a more mature society, a society that allows politics to work for everyone, not just them and us.</p></speech>

Senator Black talked about youth apprentices and why young people are not going into apprenticeships.  I believe it is because of a lack of awareness.  Apprenticeships are now becoming a more popular pathway but it is hard because many employers look for experience.  At 16, you have just written your CV and are delighted when handing it in, but where is your experience?  You will not have had time to get any; you will just have a national insurance number.  The youth apprentice roles provide a different pathway, giving education while learning.  They are vital.  It is hard because young people may have to break a generational cycle in order to go down the apprentice road.  They may have been brought up in a household where you go into education, get further education and then go into full-time employment, where you stay until retirement.  However, there are so many other pathways available nowadays.</p> <p>  Touching on the point on identity, in Belfast you are born into a community.  It is very hard to look outside it because you have everything you need at your doorstep.  Some young people growing up think their community is the world and that there is nothing else outside that.  They ask why they would want to leave their community.  Therefore, it is a matter of breaking the generational cycle and understanding your own identity by taking a step outside the community.</p></speech>

Everyone has answered their own questions.  The key is discussion.  Senator Clonan is going to love this bit of Belfast dialect, but, by not having the discussion, you are creating an us'uns and them'uns and a yous'uns and them'uns.  Politicians help create that divide.  I am not saying it is those present but the institution in which politicians work whenever people refuse to engage in the conversation by saying they cannot focus on a certain thing because they are now focusing on another.  The subject under discussion should always be at the root of what we are talking about because it is clearly what every single one of us wants.</p> <p>  I agree with Ms Clyde in that, in Belfast, it is very much about where you are born.  It is so hard to break out of that community.  As Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile will know, north Belfast is the best place in County Antrim.  It is the jewel of the North; it is my favourite place in the entire world.  It is the best.  All I am saying is that it is great.  It is really hard to look past that community when that is what I have been told.  People ask, "Why would you associate with that community?  C'mon, you have three chippies here; that is amazing."  That is how we categorise it in Belfast.  I really appreciate Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's desire to engage in north Belfast.  It is really hard to get people at a table or in a community.  That is something we have experienced as an organisation.  It relates to the amazing question of what I would like to do.  I refer to broadening  branches.  It is a question of having more youth services across the whole of Ireland.  There are barely any youth services anywhere outside our hotspots.  Even Derry barely has youth branches.</p><p>It is all very Belfast- and Dublin-centric, whereas in places like Banbridge, Tyrone and Monaghan, there are not as many options as there are in the North.  I am just speaking from my experience as a youth worker.</p><p> By broadening that branch, you are answering your own question about the vote at 16.  By broadening that branch, young people can gain qualifications and experience in ways they cannot anywhere else.  For example, education does not work for everybody.  There will always be people who do not have a GCSE, an A level or a degree to their name.  From my experience of youth projects, I have been able to gain qualifications through them when I did not think I would get a single qualification from school.  Through that, it comes down to the apprenticeship role as well, by getting involved and learning in a different way and with different people.  It helps to build awareness around why the vote at 16 is important and why it is important to engage with your government, because you are learning in a different way.  We follow a curriculum in youth work.  It is about personal and social development, such as learning about your rights and what is important in your communities and stuff like that.</p></speech>

It would change just from the experience of the friends and connections they have.  Social media is a powerful place where you learn so much about this.  It would definitely change.  The young people who I engage with would blow you away.  I am not much older than them and they teach me a new thing every day.  They blow me away.</p> <p>  Again, on the idea of broadening branches, more adult volunteers are coming into the system who will then become members of staff, like me, and that cycle continues because they see that positive role model.  Creating that space for young people and those who engage with youth workers is important.  People who work with children or young people are stereotyped as just doing it because it is a hobby and is easy money, and that we just sit and play games with the young people all day because we are not smart enough.  That is a genuine thing that is to youth workers, day in and day out, and that is not the case.  It is so important that a space is created for young people.  When young people are being engaged with - Roisin said she had to take a day off school to attend - it is about fitting it to our timetable.  We are all busy people.  We all have families, but I ask that Senators work with us on our time as well rather than us having to come out of school, university or our jobs to meet with them because it suits Senators.  Meet us halfway.</p></speech>

Many great questions were raised and I will not be able to address them all unfortunately.  The first thing that comes to mind is how we keep young people in our country, which was mentioned.  We raised issues such as the government, the lack of services such as transport, stuff like that, that are already a barrier for young people wanting to stay here.  The one thing I would like to mention, which is a bit left-field, is brain drain.  As someone studying for a master's degree in physics, I have been told that if I want to stay in the North of Ireland, there are loads of jobs in finance.  I do not want to do finance; I have done a degree in physics.  I find that a real barrier to me wanting to stay.  There needs to be a broadening of the job market in the North of Ireland.  I am not as familiar with the market in the South.</p> <p>  On segregation in schools, I went to a Catholic primary school and secondary school.  I do not see why it needed to be Catholic.  I had to do religion as an GCSE but that did not help me in society.  What really helped me was joining organisations such as the Northern Ireland Youth Forum where I met a broad range of people.  As a Catholic person from a unionist or Protestant area, it was nice to be in an environment where it did not matter whether I was Catholic or Protestant.  When I went to university, I felt for many people it was less segregated but at the same time there is a bit of controversy.  The speakers from the North will probably know what I am on about regarding a certain society within Queen's University Belfast.  I will not mention the society because I do not want to call it names.  The society was making things more difficult for a certain side of the community based on what society members were preaching about at the freshers' fair, of all things.</p> <p>  In terms of a united Ireland, I agree there needs to be a plan, if anything.  Brexit was horrific because everyone was just voting "Yes" or "No".  There was not a plan in place.  I personally would love to be part of a united Ireland.  However, I would not just vote on that based on whether I would like it or not.  I would like to see what a united Ireland would look like and how would it affect the North and things like healthcare.  As already mentioned, we get free healthcare in the North.  The NHS is in no way functioning as it should be.  I got a QR code in the post asking me if I still wanted a tonsillectomy, which baffled me after being two years on the waiting list.  Those are the things that are important to me.  Will I still have free healthcare?  What will healthcare look like?  What will the civil service look like?  Will we need two civil services?  It relates to all those kinds of things.</p></speech>

We should not have a referendum or a vote next week or next year, but is what we are doing today not part of those discussions?  We are advocating for discussion and we are having a discussion in the Chamber with a broad group of people.  The big Ireland's Future event will take place in Dublin tomorrow.  I am not saying that this is the be-all and end-all.  Personally, that debate needs a home.  The best place for it is a citizens' assembly because it can be informed and resourced.  Does Ms Mallaghan not think the discussion is live and is happening?  If it is, the question is how we get more platforms such as this.</p></speech>

This is the same issue.  We can have all the discussions we want but my mum is sitting at home and is not part of this conversation.  There needs to be education within the population about what that will look like.  Sometimes people do not want to sit here and have this conversation.  They do not want to be told, "Here, this is what you are voting on."  It is like looking at a political party's mandate and stuff like that.</p> <p>  Lastly, I refer to the issue of identity.  In Northern Ireland, depending on what arena you are in, your identity changes.  While I am a Catholic and a nationalist, the most important parts of my identity, as Caitlin said earlier, are what I am doing, the work I am involved in and me as a person.  We should not be defined by what we choose to vote on or what religion we identify with.</p></speech>

This is an important topic and it is important that we listen to all voices.  As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Seanad, we are glancing back but also looking forward.  We want to hear the views, ideas and vision that everybody has for the next 100 years.</p> <p>  The witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that the witnesses comply with any such direction.  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses who are attending remotely.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity as those who are physically present.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members who are participating remotely that those who are physically on the complex enjoy a higher level of parliamentary privilege.</p> <p>  I welcome our guests.  We will begin with Reverend Kyle Paisley, who is joining us from England.  He is welcome and we look forward to his contribution.</p></speech>

The chief cause is uncertainty over Brexit and the trade border that now exists between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  What do most Ulster unionists think about the idea of a united Ireland?  It involves serious practicalities.  The economists, Professors John FitzGerald and Edgar Mogenroth, admit there are very few studies of relevance to the issues of the economics of a united Ireland.  Dr. Eoin Drea, senior researcher at the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies, has stated that a united Ireland would be an economic, political and social disaster for the Republic of Ireland.  Of course, what is a disaster for one part of the island is a disaster for the whole island.  Could a united Ireland give an economic commitment to Northern Ireland comparable at least to the block grant from the British Government, which currently stands at &euro;15 billion per annum?</p> <p>  Economics matter, but I think identity matters more.  A man is not what he possesses.  It is his belonging to something that counts.  As the good book says, "N&iacute; a niomarcuigh an tsa&iacute;dhbhris at&aacute; ag duine air bith, at&aacute; a bheatha."</p> <p>  Michelle O'Neill has stated that constitutional change can be achieved without sacrificing identity or citizenship but in point of fact, constitutional change brings about a new identity and a new citizenship.  One could be British and unionist in a new Ireland, but in name only.  Furthermore, if political ties with the rest of the UK are cut, it is to be feared that it might be an irreversible severance.  At present, there is no assurance that unionists would be able to campaign for a restoration of the union.</p> <p>  Nationalists speak about winning hearts and changing minds.  My heart is fixed and cannot be won but all things considered, winning over moderate unionists to the idea of a new Ireland is a Herculean task.  Political unionism may win the hearts and minds of moderate nationalists by building up local democracy and redoubling its efforts to sell the union - another Herculean task.  I hope Britain will undo the damage caused to Northern Ireland and relationships within these islands by its disastrous Brexit policy.</p></speech>

We listened to the voices of young people from across the island this morning.  They spoke about the challenges we face.  They also said we need to have a plan.  As Reverend Paisley has pointed out, political unionism has a task ahead.  That is also true of the people who are advocating for a united Ireland.  As Reverend Paisley has said, Brexit has brought this issue to the fore and we have seen the consequences of a referendum that was held without due regard to planning.</p> <p>  I will next call Mr. Owen Reidy on behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  There are five contributors and Senators will ask questions thereafter.</p></speech>

The members have our submissions.  I will make a couple of brief points.  We welcome this debate.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is an all-island federation and, with workers across the island, it has an important contribution to make to this debate.  We are proud of the fact that we are truly a cross-community organisation in Northern Ireland.  We represent workers from both traditions and international workers who describe themselves as unionist, nationalist, loyalist, republican and none of the above.  That plurality and diversity adds to our voice in this debate.  It is a unique voice in that regard.  For that reason, we do not take a particular view as persuaders for a united Ireland or persuaders for the <i>status quo</i>.  We deal with the situation as we find it.<br/><br/>Whether or not one is in favour of a united Ireland and constitutional change, the state of health of the Belfast agreement, or Good Friday Agreement, should be of concern for all.  It is in serious disrepair.  Strand one is down, and has been down for 30% of the time since devolution.  Strand two in not operating and has been subject to boycotts in recent years.  Most Irish diplomats will say that east-west relations, which comprise strand three, are probably at their lowest point in the past 20 years, largely due to the behaviour of recent Tory Governments, in particular around Brexit.  Whether one is for constitutional change or the <i>status quo</i>, that is the current constitutional settlement and everyone needs to make sure it is resurrected, and that it works.<br/><br/>We also need to learn from the chaos of Brexit.  We need to learn from those mistakes.  A political elite gave people a limited binary choice without any preparatory work.  There was no debate about the customs union or Single Market, whether students could access the Erasmus programme, etc.  Brexit also resulted in the Northern Ireland protocol and the problems with the Irish Sea.  We need to learn lessons from that and we cannot allow the debate to be dictated by those of either persuasion who have firm and fixed views.  There are many people to persuade.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of talk about the idea of constitutional change but there has not yet been much talk about what it might look like.</p><p>Brendan O'Leary's piece in his book is a very welcome contribution.  We need to start looking at the mechanics without taking anything for granted and without assuming that constitutional change is inevitable.  Regarding whether we have constitutional change or the <i>status quo</i>, there is also the issue of accompanying socio-economic change that addresses the concerns of workers North and South as we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic and go headlong into a cost-of-living crisis.  I hear people say if we had a united Ireland, we could have X, Y and Z and others say that if we had the <i>status quo</i>, we could have X, Y and Z.  We will have nothing unless we make political choices that are fundamental.  We need to see a transformation of the island of Ireland when it comes to socio-economic issues for all workers whether we have change or the <i>status quo</i>.</p></speech>

I come from what would be perceived as a Protestant unionist loyalist, PUL, background.  During my lifetime, I have been on a personal and political journey from someone who as a young man in the 1980s attended "Ulster Says No" rallies to someone who in 2022 is happy to participate in this Seanad committee.</p> <p>  Not only do I think constitutional change is inevitable, I think it is coming much faster than many realise.  That change is something I very much welcome and embrace.  For some time now, I have been holding private casual conversations among friends, family and neighbours within the wider PUL community during which I try to explain why I have a desire to see Irish unity.  What I have established from those conversations is that there are some who are truly fearful about that prospect.  Some are resigned to this happening while some are indifferent.  I find that there is an increasing number of people who are on the same path I tread now.  I hope that in some small part, this submission can assist with providing insight into those fears and help advance engagement, discussion and understanding of those who identify as British living within Northern Ireland.  That really is my primary motivation for speaking today.  </p> <p>  In the written submission provided to the committee, I have outlined my thinking about the following topics.  Highlighting the distinction between Britishness and unionism is the most valuable contribution I can make.  These identities overlap but they are not one and the same.  I hope it will be useful in providing insight as to why I feel it is futile to try to engage unionists publicly in conversations about constitutional change.  The sensitivity of language is not always appreciated when engaging those of British identity living in Northern Ireland, the North of Ireland, the North, Ulster, the occupied six counties or Tuaisceart na h&Eacute;ireann.  Language is so important as highlighted by the long list of names in use for one small place.  </p> <p>  If there is one recommendation I would make, it is this.  Do not wait for a referendum before making changes that can remove barriers to constitutional change.  With that, I will close by saying go raibh maith agat.  I very much welcome members' feedback, comments and any questions they may have.  </p></speech>

I would like to tell the committee a story.  I often go North.  I am originally from Tyrone.  Sometimes I go to Belfast.  Whenever I am there, I love to visit the peace wall to admire the art.  Often graffiti artists are at work there and I will stop and chat to them.  Before the last lockdown, I spoke to some young men who were working on the Shankill side of the peace wall.  As it turned out, they were from Drogheda and born around the time of the Good Friday Agreement.  They did not care very much and knew less about the geopolitics of the area.  To them, it was just a magical big blank wall they could shape in some way.  I thought that was a metaphor - the idea of the <i>tabula rasa</i>.  Could the same be said of a new and reimagined Ireland?  There is something about walls.  I know it has been said apropos fences and poetry but there is something in human nature that makes you want to climb over or go around walls.<br/><br/>A wall has grown up metaphorically between the two parts of this island.  Increasingly, people want to find ways around that.  It is not just people from the nationalist community.  The Brexit shock and the chaos at the heart of the British establishment have accelerated a process.  Recently I have been speaking to people who could be loosely defined as cultural unionists - persuadables.  They are not afraid of this conversation.  They just want to know the detail - what is on offer.  They also want to know that the Republic is willing and able to welcome them.  They are conscious of a lack of engagement here sometimes.  It is extremely hurtful not just to nationalists but to people from a unionist background, who are trying to look at the bigger picture, which for them, is re-admission to the EU, the economic outlook and the opportunity to be part of a large minority rather than part of a grouping where you cannot even vote in the government let alone vote them out.<br/><br/>This is a conversation that is happening in civic society even if political unionism is not engaging in it and it is a conversation for everyone to participate in.  What I have noticed is that increasingly people are leaning towards the idea of a hybrid identity.  Hybridity is a positive thing.  We have this idea of purism - to be pure English, pure Irish or pure Scots, which is nonsense if you drill down into our DNA.  Hybridity is the way forward.  The census results show that to a certain extent.  They show crudely the idea of Catholics outnumbering Protestants.  That does not matter in the sense of one block replacing another, particularly in an increasingly secular society.  What it does is act as an indicator of people being open to constitutional change.  Someone who defines in a particular way may or may not vote for unity but that person is willing to examine the evidence and make an informed choice.  What I have noticed with the people from both sides of the Border with whom I speak, particularly in the North, is that what people want in common is the opportunity to work, thrive and have an improved outcome for their children - better opportunities than they had.  This transcends these binaries we keep hearing about to do with class and tribe.</p></speech>

Constitutional change offers opportunities to advance gender equality.  The right for women to be included in conversations and debate about constitutional change should be protected by government.  It is a right now enshrined in international law and we can look to the example of UN Resolution 1325.</p> <p>  Our research facilitated women's inclusion in discussions about constitutional change on the island of Ireland.  It was funded by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We provided safe spaces for women to discuss constitutional change using community education tools.  We conducted ten workshops in Northern Ireland with women and ten workshops in the Republic of Ireland with women.  Our participants had diverse political identifications and were from different backgrounds.  What they shared was a common goal in wanting to have their say on constitutional change and to have their voices heard.</p></speech>

Our participants believed that there should be an inclusion of all social groups in these conversations and discussions and they felt that was an essential component of the unity debate.  They argued that it is essential also to support marginalised groups to enable them and facilitate their participation in these conversations.  They held that grassroots knowledge was an invaluable resource but was too often underutilised.  They underlined the need for human rights and for equality protections in any form of constitutional reform.</p><p>They felt it was essential that the grassroots had the information required before a border poll.  They were concerned about community tensions and they were concerned about the impact of constitutional change on social welfare and the economy.</p><p>We outlined a number of recommendations and principles in the report we submitted and we hope that the committee will consider how they can be implemented in the future.</p></speech>

I thank Reverend Kyle Paisley, Dr. Devlin, Mr. Reidy, Mr. Swain and Professor Ashe.</p> <p>  I hope that this is the beginning of moving the conversation from wanting a united Ireland to what kind of united Ireland do we want.  I mean by that what they are telling us about Brexit and that nobody wants to launch into something and not know what we are launching ourselves into, and all of the consequences of that.  I am also talking about the concept itself of a united Ireland when it is left as a concept because one can put one's hopes into what that is but one can also put one's fears about what a united Ireland is.  This is our opportunity to say what is constitutional change and what that looks like because that is how we bring people with us and that is how we open up the conversation.</p> <p>  I want the witnesses to tell us what are the mechanism that we need to examine and what is the research that we need to do because this is a huge task.  I would like us to understand the different areas that we need to focus in on and build a framework of the work and the detail that is involved in this.  I completely agree with what Mr. Reidy says.  Examining the mechanism and the Good Friday Agreement, we can be open-minded about this and I hope we will be.  What is not negotiable to me is the values of the Good Friday Agreement of partnership, inclusion and reconciliation and not throwing the baby out with the bath water about what has brought us to this point and what works.  I ask them to tell us today, not only for this panel but for everybody, what are the mechanisms and the detail that we need to look at.</p></speech>

The questions will be to Reverend Kyle Paisley and Dr. Devlin.</p> <p>  I want to acknowledge, because it was echoed this morning and yet again here today, that words matter and language and the sensitivity of language matters too.  I want to acknowledge Reverend Kyle Paisley's opening address to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, with the word, "Cathaoirleach".  We talked about Queen Elizabeth and her use of language in Dublin Castle, much quoted.  I want to genuinely acknowledge and thank Reverend Kyle Paisley for the respect shown to this House.  It is significant.  One word is even very significant.  It reminds me of the Irish language and culture and how we must allow and give space for Irish culture and language in Northern Ireland and, for that matter, on the island of Ireland because we talk about the lrish language in Ireland but we have much to do here in terms of our understanding and fluency of the language and the Irish tradition and culture.  It is something that all people on this island value.  We need to be mindful of that in our ongoing discussions, particularly about the Irish language in Northern Ireland.  It is an issue I support.  Indeed, I am not a great Irish speaker but I see the richness and the connectivity of it.  That is really important because it goes back to that message about identity.</p> <p>  Dr. Devlin talked about something that I touched on this morning.  Dr. Devlin mentioned the word "identity" as an emotional construct - I myself said that this morning - and it cannot be ignored.  Dr. Devlin said that any new constitutional arrangement must make space for the British identity going forward.  That is generous.  We need that sense of generosity in our language but also in our actions.  Dr. Devlin might elaborate on that.  It is a powerful message.</p> <p>  Finally, in relation to that question to Reverend Kyle Paisley, Dr. Devlin says that unionism and unionist difficulties are the republicans' opportunity.  It is a clich&eacute; to a great extent but, clearly, Dr. Devlin feels it.  It was the heading of the second paragraph in Dr. Devlin's speech that she submitted in advance and I would like her to tease that out a little with us.</p></speech>

We had young people in this morning and it was mind-blowing.  I have to be honest with everyone about that.  Hearing these presentations today, and I look forward to hearing the others as well, I want to repeat my thanks to the Cathaoirleach for this wonderful opportunity to be able to speak, and to hear everybody's voice, here today.</p> <p>  It really is significant to hear the voices of Mr. Swain, with his own background and where he is, and of course, Reverend Paisley, here today.  Of course, we have our other speakers here today.  I cannot thank them enough.  I met Reverend Paisley's father many years ago when he got electricity on Rathlin Island - it was unbelievable - where my father comes from.  It was historic to get electricity on the island.</p> <p>  I thank everyone.  I was struck by Dr. Devlin's description in her submission of the necessity for a more modern hybrid understanding of identity, North and South.  I suppose I just wanted to ask Dr. Devlin what can we do to promote this more flexible and inclusive way of thinking because it is so important.  Identity, as Senator Victor Boyhan stated this morning, is key in all of these discussions.  How can we be more flexible and inclusive in thinking about our identities and ourselves?</p> <p>  Mr. Reidy hit the nail on the head in his submission that we need to ensure that a border poll is run in an orderly informed way so that it does not become the shambles of Brexit.  How should the Government plan and prepare to ensure that does not happen?  That is key in all of this.</p> <p>  I thank Professor Ashe so much.  I would love to see the research.  I really would.  This is absolutely vital in these conversations going forward.  There is a civic organisation event happening tomorrow.  We need to bring what Professor Ashe is doing and have more engagement on that.  We have the women's council of Ireland speaking at the event but we need Professor Ashe's voice there.</p> <p>  I found Professor Ashe's submission brilliant as well, notably the reference to the gender politics of the Good Friday Agreement and everything that has come after.  We have to look at all of that.  The way in which women and grassroots campaigners can be shut out of the process was highlighted by groups, such as the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition.  How do we ensure that women get to participate fully in discussions on constitutional change?</p><p> I do not believe Mr. Beckton has spoken yet.</p><p> It was powerful to listen to what Mr. Swain had to say, particularly about he has shifted because of what is happening with Brexit, which has dramatically changed the face of everything.  The people of Northern Ireland did not vote for Brexit.  We always have to keep that at the forefront of everything we do in the future.</p><p> These conversations are fantastic.  I am so happy to be here today and so privileged to be able to hear the debate.  I recommend that our guests look back at the young people&rsquo;s forum this morning.  I would really encourage them to do so.</p></speech>

I acknowledge Reverend Kyle Paisley&rsquo;s use of c&uacute;pla focal in this Chamber.  We had Linda Ervine here a few months ago for Seachtain na Gaeilge.  Before we get into the constitutional issues, I want to make the point that the Irish language is a great unifier in terms of the ties that bind us together.  Go raibh c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le maith agat.</p> <p>  Mr. Forkan spoke about the mechanics of this debate.  I think it is very much a consistent point which emerged this morning.  I have no doubt that it will emerge in the course of the rest of this afternoon.  I do not disagree with him by any stretch of the imagination.  All of the themes he mentioned, including workers&rsquo; rights, the economy, social justice, housing, health, policing and justice, are key issues and need to be well thought-out, considered and planned for.  I believe that at times when we have been engaging in this debate, we have been talking as if the discussion is not happening.  The discussion is happening.  We need to give this discussion a home and locate it somewhere where it can be facilitated, enabled and resourced.  A good place for that would be a citizens&rsquo; assembly although I do not believe it would be the be-all and end-all.  In the first instance, and this is just a small anomaly of partition, as the Chairman will be aware a citizens&rsquo; assembly in this State involves a random selection of 100 citizens from the electoral register here.  There is not much good in having a citizens&rsquo; assembly on this matter that does not also include citizens from the Six Counties.  Small anomalies like that need to be sorted.  My question in this regard may be answered by any and all of our contributors. Would they feel that a citizens' assembly or a similar forum would be a useful space in which to locate that discussion in the future?</p> <p>  I must declare an interest because Professor Ashe was my lecturer in university so she is partly to blame for me being here.  I do not want to name anybody in particular but it is fantastic to have Ms Eilish Rooney here alongside her.  She is a quiet champion of peace, equality, human rights and justice who has done phenomenal work over a long period of time.  It will be crucial that people like her are part of this debate in the future.</p> <p>  On the research issue, Professor Ashe is correct in that we need to include those lesser heard voices, with women&rsquo;s voices being such key voices.  Within that, there are multiple communities and voices we need to hear.  Within the women&rsquo;s sector and women more generally, we want to ensure we have "hard-to-reach" voices, a term I personally hate.  I am talking about women of colour, women from deprived communities, women who are former combatants and women who have been to the fore in peace-building.  We need to ensure we get them into this dialogue.  Can I have our guests' immediate view on how we can best achieve that?  I agree that we need many voices in this, and I include ourselves in that.  We engage in this stuff fairly regularly because it is our meat and drink, but it will be very crucial that we hear all these voices.  The same goes for the trade union movement, which Mr. Reidy can reach, and for the community and voluntary sector.  We are going to need everybody to put their shoulder to the wheel to ensure we get those voices coming, through our guests, into the space that hopefully will be created sooner rather than later to give a home to this debate.

I am looking forward to everyone else's contribution.  I wish to put my cards on the table.  I am from the great county of Kildare which is in the middle of this great country which we have.  I am very interested in this conversation.  The most important thing is that we have said we are here as a committee to listen to what our guest speakers have to say.  It has been very interesting so far.  Unfortunately, I came in at the end of the debate with the young people this morning, but I found that brilliant as well.</p> <p>  I thank Reverend Paisley, Mr. Reidy, Mr. Swain, Dr. Devlin and Professor Ashe for what they have contributed so far.  I have two questions.  The hybrid identity that Dr. Devlin spoke about has been mentioned by other colleagues.  Could she tease that out a little for us?  What is she actually talking about there?  It is most important that we, as a committee, listen to that.</p> <p>  Mr. Reidy spoke on behalf of an organisation which represents workers about social change.  Where does Mr. Reidy see an all-Ireland fitting into social change?  Does he have any thoughts on that question?  Obviously, some of us, more than others, are here to put a voice to the social change we would like to see.  As someone from an all-Ireland organisation that represents workers, where does Mr. Reidy see that going?</p> <p>  Professor Ashe and Mr. Swain are in the communities.  Professor Ashe spoke about community tensions coming through in her survey.  Could she let us know a little more about those fears?</p></speech>

My questions are informed by my experience as a student at Trinity College Dublin.  I went to Belfast and I had colleagues in Stranmillis University College and St. Mary's University College on the Falls Road.  From 1984 to 1989, I spent a great deal of time in Belfast.  Through the friendships I made with people from all communities, I found I had nothing whatsoever to fear.  However, I fear what is happening in Westminster.  I had a conversation with a very high-profile and senior member of the loyalist community whose blushes I will preserve.  I will not say who he was.  He said to me that the Scottish people know who they are, as do the Welsh.  He said that the English are going through a period of existential identity crisis and we need to support them in that moment of uncertainty.  It has implications for us.  I echo what Mr. Swain and others have said.  Change is coming very quickly on this island.  We are looking at the twin barrels of change.</p> <p>  I remember a game I used to play with my sisters called &ldquo;Ready or not, here I come&rdquo;.  My experience as an Army officer in the Middle East and in the former Yugoslavia has told me that when people stop talking, they communicate in other ways and we all know where that leads us to.  From my area of interest, I believe that in ten or 15 years' time &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, or the Defence Forces, will no longer exist.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, our police force, will no longer exist on this island and I do not know what will have replaced them.  Perhaps An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be called the police force of Ireland or for the land, but I do not know.  That is what troubles me because I have a 21-year-old, a 20-year-old, an 18-year-old and a 14-year-old, and they, like our contributors' children and grandchildren, will have to live these next steps and navigate them.  It behoves us within this committee and as a community of elders - I hope that term does not offend anybody - to begin the conversations.  How will policing, justice, defence, security, intelligence, social protection, education, and health be accommodated?   I have a disabled child and I would much prefer the services and therapies he would get in Northern Ireland.  Who is having these conversations?  My question to our guests relates to how best we facilitate those conversations.  Is it through a citizens' assembly?  The people are already ahead of these Chambers.  There is a major event happening tomorrow in the 3Arena, if I am not mistaken.  I would love to have the opportunity to speak at it, but perhaps the next time.  We need to reach out to one another and celebrate our differences.  Diversity is the key to our survival and to our shared future, in whatever format that takes.  We must have a conversation because fear of the unknown will lead to suboptimal outcomes and we do not want to go back to that dark place.  I welcome any suggestions from our guest contributors on how we might have those conversations.</p> <p>  Finally, I wish to say that if I can support our guests' work in any way and if I can come to speak at any forum or place they might suggest, I would very happily do that.</p><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na finn&eacute;ithe go l&eacute;ir go dt&iacute; Baile &Aacute;tha Cliath.  I was born on the 50th anniversary of 1916 and, with my personal journey going back to the 1980s, I am delighted to see everyone in this Chamber and to hear Reverend Paisley and others.  We are all one extended family.  Like all families, it is a bit dysfunctional at times, but we are all family.</p></speech>

First, I am grateful for the comments regarding the Irish language.  I understand that a great Englishman, William Bedell, was the first man to translate the Bible into the Irish language, to many complaints from many of his fellow clergy on the island of Ireland.  As they say here, the only way is Essex.  He was a good man.</p> <p>  A question was raised about the second paragraph in the full submission about unionists' difficulty being republicans' opportunity.  I know that is an old clich&eacute;.  What does hold water in the present situation is that we all agree that the Troubles in the North of Ireland cast a long shadow, and still do, over relationships and the general atmosphere in northern Irish politics.  I put that line in because there is still a fear among many unionists that if there is a united Ireland, there may be elements who would seek to exploit that.  People in Border communities suffered a great deal during the Troubles.  Going to the question of identity in a united Ireland, it may be possible, and I am sure many have good intentions regarding this, to have the history and culture of unionists and folk of a British identity be respected and acknowledged, with freedom being given to the expression of history and culture.</p> <p>  The one remaining issue with regard to identity is affiliation, which is a harder issue to get across.  If people's history is acknowledged and they have the freedom to express their culture in a new Ireland, the one sticking point for many unionists is national affiliation.  Briefly, people cannot really be unionists without the union and without that national affiliation.  That is as much as I can say.  I cannot remember all the questions that I was asked, but I hope I have answered some things in some way, at least with an outline.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Owen Reidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#X00500"><p>Those were interesting, important questions.  I will try to take them in the round and not to be too long-winded.  In response to Senator Currie, the question presupposes that ICTU is advocating for a united Ireland.  We are neutral on the issue because we represent workers across Northern Ireland who vote for all parties and none, who identify as British, Irish or Northern Irish, and our growing international workforce, though it is not growing enough because of the state of the economy and because some do not feel welcome enough.  As an organisation that is interested in social change, we want change today.  We do not see it as being dependent on the constitutional issue.  It is a fundamental issue.  We want to be part of the debate.<br/><br/>I would like to read Dr. Martina Devlin's submission because I would say she captures the identity issue well.  I will give an analogy.  There are many strikes in Northern Ireland at the moment.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile will know the council areas only too well as a native of Belfast.  When it comes to identity, we look at people in a linear, one-dimensional way.  It has to be multifaceted.  People on the picket line represent various unions.  One might be a DUP voter, another a Sinn F&eacute;in voter, and others may be everything in between.  One may say that it is a disgrace that devolution has collapsed and another may say that the DUP is right to stay out until the protocol is fixed.  What unites them is they are frustrated about the cost-of-living crisis and they want a pay increase.  That is incoherent and inconsistent for some people.  To me, as a trade unionist who has operated in Northern Ireland for the past six years, with 18 years previously in the Republic of Ireland, it is not inconsistent.  It is what it is.  It is part of people's identities.  What people here are trying to do and to build is important.  We cannot just categorise people by how they vote, whether it is with regard to identity, cultural or socioeconomic issues.  They have many identities.  We need to make sure that we do not fall into the linear argument of asking if people are for or against something and, if they are against it, deciding maybe they should be coaxed to be for it.<br/><br/>A couple of points were raised about what we need to see happen.  We need to see them happen today, whether it is in one jurisdiction or two.  The UK and Republic of Ireland shamefully have one thing in common.  We produced a report that we cited with a link in our submission to the committee.  It is called, No Going Back &ndash; A New Deal Towards a Safe and Secure Future for All.  We still spend too little on public services per person in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.  We talk about wanting European services, but we do not have European taxes.  Employers in Northern Ireland pay 41% on national insurance and labour taxes compared with rates in the rest of Europe.  Employers in this jurisdiction pay 48%.  People like Danny McCoy, the head of IBEC, say that we need a bigger state.  If we have learned anything from Covid, it should be that collective solidarity is key and that the state has to be adequately resourced, with people paying their fair share.  To be fair, in the Republic of Ireland, the tax system for workers is progressive.  When people earn more, they pay more.  It has become less progressive in the UK because of what Mr. Kwarteng did with the 45% tax rate.<br/><br/>The social wage needs to be addressed and fundamentally changed.  That is not predicated on whether it is one jurisdiction or two.  Some people would say that it would be inevitable if we had one with the right government.  Other people would say it would be addressed if the Labour Party in Britain was in government.  The constitutional issue is separate to that and runs in parallel.  Workers cannot wait for a better future or for social justice being dependent on constitutional change, nor can the <i>status quo </i>persist.<br/><br/>Citizens' assemblies have worked well in the Republic of Ireland.  They have been excellent and shown in many cases that the people are ahead of the political class to some degree.  I do not know how we would do it on an all-island basis.  My concern about Northern Ireland would be that certain people would just absent themselves from the process and I would wonder if it was a true reflection of the dynamic.<br/><br/>The building blocks are part of the architecture that we have all signed up to, which is the Good Friday Agreement.  That is the architecture for whatever the future holds.  We should not be fearful of it.<br/><br/>We should not talk about a united Ireland as if it is a point in time to reach.  Society constantly evolves.  I do not mean to constantly look at Senator Currie since I am talking to everybody and trying to address all the questions.  Society evolves and we need to improve as we go along.  Whether we have a united Ireland or the current situation, workers have to make the best of it.  It behoves the political class to do its bit to help us to do that.<br/><br/>I am sorry if I went on a bit.</p></speech>

Several Senators raised it.  We cannot expect people to stop being unionists even if there is a united Ireland.  That is like asking people to change their identity entirely, which is not logical, fair or inclusive.  We need to show unionists that their distinctiveness would be respected in a united Ireland, not swallowed up, and not tolerated grudgingly.  It should be given scope.</p><p>Understanding and appreciating someone else's symbolic icons does not topple your own.  There is room for both.  The answer lies in the Good Friday Agreement, which can be reverse engineered to encompass the island as a whole.  That could be used to make space for hybridity just as in Northern Ireland people have the right to define yourself as Irish, British, European, one or all three as you so choose.  That can be reversed into a united Ireland with constitutional protections for those identities.  That is really important.</p><p> It is an enormous opportunity because we are not just talking about people who think of themselves as British and Irish or British-or-Irish; we are talking about Irish Nigerians or Irish Polish people, Irish Chinese people and the same protections ought to be offered there.  This is an enormous opportunity.  Of course the thing about the Constitution, and indeed the Republic, is that it is a living document.  It needs to constantly evolve and be improved.  </p><p> On Senator Black's points, we should not think in terms of cultural superiority but cultural equality.  That means making space for 12 July, for example, as a national holiday.  I would love to learn how to play the Lambeg drum.  I might not be able to lift it but I would like to have a go at it.  These symbols are not threatening any more.  </p><p> If I might address Reverend Paisley directly, we can learn from each others symbols.  Both sides of the house used to play those drums once upon a time before the Troubles.  There are opportunities to respect each other's culture and identity in a really genuine way and not in a box-ticking way.  I heard his father preach after the Omagh bomb in 1998.  I sneaked into a little Free Presbyterian church; I think it was in Pomeroy but it was definitely outside Omagh.  I got lost on the highways and byways getting there.  I stood outside where I was just going to listen.  A nice man with white gloves, a suit and very respectably dressed for church whooshed me inside and sat me down beside some ladies with their hymn books.  I had to participate then or I would have been outed, although I am sure they knew right well.  However, I have never forgotten the address he gave to the congregation.  What was key about it is that he did not know that there was anyone from my background, which can probably be guessed from the look of me with my green jacket, red hair, freckles and my name.  He did not know that there were people like me there.  He thought that he was addressing a funeral after the Omagh bomb in the Presbyterian community.  He said to that congregation that a mother's love is a mother's love and a mother's loss is a mother's loss, irrespective of whether she is Catholic or Protestant.  I thought that showed leadership.</p><p> What I would like to say to everyone in this Chamber and especially the political class here, because it has an important role to play, is that leadership is needed from the political class.  Senator Boylan asked for some information on that and I think Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile did too.  We need to start by establishing an independent body to consider the case, reporting its findings within a specified timeframe.  It should be cross-party, cross-Border, with Irish, British and EU membership, along with representatives from civil society.  We want a team of people working together to plan how reunification might be delivered in a logical, sustainable way.  When we have that information, then we go to those people that I was talking about whom I meet in places like Bangor and Belfast and around the North who come from a culturally unionist background and who are not, as I said, afraid of the conversation despite what some of their leaders are staying; they just want to know what the plan is.</p></speech>

It is the first time I have heard the term &quot;hybrid identity&quot;.  Identity and understanding identity in Northern Ireland is the key to this.  In my presentation I talked about language and its importance.  I talked about the very genuine fear in my community, the unionist community, of a united Ireland.  In my introduction I did not talk of this but I said that in understanding that fear, the clue is in the name.  The unionist <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>is the union.  Unionism will cease to exist in a united Ireland.  That is why there is so much fear.  Unionism is an identity but Britishness is a greater identity.  It would be true to say every unionist is British but it not true to say that every British identity is a unionist.  Here is one example: I am British, I am Irish.  I think I live in the most fortunate part of the world because I can hold both those identities.  Neither one eclipses or diminishes the other and my life is the richer for them both.  Language is important and understanding Britishness as opposed to unionism.  I did a little research before I made my submission.  I went onto the UK Government website.  There are 277,000 British people living in southern Ireland.  That is greater than the DUP vote.  Are they less British because they live in a place called Ireland?  I do not think that they are.  Then with the Irish people and Irish identity, the Irish diaspora is well known and understood but an Irishman living in Cork, Crossmaglen, Chicago or Coventry is Irish.  As a British person, I can be British whether I am living in Belfast or Ballina.  One of the things that I have observed when I have been talking to people from my community is when unionists get invitations to talk about a new Ireland, a shared Ireland and a future Ireland, a redness descends because they realise that conversation is about their extinction.  If those conversations are directed to British people and to British identity, British identity is a global thing.  When I am talking to my unionist friends I pose the question: will Nicola Sturgeon be any less British if Scotland achieves independence?  She will not.  That is the point that I would like to make.</p></speech>

All they wanted was the opportunity.  With a fairly small resource, we provided the opportunity for them not only to have their say but to do what we are doing today, and listen to other people have their say too and to learn more about what constitutional change might mean and what specifically it might mean for women.  We were interested in hearing their voices.  I feel that we are here today because they gave their voices and did so freely.</p><p>There was even a pleasure and enjoyment in the conversation between people, especially between those who had very different experiences of living in Northern Ireland and the North and those who had very different experiences of being in the Republic of Ireland.  We brought women together throughout the island to listen to each other and continue the conversation.  We were asked about how we promote the conversation.  One of our findings was that the conversation is there waiting to be had; what is needed is a mechanism.  The mechanism we devised, using community education methods, was a very usable and well-known mechanism within the women's sector, for instance, that can be used and employed - with the encouragement of the Seanad for sure - in working class communities and in hard-to-reach communities with hard-to-reach people, such as the people we talked to.  Those people want to have their voices heard.  Today's meeting has already continued the work we started because Senators are listening to those voices.  They have got our report, heard our recommendations and, in a way, we can say to the women we have worked with that the Seanad heard them.</p><p> That is not the same as a citizens' assembly, which is work at another political level that will be very welcome whenever the day comes, but people are already having their own assemblies.  At F&eacute;ile an Phobail earlier this year, we had a people's self-selected assembly.  That does not meet the standards of a citizens' assembly but it was a fun way for people to have their say and to feel themselves included, most especially when what they had to say was not what other people wanted to hear.  Voices that are excluded have to be heard and we have to find mechanisms to enable those voices to be heard.</p><p> The last point I will address was one reported on by Professor Ashe, namely, a tension within some working class communities, especially loyalist working class communities, where some women registered concerns about their own security in even articulating publicly a view about the conversation.  Those things happen on some occasions and, listening to the presentations we heard today, there is a mood change.  Certainly, within the women's groups and the women's sector in working class loyalist areas in the North, people want to have their say, they want their voices to be heard, and to reinforce some of the points made by colleagues today.  I do not see that sense of insecurity as a weakness.  I see people articulating that sense of insecurity as a strength.  We need to hear those people.  They need to be heard within their own communities and encouraged to have their say. </p></speech>

I will reference the most recent event.  Some nationalist groupings have been campaigning for a border poll for some time now, as is their right.  Those behind the campaign obviously feel their objective has, to some extent, been justified following the recent publication of the 2021 census results in Northern Ireland.  However, I question the interpretation of those results and the wisdom of using the arithmetic of the religious composition of the Northern Ireland population as a major argument for seeking fundamental constitutional change at this point in time through the holding of a very premature border poll.<br/><br/>Before embarking on such a risky course of action, it is important for all of us to learn from the mistakes of recent and previous historical initiatives on major constitutional or institutional change, three of which I detailed in my submission.  First, this island was partitioned a century ago.  Two separate states were established on the basis of religious arithmetic.  In Northern Ireland, political institutions were established on the basis of majority rule, which discriminated against the Catholic nationalist minority whose consent was never sought.  The consequence, of course, was the Northern Ireland Troubles.  If future constitutional change is to take place, it must be able to win the consent of both the nationalist majority and the unionist minority rather than a simple majority of 50% plus one.<br/><br/>Second, in 2016, as has been mentioned by Mr. Reidy and Senator Black, the disaster of the Brexit referendum poisoned relationships between political parties in the UK, between Britain and Ireland, and between the Irish Government and the unionist population in Northern Ireland.  I agree with what has been said, and I said it in my submission, that mistake must be learned from.  Before we ever go near a vote on a border poll, the electorate in both parts of Ireland must be adequately informed, not only about what they will vote on but the consequences of whatever the vote will be.  I think Senator Black raised the question of how we do that and I raised it in my submission.  I do not go for the idea of a citizens' assembly.  The best people to do that would be those involved in an inter-university project.  Many academics throughout these islands are looking at this issue.  They should be brought under one umbrella and they should look at all the options people have, whether it is an continuation of the present constitutional <i>status quo</i>, with possible change in many institutional ways, or the different types of all-Ireland structures, such as federal, confederal and so on.  A third option I raised relates to what happens if Scotland gains independence.  Does that give us another different type of structure, one that is outside the present framework?  We should also think outside the box.  If Scotland gains independence, we could create a new European structure as a western part of the European Union.  It is important to educate the electorate.<br/><br/>Third, in 1998, two referendums in both parts of Ireland overwhelmingly approved the Good Friday Agreement.  Although it brought an end to terrorist violence, it has failed to deliver political institutions and reconciliation.  We need to revisit it.  In my submission, I propose an amendment to the St. Andrew's Agreement to ensure the functioning of stable political institutions in Northern Ireland.  We also need to clarify the conditions for a border poll.  Without stable institutions, it is difficult to understand the logic of holding a referendum on Irish unity.  If we cannot unite in Northern Ireland's political institutions, how can we expect to unite Ireland?  The priority should be to ensure that stable political institutions are established in Northern Ireland rather than holding a border poll.</p></speech>

As I look around, I believe I am the oldest person here at 84 years of age.  Why do I bother?  Senator McDowell hit it on the head; it is because I care.  I have four children and seven grandchildren.  I care about the country they will inherit.  A united Ireland is inevitable.  It will not happen in my lifetime but it will happen in my grandchildren's lifetime.  I am confident of that.</p> <p>  A number of things have to be taken into account.  The time for a border poll is not now.  A 50% plus one majority would be a disaster; it has to be more definitive than that.  What comes next after the border poll, if it is in favour of a united Ireland?  On policing, what would our police force be called?  The PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have to be joined together in some form or another.</p><p>Where would the seats of Government be?  Would they be in Dublin?  Would they be in Belfast?  As regards the national anthem, I would be in favour of changing it altogether.  If we were united, it should be "A Nation Once Again" because we would be one nation.</p><p> The Irish language is a beautiful language.  It will be spoken by the minority in the next 50 years.  However, British or unionists have no interest in it.  That's okay.  As regards the flag, will the white be taken out of the flag and the green and orange joined?  The unionist role in a united Ireland is very important.  The first thing that would have to happen is an all-Ireland election.  If that happened, the unionist population would elect their representatives just as they do now.  That would start a government, and rightly so.</p><p> On our shared culture, we cannot ignore the fact that the Battle of the Boyne took place; it is part of our culture.  The Easter Rising took place; it is part of our culture.  The Siege of Derry took place; it is part of our culture.  There is no use sweeping these away.  They are a part of what we were and what we will always be.  Ireland's relationship with Britain would be a lot happier and we would be better friends in a united Ireland than we are at present.</p></speech>

I want to add to what the Senators asked in respect of what political framework will develop from all of this.  I will outline briefly what I think are the three main constitutional frameworks that could be possible.  One is a federation, one is a confederation and the other is a centralised state.  All of those options are unitary states.  The federal option delegates adequate power to the people in order that more power can be retained in the centre.  The confederal state is the most democratic option because it considers the people as totally sovereign.  The best example would be Switzerland, where there is direct democracy.  For example, I come from the area around the Mourne Mountains.  If the powers that be are going to take away Newcastle's or Downpatrick's local hospital, through direct democracy, the local people can go out into their village square, vote on it and say "We want to keep our local hospital".  The confederal constitution is the most democratic.  The Irish Republic is a centralised state because most of the political power is in Dublin, although there are the local democracies.  I am here to advocate for a confederal democracy.  I encourage people to look at Switzerland as an inspiration for that.</p> <p>  The other point I would like to make is about identity.  Identity is extremely important, but there is also another concept that is very important and that is accountability.  I have lived all my life in Northern Ireland, or the North, whichever way you want to term it, and what I perceive as the major problem - we are not supposed to speak about entities here, so I will keep it more general - with the governmental system in the North is that it is based too much around identity rather than accountability.  This institutionalises, or is inclined to institutionalise, sectarianism.  If we are going to build a new Ireland, we have to try to forge a new consensus for a new Ireland.  That means drawing up a completely new constitution for the whole island.  It is highly unlikely at this stage that a considerable number of unionist people would not take part in any debate on that.  If that debate was initially around reforming the institutions in the North of Ireland, maybe more might take part.</p> <p>  One point about citizens' conventions, I advocate that those meet in each town where consensus is measured and everyone is given a say.  A select citizens' assembly is okay, but how do you select those people?  What is their expertise?  What about all the people who have not had a say?  Measuring consensus is also very important.</p></speech>

We have talked a lot about minorities.</p> <p>  A constitution is the safeguard of the rights and liberties of every citizen.  It is also the ultimate test of the law.  However, a constitution is not unchangeable.  We have been talking about possible changes all afternoon.  It is organic.  It reflects the changes of the views of the citizens, and we have seen that several times in recent years.  It is important, I suggest, that all citizens should feel that the constitution is theirs and that they are not in anyway excluded by it; especially in the context of the aspiration we have been talking about of the unity of this island by consent, which is essential.  Our Constitution reflects the fact that it was framed at a time when the Roman Catholic Church had great influence in all aspects of Irish life.  I argue that in Ireland today, the specifically Christian elements of the Constitution exclude those citizens who do not subscribe to a religious belief.  The numbers of those citizens are increasing, especially among the younger cohort.  We have already heard mention of the results of the recent Northern Ireland census.  There is a human right to freedom of religion and belief and a right not to be compelled to reveal one's beliefs in public.  Two sections of the Constitution concern me.  First, the Preamble, which sets the tone.  It begins "In the name of the most holy trinity" and ends with "we acknowledge all our obligations to our divine lord Jesus Christ".  That specifically excludes all non-Christians immediately.  Indeed, it includes some Christians who are not in fact Trinitarians.  Second, is the requirement for religious oaths for public office.  The Constitution requires that the President, judges and members of the Council of State take a religious oath.  In principle, this excludes those who do not believe in a monotheistic religion.  In practice, it requires those without a religious belief to commit a hypocritical act as the first act associated with their office.  That cannot be a desirable outcome.  It is the business of the State to mediate between different interests and belief groups, tolerating as much difference as possible without privileging any group unduly.  The way minorities are treated is a key test of a modern democracy.  I suggest to the committee that the Preamble and the oaths relating to public office are both undesirable and unjustified and, in principle, privilege one set of beliefs over others.</p></speech>

I am not here to represent any specific community.  I am not affiliated to any political organisation.  My views are my own.  I feel my life's journey, from being born a British subject in a loyalist community in Belfast through to becoming a proud citizen of the Irish Republic, gives me some life experience that might help in the opportunities and challenges we face in the coming years.  We have an unequalled opportunity to create a society that can be rich in its diversity and inclusivity, that has a strong economy and that is innovative; a place in which people can thrive and prosper.</p><p>My dream is that my unionist family and friends will find that society desirable and, at least, an acceptable place for them to live and thrive.  I have grave concerns, however.  Mr. Cushnahan spoke about 50%+1.  The demographics suggest we are within touching distance of gaining a border poll but that creates a significant problem in terms of those unionists who will not accept simple democracy.  That could have the real threat of returning us to dark days of conflict that we have tried to avoid.  This dialogue is important and it needs to be supercharged so that we can get these civil assemblies.  In the run-up to the Good Friday Agreement there was significant dialogue on a one-to-one basis or within community groups that helped to break down some of these barriers.</p><p> I have no set views or expertise on the constitutional structures.  I probably favour unity.  There is a dysfunctional government in the North at the moment.  There are a few potential compromises and other areas to consider.  I refer to the issue of defunding religious education.  There has been great work in integrated education and that is growing slowly but it is too little and too slow.  Governments, North and South, have the purse strings to defund that religious education.  We can mandate that schools have to be non-religious.  To me, that is probably the single biggest barrier to creating an integrated society.  I did not meet a catholic until I was 16 and had left school.  That still happens today.  As regards the Irish language, I am a supporter of Irish language education but I know it is not going to be acceptable to unionists who join a new Ireland.  In addition, the current structure in the Republic means that we do not tap into the 13% of non-residents who could be part of that teaching capacity.  That would be much more diverse and rich.  </p><p> On health, in the Republic there is a need to remove all religious patronage from the health service.</p><p> The issue of flags and emblems has been raised.  I am now proud to respect the Tricolour and sing Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann but during the Troubles they were paraded as the war emblems of terrorists.  I know that they will not be acceptable to my fellow unionists and friends.   The trigger that encouraged me to become an Irish citizen was the constitutional change in 1998, to which reference has been made.  Articles 2 and 3 being changed was a signal to me to accept my Irish citizenship.  Previously, those articles had been used as justification for killing and maiming people.</p><p> Some of these suggestions may not seem acceptable but a process of unification that is going to gain the will of the many will need such compromises.  We will develop a stronger, richer and more inclusive society and economy as a result.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</p></speech>

My questions are for any of the witnesses to answer.  There was reference to the mechanics of some of this stuff and how people envisage that.  In terms of issues of identity, respect and creating space, what is not a parallel process but can almost be done in parallel is the issue of the Irish Government going further than just making a passport available to people, which is important.  There is great symbolism with a passport and I do not diminish it at all but it is possible to go further.  Those present may be aware that I have campaigned for a referendum on extending voting rights in presidential elections. Not every unionist, and probably not every nationalist and republican, would take up that opportunity, but I have spoken to a former member of the British parachute regiment who is from Belfast and was involved in negotiating the Good Friday Agreement with the Ulster Unionist Party.   He said he would love to have the opportunity to cast a vote for the President because he very much saw that office as being representative of him.</p> <p>  In the previous Seanad, Senator McDowell chaired a subgroup on Seanad reform that set out a number of proposals.  The Cathaoirleach need not worry - I am not taking us off track.  It produced a range of proposals, including the extension of the franchise in Seanad elections universally, to every citizen.  As all present are aware, the Seanad electorate is currently quite small.  The universal extension of that franchise would mean that, from Kerry to Derry, everyone would have the opportunity to elect candidates to the House.  That would strengthen and enrich the opportunities.  I have seen up close the benefits of having unionist voices in this Chamber.</p> <p>  Are there things the Irish Government can do unilaterally, in parallel with the issues we have discussed this morning? The word "unilaterally" is sometimes taken as being nearly like a scary or bad word but I think it would be positive unilateralism if the Irish Government  were to take these initiatives and show, in a respectful and courteous way, everyone in the North - nationalist, unionist or neither - that they could have a stake.  There was reference to Articles 2 and 3.  Yesterday at a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement I made the point that some people think Articles 2 and 3 were deleted from the Constitution in the context of the Good Friday Agreement but they were replaced with a commitment that people born on the island have a right to be part of the Irish nation.  I am keen to hear the thoughts of our guests on how the Irish Government can and should give effect to that, which is on the table now, alongside working towards constitutional change and redrawing the Constitution in a way that is respectful to everyone.</p></speech>

I do not even think about a border poll.  For me, it is about planning and preparing.  Everything comes down to planning, preparation, communication and these conversations.  It is vital for our Government to be looking at planning.  There have been a lot of academic papers on planning and preparing.  Colin Harvey has done significant work on it, as has John Doyle from DCU.  The conversations are happening around kitchen tables and in households and now, thankfully, it is being brought in here, to Leinster House, thanks to the Cathaoirleach, and civil society groups such as Ireland's Future, of which I am part.  That is really important.  It is about the conversations and it is about planning and preparing.  How would the witnesses like to see our Government plan and prepare for this?  That is key.</p></speech>

Senator Black and Mr. Cushnahan kind of spoke about the same issue, namely, identity versus accountability with regard to the Assembly.  I am oriented towards the technical, so I ask the witnesses to talk me through their understanding - Senator Black covered this with the various models - of being open-minded about this, as well as the models we need to consider.</p></speech>

I listened very carefully to the remarks of Mr. Swaine.</p><p>He asked what is a unionist in a united Ireland.  It is arguable unionism is extinct in terms of the view of a unitary Irish State.  Therefore, when you ask the unionist community and middle ground in Northern Ireland to opt for a new constitutional order on this island, you are asking a substantial number of people to extinguish their ideology in practice and to revert to a sense of Britishness or whatever in a unitary state.  Andrew Gallagher has put forward a paper which accords entirely with my view concerning a confederal arrangement whereby both parts of Ireland, as partners in a confederation, share membership of the European Union on agreed terms and Northern Ireland continues to be and develop as a political community and changes the Good Friday Agreement to provide for a more majoritarian, less mutual-vetoing architecture.  That is the way forward.  If I were an Alliance or unionist voter, I would never vote "Yes" in a referendum for Irish unity unless I see the package.  The package will never be devised by me because, if I am a unionist politician, I will never participate in its design.  These are the crude facts.</p><p> The best chance of having a change in the constitutional architecture of this island is for the two parts of Ireland to come to a partnership together.  It means radical unitary state republicans have to accept that their ideal be postponed for a while in order that the confidence of those who want to remain British in Northern Ireland, and to retain their own police, parliament and capacity to make laws, is retained.  No amount of dialogue will come up with a model in whose development unionism can participate because it is too risky for unionist politicians, but the confederal path is the right path.  You can get two component parts of this island to share their membership of the European Union.  You could even have some vestiges of linkage to Britain remaining in the northern architecture, as long as there was an Irish confederation.</p><p> I have done a paper on this and put it before Jeffrey Donaldson a few years ago.  I believe to ask unionists to surrender - I am using that term in the most technical sense, like people getting married surrender to each other - to an order in whose design they have not participated is fatally flawed and not likely to succeed, whereas to respect the fact Northern Ireland exists and could be a partner of the Republic in a confederation would enable confidence to be built in Northern Ireland.  </p><p> Going back to what was stated by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, there are things we can do ourselves, such as the Seanad and all the rest of it.  Northern Ireland needs to remove the mutual veto on the petition of concern and that kind of stuff, and to address each other as fellow citizens, one of whose votes is as good as the next and who are no longer dominated by identity politics.  I put that to Mr. Gallagher in particular, I suppose, since he agrees with me most.</p></speech>

I really like the idea of a university-led examination of people's views.  That infrastructure is already there across the island.  Who better than our research leaders in the human and political sciences to do good phenomenological and qualitative research at PhD or post-doctoral level?  We would get results quickly, within three or four years, and would bring all those voices to the fore.  It is a great suggestion.  No pressure.</p></speech>

That is why I say we learn a lesson from Brexit and the way it should take place, not on the basis of a citizens' assembly but academics, who are more qualified than anybody else.  All this research is going on but it never reaches the voters or even the elite.  Committee members probably do not know about it.  None of the similar bodies in Westminster or Northern Ireland are given this information.  Planning is critical.<br/><br/>I have argued the inter-university project must not be prescriptive or come to a conclusion.  It provides the various structural options for going forward.  I am not against a border poll.  I am against the premature timing of it, which will exacerbate the problem when there is total political instability and fear in the North.  Timing is critical.  Another thing that is critical, no matter how long it takes to have such a poll, is how those leading the campaign for a border poll on Irish unity argue their case.  It cannot be about arithmetic.  It has to be about persuasion and must convince unionists that a united Ireland will not be as cold a place to live as Northern Ireland was for Catholics.  There are not many good signs about that.<br/><br/>I mentioned in my submission the opinion poll in the <i>Business Post</i>.  What was horrifying about it was the reluctance to think about changing the national anthem or having unionists in a form of power-sharing in government.  The younger they were, the more hardline they were against making any change which would persuade unionists.  That has to change.  We cannot expect unionists to surrender to nationalists.  This has to be something where unionists and nationalists walk together to try to create institutions which respect their different identities and, most important, assure them they have a place in it and are part of it and it is an inclusive project.<br/><br/>On Senator McDowell's point, if there ever is a united Ireland, we have to protect the British identity.  There was a committee in this House that saw the basis of doing that in the comprehensive debate about the Good Friday Agreement.  The British-Irish Council should continue to represent the interests of those with a British identity, just as the Good Friday Agreement represented nationalists in Northern Ireland.  That should be a critical point of any architecture in an all-Ireland-----</p></speech>

My idea of identity is if you are born in Wales you are Welsh, if you are born in Scotland you are Scottish, if you are born in England you are English, and if you are born in the Thirty-two Counties of Ireland you are Irish.  You can be what you like afterwards: Irish-British, Irish-Scotch or whatever you like.  That is my opinion.</p> <p>  On my vision for Ireland, while the one Senator McDowell mentioned has great value, I would like to see Ireland reunited within the Commonwealth of Nations.</p><p>We lost that identity in 1949 when - I will not mention who took it away from us but it is well known - on a whim, because he was seated in the wrong place at a party, this person took offence and decided we were getting out of the Commonwealth.  I would like to see us back in the Commonwealth.  It is not the British Commonwealth, it is the Commonwealth of Nations.  I am open to correction, but as far as I know there are several republics in the Commonwealth.</p></speech>

There are lots of things we can do that would make this polity a better one for those of us living here now.  They would also make it more attractive to citizens not only in this Republic but in Northern Ireland.  Neither polity, Northern Ireland or the Republic, wants to inherit in a united Ireland the problems and faults of the other jurisdiction.  We have all got our own problems, which we are trying to deal with.  We have them and Northern Ireland has them, and it is trying to deal with those too as best it may.</p> <p>  There are things we can do.  At the risk of stealing some of Mr. Campbell Scott's thunder, we can legislate for change in education and health to remove the residual religious influence which many would say is far too dominant - certainly secularists and humanists like me would say so.  If we create what I would call a more liberal - I know that is a dangerous word - society, that is, one that is more respectful of minorities, it would be a more attractive one for people to come and join for those from Northern Ireland, and it would be a more attractive place to live in.</p></speech>

The malaise affecting people now across the whole island, probably more so than anything else, is that they feel alienated from representative democracy.  They feel they do not have any say in the major decisions that affect their future.  The question was asked about what could be done in the North or even in the South.  I would encourage a movement towards a more participative-style democracy where people can influence the decisions where they live and work.  I think this is the way the future of democracy has to go.  For example, what the Government in the Irish Republic could do is work towards that type of governmental system where people have more of a say in the decisions that affect their well-being.  I know people can vote through representative democracy, but what does that mean to somebody whose local hospital is being closed down in Monaghan?  It does not mean much to him or her.  In Northern Ireland, what does that mean to people in Newry and Downpatrick whose local hospital is being run down?  The way to do that is to have citizens' conventions in each major town throughout the whole island.  The difficulty is that the unionist people may not take part in that, so we may have to confine the debate in the North to reforming the institutions in Northern Ireland.  For example, one point that could be done right away relates to the idea of a First Minister.  This encourages a rush to the bottom because then people are vying for position to see who can get the First Minister post.  The reality, according to my knowledge, is that the First Minister and deputy First Minister positions are equal.  It would be a great step forward in the North of Ireland if the posts were designated as equal.  I do not know if that answers the question, but the idea to keep in mind is that instead of a referendum there is a preferendum, so that when people vote from one to four, they might not get their first choice but they might get their second choice.  That way we are building consensus.  That would be a useful mechanism for the citizens' assemblies.  A preferendum is very good instead of a binary referendum because it builds consensus.</p></speech>

I picked a couple of points that we touched on during the day to provide what I think would add a little more colour.  I understand the limitations of a citizens' assembly in the Republic.  Let us have a citizens' assembly with special guests.  There are ways we can extend the scope to make sure we get the right people represented.  That is critical.</p> <p>  I talked about facilitated dialogue, and just to put a bit more colour on that, coming up to the Good Friday Agreement, sterling work was done by all the politicians we saw on the news day by day, but an awful lot of undercover work went on for years before that.  An example is the work done by Martin McAleese with the loyalist paramilitaries in Belfast.  That was hugely needed and powerfully impactful.  The Irish Government has an opportunity to fund that type of work.  It should send people up to meet these people, spend time with them, facilitate and bring them down here.</p> <p>  The other entity I did some work with was the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation.  It is a great mechanism for facilitating dialogue and getting the people who need to be together in the same room in a safe environment with an opportunity to get these discussions going.  Those people then go back and influence their communities.  That is how change happens.  It is not by putting up a single item.  If the Irish Government wants to do things, it should fund that type of work, as that would have a significant impact.</p></speech>

I will not bother to go into a lot of statistics, but they were seismic in two regards.  For the first time since the foundation of the State, people from a Catholic background in Northern Ireland outnumbered those of the Protestant persuasion by 45.7% compared with 43.5%.  Second, 32% described themselves as British only.  That is a massive drop from the 66% who described themselves as British at the foundation of the state.</p> <p>  As I point out in my submission - I will run through this quickly - four out of the six counties already have nationalist majorities.  The biggest council in the North, Belfast City Council, is no longer under unionist control.  After the Assembly elections in May, for the first time the unionists are no longer the largest party in Stormont.  If Stormont is reinstated, which is a big question mark, for the first time unionists will not be entitled to the First Minister's position.  According to the rules, that will be in the gift of Sinn F&eacute;in.</p><p>The point I am making is that it is obvious that we are living through a time of true change.  It is an irreversible change and many politicians and pundits across this country and on this island, including across the divide, have openly acknowledged this.  Yet as far as I can see, our media and the political establishment are reluctant to face up to that.  I will give one simple example.  On the day the results were published, Thursday, 22 September 2022, RT&Eacute;'s flagship current affairs programme, &quot;Prime Time&quot;, did not cover the findings at all.  On the same day, the Taoiseach who was in New York also sought to downplay the significance of the results by describing them as &quot;interesting&quot;.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, took the same line as the Taoiseach when he suggested we should all be cautious about reading too much into these figures.  This was in marked contrast to the position of Mr. Colum Eastwood, the leader of the SDLP, and I quote exactly what he said.  </p><blockquote>	This is a seminal moment in the history of modern Ireland.  The census figures published today reveal that, by any measure, the constitution of the North has been transformed utterly 100 years on from partition. </blockquote><p>If any members of this committee have travelled North in recent years, they will have noticed the growth in the Irish language.  Many people in the North frequently use Irish sentences or sayings.  I even heard Arlene Foster say &quot;Sin &eacute;&quot; the other day.  GAA jerseys are everywhere.  The BBC's political editor, Mr. Enda McClafferty, suggested it is likely the Catholic designation will surpass 50% within five years.  Yet there seems to be no urgency in the Republic to deal with this and address what is happening on the ground.  I have done some empirical research and talked to numerous people across the Border.  No one has been in contact with the shared island initiative.  Anything that is happening is coming from the ground up.<br/><br/>I therefore contend we need a citizens' forum.  Academics need to be brought on board.  A roll-out of engagement with communities right across the country, North and South, is needed and the right of the people on the island of Ireland to vote for the President should be examined forthwith.  Key players in the North should be invited to address the Oireachtas on all matters of all-Ireland significance and a White Paper should be prepared by the Government to outline its draft proposals in the event of a border poll.</p></speech>

I am here as an individual and as a PhD student researching constitutional change in Ireland and identity.  Brexit has ignited unprecedented constitutional debate across these islands and forced the Six Counties out of the European Union against their democratic will.  Importantly, unification offers a direct path back to the EU, making this Seanad initiative both welcome and timely.  As members are aware, the Good Friday Agreement which was overwhelmingly endorsed in concurrent referenda, retains the democratic legitimacy of the people of Ireland North and South.  The agreement contains within it a mechanism to bring about Irish unification through a border poll.  Critics of unification tell us that a Border poll would be too divisive but referendums by their very nature are divisive.  Partition by its very definition is divisive.<br/><br/>Critics of unification tell us now is not the right time, yet the constitutional tectonic plates are clearly shifting.  As Mr. McArt outlined, the recent census figures in the North provide the latest indicator of a constitutional trajectory that is gaining momentum.  With the loss of a Protestant majority, the Northern polity has now lost its <i>raison d'etre</i>forever.  Now is absolutely the right time to begin preparations for the border poll and righting the historic wrong of partition.  <br/><br/>There is an onus on the Irish Government to begin detailed preparations.  As I suggested in my submission, such preparations should be carried out by a fully resourced ministry for unification to bring forward detailed plans based on the latest data.  It is also essential the widest possible views are considered in the planning process through a fully representative all-island citizens' assembly.  The building of a new society must be based on robust human rights standards.  Any new Ireland must be based on the principles of equality and fairness.<br/><br/>James Connolly viewed Irish history as three eras, which he metaphorically referred to as pictures.  The first was pre-conquest Ireland.  The second picture was Ireland under conquest.  The third was &quot;the re-conquest by the people of Ireland of their own country&quot;.  We have a blank canvas before us and an opportunity to create a new country in a spirit of generosity and based on the principles of equality and fairness and a society that moves us all forward in confidence and hope.  As Connolly continued:</p> <blockquote> 	The third picture must be drawn by each, as it suits his or her fancy, who wishes to visualise to the mind&rsquo;s eye the complete reversal of all that was [constructed] in the second.  As they construct that picture of the future, so they will shape their public actions. </blockquote> <p>May this session today advance the shaping of our collective public actions and the creation of that third picture.</p></speech>

I was the best man at this Orangeman's wedding 15 years later.</p> <p>  In my submission I raised concerns about ramming a tricolour down the throats of unionists.  In the context of this submission I have some suggestions that might help to alleviate these concerns.  Vast quantities of money must be pumped into impoverished areas to pacify some of the more extreme elements within the Six Counties.  The right of people within the Six Counties to call themselves British and to be legally entitled to a British passport must be copper-fastened and enshrined in any new Ireland.  Constitutional protections for unionists and their culture are vital.  As has already been touched on, we must forego the national flag in Ireland, which will be a bitter pill for many republicans to swallow.  In the event of a new Ireland, some kind of temporary joint rule would be necessary to demonstrate to unionists that we are not the great bogeymen who seek to destroy everything they hold dear.</p> <p>  Some of these suggestions will no doubt be anathema to many traditional republicans but the very utterance of the words "united Ireland" are abhorrent to many unionists.  Ultimately, in this great fire-dance of nationhood, we can only hope economics will trump political ideology, compromise will trump dogmatism and empathy will trump small-minded egoism.  Finally, I encourage people here to go out and talk to somebody from the other side, rather than living in the echo chamber of their own minds, which this forum could be considered to be.</p></speech>

Most proposals for a border poll as it is commonly understood, will run into a kind of constitutional trilemma, which is that unionists will not help to design their own downfall, nationalists cannot deliver an inclusive settlement without unionist input and Brexit has taught us to never vote on anything before we know all of the details in advance.  Any grand plan for unity I have read has always fallen short of one of these requirements and this problem is fundamentally unsolvable.  We have to work around it instead.  </p> <p>  The workaround is to treat unity as an ongoing process, rather than as a singular event at some point in the future.  This means we need to make many changes within the constitutional system we already have, well in advance of any poll or even if a poll is never called, as well as deferring many of the difficult changes until afterwards, when we can get more input from people who perhaps voted no on the initial question.</p><p>The border poll will be a critical step in the process but it is a relatively small one compared with the other things that will take place around it.</p><p> It is incumbent on the Republic to make itself compatible with unity in advance.  It should perhaps even do so unilaterally, if necessary, because getting things done in Northern Ireland is more difficult than it is here.  This means eliminating practical impediments to unity and, more importantly, eliminating perceived barriers to the inclusion of non-nationalists in any future conversations.  Many people in Northern Ireland, not just unionists, look across the Border at the Republic and at Dublin and they do not necessarily have animosity towards it but they do not see themselves reflected in it; they see something that is other.  That needs to change in advance of any talk about constitutional change and a Border poll.  We need to move beyond a narrow transactional relationship between North and South and between unionists and nationalists.  We need to think in terms of generosity and about being generous towards each other.  This is enshrined in law in the North, where it is required to demonstrate parity of esteem between traditions.  That was all part of the settlement of the Good Friday Agreement.  This is not necessarily a requirement in the Republic, but the Republic should voluntarily introduce parity of esteem with unionism.  That would be a valuable contribution to reconciliation.  Then, if a Border poll does or does not happen, it would just change relationships that have already been built and rebalance things rather than being a full new constitution in one go.  Afterwards, we can have the long-term discussions about what kind of constitutional future we want to build.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.153" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emma DeSouza" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#FF00200"><p>It is a pleasure to be here.  Brexit has fundamentally changed the political landscape across this island and has significantly brought forward the prospect of constitutional change.  We, as an island and a as people, are anything but prepared for where that change may take us.  We have no way of anticipating when a Border poll could be called, nor do we know how much time might pass between the calling of a vote and the holding of a referendum.  That is why it is so important that work be done now to prepare.</p> <p>  In my submission, I focused on five key areas, namely, education, political institutions, civic dialogue, voting rights and citizenship legislation.  I made several recommendations on actions to be taken before and after a vote.  For the purposes of this statement, I want to focus primarily on what can be done now.</p> <p>  On civic dialogue, there is a real and pressing need for more spaces and structures for dialogue across this island.  In Ireland, as many have noted already, the citizens' assemblies have proven effective at making the case for progressive change but no comparable structure exists in the North.  The Civic Forum for Northern Ireland, outlined within the text of the Good Friday Agreement, was to be a structure for engagement, intended to foster better understanding between communities and act as a much-needed bridge between Northern Ireland's combative politics and its citizens.  However, it was disbanded after only two years.  It would seem perfectly reasonable and rational to reform the Civic Forum for Northern Ireland, in tandem with an all-island citizens' assembly, in 2023, the year of the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  The fateful reformation of the Civic Forum for Northern Ireland could provide a space to discuss the many social, economic and cultural issues affecting the region.  The benefits of meaningful engagement and public consultation cannot be understated.  When it comes to political institutions and participation, I recommend to the committee that an effort be made in the here and now to increase the number of northern voices in Dublin.  Three seats should be reserved for Northern Ireland in the Taoiseach's nominations to the Seanad, one for each of the dominant traditions.  Additionally, political parties should make an effort, in the event of any by-elections, to seek out northern candidates.</p> <p>  On future planning in the event of constitutional change, I have suggested that a transition period be established and that Stormont, as it is now in devolution, end with reunification.  In an effort to decentralise, the Chamber should be split between Dublin and Belfast.  In terms of inclusion of marginalised communities, I have suggested a unionist panel in the Seanad and the bedding in of using the Taoiseach's nominations to increase diversity and representation.</p> <p>  It will surprise few that I included citizenship legislation in my submission, given my experience.  While our case resulted in significant changes to UK immigration law, gaps in legislation remain.  Action has to be taken in advance of constitutional change in order to legally protect citizenship entitlements.  These changes are not just to protect Irish citizens but also British citizens.  Without intervention, British citizenship entitlements would become vulnerable after just one generation.</p> <p>  I have a particular interest in education because the merging of two education systems would present an opportunity to collate best practice and, importantly, would enable a full-scale modernisation of the education system and curriculum.  The North has one of the most segregated education systems in Europe, with 93% of schools remaining divided on religious lines.  In the South, religion still plays an overbearing role in the education system.  Education across the island has diverged significantly since partition, with disparities in school structures, teacher's pay, school governance and assessment.  Considerable work would be required to create an all-island education system.</p></speech>

The decade of centenaries in Ireland has been an important period in our lives as historians.  It has been a time of cultural reflection and of historical events that need to be reviewed.  There have been commemorations for the Ulster Covenant, the First World War, the Easter Rising, the 1918 general election and, last year, the establishment of Northern Ireland.  However, there have been some centenaries that have gone or will go unnoticed.  In 2020, it was marked how more than 100 years ago the Protestant associations of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan were established.  Originally they derived from the former unionist associations.  Once they knew their counties would not be allocated to Northern Ireland, they refocused themselves from unionist interests to protecting Protestant interests.  In 1920 they were defensive organisations to bring local Protestant militias together to protect themselves from IRA and bandit raids.  Following the War of Independence, protecting Protestant interests took on a new meaning as these associations wanted to give their communities a voice in the Irish Free State.  Next year will mark the centenary of when these associations, for the first time, stood a candidate in the 1923 general election.  These associations would continue standing candidates for general elections until 1961, and up to 2004 for local elections.  This was well into the 21st century and spanned four generations of the Protestant community being involved in these associations.  The last Protestant association meeting that was ever held was in Clones in 2016, the same year this capital was the centre of the commemorations for the Easter Rising.</p> <p>  The Northern Irish census, as many have put it, has recently announced a Catholic majority for the first time in centuries  in Northern Ireland.  Combined with the recent historic electoral victory for Sinn F&eacute;in in Stormont, there are many who have the view that a Border poll will occur soon.  Even if a united Ireland was to happen, Dublin must realise that the unionist community will not simply disappear.  It will evolve and its unique sense of a cultural and political identity and attitude may be present in another 100 years even, just as the Ulster unionists in the Border counties had done.  When learning of the experiences of these Protestant associations, the same mistakes may not be repeated.  The Newtowncunningham Community Outreach Project recommends and implores this committee that a federal constitution must be established in the event of a united Ireland to allow the people of Northern Ireland limited self-governance to allow all local voices to be heard: unionist; Northern Irish nationalist; and other.  The right of dual identity and citizenship should be maintained and widened across Ireland.  Article 8 of the Constitution should be amended to allow Ulster Scots to be recognised as the third language of Ireland following Irish and English respectively.</p><p>Though it is not our constitutional recommendation, I agree with Seamus that joining the commonwealth of nations would be a good conciliation to unionists in the North.  Ulster unionists would have to evolve, whether they like it or not, in the event of a united Ireland but in what manner depends on the grievances they have.  Trying to remove their voice, as some in the Border counties believe has happened to Protestant associations, would just lead to hardship, unrest and an inevitable failure to create a truly united tricolour nation.  If so, a future centenary on unification will come in 100 years' time but will not be fully commemorated by all in Ireland as it will bring up uncomfortable memories, old grievances and dig up old wounds and questions that many would like to keep buried and forgotten, just like the centenary of the Irish Civil War this year.</p></speech>

That is a very important note to end our submissions on, in terms of learning the lessons from the past and using those lessons in relation to the journey going forward.  Thank you for sending in your submission, which I found very interesting and informative on a little-known part of Irish history that is well worth being highlighted here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

As I said previously, I really want us to produce a report at the end of this process that outlines the options for a pathway to bring this forward.</p> <p>  I thank Seamus for his submission.  When I read it, it pressed so many buttons for me and it did so again today because it reminds me why the Good Friday Agreement is so important.  It reminds me why we champion it so much and it reminds us all why we are here.  Andrew reminded us why it is such an achievement because it manages to square the circle and here we are again, trying to square the circle.  I am interested in looking at a system that accommodates as much as possible in both the outcome and the process.  </p> <p>  Mention was made of generosity and the need to compromise.  Everyone is going to have to compromise if we are going to arrive at a vision.  We have focused a great deal on unionism and its compromises.  How much are republicans going to compromise?  I really want to hear about that, because I cannot help but think we are asking unionists to come and participate in a new system - and I do not mean this in a combative way - but Sinn F&eacute;in is not participating at Westminster, and that is part of this as well.  I would love to hear our guests' thoughts about that.  Who is willing to compromise?  This is about a multiplicity of identities.  I always use the word pluralism but our guests have introduced me to a new term today.  I thank them for echoing all of that today.</p></speech>

These will probably be my final remarks for today.  Senator Currie makes an important point in reminding us that this is going to culminate in a report which is as much our guests' as it is ours.  That is the strength of this process.  We wanted to play our role as a political institution but also as an institution that has previously - and, indeed, currently - benefited from being nationally representative, in the sense of representing Ireland in its entirety in its own modest way.  It still has a bit to go yet but nevertheless, it is an important aspect of the Seanad.</p> <p>  I want to take the opportunity to thank everyone for their submissions and contributions.  I reiterate what Senator Black said.  I encourage everyone to go back and listen to the contributions of the young people this morning.  They were really good, as were the contributions this afternoon.  We all accept and agree that on this issue, there will have to be compromise.  I remember many years ago when I was elected Lord Mayor of Belfast, one of the first visits I made was to my old secondary school.  A teacher there who had taught me in primary three and primary four of the bunscoil and had taught me all the way through secondary school from the beginning to the end had his own views on the constitutional question.  I remember that he gave me a hurl to put into the mayor's parlour.  Written on it, as Gaeilge was "an crann nach l&uacute;bann, brisfidh s&eacute;", which means "the tree that does not bend, breaks".  We all have a bit to go in terms of compromise and understanding each other and the Seanad has a good role, through this committee, in facilitating some of that discussion and helping to inform going forward.  I do not want anybody to get the false impression that this is a citizens' assembly.  We are trying to play a role in contributing to the larger debate.  We are really strengthened in doing so as a result of our guests' input, no matter where they are coming from and no matter what their submissions.  Obviously, not everyone who made a submission will have the opportunity to come into the Chamber and present, but we are very grateful for all them.  I genuinely hope it goes some modest way in helping to inform the debate going forward.</p></speech>

As I said at the start, this is very much a listening exercise for  us.  When I agreed to be part of this committee, we were told that there would be a report at the end of it but all reports are only as good as the people that participate in their making.  Today has been a great start for us in that sense and the next couple of sessions promise to be very good.  The message we would like to send is that we want this report to be inclusive.  We want all voices to be heard.  We want all traditions and those of no tradition to be part of the report.  That is the message that we want to send out today.  We need everybody to contribute.  We are using the power of the Seanad to ensure that preparation - the one word that has been repeated again and again today - starts for what this island will look like in ten, 15, 20 or 50 years' time.</p> <p>  I have listened to many of the contributors talking about winning the consent of both traditions and how important that is, as well as how important it is to listen.  That is the most important thing that we, as a committee, can do.  Seamus's story - and so many stories like it - is brilliant.  It is about the helping hand that we have had from each side of the divide.  I have heard so many stories like that over the years.  Seamus's story has brought that home to us again.  We need to tell that story again.  Nobody needs to be afraid.  There is a helping hand for everyone.  That is what the Irish people do well.  We do well in giving a helping hand.  That is what this committee is about.  That is what we are trying to do here, in terms of listening and preparing a report.</p> <p>  I did not come in earlier when Campbell mentioned religious influence.  Emma spoke about it too.  Campbell had not met anyone from a different religion until he was 16 years of age.  That needs to change, and change quickly.  Many parties and individuals are talking about such change but it will require momentum from us all and from all political institutions on this island.  We need to have that conversation quickly.  That is a very important point that I have noted today.</p> <p>  I thank the Cathaoirleach for facilitating this meeting.  It has been a great start and bodes well for where we need to go.  We are going to prepare a report and we hope that report will be influential but most importantly, inclusive.</p></speech>

I thank everybody who came in today.  I thank them for giving us their time and for making their submissions.  I also thank everyone who sent in a submission.</p><p>There were more than 100.  This work that the Seanad is doing is vital.  I did not think too much about it until I was sitting here this morning listening to the young people.  I knew it would be good, but listening to the witnesses before us now as well as the young people earlier has been a wonderful experience.  All I want is to hear everyone's voice and what people's opinions are.  We all want that.  The Chairman has driven this process.  We only do four sessions.  Unfortunately, we did not get to hear everyone's submission, which I would have loved.  Perhaps we should consider having an ongoing Seanad Public Consultation Committee so that we can hear as many voices as we can.</p><p> I am sorry that I missed some of the presentations, but I had to step out.  I am not sure if I am allowed to ask questions, but I wanted to ask Ms DeSouza about her idea concerning having more unionist voices in the Chamber.  That would be vital.  What would she envision the potential benefits and pitfalls of that being?  I will look back on the presentations when I get home today.</p></speech>

The Senator wrote an article and was then quoted by the former Supreme Court judge, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, in our launch of Seanad 100 this week on Northern voices.  His article was on the different constructs and ideas that he has articulated today.  It is fortunate that he has been able to attend.  He is not a formal member of the committee, but is substituting for Senator Boyhan.  I thank Senator McDowell and everyone else for their contributions.</p> <p>  A point made by Mr. Beckton that, as far as I know, had never been made before had to do with the idea of extending the idea of British citizenship across the Border.  We talk about it as being within Northern Ireland, but Mr. Beckton pointed out that there were many people on the southern side of the Border who remained British.  They were no longer unionist because they were on the far side of the Border but, despite still feeling British, they had been denied that opportunity.  It was an interesting idea.</p></speech>

He was a unionist who was elected in a by-election to the House.  Unfortunately, he was not reappointed.  He was on our Brexit committee and he invited us to Belfast to interact with a large cross-section of social and economic groupings.  He brought us to Stormont.  I remember sitting in its Senate chamber, which is now empty and only ever used for committee meetings.  It occurs to me that, if changes in architecture in Northern Ireland are going to happen, something equivalent or similar to a forum of some kind could be re-established as part of that architecture.  I would be interested in hearing witnesses' reactions to this suggestion.</p><p>Since I am not a member of this committee and will not be involved in drafting the report, I appeal to its members.  They may have their preferences.  Some may have a unitary state radical republican perspective, others may have a different perspective, but I appeal to them not to close any door, but to leave every option open.  I noted that, on the spectrum from Deputy McDonald to the T&aacute;naiste, both have stated in their own way that they are open to a confederal model.  This is not an opportunity to make &quot;the best&quot; the only option as far as anyone is concerned, but to leave open options and see whether we can engender a debate.  When there was a proposal to abolish the Seanad, the slogan of the people who opposed abolition was &quot;Open Seanad &Eacute;ireann, Don't Close It&quot;.  That is the point - we need to be more open and leave options open rather than being prescriptive.</p></speech>

If 50% plus one is enough to keep the union, how do we sell it to nationalists that 50% plus one is not enough for unity?

I agree with the previous speakers, in that we cannot enter into the process that we are discussing with any prescriptive or predefined ideas about what the outcomes will be.  According to an online Ireland's Future event held in January, a journalist, Ms Aoife Moore, submitted a freedom of information request to the Department of Justice.  What she found out was that no contingency plan whatsoever had been made by this Government for a border poll or eventual unification.  However, it did have a contingency plan for Scottish independence.  There is something fundamentally wrong with that approach.  It is incumbent on the Irish Government to start detailed planning now based on evidence, academia, as many different voices as possible and expert analysis.</p></speech>

We have to be tentative around figures like that.  There should be some kind of temporary joint rule system to assuage some of the fears of unionists.  I know that sounds undemocratic but the inauguration of the Irish State was undemocratic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.177" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#HH01000"><p>I will pick up on the point about 50% plus one.  The legal test has to be 50% plus one.  There is no way that, if a referendum is called, there is a 50% plus one result but it does not pass.  We have more choice in our timing, though.  We do not have to call a referendum right now when we think we will get 50% plus one.  As many have pointed out, if we are looking at the direction of travel, once public opinion shifts, it is unlikely to shift back.</p><p>I do not think there is any danger in taking a little bit of time to do things right and get it done properly.  I agree with all the others who said that the bigger the majority in favour, the better.  While 50% plus one is legal, 60% or 70% would be much healthier for building a stable democracy in the future. </p><p> Senator Currie asked about what compromises republicanism could make because we always ask about unionism making compromises.  That is the difficult question and I do not have an easy answer for it.  Unionists will be upfront and state that they do not want anything from republicanism - they just want to be left alone to live their lives and stop having to worry about constant compromise and change.  That is a feature of unionism and has been since it was founded.  On the other hand, republicanism, because it is the agent asking for change, has to be the one that makes the proposal.  If you are asking somebody for something, you have to offer them something.  I do not think the public mood is quite there yet.  I read an article in one of the newspapers recently arguing that the Republic is not ready for unity.  Part of that is the lack of conversation in wider society.  There has been a lot of conversation in forums like this and lots of academic studies done and books published.  Richard Humphreys' book in particular is essential reading for anybody who wants to get into the nitty-gritty of how unification might actually happen in practice.  The general public are still not quite thinking about it, or at least not thinking in terms of what price we are going to have to pay for unification.  From that point of view we are still a good way off. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.179" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emma DeSouza" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#JJ00200"><p>I will just pick up on that point about compromise and the changes that would have to be made.  Constitutional change cannot just be about the South subsuming the North.  It will require significant and substantive changes to the State.  It will require a new education system, a new healthcare system and hopefully more infrastructure in Border counties like Fermanagh.  It will require completely changing the State.  There are lots of positive cases for why that is a good thing, for a more inclusive State.</p> <p>  To pick up on Senator Black's point about the unionist panel, that is about ensuring inclusivity and that the voices of the unionist community are heard.  This House can be an excellent Chamber for communities that are marginalised.  The pitfall of expanding the concept of a unionist panel out to something more, like a Cabinet position, for example, is that it risks placing unionism above other marginalised communities.  It is important to remember in this conversation that there are other minorities that are not being heard and need to be accounted for as well.</p> <p>  We are talking about identity a lot in here today.  I would caution against a binary British-and-Irish or unionist-and-nationalist narrative or thinking around the North.  I am known for being an Irish citizen who took the British Government to court over my right to be accepted as Irish but within my own family there are those who have a British identity, an Irish identity, and both.  My father is a British army sergeant and my mother is Irish.  I was raised in British army camps when I was younger and I have been raised to have my own viewpoints on being an Irish citizen.  I have never described myself as a nationalist.  I am a humanist, an internationalist and a social democrat.  I did not always aspire to a united Ireland but I do now.  Increasingly, there are more and more people coming to that thinking too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-30a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Samuel Beckton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2022093000002#JJ00300"><p>As the Cathaoirleach pointed out, passports and citizenship would have to be extended across the island of Ireland.  In a united Ireland, if that right of the Good Friday Agreement just stayed in the North, then there would be a double standard in place, whereby if someone were in the North it is fine but if they were in the South it is not.  If that was extended throughout the island of Ireland it would at least allow for all cultures to be accepted across this island.</p> <p>  We have been talking about the future.  Opinion polls are changing but I have to caution the committee.  The next decade of centenaries that is coming in 20 years, in 2039 to 2049, will be another time of historical reflection around the Second World War and the creation of the Irish Republic.  At that time, divides will be felt again, particularly as the North participated in the Second World War but the South did not.  All the policies and the suffering the North went through, especially the Belfast blitz, will be remembered again and those in the South will not be able to understand the suffering they went through.  Some in the South did come up to help, such as the brave firemen of the Dublin Fire Brigade who helped with the Belfast blitz.  Many others joined the British or Allied armed forces and when they went back South at the end of the war they were treated horribly.  We have had recollections of that but how do we commemorate those events in a united Ireland?  Will the North be allowed to commemorate such events while the South stays quiet?  Sometimes we really need to look at history.</p> <p>  It is the same when we talk about unionists in the Seanad.  It is important for all views to be recognised but we should remember the likes of William Sheldon or John Copeland Cole from the Border counties.  Though they could not contest their seats because of changes in the 1961 electoral Act, they were allowed for a few electoral seasons to be Members of this fine House, the Seanad.  There is a problem in that there is an element of tokenism there that can take away communities' idea of self-respect.  Here is a question.  How long will that go on for in a united Ireland?  Will unionists have a token seat in ten years, 20 years, and so on?  How long will people be allowed to have that right before it is gone?  That happened with the unionist seats when Ireland was first established and unionists were in the Seanad, before it was abolished in the 1930s.  While history is a far different cry, it does have a tendency to accidentally repeat itself if we do not learn from it properly.</p></speech>

It is about learning from the mistakes of the past and from history and preventing it repeating itself.  It reminds me of S&eacute;amus Heaney's "hope and history rhyme".  The only thing we can hope for is that in some instances history does not repeat itself.  That is why we are here, to listen to all the voices and learn from those like Mr. Beckton who have looked at what went on in the past and what should not have happened and try to learn from those mistakes.</p> <p>  Mr. Paisley has sent his apologies.  He wanted to stay for the entire session but unfortunately his line broke down.  He wanted to stay for all the contributions but they have all been recorded and will be broadcast again on Oireachtas TV.  The session was also carried live on Oireachtas TV and is available on the website.</p> <p>  As we have a few minutes left, I will allow Senators in to say a few last words.</p></speech>

I have two points.  On the issue of fear and concerns, the fibre of my political being is about constitutional change and Irish unity.  I am unapologetic about that.  However, I understand entirely that there are fears out there.  That said, I do not think anyone's fear should trump anyone's aspirations and I do not think anyone's aspirations should negate anyone's fears.  I live in, come from and have had the privilege of representing a part of Belfast which, when there has been any kind of political destabilisation within unionism or loyalism, has been the first to feel the whiplash of that.  I am acutely aware of what people's fears mean.</p><p>I do not say that to be glib and I mean it sincerely.</p><p> The other point is one I make in this Chamber regularly.  Again, I do not want to say it in a combative way but the compromise was the Good Friday Agreement and we all compromised on the Good Friday Agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement does not settle the constitutional question; it asks us the constitutional question.  We all agreed to that, North and South.  That premise, the same spirit that led to the dialogue around that agreement and the same inclusivity should steer this conversation for everyone, no matter where they fall down on the question itself.  I thank everybody who attended.</p></speech>

We read the submissions, went through them and decided who was coming, but it was the Cathaoirleach who made sure this room worked today, and we are very appreciative of that.  I do not think the Good Friday Agreement asked the constitutional question; I think it left it open-ended.  I believe the values that underpin it are compromise, generosity, partnership, inclusion and reconciliation, and of all the words I would like to end on today, it is &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo;.</p></speech>

I had great conversations with Mike Nesbitt, who said that true reconciliation means giving up all hope of a better past.  The idea here is to build a better future.  I thank all of those present for being part of that discussion about a better future.  Wherever we all are in 100 years time, I hope we are all in heaven and that the people who are sitting in these Chambers and living on these islands are living in a better future.  That is all we can hope for, and that is part of this discussion and this conversation.  I thank you for being part of it.  We will present a full copy of the report to all of you.
