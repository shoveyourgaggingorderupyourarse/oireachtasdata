    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022022300002#A00200"><p>I thank members and witnesses for participating in today's meeting.  I remind members that they are required to participate in the meeting either within the committee room or remotely from within the Leinster House complex.  Should a division occur, any members participating remotely will be required to make their way to the meeting room within the normal division time to vote before returning to their original location.  The proceedings of Oireachtas committees are now conducted without the requirement for social distancing, with normal capacity in committee rooms restored.  However, committees are taking a graduated approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online, through Microsoft Teams.  All those attending the committee room and its environs should continue to wear masks throughout the meeting.  They may only be removed when addressing the committee.  Members should continue to wash their hands, avail of sanitiser outside and inside the committee room, be respectful of other people's physical space, and practise good respiratory etiquette.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Those with any Covid symptoms, no matter how mild, should not attend.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputy Matt Shanahan.</p> <p>  As normal, all documentation for the meeting has been circulated on Microsoft Teams.  The meeting has been convened to consider the Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill 2022, which was referred to the select committee by the order of the D&aacute;il on 3 February 2022.  This short and technical Bill will resolve an issue arising regarding some employees who were laid off when Covid-19 restrictions were in place or who may be laid off over the next three-year period.  Periods spent laid-off within the final three years of an employee's service do not count as reckonable service for the purposes of statutory redundancy payments.  This means that a person who was laid off because of essential Covid-19-related restrictions will not have that period counted as reckonable service if he or she is made redundant within three years of the end of the emergency period.  This Bill addresses that issue.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Damien English, who is accompanied by officials from his Department.  Would the Minister of State like to make a short comment on the Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022022300002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chair and other members for facilitating this Bill.  We are in a position to move it through Committee Stage today, all going well.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill.  The Bill provides for a payment from the State which will ensure that workers being made redundant will receive the same statutory redundancy payment as if they had not been laid off due to Covid-19 restrictions.  Under existing redundancy provisions, a period of lay-off within the final three years of service before a worker is made redundant is not allowable as reckonable service.  Therefore, the lay-off period is not counted towards a worker&rsquo;s statutory redundancy payment.</p> <p>  Due to the necessary Government decisions to close and restrict certain sectors of our economy, some workers lost the opportunity to accrue reckonable service.  This Bill will provide for a Covid-19-related lay-off payment from the State which, in the event of the worker&rsquo;s redundancy, will cover lay-off periods due to Covid-19 restrictions.  Payments will be made from the Social Insurance Fund.  A worker does not have to have been in receipt of any form of State payment during the lay-off period.  The criteria are simply that the person qualifies for redundancy in the usual way and was laid off because of Covid-19 restrictions.</p> <p>  The amount eligible workers will receive will depend on the length of time they were placed on lay-off due to Covid-19 before the date they were made redundant.  The Bill does not change the fact that employers are obliged to pay statutory redundancy, which excludes lay-off periods in the final three years of employment, to eligible workers.  However, employers will not be liable for this additional payment.  The Covid restrictions which caused lay-off situations were completely outside the employers&rsquo; and employees' control.  Imposing this cost on employers would be unfair.  It would also conflict with wider Government policy, which, since the start of the pandemic, has been to minimise financial hardship on businesses and workers during the most challenging of times in order to protect those jobs.</p> <p>  This Bill provides the best outcome for both employers and workers.  It will provide the legislative basis for the Department of Social Protection to process applications and make this payment to workers as soon as possible.  It will be an employer-led online application process in the first instance.  This is the most efficient approach from a customer service perspective.  However, in the event an employer fails to make an application, I assure the committee that manual applications from workers will be accepted and they will not lose out.</p> <p>  Intensive work is ongoing on the development of the necessary systems, which was raised on Second Stage.  I confirm that officials in the Department of Social Protection expect to open the application process during quarter 2 of this year.  It will be in a position to do that in the next couple of weeks.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and her officials for their important work on this.  I thank Deputies for their contributions on the Bill on the previous stage.  I look forward to today's discussion.  One of the major changes that people asked is in amendment No. 4, which extends the timeline.  I am conscious that Members raised that.  There was unanimous support for this change.  I hope, if the committee accepts the amendment, that it will deal with the issue.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 9 to 15, inclusive, and 22, tabled by Deputy Louise O'Reilly, are out of order.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 16 to 18, inclusive, tabled by Deputies Paul Murphy, Br&iacute;d Smith, Richard Boyd Barrett and Gino Kenny must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 187(1) as they are not relevant to the provisions of the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 10, 13 and 14, tabled by Deputy Louise O'Reilly, must also be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 212(3), as they have the potential to impose a charge on the Exchequer.  Amendment No. 5, tabled by Deputies Paul Murphy, Br&iacute;d Smith, Richard Boyd Barrett and Gino Kenny must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 212(3), as it has the potential to impose a charge on the Exchequer.</p><p>The remaining amendments will be considered at today's meeting and groupings apply to amendments Nos. 4, 6 and 7 and Nos. 8 and 19 to 21, inclusive.  I propose we try to complete our Committee Stage consideration of this Bill today.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Does anyone want to come in there?  Deputy O'Reilly wishes to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022022300002#B00200"><p>Some days you get lucky with amendments and some days you do not.  All of mine have been ruled out of order but I want to speak broadly, if I can, to the intention of those amendments.  I understand we cannot get into the substance of them and I do not intend to do that.  The amendments had a single purpose, namely, to deal with the issue of tactical insolvencies.  I fully accept that is not within the scope of this Bill.  Maybe the Minister of State will take a little time to update us on the plan for the action on collective redundancies following insolvency.  I am aware there is some work under way on that.  I got that in a reply to a parliamentary question and it would be helpful if we could hear that.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is well aware of the issue.  We saw Clerys broken into two companies.  One was the operations and the other was employing the workers.  They never knew they were working for two separate companies.  They only knew they were working for Clerys, which many of them had worked for all their lives and given good and loyal service to.  Then overnight their jobs were gone.  The assets were transferred to the operations company, that was liquidated and the workers were left absolutely high and dry.  A similar but not exactly the same situation happened in Debenhams, but whatever the technicalities of it the upshot is the workers were left high and dry at the end of it.  We saw it with Clerys, La Senza, Paris Bakery and TalkTalk.  They are what are known as tactical insolvencies.  The purpose of the amendments I put forward were to deal with tactical insolvencies and situations whereby companies use the courts to engage in a tactical liquidation.  That means they can avoid paying what are, essentially, their debts.</p> <p>  This legislation recognises the fact that, through no fault of their own, workers found themselves on lay-off and they should not find themselves disproportionately impacted by something that was not their fault.  Likewise, in the situation of a tactical insolvency, workers who have given good and loyal service find themselves in a situation whereby the company goes out of business and they are left with absolutely nothing.  The majority of companies do not engage in this practice but legislation is required for those that do.  They are only small in number and I would not want to portray this is as all workers being in danger of this happening to them.  However, when it happens it is absolutely devastating.  The Minister of State will know this because he has met the workers from Debenhams and some of these other companies.  He knows what needs to be done.  Many of these cases end up being high-profile because the practice is quite shocking to people.  They find themselves in a state of shock.</p> <p>  I appreciate my amendments have been ruled out of order.  However, the Minister of State might take this opportunity to advise us about it.  According to the reply to a parliamentary question I tabled: "Work has ... commenced on the drafting of the Terms of Reference for the Employment Law Review Group ...".  That is to organise the membership.   The reply states the group hopes to be up and running "on a non-statutory basis, in Q1 of 2022".  We are heading into the last month of that quarter.  I apologise as I appreciate this parliamentary question does not relate directly to the legislation but it is in the general area of redundancy.  I ask that the Minister of State provide an update.  If he cannot, a response in writing would be good.  We all had huge sympathy for the workers from Debehams and we all saw what happened.  When we looked back we saw that was a repetition of similar - not exactly the same, but similar - situations in other companies.  As we move out of the pandemic, if there is going to be any pandemic dividend this must be part of it.  Work on tactical insolvencies and collective redundancies must be part of the pandemic dividend, if you want to call it that.  It should not have taken a pandemic to put it on the agenda but the workers deserve nothing less than that.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022022300002#B00300"><p>The Deputy will appreciate I am not going to go through every amendment that was disallowed.  They are not related to this Bill but I appreciate why she wants to bring them up and have them discussed.  I would be happy to return at a later stage to do that.</p> <p>  When I was at the committee discussing the Duffy Cahill report, I outlined our issues with that report and also outlined the changes we were bringing into place on that.  I committed I would return to the committee at a time that suited members.  When the committee has completed its own report on that I will be happy to look at that too and go through it with members.  I have not yet got it on my desk - maybe I have missed it or something like that - but I am happy to discuss it with the committee whenever that arises.  I will given an update on the plan of action following our report on that.  To be very clear, while there are many differences of opinion around the Debenhams situation in here, I repeat that if anybody has any evidence that is different from what I have I would like to have it.  I have asked for that on a number of occasions at committee, in the D&aacute;il and so on.  I would be glad to get it at any stage in order to be able to review it.  It has not been so today but often with this discussion, what is said does not match up with the evidence.  We will of course take any new evidence and review that.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and I committed, when we met the Debenhams workers, to review the legislation in this area and, if we could at all, to strengthen the protections for anybody in that situation.  Nobody could have anything less than sympathy for anybody in that situation of redundancy.  We committed to doing that and as a result of that work there was a plan of action.  I do not have it with me but from memory I will give the committee the low-down on where it is at.  The employment law review group we have set up is being scoped at the moment.  It should be in a position to be able to discuss that with the committee here and bring it forward before the end of quarter 1 but certainly within quarter 2.  Quarter 1 was our aim and that work is ongoing with the membership and to have that set up and on a statutory basis.  We are pretty much on track to do that, be it at the end of quarter 1 or early quarter 2.  That will happen; it is a commitment that is there.  There have already been changes in the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, legislation that was brought forward.  That effected some of the changes that were recommended as well.  The Company Law Review Group, CLRG, has also completed its report into this very complex area.  That report was with the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, as of the end of 2021.  We will bring forward recommendations and changes out of that as well.  It will be published when it is appropriate.</p> <p>  Like the Deputy, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, notes the number of cases in this situation is limited.  There are some and there is no point in denying that but it is not the norm.  If we can strengthen that then of course we will but the ODCE points out again that there is already legislation in this situation already.  That confirms what we have said on numerous occasions.  It is there but is not always used and that is what we have had to discuss with the unions quite a lot, in order to see whether we can we make that more user-friendly and more available.  I am happy to debate that with members, and so will the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, when it is appropriate.  The handbook was published, I think, in December as well.  It is a very useful guide for employees, who might not always be aware of the situation or the laws.  It will help them with their work, with their representatives and with their unions as well.  That is a quick summary of that.  Again, it is an area we are very much committed to so I am happy, at a later stage, to discuss it again with the committee when it is appropriate to do so.</p></speech>

This reflected the situation at the time of publication, when restrictions were easing and the economy was reopening.  I think that was back in September 2021.  However, we all know we suffered a setback as a result of the Omicron variant and some restrictions were necessary during December 2021 and January 2022.  This particularly affected the entertainment and hospitality industries.  This was well flagged by Deputies in their contributions on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Therefore, to ensure that all periods of temporary lay-off due to Covid-19 restrictions are encompassed by this new payment, the amendment will extend the lay-off periods covered to 31 January 2022.  It also means the payment will apply to workers who are made redundant before 31 January 2025.  Those are the three years referenced earlier on.  This will increase the maximum any worker will receive to &euro;2,268 if he or she was on lay-off due to Covid-19 restrictions for the entire period between 13 March 2020 and 31 January 2022 and normally earned at least &euro;600 per week.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 provide for the deletion of the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; on two occasions where it occurs in this Bill.  This is not to downplay the emergency and exceptional nature of restrictions or the gravity of their effect.  It is because previous amendments to the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 refer to the &ldquo;emergency period&rdquo; in the particular context of section 12A.  Since the extension we are now proposing is no longer clearly linked to that specific timeframe, the deletion will avoid any ambiguity as to the period eligible to be covered by the Covid-19 lay-off payment.  The amendments here reflects the change we were looking at ourselves but also that members clearly raised a few weeks ago in the debate on Second Stage.</p><p>This amendment is appropriate and I recommend that members accept it. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022022300002#C00200"><p>I welcome that the issues raised are being addressed.  The extension, though, is to 31 January 2022.  There are still people who are laid off now.  Where will that leave them?  I refer to situations where it is necessary for people to have recognition of continuous service.  Where does this leave those people?  Even if we were sitting here and we were able to say that the pandemic is 100% over - and the Minister of State will be aware from listening to medics that they will never be able to say that, while we as lay people may be - there are still people who are temporarily laid-off as a result of Covid-19.  I wonder if it would not be prudent to extend this measure a little while.  Will we not have people going back to work who are only slightly outside the provisions?</p> <p>  Most people are, hopefully, going to be back in work and going back to where they were working.  A small number of people, however, are still laid-off today who would not be covered by this proposal, in the event that they find themselves in this situation when they go back.  Would it not be worthwhile, therefore, to have a short extension of this measure, not forever or indefinitely, to encompass a point - and I know we are not going to have anything stupid like a "Freedom Day" or anything like that - when all workers should have gone back to work, or else it can be assumed they will not be going back.  I am wondering how this proposal would work for those people who are still laid-off today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022022300002#C00300"><p>It is a fair question and observation.  The difficulty we have is that the legislation must be linked to the restrictions.  We are saying that lay-offs until 22 January 2022 are linked to Government restrictions.  They are not lay-offs because of Covid-19, but because of interventions by the Government which restricted businesses' ability to operate at full capacity.  Those restrictions have been fully removed since 22 January.  There are going to be ongoing issues relating to Covid-19 for God knows how many years in some sectors and some companies and there are other supports and initiatives which will see the Government step in.  Regarding this legislation and this link to Covid-19 restrictions, we had previously linked this to section 12A.  We extended that in tandem with the restrictions to 22 January.  I think it is a fair date; I am not sure how we could pick any other date or how that assessment could be made.</p> <p>  To be clear, then, the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that employees who were laid off due to Covid-19-related restrictions are not disadvantaged should they be made redundant.  Again, the State is taking up that cost.  I think we have made the best attempt to get this right and the Deputy will appreciate that, because I am not sure what other rationale we can work off, bar these measures being linked to restrictions.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022022300002#C00400"><p>I fully appreciate that, and I am not being argumentative.  I am simply asking about those people whose companies have not started back working yet.  The restrictions may have been lifted, but some companies are in the process of coming back into operation.  Supports are still in place for companies and for workers.  It strikes me that for as long as people are receiving a Covid-19-related benefit and are not in work, then that should be the mechanism by which it is judged.  I refer to the last Covid-19-related benefits being paid in the context where people want to go to work but cannot, and that that type of situation should be linked.  I appreciate that might be difficult to do.  There are people, however, who are in this type of situation.  The numbers might be small, but that was also true for the cases I highlighted.  It does not mean that the consequences have not been grave for each individual affected.</p> <p>  There must be a cut-off date, and I am not suggesting for a moment that this provision would be openended or indefinite at all.  I am only asking that consideration perhaps be given, not on this Stage, but when we are doing the final Stages, to those people who are currently laid off.  I refer to people who may be laidoff and on Covid-19-related benefits.  They should be encompassed by this legislation.  I think the numbers are small.  Again, I am not trying to say that these measures should be openended and last forever.  They should, however, last for the duration of the Covid-19 benefits because they are specifically linked to Covid-19 related lay-offs.  </p> <p>  We could find ourselves here in a year or two going back over the cases of people, a small number, who found themselves in difficulty regarding what might technically be considered a break in service.  People receiving a Covid-19-related benefit because they are not in work, who then go back to work and find themselves made redundant, will not have this period of service considered in the same way it was for everybody else.  It may be that this may not turn out to be an issue.  Hopefully, everyone will go back to work and find they will not need redundancy payments.  It strikes me, though, that a small number of people may end up in that situation and I ask that consideration be given to them.</p></speech>

As she said herself, none of us here could figure out what date to use for the ending of this measure or how we could judge that aspect.  The rationale the State has taken here is a pre-emptive one.  We recognise that neither employees nor employers are responsible for this situation.  The restrictions prevented people from working and they were temporarily laid off.  Section 12A prevented employees from triggering redundancies themselves.  That measure ended in September 2021, and it was the initial link with this legislation.</p> <p>  We have gone beyond that now in the last few months to try to include those impacted by the restrictions which remained in some sectors.  I do not think we can go beyond that, however, and I do not see how we could do so.  Since the lifting of restrictions, we have expected employers to make the relevant decisions that are right for their businesses, whether that is to bring their staff back to work or to make the difficult decision to make them redundant.  There will be fallout from the impact of Covid-19 well into the future.  Naturally, through all our Departments, but mainly through this Department's supports for businesses, the number of people affected by such decisions should not be high and we will do all we can to prevent people from losing their jobs and to protect those jobs.  </p> <p>  We have proven our intent in that regard.  This legislation goes as far as it can go and this amendment brings the situation not in line with the restrictions but beyond it.  It is a fair date to have picked.  I am not sure we can accommodate another.  I understand why the Deputy is asking the question and I accept it, but I do not know how we could accommodate her request or link any such provision to legislation in future.  We have made the best attempt here to get this right.  It means that anybody laid off because of restrictions the Government put in place is covered.  </p></speech>

I refer to any restrictions that could result in people being laid off having been lifted by 22 January 2022.  This legislation brings that date to 31 January 2022, well beyond it.  I think we are being very fair in our assessment and that we have got this right legally.  We made every effort to cover this situation.  It was drafted in conjunction with everyone on this committee.  We reflected on all those contributions on a previous Stage.  We got Cabinet agreement to go to the end of January and I think anybody would say this is now a fair assessment of the situation.  I do not see how it is possible to go beyond that, because it is linked to Government-imposed restrictions that resulted in lay-offs.</p></speech>

That Act passed all Stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas and was signed into law by the President on 22 December 2021.  The members of the committee will be familiar with the legislation and its content having considered it recently and they are supportive of its objective to establish the new corporate enforcement authority.  As the members are aware, the Act provides the legal framework to transform the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, into a stand-alone new authority.  </p><p>Simply put, section 11 incorrectly refers to Schedule 2, when it should refer to Schedule 1.  The Schedule itself provides for certain matters on the establishment of the new authority.  By way of example, these include that &quot;The Authority shall be a body corporate&quot;, with its name contained in the Constitution, &quot;with perpetual succession&quot; and a common seal.  It is important that we fix this error without undue delay to not hold up the next phase of the transformation of the ODCE into the new authority.  </p><p>Regarding the detail of the amendments, a new section 4 is inserted into the Bill that amends an incorrect reference to Schedule 2 by changing it to &quot;Schedule 1&quot;.</p><p>The new section 4 and the amendments to the consequently renumbered section 5 have been drafted to ensure that this section will commence automatically on the commencement of section 11 of the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Act 2021.  I would be grateful for the members' support in expediting this change.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee with regard to this legislation.  There was wide cross-party support for the need for this legislation during the Second Stage debate.</p> <p>  Essentially, the Bill aims to bring under the authorisation of the Central Bank financial products of which most people are very well aware and familiar with.  One such product, the personal contract plan, which many people have, is widely used in the motor trade area for financing car purchases.</p> <p>  The second concerns where people perhaps buy household appliances, be they refrigerators, sofas or televisions, in shops that have buy now, pay later schemes with which most people are also familiar.  Until now, however, they have not been authorised by the Central Bank.  In the interests of consumer protection, we want those types of products and their providers to be authorised by the Central Bank.  That is the essence of what we are doing today.  There are some amendments to be put through following on from our Second Stage debate.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State said, this is a Bill I support.  We hope the Minister of State will adopt an amendment later in terms of buy now, pay later schemes.  I welcome a late amendment from the Department of Finance with regard to bringing those types of products under the regulatory framework, which is really important.  I must say at the outset that it is a little bit frustrating that four years have passed.  It is four years or more since I called for regulations on personal contract plan products.  I engaged with the Central Bank and Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, at that point.  Indeed, the CCPC had issues and concerns about this for a number of years before that.</p> <p>  We need to find a way to be able to act faster regarding the regulation of financial products.  As the Minister of State indicated, there has been a massive increase in personal contract plans over the last number of years.  Many customers are not fully aware of what they are fully signing up to in terms of the lack of credit checks but also that they cannot sell their vehicle if they fall into financial difficulties.</p> <p>  We will have an added challenge in terms of personal contract plans with regard to the transition to electric vehicles, EV.  This very much needs to be carefully monitored and there is further work to be done.  Four years on, however, we are on Committee Stage and, as the Minister of State said, there is broad support for this Bill.</p> <p>  As I said, I welcome the fact that an amendment is coming in terms of purchase now, pay later schemes.  This is another area, particularly with Klarna entering the market here late last year, in which we see from other markets, particularly in Britain and elsewhere, that there has been an explosion of credit in the use of this facility.  Again, many people are not familiar with the impact this can have in terms of missing payments.  We will discuss that later but I broadly support the provisions of the Bill.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 amend section 2 of the Bill, which in turn provides for a number of amendments to section 28 of the Central Bank Act 1997.  This is an important section of the Act as it sets out the scope of the Central Bank regulated businesses, including the regulated business of retail credit firms and credit servicing firms.</p><p>The amendments are necessary because since the Bill was published in June of last year, section 28 of the Central Bank Act 1997 was subsequently amended by SI 561 of 2021, that is, the European Union (General Framework for Securitisation and Specific Framework for Simple, Transparent and Standardised Securitisation) (Amendment) Regulations 2021.  That statutory instrument was necessary to give full effect to the amended EU securitisation, that is, EU Regulation No. 2021/557, and the securitisation amendments of the capital markets security package.</p><p>If these two amendments are not accepted, it would essentially undo the changes to the Act which, as I already mentioned, were made last year by the statutory instrument.  The amendments provide that the passive securitisation vehicles, which falls within the scope of the amended EU securitisation regulation, will fall outside the scope of the requirement to be authorised as a credit servicing firm.</p><p>Essentially, a statutory instrument was necessary over the course of the last year since this Bill was published.  We need to include this here otherwise that will fall.  It is, therefore, almost a technical amendment.</p></speech>

Can the Minister of State clarify when this legislation will come into effect in all of its provisions, including, for example, the regulation of personal contract plans, requirement for credit checks and capping of annual percentage rate, APR, at a rate of 23%?  The Minister of State might outline that for us.</p></speech>

We want to do it as soon as possible.  As soon as the legislation is passed by the Oireachtas, we will immediately discuss with the Central Bank the timing of the commencement orders.  As we speak today, frankly, we do not have a date for the commencement orders of this section other than to say it will be done as quickly as possible, in consultation with the Central Bank, once it passes through the Oireachtas.  We do not have the commencement dates today.  All I am in a position to say is that it will be as soon as possible.</p></speech>

As I said, we have been calling for this for four years now.  Much work has been done and there have been many reports.  We had the Tutty and CCPC reports.  The Central Bank has been carrying out reports as far back as 2018.</p> <p>  Surely, as we are passing legislation, there is some understanding within the Department of Finance and Central Bank about when it might possibly come into effect.  There must be some understanding somewhere.  I appreciate the Minister of State may not have a specific date but does he expect that all provisions in this legislation will be enacted this year as a starting point?</p></speech>

There have been discussions with the Central Bank and no delays are envisaged.  Until it passes through the Oireachtas, however, we cannot tie that down.  The Bill passes from here to the Seanad and we hope it will be well cleared through the Oireachtas very soon.  The only commitment I can give is that I will be happy to come back and provide information on an exact timetable within six months of the passing of the legislation when the issue may well have already been dealt with.</p><p>However, I will not let it go for longer than six months from the passing of the legislation without a specific report back on the timetables.  Six months is reasonable.  I am just giving that commitment to the select committee.</p></speech>

As legislators who are asked to pass legislation that we support, it is reasonable that before this legislation is passed, we have an indicative timeframe as to when various sections will be commenced.  It would be quite normal to have that understanding.  While there might not be a specific date in the Bill, there would be an indication that it is envisaged that it would be in the third or fourth quarter of the year.  If possible, can the Minister of State obtain that information before Report Stage?</p></speech>

Is it envisaged that this will be annual occurrence?  What is the intention behind this?  This is enabling amendment to the existing legislation, but what is the intention behind it?  Is it that there will be an annual report?  I ask the Minister of State that while they may include statistics on where we are with personal contract plans, PCPs, and other relevant information, that the Central Bank should be asked to look at this market in the context of transition to electric vehicles as well.  As the Minister of State will know, there is a bill of payment that customers have to pay at the end.  If the value of the car drops because the market is not there, there could be concerns for providers and individuals who have availed of these contracts.  It is important that we have some analysis on it, given that this market is absolutely huge and is likely to continue to grow.  That needs to be looked at, particularly in view of where we need to go in terms of moving away from fossil fuels.</p></speech>

The section provides that the Minister for Finance may request that the Central Bank, using the powers under the Central Bank Act, to collect and publish information on credit hire purchase agreements, including PCPs and consumer hire agreements, or services provided by retail credit and credit servicing firms.  This will facilitate the publication of additional statistical data on the level of financial accommodation that is provided by the regulated businesses where the Minister considers that there is need for such additional data.  The Minister will use this power where there is a need to do so in consultation with the Central Bank.  The amendment will allow for a collection of publication of data either on a once-off or an ongoing basis, as provided in this section.  However, the amendment makes clear that this does not apply to personal data or to firm-specific data that is not otherwise relevant in the context of the provisions of section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942, which generally prohibits the disclosure of confidential information, except in specific circumstances.</p> <p>  The Minister has the power under this section either to request information on a once-off basis or on an ongoing basis where he or she feels there is a need to do so.  There may not be a need.  The Central Bank, separately under the legislation, can, on its own initiative, produce this report without a request from the Minister.  This means that the bank has the authority to do it under the legislation and the Minister has the authority to ask for a report if and when the need arises.  It could be more often than every six months, or it might not have to happen very often at all.  It is only when the Minister deems that a need arises.</p></speech>

Basically, people are not purchasing cars; they are hiring a service.  They do not own the cars and they never will own them unless they pay the bill of payment at the end of the contract.  There are a number of options at that point.  Given the size of this market, it is important to have some analysis.  Maybe there are no concerns at all.  Because we are trying to encourage more people to move to electric vehicles, however, the second-hand market for diesel and petrol vehicles will shrink.  As a result, an analysis of how this will market transition and where we want people to go is going to be important.</p></speech>

We all know that electric vehicles are substantially more expensive than other vehicles that are currently on the road.  Therefore, there will be a dual difficulty here.  People are going to want to change sooner in order to go carbon neutral and there is also the high cost of new cars.  I have not addressed that particular issue yet.  It may be something we can explore further on Report Stage.  I have no specific information on the transition to electric cars in the context of this debate.  If I were to say anything further, I would only be speculating.  We will make a note to address that more in more detail on Report Stage.</p></speech>

What I will say is that the Department of Finance would not have direct answers.  Much of that would be available through the motor trade.  However, will endeavour to talk to whichever Department and whatever is the relevant agency in the motor trade, perhaps the Society of the Irish Motor Industry.  Various organisations which may have information.  We will assemble what we can, but it will not be information from the Department.</p></speech>

This is because some of contracts are based on annual mileage.  Some people in urban areas feel that these cars are great.  However, people who are doing 40,000 to 50,000 km per annum in their cars have a specific difficulty at the end of their PCP agreements.  In addition, the electric vehicle issue is another new element.  We will endeavour to see what information we can obtain through Government sources.  When we get that we will send it on to the committee.</p></speech>

Is there any information about the availability of cars to meet the needs of the person who has to travel more than 40,000 miles per year?  How do they fare in the market at present?  Are they encouraged to go for electric cars, which, in turn, will reduce their carbon emissions and help us to meet our carbon requirements?  Can the Minister of State give some information on that?</p></speech>

Through the Society of the Motor Industry of Ireland, we will try to obtain what information we can.  We try to get information.  When some people talk about electric cars, they might be referring to hybrid cars that run diesel and then switch to running on an electric charge.</p><p>Some hybrid electric cars that can be plugged in at home have a diesel or petrol engine, so it is not a question of all electric or all diesel.  The question of whether a vehicle is plug-in hybrid enters this equation.  All I can say is that we will try to see what information is available from the motor trade, taking those complexities into account.  I cannot give any guarantees as to the quality of the information we will get back from the industry but we will seek it.  It is in the industry's interest to give it as this legislation is passing through now.</p></speech>

I am not referring to hybrid cars but to all-electric cars.  The information is not available and the motor industry does not have it.  If it does, it is selective.  The industry will tell you that if you travel more than 40,000 miles per year, an electric car is not the answer to your problems.  We have nowhere else to go.  We have nowhere to get information other than the industry.  Do we have a plan to have a certain number of electric cars in the country by a certain time?  We are supposed to.

This amendment will remove any doubt on this matter.  Some providers provide credit to the shop but not directly to the customer.  A consumer buying a domestic appliance, bed or another product by way of a BPL arrangement deals with the shop, but the shop may not be providing the credit because a credit provider may be dealing with the shop.  It is a question of ensuring the latter is captured within the legislation.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</p></speech>

It is no longer a matter of the sale of a product &mdash; which entails the shop &mdash; because the shop is not providing the credit at all.  The amendment captures the credit provider that makes credit available by way of advertising to consumers.  In some cases, it is the shop that advertises rather than the credit provider.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State know what I mean?  Consider the example of buying a jacket in Topshop for &euro;100 through a BPL arrangement where that arrangement is advertised by Topshop although Klarna provides the credit.  Klarna will not have advertised its services.  Since it has not invited customers to avail of credit through advertising, is it still captured under the definition?</p></speech>

The credit provider is not providing credit to the shop.  I agree 100% with the proposal but am concerned about the conditions under which the credit arrangement falls under the scope of the Central Bank if there has been an invitation, by way of advertisement, to avail of such credit.  I am just wondering whether there is a way by which the credit provider can say it is not advertising the service and that it is Topshop that is doing so.</p></speech>

The customer who buys something in a shop may be told to pay for it now and at the end of one, two and three months, not aware that credit is being provided to the shop.  This is where the arrangement is solely between the customer and the shop.  Klarna or any other such company is not involved in any transaction involving the customer.  I am referring to where the customer is aware the product he or she is buying has been partly financed by a finance company, through credit to the shop, but where there is no connection between the customer and that actual credit provider.  It can work both ways.  One can buy something through an arrangement with a credit company through a shop.  Now some shops make it much simpler in that they actually arrange the credit themselves.  They are in credit and the customer is not part of that credit arrangement.  The proposal is to make sure the company providing credit to the shop but not the customer is captured under this legislation.  I am referring to where there is no contractual link between the customer and credit provider.  Where there is a link between the shop and the credit provider that the customer might not even be aware of, it will now be captured.  I hope I am making myself clear on this.</p></speech>

This is an amendment where there is cost-free credit.  So there is no credit charge.  One just goes in and if it is &euro;1,000 then one pays &euro;333 today, &euro;333 at the of the month and &euro;333 at the end of month two.  There is no credit charge.  None.  It is actually being financed by a credit company to the shop to give that price.  There is no interest being charged to the customer.  The price that the shop charges essentially has a built-in cost of credit but the consumer would not be aware of that.  This amendment is to make sure that the provider of credit to the shop is captured under this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022022300002#D00700"><p>We want to get to the same point.  My only concern is the wording so I will go through this slowly.  Let us forget about a shop so as not to mix things up.  Let us forget about the scenario where the credit provider provides credit to the shop.</p> <p>  Let us look at Klarna, which is the biggest operator here.  Klarna provides credit to a customer to purchase an item from a shop.  This amendment will capture Klarna because the previous legislation said that it was the sale of a product.  Klarna were not selling a product or jacket and only provided credit.  This amendment is about the provision of credit so Klarna is captured so far.  The problem is that the amendment states "other than where such credit is granted or made available by a person who has invited, by way of advertisement, consumers to avail of such credit".  That is my concern.  Let us look at what happens in the market and at Asos, for example.  It is not Klarna that invites people to take credit with Klarna but Asos.  The credit is not being provided "by a person who has invited...", it is the actual retail outlet.  That is what happens in the market here and that is why I am concerned.  </p> <p>  I am looking at advertisements.  It is the shops which ask people whether they want to pay with Klarna and, if so, they have two options to either pay now or spread payments over a certain period.  It is the shop that invites the person and that shop is not the credit provider.  So the credit provider can say that is fine but I am not, as is stated in the amendment, "a person who has invited, by way of advertisement, consumers to avail of such credit". </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022022300002#D00800"><p>I can confirm that the legislation captures people who provide credit and the people who advertise the provision of credit.  So the provider, Klarna, is captured under this legislation.  All of the credit providers are covered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022022300002#D00900"><p>Where is the credit provider unconditionally captured under this legislation?  I ask because it is conditional in the amendment, which very clearly states "other than where such credit is granted".  Let us say one goes into a corner shop for a loaf of bread and a pint of milk but one asks the shopkeeper to record the amount in a book or put it on tick or says one will pay for the items next week.  Those people are not captured in the legislation.  The people who are captured are "other than where such credit is granted or made available by a person who has invited, by way of advertisement, consumers to avail of such credit".  The problem here is that when Topshop invites customers to get this credit it would be captured but Topshop would not because it has not made any credit available and Klarna, potentially, would not be captured here because it made the credit available but did not invite anybody personally to avail of the credit because the shop did so.  That is my concern.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022022300002#D01000"><p>I will read the wording of the amendment as I think that will help.  It states, "credit granted or made available" so everyone is covered if they make credit available.  The amendment continues, "without payment of interest or any other charge, other than where such credit is granted or made available by a person who has invited, by way of advertisement, consumers to avail of such credit&rdquo;.  So it is one or the other and both are captured.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.144" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022022300002#D01100"><p>No.  With respect, the Minister of State must look at the amendment that has been put forward in the context of section 3 of the original Act, and I do not have it in front of me, which specifies those that are captured under the Central Bank regulation and it has a number of exemptions, and exemption (e) refers to those who are exempt from the regulation and states: &ldquo;(e) credit granted or made available without payment of interest or any other charge".  That is where someone is buying milk and bread from a corner shop but saying to the owner that one will pay next week or ask for the sum to be noted in a book.  That scenario is exempt.</p> <p>  What is not exempt is "other than where such credit is granted or made available by a person who has invited, by way of advertisement, consumers to avail of such credit&rdquo;.  So if the corner shop advertised that customers can get interest-free credit on shopping then they would be captured in the same way as Klarna.  That is what the intention here is.  The problem is that it is connected with the advertisement and it has to be the person who invites it through advertisement that is captured.</p> <p>  If the officials in the Department and the Central Bank are comfortable with the wording, given what we have teased out, then I am happy.  However, I wish to take this opportunity to say that I think there could be an issue in terms of who advertised the products.  This is common standard.  Klarna is not the one that advertises.  It is the shops that advertise.  There is a window on the shop's website where one can avail of the Klarna credit but Klarna does not advertise the credit.</p></speech>

What is excluded from the legislation, which the Deputy has talked about, is what we call the informal credit.  I mean where a person buys something in a shop on tick and pays the money at the weekend or at the end of the month.  Those types of informal arrangements where there is no interest charged are the types that have been excluded up to now and do not prevent the shop from giving credit.  They are the ones in the exemption that has been referred to.  We do not want to interfere with that type of business because that is how people operate.  Agreeing to buy something now and paying it off at the weekend is excluded.</p> <p>  I can confirm that the officials have said that they have gone through the wording of this provision specifically with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  They are totally satisfied with the particular wording of the amendment and I can supply further clarification. </p></speech>

There are numerous websites which show that it is not Klarna that advertises or invites.  Klarna is neither inviting nor advertising and, therefore, it is not included under this section.  It is the shop that invites and advertises and the shop websites provide a window or gateway to Klarna but it is not Klarna that advertises its products.</p></speech>

Klarna does its business with the merchant.  The person who wants to use Klarna knows of the product and has bought that product, in a sense, from Klarna because they are using the service to pay the merchant plus they do not pay any charges or interest.  It is a deal between Klarna and the merchant.</p></speech>

The intention of the entire legislation is to capture the direct and indirect providers of credit.  That is the essence of it.  Nevertheless, there is a concern that in a slightly different context, interest-free and cost-free buy now pay later, BNPL, credit which is advertised or provided or both by an entity other than the seller of goods to consumers will still fall outside the scope of the 1995 Act, and consequently, also outside the proposed scope of Central Bank regulation.  I am referring to companies, such as Klarna, that are not the providers of the goods, and are advertising that they will provide interest-free and cost-free BNPL credit.  It is where the finance company is advertising.  The amendment is designed to capture those companies that are advertising directly and publically and not the sellers of the goods.  We have been discussed the situation where the seller of the goods does the advertising.  This refers to the situation where the financing company itself advertises directly.  There is a concern that this was not captured previously.  For example, some BNPL providers may not charge interest or other costs to a consumer for the credit which is used to purchase a good but instead charge the retailer a commission on the sale of the good.  For example, Klarna could have an arrangement that it will not charge interest but gets commission back from the retailer in lieu of interest.  We feel that those companies were not captured by this legislation.  That is why we have brought in the amendment.  </p></speech>

My point here that we must ensure that the language and text of the amendment is tight enough to ensure that regardless of which entity - the credit provider or the shop - is inviting or advertising, the credit provider is captured under this amendment.  That is the concern.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022022300002#E00400"><p>The real concern here is from the consumer's point of view.  Under the arrangement that I have just mentioned, there is no credit being charged along the line.  The shop is going to pay commission back to the credit provider.  There is no interest charged anywhere in the system.  While such credit may not come at a cost to the consumer, there is nevertheless a concern that the consumer, if not adequately assessed, could overborrow.  We do not want consumers going around several shops and doing this and building up unsecured debt.  The concern is that some consumers could overborrow and may have difficulties in meeting their financial commitments.  This is to help prevent overborrowing.  Therefore, it is considered prudent to address this matter and ensure that any person which advertises the provision of BNPL credit to consumers, including interest- and cost-free BNPL credit, will fall within the scope of the Consumer Credit Act and within the scope of Central Bank regulation.  Really, we are talking about the practice whereby companies are providing the funding indirectly, no interest is being charged to the consumer, the shop is not charging the consumer any interest or credit, and the finance provider is not being paid by way of interest, but is being paid through commission from the shop.  We are concerned that if that practice escalates, people might overborrow.  The best way of preventing that is to ensure that the provider of that credit falls under the scope of the Central Bank regulation and the Consumer Credit Act.  There will be the normal credit checks in relation to the credit that people are building up.  We cannot do that-----</p></speech>

The problem is that if Klarna does not advertise its services, it does not fall under the scope of the Central Bank regulation, under which the Government and all of us want to bring it.  It is conditional on advertising and inviting the person to take up the credit.  I am going to leave it at this point.  A note would be helpful to ensure that there is tight language.  Maybe it is already done.  However, from what I see in terms of the way it is written, there probably could be an area where companies such as Klarna could say that they do not advertise, because it is actually the retail website that advertises.  In Britain, it is the retail website that advertises the credit.  For example,  if a customer goes onto the Topshop website, they will be asked if they want to pay by Klarna.  It is the Topshop website that advertises it.  The customer clicks the button and it takes them to Klarna and a back office that is not advertised.  That is the problem.  If it is conditional on advertising and inviting the person in, I think it would be worth going back to officials in the Central Bank or whatever to make sure that it should not be contingent on whether it is Klarna or the shop that advertises - it should be captured.  That is the intention of the legislation.</p></speech>

We will get the note back to the committee as quickly as possible, well before Report Stage.  What we are capturing here is the providers of credit that are invisible in the system.  There is no advertising.  The companies that advertise are already captured.  We talked about the situation where the seller of the goods is advertising.  There could be an arrangement between the shop and the finance provider whereby the provider does not charge interest but charges commission and there is no advertisement involved.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the credit provider is also captured under this legislation.  We will provide a note to the committee.</p></speech>

Section 11 ensures that the APR provisions apply to credit and hire purchase agreements.  The Central Bank may make regulations to amend the method of calculation.  Later, we will deal with the fact that APR is capped at 23% for these services, which I support.  At least it is being brought into line with other services.  Going back to the example of Klarna, it offers interest-free credit up to a point.  If you miss a payment, you are penalised.  The APR that Klarna charges is way above 23%.  Does section 11 include the groups that we have now included in the regulation of the service?  What happens is that late payment fees are charged in relation to this.  It is not just about bad credit checks or people borrowing too much.  People are heavily penalised.  Most of the customers are students or people on low income.  At a time of high inflation, this makes matters worse.  Klarna is just here and is new to people.  It is a different way of money lending.  It is fine if the customer is making their payments but a study that was done in Britain showed that one third of millennials who have used BNPL credit have been charged late payment fees.  The study showed that the customers are 18 to 24-year-olds, over one third were 25 to 34-year-olds and some were even over 65.  Many are students trying to get through college, and so on.  These late payment fees can be as much as 40% of APR.  Where does the APR fit in relation to this?  How are these fees regulated under section 11?</p></speech>

It is on the basis that the contracts are implemented and honoured.  This legislation does not deal with situations where there is a default in those payment arrangements.  To my knowledge, it does not give comfort to people who default on their loan or finance agreements.  It is strictly based on the APR, which is based on taking the total cost of credit to the consumer expressed as an annual percentage rate into account.  It does not cover mechanisms to deal with defaults in the contractual arrangements.</p></speech>

It requires that a creditor providing a moneylending or hire purchase agreement cannot do so at a rate above 23%.  Could I ask the Minister of State about the remedy that is available to the consumer in this circumstance?  In section 28A(3) and 28B(3) there is a novel and interesting proposal which says that a creditor who charges more than 23% cannot enforce the agreement.  If somebody charges me 25%, the remedy is that he or she cannot sue me for the money, which is great, but the second paragraph in the subsection states: "Provided that if a court is satisfied in any action that a failure to comply with the aforesaid requirement was not deliberate".  Do we mean here that the remedy will not apply if it is simply a mistake and that if a creditor provides an agreement which has 25% and says he or she never realised there was a 23% prohibition, that he or she will be able to avail of that?</p></speech>

I do not think anybody would accept a finance company did not understand the product it was selling.  There are provisions in separate legislation already on consumer protection.

Schedule 5 lists the public bodies which may collect and use a person's PPS number for a public purpose.  While such a listing is not a necessary requirement for the processing of PPS numbers by the Central Bank in relation to the central credit register - as the statutory basis for that use of PPS numbers in relation to the CCR is already contained in the Credit Reporting Act 2013 - the Central Bank nevertheless indicates that its inclusion in Schedule 5 would have a number of additional benefits for the operation of the CCR.  These include access to PPS number validation tools operated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which will help improve the accuracy of the processing of PPS data for CCR purposes, and that it will also provide for increased transparency in relation to the processing of PPS numbers for CCR purposes.  It improves efficiency, but all the protections in regard to the PPSN system are not impacted.  It is an improvement in the administrative efficiency of the central credit register with the full rigours of protections that people have in respect of data protection.  The Central Bank has an agreement, as have all Departments, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Social Protection on the use of PPS numbers.</p></speech>

It is a double check back to where the PPS number originated from that it is a valid number in case somebody put in a false PPS number or there was an error in it.  There is now a method for the Central Bank to validate the PPS number through the central credit register.  That is essentially what is being done here.</p></speech>

They want to be able to include it here.  It is not part of the loan authorisation.  It is part of data verification, if the needs arise.  If a wrong PPS number comes in they can verify it.

Of course it can.  The information must be passed over.  The central credit register has been operating for a number of years now without PPS numbers.  I am not arguing the point, I just want to know what the process is with this amendment.  I am, however, very concerned about the facilitation of credit to people who cannot afford it.  I am also very concerned that, given what is happening with buy-now, pay-later loans and the level of default that is happening and particularly in the younger age group, they would have a negative credit history that will impact them when they try to go for other loans or a mortgage in future years.  That is the problem.</p> <p>  There is a wider issue around these buy now, pay later loans.  This is going to come with serious consequences for individuals, and those consequences were not there up onto now because they were not captured in the central credit register.  The central credit register will follow them around for a number of years.  The majority of those people, and including over 65s, would find it difficult to get a mortgage or other loans later in life.  I am teeing up with the amendment later on, but we must deal with the buy now pay later loans.</p></speech>

The amendment calls for the Central Bank, no later than six months following the date on which this section is commenced, to present a report to the Minister for Finance, examining: the buy now, pay later products in the market, with particular reference to but not restricted to the current state of the buy now, pay later products market including its component parts and recent changes in size and scale; the possible trends and future pressures in the buy now, pay later products market; to present an assessment of the benefits and harms evident or possible in the buy now, pay later products market and those that may be expected as the buy now, pay later products market develops; and to compare international approaches, including regulatory measures, in response to the issues examined where relevant; to make recommendations, as the Central Bank considers necessary or appropriate, to respond to the issues examined.</p><p>The amendment also calls for the Minister, after receiving a copy of that report to lay the report before each House of the Oireachtas.  If the Minister does not accept any recommendations of the Central Bank in the report the Minister shall within one month of being presented with it prepare and lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement of the Minster&rsquo;s reasons for not accepting it.</p><p>I tabled this amendment because there has been a huge increase in the buy now, pay later, BNPL, market.  Just as we have seen with PCPs, we are seeing a large increase in this type of market.  Indeed, it is increasing exponentially.  This market is of particular concern at a time of rising prices.  When somebody goes into a shop and decides to buy a flat screen television on a BNPL basis, for example, the situation is that up to one third of younger individuals will miss payments and will be penalised.  This has an impact on their credit rating.  Across the water, an average of one quarter of all adults who use BNPL services have failed to pay on time and that goes up to 35% for those between the ages of 18 and 34.  Those figures are truly shocking but that is what is likely to happen in our market too, with significant consequences.  We need to be ahead of the curve in relation to this.  </p><p> As I mentioned earlier, over four years ago I called for regulation in relation to PCPs.  PCPs, which account for hundreds of millions of euro of credit, have been unregulated for the last number of years.  This legislation, when it passes with the support of the Houses, will deal with that issue.  The BNPL market is now being regulated as a result of this legislation and that is to be welcomed.  However, there are further issues that need to be looked at in the context of the impact this will have on the provision of credit and on consumers, particularly those on lower incomes as well as those who are not necessarily on a low income but who are younger and are taking the easy option to have the commodity here and now and pay for it over a period of time.  The evidence suggests that those payments are not running smoothly, that the penalties are significant and that debts are just handed over to debt collectors.  Those debts spiral and people get into a cycle.  What this amendment does is task those who are best placed to deal with this issue with looking at this market, at the growth in the market, the opportunities and benefits it presents, as well as the negatives and to respond back if they deem it appropriate.  Maybe they will say that everything is fine but if not, they are tasked with making recommendations.  Under this amendment the Houses of the Oireachtas is asking the Central Bank to do that work and report within six months.  I strongly encourage the Minister of State to support this amendment because there is a boom in the BNPL market which is giving rise to serious concerns relating to rising consumer debt and the consequences that can flow from that. </p></speech>

Presumably the expectation is that, taking account of regulatory measures adopted elsewhere, there would be a recommendation to regulate BNPL providers.</p> <p>  This amendment is unnecessary and should be opposed because the Bill already provides for the regulation of BNPL credit providers.  This is being done by widening the range of financial agreements which will fall within the regulatory scope of retail credit firms, from its current scope of cash loan credit agreements directly provided to customers to one which will also include deferred payment credit agreements directly or indirectly provided to customers.  Therefore, this Bill will capture BNPL type credit.  Furthermore, the Minister&rsquo;s own amendment No. 4 will also provide that interest and cost-free credit agreements, including interest and cost-free BNPL credit agreements, will also be within scope where such agreements are advertised to consumers.</p> <p>  On the slightly separate point in Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s amendment regarding information and data on the BNPL market, it should be noted that section 9 of the Bill inserts a new section 36EA into the Central Bank 1997 regarding the collection and publication of information on relevant agreements.  In particular, it provides that the Minister may request that the Central Bank collect and publish information on credit and-or hiring agreements, which includes BNPL agreements, and such reports can be on a once off or recurring basis.  </p> <p>  Furthermore, it should be noted that under existing legislation the Minister can seek reports from the Central Bank, such as under section 6A of the Central Bank Act 1942 and section 81 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, and therefore there is no need to have sector-specific provisions in law to provide for this.  Also, under the bank&rsquo;s supervisory powers the Central Bank can gather information as necessary without these specific provisions.  This information can be gathered at the behest of the Central Bank itself, without this provision.  The Minister, separately to this provision, can request the Central Bank to provide this information.  Therefore, there are two mechanisms already in place to facilitate the collecting of this data and the publication thereof.</p> <p>  In addition, the Central Bank regularly appears before various Oireachtas committees in relation to the performance of its functions, including its consumer protection functions, and members of the Oireachtas can avail of the opportunity to closely question the bank on all aspects of its work.  Regarding Oireachtas scrutiny of the Central Bank and the power of the Minister to seek this information, the Central Bank's supervisory powers already give it the authority to seek this information and publish it.  Accordingly, it is considered that the specific amendment proposed by Deputy Doherty, while well intentioned, is unnecessary.  I will be opposing the amendment on that basis.</p></speech>

The irony is that Deputy Fleming, who is the Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, brought legislation before the House that only asks for a report on dual pricing.  He then went on radio and claimed that he was going to ban dual pricing but he had no hand, act or part in that.  He knows that it was me who made the complaint to the Central Bank.  I sat down with the Governor and convinced him to carry out the study.  The Central Bank published its report last year in terms of the way forward but the Minister of State did not even make a submission to the consultation process, unlike Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Minister of State produced legislation that asks the Central Bank to give the Government a report on how it is going when it is finally implemented in July.  This amendment is asking for the same thing.  It is asking for a report not just on the specifics contained in the legislation but also on wider issues in terms of the regulatory impact elsewhere, as regulators are clamping down on BNPL.  If the Government wants to deal with this in four years' time, in the same way it has dealt with the PCP issue, that is fine.  I am conscious that Fianna F&aacute;il was not in government then but it supported the previous Government.  It took over four years, since I began raising these issues, to bring forward legislation but we do not know that this legislation will have an effect this year.</p> <p>  Why would the Minister of State resist having a report of this nature?  Indeed, a better response from the Minister of State and one which would be acceptable to me would be not to put this into legislation but to give a commitment to ask the Central Bank to provide a report on the BNPL market, its potentials, pitfalls, the international regulatory framework and any recommendations it sees fit to make.  The bank might determine that there is a cause for concern here in terms of consumer protection and higher debt and it might determine that this market is going to grow based on what is happening elsewhere.  On that basis, I press the amendment.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have the opportunity to address it on this Bill, which facilitates the transfer of specialist community-based disability services from the Minister for Health to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The Bill was published on 9 February and, as Deputies will be aware, commenced its passage through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il two weeks ago.  I welcome the support received in the House for the core principle underlining the Bill, namely, to consolidate and centralise responsibility for disability policy under one Minister and Department.  The centralisation of the equality, health and social care dimensions of support for people with disabilities will facilitate the transition from a medical model of support to an holistic, rights-based one that supports people with disabilities to live autonomously.</p> <p>  After the transfer, the HSE will continue to deliver the services and, therefore, the organisation will report to two Ministers on different elements of its functions.  The Bill seeks to put in place a legislative basis to ensure that both Ministers have the necessary authority in their respective areas of responsibility.  I thank Deputies for their continued support for the Bill.</p></speech>

We will have two Ministers responsible.  Will this lead to divided responsibilities, which will mean no responsibility, or is the Bill better than that?  I am just throwing this question out there.  It is fundamental to the consideration of the Bill.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Bill is to move responsibility for disability matters from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and, as I called him throughout Second Stage, the Minister with responsibility for equality and to give him autonomy.  This transfer means that the Minister of State role will move, as will the relevant functions, which are essentially the interaction with the HSE.  The money needs to transfer as well.</p> <p>  We are going from a medical-based model to a more inclusive one of social care.  Since the Taoiseach appointed me 16 months ago, this is what has been going on and I have been working with the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and Stephen Donnelly.  Disability services are best placed within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  There is more to people's health than just the medical approach.  This area sits perfectly within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p> <p>  I welcome how the HSE will report to two Ministers and seek a budget separate from the Department of Health.  I also welcome that disability will no longer be the Cinderella in the Department of Health.  It will have the largest budget within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which will put disability front and centre when negotiating budgets.  While the HSE will report to two line Ministers, it will report on its specific responsibilities for disability matters to the Minister with responsibility for equality and make specific requests in that regard.  We will not be discussing other elements at all.</p> <p>  Does that answer the Deputy's question?  I do not believe that this matter will fall between two stools.  Instead, this is a welcome move to put people at the centre.  In line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, this will give a home to a rights-based approach.  We will be taking a rights-based approach to disability and not just looking at it through the medical lens.</p></speech>

I am supportive of the Bill but I have a couple of questions.  This Bill is rushed.  We waited a good while for it but it was only published on 9 February and we are now on Committee Stage.  There has not been much opportunity to scrutinise the Bill, especially for the many advocacy groups working in this area.</p> <p>  The dialogue forum was established under the recommendations of the report from Dr. Catherine Day in 2018.  Now that the area of disability is transferring to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, will that Department be represented on the dialogue forum?</p><p> My second question concerns the disability capacity review.  We know that over 90% of people with disabilities are supported through general community health and social services.  All of these services will remain under the remit of the Department of Health when the transfer takes place.  What is often needed is a combination of specialist disability services and mainstream services, particularly for people with progressive conditions, meaning they will need to make significant changes over time.  What mechanisms will be put in place to ensure strong linkages and integration between disability services and mainstream health services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2022022300002#B00200"><p>The disability capacity review involves a whole-of-government approach.  The framework and action plan are being finalised with the support of funding because we know there is a lot of unmet need within that.  It is not just unmet need within the health element but also with regard to recruitment, training, housing provision, access to employment and social protection.  From a health perspective, it is a really welcome document.  Eithne Fitzgerald is finalising the framework and the action plan with us to go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to seek funding for it.  I plan to divide it in three different phases in the first three years as opposed to doing it in a ten-year chunk and to front-load it to ensure we address that unmet need.</p> <p>  We know the expenditure of people who have children with challenging behaviours is no different from that of parents of children with multiple complex medical needs.  The expense and the under-resourcing and underfunding for these parents need to be addressed and to be front and centre.  At the same time, we need to address the rights of people.  The right to housing and the right to access employment are very well addressed, which is why we have the housing strategy and the comprehensive employment strategy.  I sit on both.  I am confident about the disability capacity review.  It has been a long time in the making and was eventually published.  The framework and the meat that is being put on the bone are very substantial.  It is not just sitting within one Department but must sit across all Departments.  I have no doubt that all Deputies here will support the publication and the framework.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

Is she satisfied the section contains sufficient safeguards to ensure it does not fall between stools like the determination of the existence of a disability.  I forget the exact term.  We had a discussion about it in another context.  It concerns the definition of a disabled person and recognition of a disability for the purposes of the use or control of a vehicle.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the definition in the Bill is not dependent on a definition under the Disability Act?</p></speech>

The reason is to ensure the protection within the Health Act recognises the transfer of certain functions from the Department of Health and the roles and responsibilities of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I am reassured that we have left no stone unturned to ensure that when disability is transferred, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will have the same functions and access as the Minister for Health currently does with regard to disability and nothing will be left behind.  What we are doing is what I have been doing for the past 18 months, namely, straddling the two Departments.  While it has been slow in coming, although perhaps the legislation came very quickly, it gave me the opportunity to see where it is totally interwoven and where there could be slippage between the two stools, as the Deputy mentioned.  The Deputy will see as we proceed through the amendments, particularly those relating to the memorandum of understanding, that we have ensured there is no misunderstanding, nothing is left behind and, at all stages, we have a safety net.</p></speech>

To return to how engagement and policy is delivered, which is my core function, it is about that piece the Deputy spoke about around breakdown in the delivery of service but in regard to a particular area as opposed to a particular case.  I have monthly meetings with the heads of disability and weekly meetings with the Department of Health at which we continue to raise and address such issues.  We will continue to do that.  It is important we do it, but through the proper process as opposed to by way of telephone contact day in, day out.  It is about having in place a system whereby I meet with the heads of disability, by which I mean the leads in the nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, every month and with the Department every week.  Good communication is key to addressing issues such that they do not fester.  That is not shying away from the problem.  We do have issues.  There is no doubt we have a lot of issues within the disability area.  It is hoped that, through this process of engagement, we can get delivery in a timely fashion.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped it will cover the issues I have in mind.  One such issue, which the Minister of State anticipated in her response, is that of the person who has to visit a hospital and does not receive the treatment he or she requires, is not attended to and spends up to 20 hours or two days on a trolley and nothing happens.  We cannot stand over that.  It flies in the face of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We should have dealt with this at the previous meeting.  We need to put in place the fundamentals of Sl&aacute;intecare and give it the <i>imprimatur</i>of Sl&aacute;intecare as well.  I am not sure if people understand the point I am making.  I may, perhaps, not be making a very clear case.  I have sat with parents in hospitals while their child with a disability did not receive treatment.  I am sure I am not the only one of the members here who has had to do that.  We did that on the basis of needs must.  I am concerned the Minister cannot intervene.</p></speech>

I hear from all Deputies about the lack of access to services.  I acknowledge that.  I am working with the heads of disability, the lead on disability within the HSE and the Department to put in place a proper process.  Sl&aacute;intecare funding was afforded to the Department of Health.  We used it very wisely to address a specific issue raised by all Deputies on the assessment of need.  We will need to use that process again.  When we used the Sl&aacute;intecare model on the assessment of need, we successfully dealt with the issue.  We need to use that model throughout all of the therapies.  I will not shy away from that.  We need to access the Sl&aacute;intecare model and funding to ensure we have a targeted delivery.</p> <p>  There is no point in only having targets.  We need a lifelong plan of delivery.  When we raise the boat, we need to give it a steady direction such that it does not fall off again, so to speak.  There is no point in a having a short-term solution.  We need a short-term solution but a long-term gain.  That is what I want to see happening, particularly in regard to the therapies, which is an area of concern for all Deputies.  That is exactly the plan in terms of the reform that took place in recent months.  We are putting in place the progressing disability services, PDS, model, which by all manner and means is very testing.  I am engaging continually every month at a national level with the HSE - it is very structured engagement - and every week with the Department to ensure this policy direction we have taken will work, most importantly for the families.  We will need to take a Sl&aacute;intecare approach to that in accessing funding to address the diagnostic needs within autism.</p></speech>

However, in relation to specialist disability services, they will fall within the remit of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Specialist disability services are what are transferring over, but the functions and responsibility of accounting in relation to certain aspects of the HSE will still fall back to the Minister for Health.  That is why there will be two separate service plans - one for the Minister of Health and one for the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  However, the delivery of it will still be by the HSE.  Nothing will change in that regard.  The delivery of services will all be through the HSE.  If the HSE, from community specialist point of view, provides them through the section 38 and section 39 organisations, subcontracting them out, that will be part of the its service plan return to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p></speech>

That is very clear.  We know my budget and we know the budget line that it falls under.  Currently, there is a budget line there of &euro;2.3 billion.  The HSE makes submissions to the head of disabilities on an annual basis for its requests for support.  It will now be the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth doing that.  He will be negotiating his budget directly with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the funding.  However, on the delivery of the aspect, the HSE will be accountable to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  That will be going directly into the disability specialist teams, to fund the therapies, day services, the respite and residential care.  The lines are very clear within in.</p></speech>

How is the division within primary care made?  Obviously, it deals with a wide range of different health related issues as well as-----</p></speech>

Any of the children who would be coming through the PDS model and who would be on it would be seen as having complex multidisciplinary needs.  The child referred back into primary care would be seen as needing a singular need, whether it be the speech and language need or the occupational therapy need.  It would not be the need of a multidisciplinary piece, so they should slot across.  That is why, in the roll out of PDS, we have 91 PDS networks and 96 primary care networks, so one will not overlay the other so there is that fluid transition across.</p></speech>

The funding model will still always go through the HSE, but the delivery of service could be through another provider, no different from a section 38 or section 39 organisation, where a service-level plan would be put in place to ensure that the provider meets the needs and has the capacity to deliver it.

We are moving to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, where the person is at the centre and where we are aligned with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  Therefore, it is meeting the needs of the individual.  The service provider best placed to deliver the service, be it a section 38 or section 39 organisation or the HSE, will deliver that service.</p></speech>

There is no maternity leave cover for speech and language therapists at present.  Who decides whether that will be funded or not?

In a care setting that is predominantly female, it is an issue to think we do not fund, cover or back maternity leave.  I do not find it acceptable.  We would not do it in teaching and I do not know why we would not do it in disability and, most importantly, in the therapeutic delivery of care where early intervention is key.  It is something I have taken up with the HSE.  Currently, it is a conversation.  I have funded and started that.  Three of my children's disability network team leads are or will be on maternity leave this year.  I am funding those posts.  I am working very closely with the HSE to ensure we can build in the capacity so as to have that capacity budget to be able to cover maternity leave.  That is across all different grades.  If a senior speech and language therapist is out on maternity leave for 12 months and a child does not see a speech and language therapist in that time, that is not a delivery of service.  Sometimes that is not communicated to the family and they do not know why.  We need to ensure we have that continuation.  I am looking at having relief maternity panels with the skills available to support the teams who are able to deliver the service of the relevant grades.</p></speech>

This section is about access to information.  I received a reply this morning from the HSE.  I was looking for details of the waiting lists for early intervention teams because we are all dealing with children who age out of this.  The provision of services is very problematic at the moment.  I sought details on the waiting lists.  The reply came back that the HSE does not have that information.  This is information that is with the various section 38 and 39 organisations.  How on earth can services be planned for if you do not have basic information and data on the waiting lists?  We are told that it may be ready at the end of the first quarter.  This goes back to the whole issue in the HSE around its appalling IT systems and how at any one time it cannot say how many staff it has in any particular area or how many are on the waiting list.  I am asking the Minister of State to recognise that this is a major obstacle to providing adequate services.  What you do not measure does not count, as the saying goes.  We need to put proper data systems in place so that we actually know the level of need.  Then efforts can be made to match that with the provision of services.  I would ask the Minister of State to please prioritise the provision of data so that services can be adequately provided.</p></speech>

I completely concur with her.  If we do not have the data, how can we measure?  I will bring her up to speed on two things.  The contracts have been signed for a new ICT system for the progressing disability services, PDS, model.  I am pushing this and want to see it done.  I am assured that by quarter 1 of 2023, all the PDS systems throughout the country will have the data and the information technology systems to collect that.  Then I will save Deputy Shortall and everyone else on their parliamentary questions because I want to have it live so that we see the waiting lists live - not the individuals but the numbers - so that people have a proper directory of when someone enters a particular CDNT team, what is ahead of them and where it is moving.  It is not in relation to accountability but it has to be in relation to seeing what is getting done.  We need to know there is a throughput but the clinicians themselves will want to see that too.  We must move away from a paper-based system because it does not serve any purpose waiting three months to get an answer.</p> <p>  On the response the Deputy received to her parliamentary question, early intervention is gone and it is all part of the PDS now.  That is the answer she should have been given.  We no longer have that because we have all our PDS teams in place.  It is from birth to 18 years, so there is no ageing out.  Since the reform, the days of ageing out of a service has gone.  That is of little comfort to those who thought they were on an early intervention team.  I can only apologise to the families who might not be aware of it for poor communication on that.  Early intervention ageing out teams are gone.</p></speech>

They are saying that it might be the end of the first quarter.  I hope it is.  I accept what the Minister of State is saying.  Data is essential.  You cannot measure anyone's performance unless there is clear data.  I would also ask the Minister of State to confirm she is supportive of what is contained in Sl&aacute;intecare on the allocation of resources to the various areas, whatever boundaries we are using, and it is to be hoped we will be using the new regional health area, RHA, boundaries soon, that the allocation of resources would be done on an objective basis - looking at the population in each area, the socioeconomic profile, the number of children, the number of older people and all that kind of thing - and that it would be transparent.</p></speech>

That is the whole idea.  I see the number of parliamentary questions that come in and how long it takes to get responses to them.  I believe in reporting in real time because that means parents have the power and they have the information.  It also gives Departments the opportunity to support, fund and address the issues Deputy Durkan raised around maternity leave, long-term absences or whatever needs arise.  We will have a live helicopter view.  There is no point in finding out about this six months later and we have not delivered services for six months.  There is an appetite in the HSE to be very fair within disabilities, but it needs the tools to do the job.  That is the appetite and the policy direction within the Department of Health and within the new Department.  Yes, there will be a funding ask to make that work, but that will mean the delivery service will be brilliant.  It will also mean that we know the shortfalls.  Further, it will mean elected representatives will know the CDNT teams in their areas and how they are functioning.</p></speech>

This is about co-operation and arrangements for co-operation by the executive with housing authorities and the Ministers for Health, Social Protection and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  That is fine.  That kind of co-ordinating role is essential.  There are many aspects to the disability issue and it crosses many Departments.  I think there are other Departments that are equally relevant, if not more relevant, to people living with disabilities.  I do not know why this involves housing authorities rather than the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The Minister for Transport is a key Minister with regard to providing access and mobility for people.  The Department of Transport is also key and is relevant to people with disabilities.</p> <p>  Besides just employment, messages relating to education and training are important.  The proper training courses need to be available and accessible.  Why is the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science not referred to too?  There is a big challenge in getting all of those Departments on the same page and keeping the focus on meeting the needs of people with disabilities.  Why are some named when others, which seem very relevant, are not named?</p></speech>

I take on board what the Deputy is saying.  Whenever I talk about disability, I speak about it in the round.  I agree with the Deputy that education, higher education and transport all have a role to play.  There is not one Department that does not have a role to play when it comes to disability.  That is why it is being moved to the Department for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Moving it to the Department responsible for equality is the baseline, person-centred approach.  That is why it is mirrored to the old Act.</p></speech>

Why is this legislation not going further than just mirroring what was in the original Act?  Why is it not going to include those other relevant Departments?  Has the Minister of State any thoughts on how she will bring those other Departments into line or get them to focus on the needs of people with disabilities.</p></speech>

I am already doing what the Deputy refers to with the reconfiguration of the transport committee, which I am chairing.  I have brought in the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Social Protection, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Education.  They are all present.  A person with a disability has the right to go to work, to be educated, and to travel.  I am looking at it in the round.  I also chair the national disability inclusion strategy group.  Every Department sits on that, along with a stakeholder group.  That is where I see accountability.  I am no more a hard taskmaster than the Deputy is, with what she set me today.  We need to look at the suggestions and how we can make it more inclusive and fluid.  Not everything should be a battle.  Every Department must attend and must have an action plan.  In the past, they have used the traffic light system.  It is getting very narrowed down.</p> <p>  What is really meant when one talks about transport?  To be fair to the relevant Ministers, they have provided their officials to address the transport issue.  Everybody on this call, including the Deputy and I, knows that much is going on in transport that needs to be addressed, from the mobility allowance to the primary medical certificate to as simple a matter as parking bays.  Local government has a role.  It is not just a matter for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, but also the local authorities.  We have somebody from the county councils attending that transport meeting.  I am looking at it in the round.  This is just a transfer of functions.  If it was not just a transfer, I would have been broader with it.</p></speech>

What are the reporting arrangements to the Minister of State and for the public and service users?

The National Disability Authority reports on specific issues.  The most recent report, which I hope will be published soon, relates to Irish Sign Language, which went in under the bonnet in every single Department across Government.  That undoubtedly threw up challenges, but I am glad to say that they are being addressed.  It is the same with the national disability inclusion strategy.  The stakeholder groups, representative organisations and disabled persons' organisations are there.  They are able to provide feedback about progress to their representative bodies.  They also have members on the various sub-committees of the national disability inclusion strategy, including education and transport.  Some of those positions might not all have been filled in the past.  With the sixth disability stakeholders group, we have an ambitious cohort of representative groups on board.  They all provide feedback to various organisations.  Wonderful work has been done by the fifth disability stakeholders group.  We now have a new cohort, which is the sixth disability stakeholders group.</p> <p>  One of the primary functions in the national disability inclusion strategy, at the top of its agenda, is to address the cost of disability.  The cost of disability is a concern that is considered with regard to education, housing and social protection.  All the key players from relevant Departments are present.  It is welcome that the Department official does not change from quarter to quarter.  The same lady has been involved with regard to education since I became Minister of State.  She is a fantastic woman who has continued to do this.</p><p>The same has happened with local government.  We have consistency in attendance at the meeting from the representatives of the relevant Departments so they can feed straight back into their line Ministers.</p></speech>

Say, for argument's sake, a housing authority is dealing with an estate of 80 houses, which was something I saw recently.  I do not believe any house in that development was specifically set aside for people with disabilities.  Could there be far more co-ordination in that area?  Where a housing scheme is being built by a local authority or a statutory agency, such as Tuath Housing or Respond, can there be more co-ordination in setting aside units specifically for people with disabilities?  I do not think that has been put in place in real terms.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, for the disability housing strategy they recently launched.  When we talk about housing, we should talk about universal design.  A particular property should be suitable for a person with a disability, an older person or whoever else.  A property should meet the needs of whoever needs to access it.  Deputy Hourigan talks to me clearly and at all times about the need for universal design.  Local authorities have a long way to travel on this issue and some are better than others.  They must ensure proper allocation and universal design.  If more local authorities addressed the need for universal design, more people could access properties and live independently, or could be supported to live independent.  A key focus of mine is to support people in independent living and to ensure there is proper personal assistant support for that.  We must also bring into the conversation how technology can support people to live independently.  Local authorities have roads to travel in this regard.  They do not have a target to provide, say, 5% of homes for people with disabilities.  In actual fact, they need to meet those people's needs, no different from the way they meet the needs of able-bodied people.  They should be able to meet the needs of all.</p></speech>

The housing bodies are now building a large number of houses for people on the housing list.  Should we not incorporate all of the players in providing housing?  It is not unusual for an organisation that is trying to provide housing for someone with disability, whether intellectual or physical, to run into problems in getting the housing he or she needs.  Those organisations can end up purchasing properties in locations that are not ideal.  Housing in urban centres, close to shops or services, would be far more beneficial to people with disabilities.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right.  It is regrettable that in the past we or disability organisations bought properties that do not meet the needs of the individual but which were the only properties that were accessible.  We need to have town centre properties with universal access for all persons with disabilities.  It goes back to the point Deputy Shortall made.  There is no point in having a person with a disability living down the country if he or she does not have access to a transport system.</p></speech>

We are spending a lot of money on adaptation grants and moving people from one property to another.  It is not just our houses; our whole environment needs to be universally designed, including transport links.  The biggest obstacle to housing for disabled people is the lack of consultation with the health authorities to provide whatever those people need to support them to live independently, including a home care or personal assistant and assistive technology.  That seems to be where there is a breakdown.  The housing authorities can provide the houses but the supports for the person who wants to live in those houses are not provided.</p></speech>

I will say again there will be a central role for the Minister with responsibility for disability.  It is about working in a cross-Government manner, across Departments.  To be fair to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, he has opened that door for me.  If he provides the houses and I can provide the home support, the personal assistant or the technology piece, I will come on board.  We must travel the road together.  There is no point in building properties that people cannot access because they do not have the health supports they need.  Joined-up thinking is required, which takes us back to why this transfer is so important.  It goes back to the equality piece.</p></speech>

Has anybody looked at, for example, the duplex housing system recently and how many people are in such accommodation and must access their homes via an outside stairs with only one handrail?  There have been numerous cases of people breaking their ankles, legs and so on and so forth.  Those people can still be left in those houses for ten years, 15 years or more, becoming more dependent on those around them.  They are, unfortunately, not receiving any urgent treatment.</p> <p>  Approved housing bodies have within their lists of tenants at the moment several people who need adaptation grants to change their houses to address the needs of the people living in them.  Those needs are fairly extensive.  Some older people may have fallen or may have had an experience that has resulted in their being afraid to use the bath and afraid to stay in their own homes as a result of the means of access.  We do not readily understand their experiences.  I ask, in the situation we find ourselves, that the Minister of State would take responsibility and be in a position to dictate the necessities at design level for the people who are going to live in the houses.  We must address the limitations on the extent to which disabled people can enjoy a normal living standard in their houses, insofar as it is possible for them to do so.  How can we make it happen for them in a short time rather than telling them we will do something about it when we get time?  I am sure everybody knows of cases of people who are in approved housing body houses but had to wait two or three years to get into them.  That is crazy.</p></speech>

One of the pieces was around the housing adaptation grant for disabled and older persons about which the Deputy spoke.  The grant system never recognised the sensory needs of young people.  To be fair to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, he changed the qualifications to acknowledge that sensory needs can be part of the system.</p><p>If a room needs to be provided for the sensory needs of a young person, the local authorities now recognise that.  That was progress in recent months while this consultation on the strategy was coming through.</p><p> I agree the sum given through the housing adaptation grant needs to be reviewed, given that sometimes we do not need to move people from their houses.  Perhaps their changing needs have to be addressed, but sometimes the changing need might be a bit more expensive than the &euro;30,000 that is allocated.  It might be able to be done over two or three years, but to meet that need, it needs to be done now.  That is another issue that needs to be addressed.  To be fair on this to the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, they have been very open and approachable in regard to listening to people about meeting that need.</p></speech>

Theirs is a very energetic team and their office has been very good throughout the time I have been in the D&aacute;il when dealing with complex issues we occasionally encounter in our constituency offices.  They have been very engaging in that regard.</p> <p>  To follow on from the point our colleague mentioned regarding housing, we heretofore spoke about percentages of housing in a development needing to be equipped for disability or one's future needs.  I fully agree with Deputy Tully and the Minister of State that it is essential all housing stock be equipped for one's future needs.  None of us knows what lies ahead.  Some of us are born with limitations, while others, unfortunately, acquire them during their lifetime, and it is important the housing stock reflect that.</p> <p>  As a general housing point, this is an issue that arises time and again and it relates directly to Deputy Rabbitte's Ministry.  There are many empty nesters who have four-bedroom houses in council estates.  The spouse may have passed on, the children may have left and there could be someone down the road, often with a disability, who would love to be able to live in the house.  We need to re-examine the configuration of housing and of the idea that, when someone gets the keys for a local authority house, irrespective of when the person got those keys, the house will be his or hers forever.  In case the person's needs change, there needs to be flexibility built in.  I know of people in County Clare with profound disabilities who are still struggling to get housed.  There are ideal units in their town and village but they are taken up, often with many of the rooms vacant.  Flexibility needs to be built in to that.</p> <p>  Turning to the housing adaptation grant, the inclusion of sensory rooms last year was really positive.  I was a teacher in a former life and I developed our sensory room in Parteen National School.  The rooms are fabulous.  When a child is in a state of high anxiety or stimming, he or she can withdraw to that space, relax and come back ready to engage.  They have been in schools for only a few years, but it is incredible - revolutionary, in fact - that they are now being provided in homes, with Government support.  Does the Minister of State have any metrics to determine how that is going?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.460" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2022022300002#K00300"><p>I do not have any metric other than my constituency office, but the scheme has been very well received.  Having talked to my local authority, Galway County Council, I know it has been well supported.  For me, what brought to light the value of a sensory room, if the Chairman will indulge me for a moment, was on Sunday night last, when I was watching "Room to Improve" and the value of sensory rooms was addressed.   The little man on the programme went into the sensory room in the family's house and was able to regulate himself.  Ordinary viewers watching the programme would not have understood this unless they had experience and understood what life is like for a child with sensory needs.  We could see the value of that room and how the family could continue to function because they had the space to accommodate the room.</p> <p>  It is welcome that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has now seen fit, thanks to the Minister, to qualify sensory rooms as a need, and I expect there will be greater take-up of that now.  It is also important, however, that local authorities, within their housing stock, would acknowledge we need to build that capacity in to some of it.  In the past, for a husband and wife and two children, local authorities would say they were entitled only to a two-bedroom house.  Perhaps where there is a sensory need, we will need to designate another room as the sensory room.  Local authorities need to be open minded about meeting the needs of the family.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.461" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2022022300002#K00400"><p>I would like the Minister of State to champion the provision of sensory rooms more generally in respect of public buildings.  They are now in hospitals and many schools, and they are beginning to be built in homes.  There are many people who started their education in primary and secondary school being highly supported with intervention services and special needs assistants, SNAs, and went through our fantastic education system, for which I am a firm advocate.  They then go on to fulfilling careers in the public service and other areas, where they can function very highly and do a fantastic job, but there may still be times in the day or during the week when something can throw them.  There are staff in the public service, possibly even here in the Houses of the Oireachtas, who may have certain sensory issues.  Sensory rooms are very small in terms of the space they take up in a building but their impact is substantial.  I would love someone to be a champion for them.  A sensory room was recently installed in Shannon Airport.  People quietly go in before a flight and emerge feeling rested, calm and ready to board a plane.  It should be a feature of most public buildings in the general specification of design, and I ask the Minister of State to push that.</p> <p>  Her Ministry's transfer has been streamlined well and that is welcome.  I am conscious she is being flanked during the meeting by two departmental officials.  Has there been any departmental resistance or barriers of which we need to be aware as a committee?</p> <p>  Finally, turning to the section 39 charities and organisations that have acquired housing stock with support from the Government, it concerns me - I have said this to the Minister of State previously - that many of the residential houses that are acquired for people with disabilities are former bed and breakfast accommodation or seven- or eight-bedroom houses, which the general market of buyers would not go near.  We end up, therefore, with people who have profound needs being supported in an environment where the house is fantastic and the people around them support them but the house may be located 7 or 8 miles outside where they need it to be.  I can think of one former bed and breakfast accommodation in Clare - I will not say where it is - that is totally remote from where the needs are.  Nevertheless, the Department and the section 39 charities decided that because it has seven bedrooms, they would buy it, but that should not be the metric for whether to buy it.  It should meet the needs and, if anything, be town centred in order that the resident can walk out, have a coffee and socialise and mix with people.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for his forbearance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.462" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2022022300002#K00500"><p>To clarify, I have experienced no resistance within either Department.  I am supported well today by the Department of Health and have been warmly welcomed by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I am supported by both Ministers and both Secretaries General in the transfer.  Perhaps one of them will be delighted to see me go and another will be delighted to see me come, but we will say no more about that and it is okay.  As for the HSE, as I explained earlier in response to Deputy Durkan, I have put in place a system that may be a little more granular than that which was there in the past.  I have a good working relationship with the HSE within the system that exists, because we need to get answers.</p> <p>  On the purchase of properties, it is important to put on record - I think the Chairman will understand why I am saying this - that there are many ageing families who care for people with disabilities, and we do not have enough property to support or meet their needs.  At all times, those individuals are trumped by crisis emergencies that come in ahead of them.  What I am trying to do with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, therefore, is to build in capacity while, at the same time, meeting the emergency needs.  When a provider sources a house, it does so in good faith.  It could be taking account of its book or its need for respite or residential care, and a property might not be available at that point in time, but it knows the needs of its families.  That is what providers are trying to address.  They are trying to relieve that anxiety, stress and pressure on families, and sometimes the property might not be at the desired location.  While we are building Housing for All and will, through the Government, I hope, deliver the houses that are required, it is my one desire that we ensure there are houses with universal design in town centre locations that meet the needs.  For once, we should not work off a key performance indicator, KPI, of debt to meet the needs of families but rather meet the needs and build in the capacity in advance.  We should work with providers to ensure the needs and the providers' waiting lists will be met.</p><p>That takes planning but it is happening.</p></speech>

I am just checking that it will transfer as part of this move.  It seems to be the case but I would like the Minister of State to confirm it.</p></speech>

The number one item within it is that transfer.  That transition planning is a priority for me.  Deputy Cathal Crowe touched on the transition aspect.  A great deal of work needs to be done on this.  Career planning must start much earlier in education.  To be fair to the Taoiseach, an education sub-committee was convened and this was one of the hot topics discussed at it.  We must see a bring future for our young people in special classes, special schools or special units.  There should be a pathway through education with any needs met; they should not fall off a cliff edge the moment they exit education.  We must ensure they work with providers, the HSE or whoever else.  That must happen.</p></speech>

I know we are talking about transference of power in the Bill.  In my local authority at one time a person could not get an extension if that person lived in the middle of a terrace.  If somebody had a stroke, the onus was then to transfer the family into an area where they might have known nobody or so on.  There were all those sorts of difficulties.  If a person was in a private house, a grant could be received for a mid-terrace property.  It is important to have a system where people can see such a change.  That has been going on for decades in that local authority and there are probably other examples as well.  It is about capacity and saving money as well as everything else but it is also about the individual.  The Minister of State is indicating the individual will be at the centre of this, and that is key.</p></speech>

My understanding is that the <i>Irish Examiner</i>has been told in the past three or four days that a statutory investigation conducted by HIQA does no carry any enforceable sanctions and therefore could not be guaranteed to achieve improvements in residential care.  I am just wondering about the transfer and we are talking about HIQA but where is an individual complaint filed and what is the role of HIQA in trying to deal with an issue.  If parents or family have somebody in a residential setting where the person has a disability, they find they get no response from the residential facility or the organisation running it.  If they go to HIQA, the authority has a role, but we find that in many cases people end up going down the legal route, which should not be the case.  Are we making adequate provisions and could we do something further in making sure that where there is a complaint, particularly with respect to somebody with a disability, there is a proper mechanism to deal with it?</p></speech>

HIQA's disability inspection team is legally responsible for the monitoring, inspection and registration of designated centres for adults and children with a disability.  As of 31 December 2021, HIQA has a total of 1,407 registered centres providing either long-term residential care or overnight care.  To be fair to HIQA, I know when it receives a concern, it demonstrates action on the ground.  It has a good team.  It is a regulatory body and the watchdog.  It has the legislative basis on which to act.</p></speech>

That is what it said.  I am not criticising people or anything else, but I am just saying it feels its powers are limited when it is requested to do an investigation.  The authority also argues that for an individual complaint, it is also finding itself restricted.  Could that be looked at and, if necessary, could we have a discussion with HIQA to see what changes is it seeking to ensure it has adequate capacity to deal with issues as they arise, and in particular, matters relating to residential care and people with disabilities.</p></speech>

It is also important to say that if the matter is of a criminal nature, the family concerned also the right to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

As a separate addendum, there may be a conversation with HIQA.  I absolutely have a good working relationship with HIQA, and I will speak to the people in the authority.  This Bill is a transfer piece so we are looking to transfer the powers in question from the Minister dealing with health matters to the Minister dealing with equality matters.</p></speech>

If we start over and seek to give additional powers to HIQA, it could be 12 months down the road before we do so.  There may be an opportunity to deal with the matter at this stage.</p></speech>

HIQA can be kept under review.  Its powers can also come under review if that is necessary.  I will take all the Deputy's comments on board.  Any time we are dealing with delivery that is to support individuals in long-term residential or respite care, I will do whatever I can to bring more assistance.  I will absolutely work with HIQA on that but it does not come under this Bill.</p></speech>

It can be from Kerry to Donegal to the community healthcare organisations in my constituency in the greater Dublin area and Kildare.  There are cases that should not happen in those areas.</p><p>Situations continue to happen where people are at risk or where complaints have been made and nothing has changed.  People do not take the initiative of responding in the way in which they should and could respond, on the basis that they do not have responsibility or do not have direct responsibility.  A divided responsibility means no responsibility at all.  I am not suggesting for a minute that the Minister of State is part of that.  She is not.</p><p> The fact of the matter is that it reflects on us, as members of the health committee, when we debate a subject now, given the knowledge we have and the situation that exists in, for example, Kerry, in CHOs in various other constituencies and in Donegal, where nothing ever happens.  We continue just as we were.  It is not attributing blame to the Minister of State, but it is an attempt to recognise that things are happening around us that should not happen in a civilised society.  The investigation should be undertaken by whatever is the appropriate body and whoever is responsible.  I accept the Minister of State's notion that the health services can inspect private or public institutions without warning at the drop of a hat.  It is correct that they can do that.  However, they will always respond by saying, "Sorry, that is a private institution and we cannot do that".  Where do we go from here?</p><p> I believe the Minister of State's intentions are good, but we all are faced with reality.  I should mention something that came before us in recent times where an injustice is implied and there are legal implications.  I do not wish to identify it, but there is an onus on us, whenever we get the opportunity, to do something that seriously reacts to the situation that prevails, deals with it and gets it out of the way.</p></speech>

Sometimes it is the relationship with the provider, with the external, that is very important to understand.  It is very important for staff working within that care facility to know there are other organisations from which they can seek support.  It is not just the regulatory body, but the support could be from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla or social workers.  Sometimes that relationship is not understood.  In the past, perhaps, we have looked on everything through the medical lens and seen everything as an episode, whereas, in fact, there were patterns establishing.  However, because of the way we view the delivery of a disability service, we see it as a medical model.  Again, that is why I look forward to its transfer.</p> <p>  That is why I have continuously advocated in the past number of weeks for the publication of a particular report, the Brandon report, although we will not go into that now.  That is why in the past number of weeks, where we have seen an established pattern in the north west, there is the need for an independent review to understand that pattern and relationships.  I genuinely believe we do not understand patterns and relationships when it comes to the safeguarding of individuals in disability care settings.  If there was a comprehensive, independent, external safeguarding review carried out in same said location in the north west, we would take that learning.  It is not another report, but an independent review that I would like to oversee and deliver, whereby I would have assurances from my funder, the HSE, and the other providers that they understand safeguarding, patterns, relationships and how they would all work together to ensure the person at the centre gets the best possible care.  It is not seen as an episode but is seen, as it is dealt with, in the proper framework.  We can also reassure the families and rebuild the trust that when there is an adult loved one in residential or respite care, in the absence of legislation we would have regulation that would govern the delivery of the disability care settings and give back that trust.  I believe trust is damaged there at present.</p></speech>

It is serious, which is why I raised it.  It is getting more serious as time passes.  There is an onus on the providers of the service, wherever the service may be and whether it be the public health service, a private institution or institutions or a multiplicity of either or both, to be able to take responsibility for something that goes wrong or is alleged to have gone wrong and have it investigated in a way that is to the satisfaction of all concerned.  I am a long time in this House and I believe I have learned a great deal.  One of the things I have learned is that those who are providing a service need to take responsibility for something that goes wrong under their care or under their watch.</p></speech>

It appears to be a little strange.  It says that after the commencement of the section the Minister for Health will have been deemed to have performed the functions.  That appears to be drawing a line under things, saying that anything that was not done would be deemed to have been done.  That is my reading of it.  I would like a further explanation of what its purpose is, as it is a little strange.</p></speech>

Basically, my understanding is that legal advice was sought on that.  On the day when the transfer would occur, it is who is actually responsible.  My understanding is that is why it is included there.  It is where the responsibility is, as part of the transfer on the day.  The Minister of State will hopefully be doing that work on that day, but that is what it is about.  It is the legal piece.  They got legal advice on it because of the transfer on a particular day, any day.  If it is on the 3rd, the 4th or whatever day it is, if the transfer is taking place that legal piece is in place.  It is to provide for a situation where the Minister for Health might be doing something on the same day the transfer is going through.</p><p>He did that in the belief that he is still responsible and it is to protect.  The Minister for Health has done nothing wrong in actioning what he has done while the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth<b></b>could do it at 4 p.m. that evening.  It is a technical legal piece.  As we have a great working relationship, the Deputy need not worry.  I asked the same question and the provision is just to protect both Departments.</p></speech>

One should look at the commentary we have seen in the newspaper recently about the carry-on among the officials in the Department of Health and their dissatisfaction with the HSE and all of that.  It seems to imply that any unfinished business will be deemed to have been done and completed.  My interpretation of it is that this has been deep dipped and done.  There is a vast amount of unfinished business in the Department of Health.  Let us take for example the Brandon report, which originated in the Department of Health.  It has a long way to go, as the Minister of State has stated.  Who will be held responsible if issues arise about failures on the part of senior officials in the Department of Health or, indeed, the Minister?  How will these issues be dealt with?  It is that legacy stuff that I am concerned about.  I want an adequate way to bring either the Minister or officials to account and I do not follow the purpose of this section.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2022022300002#N00300"><p>I have similar concerns as Deputy Shortall.  There are countless situations where there will be attempts to complain that we are dealing with a different situation now than previously, that there are different responsibilities and that different people are responsible for what happened in the beginning.  There is no excuse at all.  I do not cast blame on the Minister of State and I believe that the system must answer for itself.  In fact, the system in some cases can work very effectively and can answer for itself.  Things may happen, things may be brought to public attention and things are dealt with.  In other situations, on the basis of real advice, nothing ever happens on the basis that some day the guilt is implied or otherwise.</p> <p>  We have had recent experiences, and members will know more about them next week, whereby members of the public make complaints about things that are not going in accordance with what they see as the norm, and where there is no responsibility taken seriously, where people know when something is going wrong, have been alerted to the fact that something is going wrong and nothing happens again.  The question at issue is whether nothing is allowed to continue to not happen, and to prevail in that after the transition and I think that there is a danger that that might happen.  People have done it before, and people have done it several times, where in order to protect people various people object to publications etc. on the basis that there is implicit guilt in reports.</p> <p>  To my mind, whatever the feelings of people are, if there is a situation developing where the rights of the individual are seriously undermined or abused, and people of a vulnerable nature are abused, and people are not dealt with in the way that they should be dealt with by anybody, by an individual or individuals, or institutions then we have a duty, a job and a responsibility, as members of the health committee, to respond to it even though others may not think that the response is necessary.  We must do so even though others may feel that we cannot do anything because there are legal implications here and so do nothing.  We cannot have a situation like that ongoing and going forward, we certainly cannot have it.  I completely agree with the points on that issue made by Deputy Shortall.  I hope that we do not have to go back again because even as we speak these things are happening so I do not in any way impugn the Minister of State in this regard.  The Minister of State is making every effort to deal with, control and take account of what is happening but there are those who do not and who defy the institutions, such as this committee, to do anything about it.  We cannot allow that to continue.</p></speech>

In a nutshell, when a function transfers, then it transfers warts and all.  I have been in the Department for the last 18 months and I have learned a lot from the experience.  I have learned that we produce an inert report and I can only see sight of it on a particular screen, as it is not published.  I agree with Deputy Durkan that there are times for getting under the bonnet and calling it out.  When we move to the new Department, it will be a case of putting the person at the centre, it will be the rights-based issue and it has to come with that approach.  The only way one can do that is when one has an open and transparent approach and that level of accountability.  I believe in that and I believe that the new Department is all about that.</p> <p>  To be fair to the Department of Health, with which I have worked closely over the last 18 months, its staff have supported me in that policy development piece while not having transferred and while supporting me in my transfer.  I have worked out of both Departments, while at all times wearing the rights-based hat albeit while working through a very medical lens.  Let us remember that this is what the Department of Health has funded for many years but that does bring problems.  There are problems.  There is no doubt but that there are systems that meet the medical needs but do not meet the rights-based needs.  I have referred to this already when I used the word "episodes".  That is how providers and care deliverers see certain things that happen in disabilities.  They see it through a medical lens.  We now need to see it more through a social care model and need to adopt a more holistic approach.</p> <p>  Yes, I am moving in the absence of safeguarding legislation but that comes down to a working relationship with the two Ministers.  I also have stated clearly that in the absence of legislation coming through the Department of Health, there is nothing to prevent the new Department from bringing forward its own regulations to address safeguarding in disability care settings.  We need to have a positive outlook as to where the shortfalls are and not be afraid to address them.  That piece is the technical piece.  Yet again, to talk to the piece mentioned by Deputy Durkan, we should not fall between two stools if somebody does something in the morning and it happens in the evenings.</p> <p>  I say to Deputy Shortall that there is a concern that nothing will happen on the day, that everything is done in good faith and that there will not be a twist in the tail.  I can only trust and believe in the officials of the Department of Health that nothing will go wrong and that what I have known to date will transfer with me because I know it warts and all and I know that there is nothing extra in it at the end.</p></speech>

I do not want us to find ourselves in a situation whereby in the case of something that happened six months ago and which ultimately and legally was the responsibility of the Minister for Health and, potentially, senior officials and the Secretary General in the Department, because this function is now transferring to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, we would have the Minister for Health saying it has nothing to do with him any more.  I mean especially where there have been things that could be described as scandals in the past and where it took some time to get to the bottom of that and establish where responsibility lies.  I am concerned that there would be an attempt to draw a line under that and the Brandon issue is a case in point.</p><p>We will not be able to ask questions of the Minister for Health anymore, even though the matter came within his remit at the time.  We will be told that it has nothing to do with the Department and that it is a matter for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  It strikes me that there is an aim to this section.  The actual wording is quite complex and, as a result, I find it hard to fully understand what that aim is.  Does the Minister of State have any more information on the delegation of functions when she moves to the other Department?  Did she have delegated functions in the Department of Health?  My fear is that there will be an absence of accountability at either the political or administrative level as a result of this section.  Can the Minister of State allay my concerns in that regard?</p></speech>

That is the first piece.  Within the Department of Health, I have had delegated functions as Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities.  To be fair to the Minister for Health, during the last 18 months for which I have been a Minister of State, he has been dealing with a pandemic so he has let me work on the disability portfolio side of things.  I hear exactly what the Deputy is saying.  She wants to know who this committee could ask questions of if something was to come up when the transfer is complete.  I would ask the exact same question.  She is right; a line is being drawn in the sand such that, after the transfer, the reporting Minister for these matters will be the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  If something happened within the last six months, 18 months or three years, the Minister to come before this committee to answer questions will be the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p></speech>

There have been too many incidents and situations in the past about which we can apparently do nothing because we were told there was a legal issue and that nothing can happen.  As long as nothing can happen, nothing will happen.  We have a serious responsibility to address issues that are emerging as they emerge.  There was one situation where colleagues raised a question and, if it had not been raised by them, the matter would not have been raised at all.  That particular situation was dealt with quickly, efficiently and effectively because it was raised.  I am sorry for going on about this more than once because I promised I would not come in again but I agree with Deputy Shortall.  An issue arises when we draw a line and end responsibility.  There is an issue there.  We had a number of issues before us and we will have more of them before us next week.  I have similar concerns about this section.</p></speech>

The policy responsibility transfers on foot of the transfer orders which are to be signed.  This section does not impact on that.  The whole transfer of functions will move disability policy responsibility, lock, stock and barrel, from the Minister for Health to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This legislation goes alongside those statutory instruments.  The Ministers and Secretaries Acts provide for the transfer of functions.  A transfer of functions order will be signed which will transfer the functions.  This legislation provides for accountability to go along with those functions because it would not be appropriate to transfer over &euro;2.3 billion worth of expenditure and all of the significant responsibilities the Minister carries without giving him or her all of these powers.  That will happen.</p> <p>  It is not my decision to make the transfer but my understanding is that there is no intent to avoid holding people to account.  From legal advice, my understanding is that this section and section 63 are included to guard against such instances as something happening on the day of the transfer, the Minister writing to HIQA to ask for this terrible thing that occurred in this centre to be investigated but that letter being null and void because the Minister did not have the power to make such a request, the transfer having happened that morning.  In legal terms, this is called a saver section.  It means that something the Minister does is deemed to be lawful provided he believed he had the powers to do it when he did it.  There is no intention to somehow allow the Minister for Health to continuing carrying out his functions subsequently because section 65 provides that all of the powers being transferred cease the minute the transfer happens.  This is not some sort of back door to allow the Minister for Health to somehow retain these powers.  They will cease.  If the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth decided to write a letter directing that something be done before the actual transfer had not been signed - perhaps it was to be signed a few a hours later - he would not have had the power to do so at that moment.  Our legal advice tells us that the inclusion of these sections protects and safeguards against that.</p> <p>  I do not believe the sections will ever be used.  I think we would be okay if they were not included.  They are just included out of an abundance of caution.  It provides a particular safeguard.  What the Deputy has talked about will happen as a result of the transfer more generally.  As she has said, if the committee wishes to call in a Minister or an official to ask some questions, it will be the Minister or officials of the relevant policy Department who are called in.  Once the transfer happens, that will be a different Department.  However, it is not these particular sections that achieve that but the transfer itself.</p></speech>

I have to leave the meeting because there is something else coming up.  I am still not getting the answers I wanted.  I do not know about Deputy Shortall but I am sure she will speak for herself in this regard.  I have to say that I am worried the current unacceptable situation may continue in the future or may not be addressed as a result of this changeover and that this may facilitate and assist wrongdoers.  We cannot have that.  That cannot happen and should not happen.  It would be a sad reflection on the committee if it did happen in the aftermath.</p> <p>  That is all I want to say.  I will not come in anymore but I do have concerns because there are those who say that there are things happening throughout the system that are of concern to an awful lot of people, that the system is breaking down, that the system of reportage is not sufficient, that there are too many blockages and stoppages and too many things happening that hold everything up and that we are in some way afraid to investigate certain things.  We are not afraid to investigate nor were we every afraid to investigate in the past.  I was in the system before, as was Deputy Shortall, and we did investigate, even where we were told we did not have any jurisdiction.  We now have to deal with those situations, without exception.  That is all I want to say.</p></speech>

The language in this section is quite convoluted.  It is open to a different interpretation from that provided by Mr. McGreal.  It allows that a function of the Minister for Health under the principal Act to be deemed to have been validly performed by the Minister after the commencement of this section.

Sna blianta beaga amach romhainn, beimid ag iarraidh a bheith ag obair i gcomhph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht leis na hoifigigh phlean&aacute;la teanga at&aacute; sna limist&eacute;ir phlean&aacute;la teanga, sna bailte seirbh&iacute;se agus sna l&iacute;onra&iacute; le cur le l&iacute;on na siopa&iacute; agus ar nd&oacute;igh leis an &eacute;ileamh sna siopa&iacute; sin ar leabhair Gaeilge.</p><p> Is iad na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in is m&oacute; at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair ar nd&oacute;igh n&aacute; na hacmhainn&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il againn chun na tr&iacute; r&eacute;imse - an fhoilsitheoireacht, an scr&iacute;bhneoireacht agus an l&eacute;itheoireacht - a fhorbairt.  T&aacute; luach na n-acmhainn&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il ag Foras na Gaeilge sa r&eacute;imse seo laghdaithe 42% nuair a chuirtear boilsci&uacute; san &aacute;ireamh &oacute; bh&iacute; 2008 ann.  In 2008, nuair a th&aacute;inig Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge isteach i bhForas na Gaeilge, bh&iacute; &euro;1.8 milli&uacute;n ar f&aacute;il do chl&aacute;r na leabhar Gaeilge in&aacute;r mbuis&eacute;ad, buis&eacute;ad at&aacute; imeallaithe agus a thagann &oacute;n Rialtas &oacute; Dheas amh&aacute;in.  N&iacute; thagann s&eacute; faoi rialacha Thuaidh-Theas Fhoras na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; an buis&eacute;ad bliant&uacute;il sin laghdaithe anois go &euro;1.06 milli&uacute;n, go d&iacute;reach os cionn milli&uacute;n.  Is &eacute; sin comhionann lena bheith gearrtha ina dh&aacute; leath.  Is rud &eacute; sin a fh&aacute;gann nach f&eacute;idir m&oacute;r&aacute;n forbartha a dh&eacute;anamh sna r&eacute;ims&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la a bhfuil taca&iacute;ocht de dh&iacute;th iontu.  Nuair a chuirtear toradh an bhoilscithe san &aacute;ireamh, t&aacute; an taca&iacute;ocht is f&eacute;idir linn a chur ar f&aacute;il thar na tr&iacute; r&eacute;imse sin laghdaithe ar bhealach suntasach.</p><p> Mar sin f&eacute;in, f&aacute;ilt&iacute;mid go m&oacute;r roimh an maoini&uacute; breise aon uaire a cuireadh ar f&aacute;il d&uacute;inn in 2022.  Fuaireamar &euro;300,000 sa bhreis le caitheamh ar r&eacute;ims&iacute; foilsitheoireachta agus scr&iacute;bhneoireachta.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, agus muid ag iarraidh aghaidh a thabhairt ar na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in a bhaineann le hearn&aacute;il na leabhar, t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach a aithint go bhfuil gach cuid di ag brath ar an gcuid eile.  T&aacute; an fhoilsitheoireacht ag brath ar an scr&iacute;bhneoireacht agus t&aacute; an scr&iacute;bhneoireacht ag brath ar an fhoilsitheoireacht.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir le ceachtar acu bl&aacute;th&uacute; n&aacute; forbairt gan pobal l&eacute;itheoireachta bisi&uacute;il a bheith ar f&aacute;il agus gan beala&iacute; againn leis na leabhair sin a dh&iacute;ol agus a chur ar f&aacute;il sna siopa&iacute;.</p></speech>

Ag f&eacute;achaint s&iacute;os orthu &oacute;n &aacute;it at&aacute; mise ag su&iacute;, t&aacute; siad den scoth.  T&aacute; sean-aithne agamsa ar fhoilsitheoireacht toisc go bhfuil m'athair gafa leis.

L&eacute;irigh Foras na Gaeilge ar leathanach 5 an r&eacute;imse litr&iacute;ochta agus na leabhair at&aacute; ann.  Cad &eacute; an compar&aacute;id idir sin agus na leabhair at&aacute; foilsithe i mB&eacute;arla?  As an 450 leabhar a foils&iacute;odh le c&uacute;ig bliana anuas, leabhair fil&iacute;ochta iad 71 acu; leabhair p&aacute;ist&iacute; iad 59 acu; agus &uacute;rsc&eacute;alta iad 46 acu.

Rinne na finn&eacute;ithe d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le roinnt de na ceisteanna eile a bh&iacute; agam.

T&aacute; s&eacute; go huile is go hioml&aacute;n ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar an margadh idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.  Siopa leabhar Gaeilge amh&aacute;in at&aacute; i gceist.

T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go h&aacute;irithe go mbeidh na siopa&iacute; Gaeilge &aacute;balta an margadh sin a bheith acu gan oibrithe St&aacute;it, macasamhail Fhoras na Gaeilge, ag teacht isteach air.  Is leis na siopa&iacute; amh&aacute;in a mb&iacute;mid ag pl&eacute; leo.<br/><br/>Tagra&iacute;m don ch&eacute;ad cheist faoi dhaoine &oacute;ga ag bogadh ar aghaidh.  Sin ceist na nd&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; ar&iacute;s ar bhealach.  T&aacute; m&eacute;id &aacute;irithe d&eacute;anta leis an margadh sin.  Luadh Roald Dahl agus daoine mar sin.  T&aacute; leaganacha Gaeilge de <i>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</i>, <i>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</i>, dialann Anne Frank agus leabhair den chine&aacute;l seo curtha ar f&aacute;il.  T&aacute; d&uacute;shl&aacute;in ann i gc&oacute;na&iacute; maidir leis sin.

Do chuid mh&oacute;r acu, go h&aacute;irithe lucht na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, is &iacute; an dara teanga acu n&aacute; an Ghaeilge agus b&iacute;onn d&uacute;shl&aacute;in ar leith i dtaca leis sin d&oacute;ibh.<br/><br/>Th&aacute;inig sraith &uacute;rsc&eacute;alta amach &oacute;n gcomhairle churaclaim &oacute; Thuaidh a bh&iacute; d&iacute;rithe ar lucht na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta &oacute; Thuaidh agus a bh&iacute; ar f&aacute;il do Ghaeilgeoir&iacute; ar fud na t&iacute;re ar nd&oacute;igh.

T&aacute; s&eacute; sin ar bun ag an Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n Adams.  Is cinnte gur fi&uacute; &eacute; sin.

Is minic a luann daoine a l&eacute;igh iad agus iad &oacute;g &eacute; sin liom.  N&iacute; fol&aacute;ir d&uacute;inn cuimhneamh go raibh an Ghaeilge l&aacute;rnach i saol na t&iacute;re agus i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; scola&iacute;ochta an uair sin.  Nuair a th&aacute;inig an ch&eacute;ad leabhar leis ar an bhf&oacute;d, in 1942, bh&iacute; an-&eacute;ileamh go deo air.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Cathaoirleach, bh&iacute; c&uacute;pla leabhar in aghaidh na bliana &aacute; gcur amach aige.  De r&eacute;ir a ch&eacute;ile, thr&aacute;igh an t-&eacute;ileamh sin ar na leabhair.  Faoi dheireadh, nuair a cuireadh an leabhar deireanach leis amach in 1984, bh&iacute; an tsuim a bh&iacute; ag daoine sna leabhair athraithe.  Bh&iacute; an Ghaeilge leis ruaigthe n&oacute; imeallaithe &oacute;n &aacute;it l&aacute;rnach a bh&iacute; aici sa ch&oacute;ras scola&iacute;ochta sa t&iacute;r roimhe sin.

The specific theme of today's meeting is to discuss online disinformation and media literacy.  Ms Haugen is very welcome and I thank her for joining the meeting today despite time differences and everything else.  There is huge interest in what she has to say to the committee.  As she knows, we have been working on the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  We have heard a lot of what she has had to say through the media internationally and in Ireland.  Ms Haugen is very welcome and we look forward to hearing what she has to say.  I hope she can bear with me as I have some housekeeping to go through.</p> <p>  I remind members the format of the meeting is that I will invite our witness to deliver her opening speech, which has been limited to five minutes, and this will be followed by questions from the members.  The committee may publish the opening statement on our web page.  Before I invite Ms Haugen to deliver her opening speech, I want to explain some limitations on parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards to references made to other persons in evidence.</p> <p>  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Ms Haugen is reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that she should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if her statement is potentially defamatory in relation to any identifiable person or entity, she will be directed to discontinue her remarks.  Witnesses participating in the committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should be mindful of their domestic law and how it may applied to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present in the confines of Leinster House to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit members to attend unless they adhere to that constitutional requirement.</p> <p>  I remind members if contributing via Microsoft Teams to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report.  I ask members to mute their microphones when they are not contributing to reduce the background noise.  I remind them to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or on silent.</p> <p>  It is a pleasure to have Ms Haugen with us today, albeit virtually.  We know she is speaking to us from the other side of the world and we very much appreciate her taking the time to be with us.  This particular debate and conversation with the committee is on disinformation, misinformation and online platforms.  We are really looking forward to hearing Ms Haugen's views and ideas on obligations we may mandate on social media platforms to protect users.  This is the main ethos and theme of our discussion.  With this, I open the floor to Ms Haugen and ask her to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am excited to be here.  My name is Frances Haugen.  Last year I left my job at Facebook as I felt I could no longer be part of a system which harms children, stokes division and weakens our democracies.  I disclosed what I felt governments and the public should know about what is happening within these social media giants and the deliberate choices they make to maximise their profits at the expense of public safety and the never-ending pursuit of growth at any cost.  I hope my revelations have been valuable for committees such as this one.</p> <p>  It is clear governments all over the world had been searching for answers about how to tackle some of the biggest issues of the day and how to protect their citizens and their democracies, but they did not have enough information even to ask the right questions let alone write the answers.  This is beginning to change, with European nations leading the way in developing game-changing online safety regimes.  As the European home to some of the most powerful companies in the world, Ireland has a unique role to play in holding these companies to account.</p> <p>  As the online safety Bill acknowledges, self-regulation of social media has not worked.  Platforms cannot be trusted to act in the public interest.  They are often, as my revelations showed, fully aware of the harms caused by their products and services and yet choose to ignore these in favour of growth and profit.  The Bill is an important intervention, as is the EU Digital Services Act.  Both regimes say "enough is enough".  Their alignment is critical, not least because Ireland will need to implement the Digital Services Act but also because regulatory fragmentation does nothing to help Irish citizens.  It only creates complexity and uncertainty at a time when what we really need is clarity.  The Digital Services Act and Ireland&rsquo;s online safety Bill should align on key principles that allow quick, effective regulatory implementation.</p> <p>  There is, of course, no silver bullet to make the Internet safer.  The challenge is how to make things easier and not harder.  Alignment between Ireland and the EU will be crucial in smoothing this path.  Part of this alignment is about how to develop robust rights-respecting regimes that go to the heart of the business model of platforms, addressing the algorithms and design features that enable the spread of disinformation and hate.  We all want Ireland&rsquo;s Bill to succeed, and to do so it must focus less on content and more on how that content is shared, spread and amplified.  It is the systems of these platforms that should be the top priority and not the content.  These are systems that promote harm, target people with conspiracy theories and drive people to hate and abuse.  We cannot simply rely on the deletion or criminalisation of harmful content.  This is not only because it risks infringing on free speech but because it does not work.  Regulatory regimes that have focused solely on deleting content have failed.  There is just too much out there.</p> <p>  We have seen too many examples of how hypervirality and amplification of lies and hate can lead to division and polarisation online, and violence and harm offline.</p><p>The US insurrection and Covid infodemic are just a couple.  However, this is far from just a western issue.  In fact, some of the most egregious harms caused by the decisions made in the shiny glass headquarters in Facebook in Dublin have been in faraway places like Myanmar and Ethiopia.  The ethnic violence fuelled by Facebook in those countries are the opening chapters of a book too horrific to read.</p><p> That is why I came forward.  I can no longer be part of such a company.  It is also why I am urging the Irish Government to reflect deeply on its own role and on the responsibilities that come with housing these social media manipulation machines.  An important live decision currently rests with Ireland. </p><p> A few Rohingya youth from Myanmar have filed a complaint with the OECD national contact point in Ireland demanding justice for the genocidal violence unleashed against their community.  They are desperate for financial support to be able to continue their studies from refugee camps in Bangladesh.  Facebook has admitted it failed to stop horrific hate speech in Myanmar on its platform.  The UN concluded Facebook played a &ldquo;determining role&rdquo; in fuelling hate against the Rohingya.  Despite this, this trillion dollar company refuses to provide any meaningful remedy for fuelling violence, while pouring money into video games and virtual reality.  That is why these Rohingya youth are now appealing to Ireland to intervene.</p><p> Ireland has been part of the OECD for 50 years and has committed to promoting its standards for responsible business conduct.  It rests with Ireland to evaluate the facts and decide whether it will promote justice or the interests of a trillion-dollar profit machine.  I am hopeful that Ireland will do what the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, promised when Ireland got a seat at the UN Security Council, which was to champion "peace and security, conflict resolution and reconciliation."</p><p> Finally, as Ireland sets up the new regulator for its online safety regime, I would urge it to learn lessons from the criticisms of its other digital regulator, the Data Protection Commission, DPC.  The DPC is widely considered to have stepped back from its responsibilities in properly enforcing general data protection regulation, GDPR.  The tech companies on Ireland's shores, once again, got away with it.  As Ireland creates an independent, robust and effective online safety regulator, it must launch an independent review into the DPC so that it too can start to enforce the law thoroughly and boldly.</p><p> Governments and citizens around the world will be watching Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory regime closely.  It is reassuring that members are taking this agenda seriously, and I urge them to lead by example when holding these companies to account.  Members have the power and responsibility not only to improve the online safety of Irish citizens, but of people across the world.</p></speech>

We appreciate her sharing that with us.  I will now turn to my colleagues, who have seven minutes for questions and answers.  I ask them to be mindful of that.  I remind Ms Haugen that members of this committee have seven minutes, so within that time they will probably move quickly through their questions to try to get short answers if at all possible to cut to the crux of the issue we are trying to discuss.</p> <p>  On that note, I will call the first speaker, Senator Cassells.</p></speech>

In it, she talked about governments not having enough information to even ask the right questions, let alone get the right answers.  She has helped us with the questions.</p> <p>  Ms Haugen spoke on our national radio station at the weekend and said that, in tackling the tech giants, a regulator would need at least 20 algorithm experts at their disposal who understand deep product expertise and how the small choices made in those systems interact and hold those systems accountable.  However, as she said, there is no undergraduate course to help train these young students.  They trained inhouse by Facebook.</p> <p>  Last night in our Seanad, I asked our Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media the following question.  Even if we pass the legislation in this country, are we fighting with one hand behind our back because we will not have the algorithm experts on the public pay roll to fight against companies that make a &euro;40 billion profit and can attract those people to come work for them?  As I said to the Minister, we would need to break into the chocolate factory and steal the Oompa-Loompas to get the magic formula to be able to fight Facebook.  Are we fighting with one hand behind our back?</p></speech>

I want to give people a little bit of context on how difficult it is to hire people who have deep algorithmic expertise and understand not just machine learning, but what those consequences are on the effects of, specifically, socially media platforms.  I would guess there is of the order of, perhaps, 200 or 300 people in the world who have the level of depth of expertise in how these systems holistically work that could even be hired.  The idea that Ireland will be able to go out on the world stage and pay market-competitive salaries to specialists such as this is an undue burden on the Irish people.  I do not think it is responsible to force all of the cost for an effective regulator only on the Irish taxpayer.</p></speech>

From a political point of view and, in particular, from the point of view of the political system in Ireland, where we have parties that are prepared to fan the hate and distort facts, is Ms Haugen confident that the rewarding of such hate still continues?  She mentioned the shiny glass offices of Facebook in Dublin.  Is Facebook following at a high level the fallout from rewarding such actions and how, through the promotion of this, it could change the course of future general elections, even in small countries such as Ireland?</p></speech>

Facebook never set out to sow discord or to pull us apart.  It never designed that.  It never thought that society was too stable, so it should pull people apart.  No one did that.  It faced a business problem that people were producing less and less content over time on Facebook and Instagram, which is a natural course for all social medial platforms.  It did studies trying to figure out how it could incentivise and elicit people to produce more content.  What it found by experimenting on people - treating them as test subjects and trying different ways of stimulating them to make more content - was that by giving them more likes, comments, re-shares and more engagement incentivised them to produce more content.  Unfortunately, when it started promoting optimising for engagement - those reactions - instead of just optimising for how much time someone spent on site, it had a side effect of ending up giving more distribution to more extreme content.  This is because the shortest path to a reaction is hatred.</p> <p>  The real question we are examining here is why Facebook did not act when it found out this was happening back in 2018.  At this point, it has been four years since this change happened.  Yet, it knew almost immediately.  Within less than six month, it sent researchers into Europe to talk to political parties and found that across Europe, people knew it changed the algorithm.  They said they used to be able to distribute content, such as a White Paper on agricultural policy - things that did not get the most clicks or most comments - and that people did not fight in the comment threads about the agricultural policy.  However, that stuff is important.  That is what society is built on.  Now, when we try to share that, we get no distribution.</p></speech>

It is slightly worse than that.  When those same researchers asked local parties how they felt about it, the political parties said repeatedly, across Europe, they were not happy about it because they are running positions now that they know their own constituents do not like, but those are the ones that get distribution on social media.  Therefore, it is influencing the ballot box even before we get to vote.</p></speech>

Obviously, money is where this is all at.  Something that our Bill has not tackled is an outright ban on junk food or gambling advertisements.  It is a very complex thing.  However, junk food and online gambling are two areas in society where there is massive revenue being generated.  From a Government point of view, should we be looking towards an outright ban on these products?</p></speech>

Ms Haugen mentioned the Irish Government's responsibility, "which come with housing these social media manipulating machines", which is a very strong statement.

Even though Europe has led the way in terms of robust, strong regulations around issues such as privacy, unfortunately, Ireland has faced a challenge in that it is falling behind in terms of enforcing that law.  The Irish people have an opportunity here to really show that they can stand up to these giants but we need to change the pattern because thus far, GDPR has not demonstrated that Ireland is willing to fund and hold to account Irish tech companies when it comes to tech regulations.</p></speech>

Moments such as Cambridge Analytica, the documentary "The Social Dilemma" and Ms Haugen's testimony to Congress give us an insight into what goes on under the hood of big tech giants.  What Ms Haugen is doing is very powerful.  I thank her for that, which, probably, is something whistleblowers need to hear that from legislators.</p> <p>  I had also intended to ask Ms Haugen about Ireland's reputation in the tech world but I will instead move to the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 which, as mentioned by my colleague, commenced in the Seanad last night.  As of publication, the Bill does not include an individual complaints mechanism for citizens who have exhausted all avenues with social media companies to find some resolution or a mechanism for the State to help that citizen to find a resolution.  Given Ms Haugen's experience in this industry, why is it necessary to have that mechanism?</p></speech>

Teenagers facing eating disorders and people who have experienced other types of mental health harms from social media are the victims of violence facilitated by social media.  I support the formation of a class mechanism because I believe there needs to be a way for individuals affected by social media to come forward.  At the same time, I do not support an individual mechanism because I worry that any regulator that Ireland might establish would be swamped by complaints.  There needs to be a way for people to bring forward their grievances but it needs to be in a way that scales so as not to overwhelm the system.</p></speech>

I agree that there are harms that currently are not represented either by specific safety Bills or are not being addressed by the social media companies.  At the same time, it is important to think about the life journey of a complaint.  It is not just about someone being bullied, it is about how we find the appropriate remedies for that bullying.  By beginning to form together in classes, we can have more robust conversations on where should be the systemic interventions and how these products need to be changed.</p></speech>

We are so far behind in discussing regulation in that we are still talking about looking at the 2D flatscreen while big tech, as Ms Haugen has acknowledged, is pumping money not into safety but into ploughing ahead with a version of the Internet that we are inside, that is a very immersive experience in terms of how we participate in meetings, parties, the gym and so on.  Questions have surfaced about its harms and the safety of people, in particular women and children.  Will measures such as the Digital Services Act and similar legislation to be introduced here in terms of a regulatory framework mark the beginning of governments being able to keep pace with big tech?  Will we ever be a match for it or will that be done by citizens taking action such as boycotting various platforms, choosing email providers that protect our data and messaging Apps that value our privacy?  Can we keep apace with regulation?</p></speech>

My concern in regard to Ireland's Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 is that it strongly focuses on content, that is, what content should be illegal, what type of content should be taken down and so on.  As stated by the Senator, we are having conversations about 2D screens when Facebook-Meta is trying to shift the conversation to this immersive metaverse video game kind of world.  What the Digital Services Act does well is that it focuses on risk assessments and the idea that what we need to do here is figure out how to close the feedback loop.  Currently, nobody but Facebook can see behind the curtain of its business.  Academics cannot study it and citizens cannot see more than their individual experience.  At present, there is no feedback loop whereby if something goes wrong on Facebook, anyone other than Facebook can observe it or suggest corrections.  The Digital Services Act's risk assessments close that circle.  It states that companies need to start disclosing what the risks are and they also need to be able to listen to concerns from NGOs and Governments and to state what those mitigations are going to be and have them assessed by an independent party.  A feedback loop would allow us to begin to shift the process and the way in which these systems work from being optimised for growth and profit to something that is more in the public good.  </p> <p>  The Senator spoke of the idea that individuals needed to be the solution.  That is not expansive enough to be able to help society in the way it needs to be helped.  I cannot overemphasise how addictive these products are.  Facebook's documents demonstrate that some of the most vulnerable people in our societies are the ones who get sucked the furthest down the rabbit hole.  Some of the characteristics that put people most at risk to being hyper-exposed to misinformation include the recent death of a spouse, being recently widowed, a move to a new city or the person being recently divorced.  It is the idea that when people are feeling the most vulnerable, they turn to this quick social fix, they turn to the online community instead of the in-person community.  The idea that individuals are the solution and they should boycott it is really dangerous.  It risks us leaving behind those who most need our care and need to be reintegrated into the community.</p></speech>

I fear that what we get to see is really only scratching the surface in terms of how we are being manipulated.</p><p>I do not know if we, despite the best efforts of Ms Haugen and many others, are able to comprehend the level of manipulation that is happening.</p><p> I will jump straight into my questions.  I spoke to someone the other day who said they believe that the Internet will ultimately be fully encrypted.  There is much conversation around Facebook and encrypting Messenger, etc.  Does Ms Haugen think that the ultimate right to privacy, via this encryption, comes at the cost of safety?  There are obviously many concerns around child welfare, etc.  Does Ms Haugen think that the ultimate goal of encryption in the Internet will have a cost to safety?</p></speech>

It is important for us to understand how product choices, when integrated together, influence the impacts of encryption.  I strongly support the individual's right to access to encrypted communications.  The only chat app that gives me my core social media is Signal, which is an open-source form of encrypted messaging.  At the same time, we need to understand how product choices can increase the risk of encryption.  For example, let us contrast Signal and Facebook Messenger.  In the case of Facebook Messenger, you get a direct line to a giant catalogue of whatever people you want.  On Signal, if you want to talk to a 13-year-old, you will have to find that 13-year-old&rsquo;s phone number.  In the case of Facebook, you can go and follow whatever the latest meme is, find a group about that meme and then you will find a bunch of middle school kids.  You can go on Instagram and do the same thing.  We need to think about the interactions between systems.  We need to begin to think creatively about what tools we can provide to children in those encrypted spaces.  Therefore, I do not think this is a binary trade-off between X and Y.  This is why risk assessments are really important.  If we allow companies to build and progress on an encrypted pathway without having had conversations with the public, we will never build in systems that say, "Hey, there's a bunch of these different tools that we could be providing to children in encrypted spaces".  Yes, it will cost companies a little bit of money to develop them, but that is how we can make sure that we can have both safety and encryption.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Haugen.  That will be useful for thinking about things going forward.  I want to jump to what Ms Haugen mentioned previously around online safety rules that focus on subject matter in a linguistically diverse world.  Can Ms Haugen elaborate a little more on that?  It is an interesting point.  Linguistic diversity is a global situation.  For example, there are words that are used in Northern Ireland that would be considered quite insulting, but in the Republic of Ireland they are not.</p></speech>

We spoke before about the idea that because Facebook operates behind a curtain, it gets to set the rules of conversation.  The ways we are talking about safety today have been shaped by Facebook's PR machine.  They have put the focus on the idea that AI and censorship, or the removal of content, is the solution.  They have said that the arguments we should be having are not about whether Facebook should be able to operate in the dark but about whether we are taking down too much content, or if we need to take down more.  They know that when we argue about censorship, we will never come to agreement.  However, we could have a conversation about the rules of the road, for example about whether Facebook should be allowed to operate without us being able to ask questions, but they do not want to have that conversation.  Therefore, when Facebook comes out and talks about AI as the solution, they are saying that they can come in and write a magical hate speech classifier or violence inciting classifier.  A classifier is a machine learning system or an artificial intelligence system.  It allows you to say that a post is inciting violence, so it must be taken down.  Facebook's own research says this strategy is deeply limited because language is nuanced.  As the Senator said, a sentence that could be totally innocuous in one part of a country could be very different and defamatory in a different part of it.</p> <p>  Even for American English - let alone Irish English, British English or Indian English - it can only take down 3% to 5% of hate speech.  Facebook's own documents said that because of these nuances in language, in a best-case scenario it would only be able to take down 10% to 20% of hate speech.  This is for the languages in which Facebook has chosen to invest.  What they did not tell the world was that in order to have artificial intelligence keep us safe, you have to rewrite those systems over and over again in each individual language.  Think of how many member states exist in Europe.  Think about how many languages exist in Europe.  Think of how many dialects exist in Europe.  A dialect has to be retrained.  Facebook has chosen not to invest in all the languages of Europe.  It has definitely not chosen to invest in all the dialects in Europe.</p> <p>  In 2018, Mark Zuckerberg wrote about engagement-based ranking, which is a kind of ranking whereby Facebook sees if it can get you to react more and rewards content that gets you to react more.  He said that is dangerous because people are subconsciously drawn to extreme content.  Even when Facebook asks people afterwards if they enjoyed this content, they say they did not.  Subconsciously, our brains are evolved to be drawn to that content.  This is super dangerous.  It is disrespectful to a linguistically diverse world.  Instead, we need to focus on how the algorithms work because those changes can apply to every single language and dialect separately.  What was the Senator&rsquo;s next question?</p></speech>

She has also referenced the situation in Ethiopia.  Could she elaborate?  I am interested in whether Facebook Ireland, specifically, could have prevented those situations.  How did Facebook Inc. fail to protect these people?  If it can happen there, it can happen anywhere else.  It is happening in other places.  I am interested to hear Ms Haugen&rsquo;s thoughts on exactly what role we specifically in Ireland had around the atrocity, as well as what we should or could have done with the powers we have, considering that the HQ is here.</p></speech>

When I was visiting France, as part of my visit in the fall, almost every single governmental minister who I met in France - and I met a bunch - almost every single one asked the exact same question.  They asked me whether I knew how many moderators speak French.  They said they had been asking for years, but Facebook would not tell them.  The reason Facebook will not tell them is because the number is so small that on certain pie charts. where they list all the money that is being spent on hate speech, there is no slice for French.  This is an interesting question.  The French authorities cannot get answers when they ask a basic question about many people Facebook has staffed to keep people who speak the French language safe.  I think approximately 1 billion people in the world speak French.  This is a major language.  If the French authorities cannot get the answer to that question, or if they cannot ensure there are enough moderators, how is a small ethnic group on the other side of the world supposed to get a minimal level of safety?</p> <p>  I will give a concrete example of how Ireland could have stepped in.  Ireland could have stepped in and said it was taking a leadership role to ensure a basic level of safety is ensured for platforms that exist in the country.  It could have said that Facebook had to disclose how many people were supporting each language in each dialect, because then we could have had a conversation about it.  If that had happened, it would have been disclosed that only one person in the company spoke Burmese.  That was one of the things that came out of the UN report.  You could also imagine a world where Ireland said it would start staffing a complaint hotline for people who work inside the company.  In the United States, if I work at a hospital, there will be a sign up in my break room saying, "Did you see something that endangered patient health?  Call this number."</p> <p>  When I worked in counter-espionage at Facebook, I was literally on the other side of state actors who were trying to weaponise the platform to hurt other nations.  I did not know who in the government I could call for help.  We know that content moderators are on the front line of basic safety for people.  Someone might be getting stalked or threatened.  Moderators are the first line of safety.  Many of them are staffed out of Dublin.  Imagine if Ireland had provided a phone number and said that if you believe someone is in danger, you can call this line and we will make sure someone at least listens to you.  That could have been an avenue for the Facebook employee who was trying to raise the alarm about the Rohingya, but did not have a chain of command that they could escalate it up to.  The UN found that this employee did not feel heard.  Those are small, little things that Ireland could do.  It could require minimal transparency, at least, and provide a helpline for people who see things that are problematic.  </p></speech>

She has done the world a great service and it is important that is acknowledged.  This meeting is a good opportunity for us to consult her and hear her views.  Today we are having a good, moderate and reasonable discussion, with some good contributions from my colleagues but it is not likely to be amplified on Facebook.  Someone would have to say something ridiculous or extremist to get more attention but more people need to be engaged in this area.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about online anonymity, particularly in the context of Facebook and Meta.  What efforts have been made to reduce the element of anonymity?  How difficult would it be for them to clamp down on it?  When I was launching my "like" page, I had to produce my passport and basically tell them what I had for breakfast but one does not have to do that across the board.  Indeed, with some social media platforms, the lack of individual tracing is just ridiculous.  Has there been a real effort on the part of Facebook to look into this area more?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.718" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Frances Haugen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022022300002#E00400"><p>I understand the attraction of wanting to decrease anonymity on platforms like this.  I have heard a lot of different people suggest that we should have identification verification for all people on social media platforms.  However, one of the important things to remember is that we live in a really diverse world.  In most parts of the world, there are not computerised systems where we can verify an ID, where we can say "Here's a picture of an ID, let's make sure that person is the same person.".  As long as we live in a world where we cannot actually confirm with any computer method the ID of people, we are going to have a situation where someone who wants to get around any enforcement system will just use a virtual public network, VPN.  A VPN is a little pipeline that allows an individual to access the Internet from a different place in the world.  People can just pretend that they are coming from one of those places and can get an account that is not traceable.  Either we exclude those parts of the world from the system, which is not equitable, or we accept that making sure we know who people are online is extremely difficult.  I do not think it is realistically going to happen any time in the future.</p> <p>  The second thing is that platforms actually have a huge amount of information on people and companies like Facebook should have to work with governmental officials who provide things like search warrants.  They should be fast and transparent in providing relevant information when a crime has occurred, for example.  </p> <p>  There are two sides to this issue.  First, it is very difficult to confirm people's ID online and we should not pretend that this is a magic bullet.  Second, companies should disclose the information that they do have.  They know, for example, where people access things from and they can infer lots of things about people's friends.  They should disclose the information they do have when, for example, a warrant is presented and should not stonewall people.</p></speech>

This is possibly more pertinent this week than other weeks and in that context, I wish to ask about Facebook's relationship with Russia.  What is happening at the moment in Ukraine is incredibly worrying and could be destabilising for the whole world, not just for Europe.  What is the nature of Facebook's relationship with Russia?  Has any effort been made to clamp down on nationalistic and jingoistic online commentary that can be very damaging and that we have seen in countries like Myanmar, Ethiopia and all across the world?  Does Ms Haugen have any specific information in that regard in the context of the current geopolitical crisis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.720" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Frances Haugen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022022300002#E00600"><p>There is a major national security problem with Facebook with regard to lack of transparency.  How does transparency relate to national security?  Usually when one thinks of national security, one thinks of secrets.  In the case of Facebook, it is important to compare what information it shares with researchers versus what information other comparable platforms like Twitter share.  I worked within the threat intelligence part of Facebook, with the people who are the first line of defence for finding information and influence operations.  This is a very commonly used technique by Russia for influencing how politics works in neighbouring countries and in other places around the world.  It is also used by China, Iran and many major adversaries who have decided to weaponise one of the most powerful things about western countries, which is their openness.  When I worked within the threat intelligence team, I saw a gross level of understaffing.  Facebook kept itself behind a curtain.  Twitter has said it will make 10% of all public tweets available to anyone in the world to research.  It is called the Firehose.  I was shocked to find out that many influence operations on Facebook were caught via Twitter because Twitter made data available but Facebook refused to do so.  People would analyse tweets and find networks.  They would find sets of accounts that acted in co-ordinated ways to spread messages that destabilised places like Ukraine.  People would then take those networks' IP addresses, give them to Facebook and point out that the accounts have the same names on Facebook and that the IP addresses are operating from the same places on Facebook.  It is unacceptable that we have to rely on Twitter's good actions to keep us safe with Facebook.  That is why any online safety realm must include safe harbour for researchers.  Facebook is suing researchers who try to keep Facebook safe.  It also needs to include mandatory, enforced transparency, like the Digital Services Act does.  Unless we have enforced transparency, we will not adequately find those influence operations that Russia uses to destabilise free societies.</p></speech>

Think about it; we do not let children grade their own homework because humans are humans.  Sometimes we need to cut corners.  Sometimes we are stressed with other things.  Facebook has only had to report publicly its profit and loss position, its expenses and that is what is optimised for.  Facebook has lots of small solutions that would have radically reduced things like misinformation or inflammatory content, including things like requiring users to click on a link before resharing content, which Twitter did.  Has anyone been censored by that action?  Has anyone been oppressed because they had to click on a link before resharing?  No, but Facebook chose not to do that because it decreased the amount of content distributed on the system by a very tiny amount - we are talking tenths of 1% here - and that would have decreased profits.  We must have mandated transparency.  The public must have the right to ask questions and get real, validated data in return on an ongoing basis.  Facebook will tell us that they cannot give us this data on a monthly or weekly basis but that is a lie.  If they pull the data once, if they write the code once to pull this information, they have systems that allow them to run it every day if they want to.  It is basically free.  Unless we have mandated, ongoing transparency, there will not be enough eyes looking at these things.</p><p>Part of why Twitter is able to find these information operations is that there are literally 10,000 researchers around the world who enjoy looking at these data and who find these security flaws.  Unless we have a similar mechanism for Facebook, we will not have a level of public safety that is acceptable.</p></speech>

I am particularly concerned about the workforce behind the monitoring of the platforms and their content.  Could Ms Haugen comment on the protection, or lack thereof, for the Facebook staff who have to review the content that has clearly been deemed harmful or potentially harmful?  Are there workers' rights issues in this regard?</p></speech>

Time and again over five to seven years, we have been hearing stories of people getting permanently damaged or coming out of these jobs after three or six months with profound post-traumatic stress disorder.  When we focus on censorship strategies instead of strategies that make the systems themselves safer, we end up forcing human beings to spend all day looking at some of the most brutal content in the world.  That alone should make us at least pause and ask whether we want a censorship-based solution or to decrease virality, amplification and the safety choices made in the platforms, because there is a real human impact and cost.</p></speech>

This has always been, and always will be, true.  We are creative little monkeys and are always looking for new ways to treat the world, and we often get ahead of ourselves.  We push too far, realise the consequences of our actions and then pull back a little towards the public good.  Technology is accelerating and is getting more sophisticated and nuanced.  As I said before, you cannot get a graduate degree in what I have spoken to the members about today; you have to go to one of these places to be trained in-house or acculturated inside it.  If we do not have whistleblower protections that are strong and robust, we will face some very large systemic risks to our societies.  Technology is getting more powerful and will get farther and farther from the public good before we realise these problems exist.  A closed system is not like in days of old whereby you could measure the pollution coming from a factory and talk to the workers about what was happening inside it.  The systems in question, however, are opaque technical systems that hide behind our screens.  If we do not have mechanisms to protect people who come out and explain them to us, we will face large risks to ourselves.</p></speech>

We should remember that these places are very privileged, they are very isolated and they are not diverse.  They do not speak for the world.  There must not be risk assessments by companies alone; risk assessments need to include the voices of bodies such as NGOs.  The reason is that places like Facebook do not reward focusing on the dark corners; they focus on growth and optimism.  They reward people who are able to figure out how to advance them and who perhaps avert their eyes a little.  We must include NGOs if we want to ensure all voices in society get heard; otherwise, we will not be able to protect the most vulnerable in our societies.</p></speech>

I welcome her to Ireland in a virtual way.  I apologise if some of my questions have been answered.  I have not been able to listen to the entire meeting.  If I repeat points, I ask to be indulged.</p> <p>  It is now widely known that in 2016 Facebook made changes to its algorithms.  These resulted in Facebook becoming a much angrier place.  That was evident to all and it resulted in circumstances in which people tended to share angrier content and posts.  The change to the algorithm and atmosphere clearly led to incredibly partisan pages.  Partisan organisations were able to exploit it.  It has been fairly widely written that the change to the algorithm and how Facebook was operated and used had an influence on the US election of 2016.  Was Facebook fully aware of the material impact of the change to its algorithm?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.733" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Frances Haugen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022022300002#F00900"><p>It is important to differentiate between changes Facebook made to its product before 2016 and changes it made to its main prioritisation system, which puts together the newsfeed.  The latter happened in late 2017 and into 2018.  Before the US election of 2016, there were other problems with the system.  For example, it was found then that a huge proportion of people who joined neo-Nazi groups in Germany joined them because Facebook recommended those groups to the people.  Sixty-five percent of people who had joined neo-Nazi groups joined them because Facebook stated those groups had really excited people who really engaged a lot with Facebook and that they might like them too.  Those kinds of things were happening before 2016.  They unquestionably influenced politics around those times.  However, we have found since then that Facebook did not invest enough in safety systems and researchers who were asking these questions.  That is part of why we need to have mandatory risk assessments that do not just involve the company, because it is not going to see things it needs to see, but that also involve bodies such as NGOs.  That was before 2016.</p> <p>  In 2018, Facebook changed from focusing on how long it could keep you on Facebook to meaningful social interactions, where meaningful could involve hate speech or bullying.  It really just meant the question of whether Facebook could optimise for reactions.  Facebook, which had researchers in Europe preparing for the EU elections, identified within six months of the change that its systems were rewarding angry, partisan, divisive content over content that looked for reconciliation or a common path forward.  </p> <p>  Facebook has also known that advertisements are equally a problem and that a high-quality political advertisement is one that gets reactions.  As a result, extreme, polarising, divisive advertisements can be five to ten times cheaper than compassionate or empathetic ones.  We need to ask questions such as whether we want to subsidise angry, divisive content when we know we cannot have a democracy when we are partial towards division over reconciliation.</p></speech>

On that approach from Facebook, did any other Facebook staff at the time raise concerns about this approach?  If so, what was the corporate response of Facebook to any concerns raised regarding that type of behaviour or approach?</p></speech>

One of the things we must remember is that the way the incentives are aligned now, the only numbers that have public accountability are profit and loss.  Those are the only things Facebook must mandatorily report in the United States.  Facebook has shown that for things such as its transparency centre, it selectively reports information, and I can answer questions about this, to paint a picture of the company that has little relation to it.  When we think about incentives, the people inside the company who find these problems were a part of the reason I came forward.  There are very kind and conscientious people working at Facebook who have no space to operate.  When they find these patterns and raise them, they might have to spend three or six months hammering on the doors to get anyone to pay attention.  When they do that, they can be labelled as squeaky wheels.  They are complaining and are not team players.  Unless we have mandatory transparency, there will not be a countervailing force to profit and loss that gives space to these people to operate.  We want to create a system of incentives whereby if someone sees a problem with, for example, neo-Nazi groups, as we are recommending, it is obvious and immediate that it needs to be escalated.  Today that is seen as a cost centre.  It is someone who is complaining and perhaps even exposing the company to risk.  Mandatory transparency makes it clear that we are watching and encourages the company to be creative and find solutions.  That is what good regulation does.  It helps to pulls the centre of mass back towards the company.</p></speech>

I am going to squeeze in one more question in the ten seconds I have left, if that is okay with the Chair.  This atmosphere and approach have led to a situation where, as we have already said, partisan pages and organisations have exploited it to a point where many people have trouble distinguishing factual and non-partisan material from that which is partisan and non-factual.  This is the point of us having Ms Haugen before the committee today.  What legislative and algorithmic changes would she recommend to ensure this does not happen again and we hit this on the head?</p></speech>

The real solutions are things such as the way the Digital Services Act is structured.  The focus is not on forcing Facebook to do one thing but is instead about changing a relationship, making sure the public can ask questions and raise concerns, and ensuring Facebook must engage.  It must give us data so we can provide accountability because those processes where we have feedback loops are how we get to a better place.  We must put in public reporting requirements which mean we can see in an ongoing way on a week-to-week basis.  This is how violence and incitement content are working.  This is how our ability to even detect that content is working.  That transparency would suddenly give another goal to the company and it would have to allocate enough resources to solve those things.  That is how we get to a better place.  We change our fundamental relationship with the company.  We cannot just ask the company to turn a knob.</p></speech>

I was conscious of the Rohingya genocide.  It was discovered that there was one contractor working in Dublin to observe harmful content in Myanmar and he only spoke Burmese while 100 languages operate in Myanmar.  I found it interesting that in September 2018, when human rights organisations wanted to take a case to the International Criminal Court, lawyers for Facebook refused that request on the basis that it would be a violation of individual privacy.  Ms Haugen will be aware that there is a big debate at the moment within the European Union.  Our concerns, as Europeans, relate to privacy rights, yet Facebook wants to ensure it can continue to transfer data to the United States.  Bruno Le Maire, the French economic minister, said last week, "I can confirm that life is very good without Facebook."  He went on to say, "Digital giants must understand that the European continent will resist and affirm its sovereignty."  Should we, as Europeans, trust Facebook?  Should we, as Europeans, allow any of our data to be transferred to the United States?</p></speech>

The way we trust people is that we must know them and see the patterns of their actions, and they earn our trust.  Facebook has had scandals over and over again.  The scandals are very consistent.  They take the form of Facebook claiming the world is a certain way, an internal person sees the consequences of that lie and comes forward.  As long as we see that pattern happening over and over again, we must ask what is going on.  We need mandatory transparency whereby Facebook must disclose this information or we are not going to get where we need to get.</p></speech>

Every year the European Union exports billions of dollars and advertising dollars to Facebook.  That is money that leaves the continent.  It cost less than &euro;500 million to build Google+ and that was with incredibly well compensated engineers in Mountain View, California.  Europe has options.  We should not think about these systems as being impossibly complex.  Europe could lead the way in saying it deserves to have publicly governed and publicly produced transparent social media.  That is a thing Europe always could be doing.  It has choices.</p></speech>

We are a small country that is trying to enforce accountability on companies.  We are trying to deal with the taxonomy of online harms and so on.

If an individual lies to the public, that is entirely unacceptable.  I want to make sure we contextualise the privileges that social media have today.  Facebook is a powerful entity with very little transparency.  It is not like a factory where one can put out a sensor and see is it polluting.  The people in Facebook are the only ones who get to see the data, which means they have a higher degree of responsibility for telling the truth.  The fact that they lie is even more egregious in that context.  I totally believe they should be held responsible.  I have forgotten what the Senator's first question was.</p></speech>

One of my goals for the next 12 months is to have a specification of the minimum set of information that would allow supervision of the systems.  The most important thing for Ireland to do is to pass an online safety Bill that is aligned with the Digital Services Act across the European Union, which is currently focusing on how to have an ongoing process of accountability.  Having a taxonomy of the harm caused by content will not work because focusing on content is a downstream solution.  We need to go to the source of the problem, which is around the algorithms and making sure Facebook must report ongoing metrics about the performance of those systems is how we will be able to answer those downstream harms caused by harmful content.</p></speech>

If we look at the actual mission of the oversight board, it is currently not responsible for seeing how these algorithms perform or ensuring that Facebook releases adequate and accurate data.  That is not its charge.  Its charge is very specific around censorship.  It asks, "Are we taking down the right content?" or "Are we taking down too much content?".  It wants us to focus on a censorship debate and not on a systems debate.  It wants that so much that the company spent $100 million to establish this board that can only talk about censorship.  There are very well-intentioned, smart and gifted people on the oversight board but they have been limited in what they are allowed to engage with.  It makes them not be able to live up to their job of keeping us safe.</p></speech>

I would be happy to deal with the commissioner.  On the question of keeping the metaverse safe, it is a great illustration of why we must focus on our systems-based approach rather than the current harm assessments.  The metaverse is new and if we sat down to write a protection plan today, we would know very little about the metaverse.</p> <p>  I will lay out what will happen if we do not implement some recurrent system of mandatory risk assessment.  We will see exactly the same thing happen with the metaverse - or perhaps even worse things - that we have already seen on places like Instagram.  People have been complaining about many of the issues in my disclosures for years, or even a decade.  The only thing that changed was that I brought forward proof that Facebook knew about these harms and they were real.  Facebook, for as long as ten years, had been saying that these problems were anecdotal and it was not the way it actually is.  It argued that if people could see everything, they would see such complaints are not borne out in reality.  They were real and the company was just lying to us.</p> <p>  What we will see with the metaverse is that people will start having individual problems.  Paediatricians are an example.  Kids are getting more addicted to these immersive systems than they have been even to Instagram.  We are not going to be able to prove such an issue because we will all only see our individual experiences of things like the metaverse.  We will not be able to see the systematic attacks because only Facebook will get to see behind the curtain.  That is why we need mandatory risk assessments or we will have the same arguments and the company will say the issues are anecdotal and not real.  The company holds all the power.</p></speech>

Much of the societal change we have seen internationally in the past decade or so has come about as a result of social media.  We had a perfect example of that in Ireland when we were the first country in the world to vote for marriage equality, with a huge part of that campaign being developed and implemented through the use of social media.  Perhaps I am coming at this from a different perspective.  There is an inevitability in how we communicate as a species that social media would eventually have come into being in any event, whether it was through Mr. Zuckerberg or anybody else.  We are now moving to the next stage of that evolution through the metaverse, as has been mentioned.</p> <p>  The question is presented to us as legislators with limited knowledge of the inner workings of social media companies.  Right now, what is the most effective deterrent to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and all the other social media companies or the most effective tool to force behavioural change from within these companies and perhaps return them to their initial ambition of providing for a greater degree of communicative power to all citizens?  Social media is ultimately about empowering citizens.  How do we make these companies go back to their founding principles?  Is there a way of doing that?</p></speech>

I want to be really clear.  I really love social media.  I have worked with four social networks at this point.  The first time I wrote a programme that went out and read the Internet, it was on a social media site called Friendster a long time ago.  I was in Europe when I wrote it.  I thank you guys for sponsoring my education.</p> <p>  I want to be really clear.  When we have social media, it is about our friends, families and immediate communities and it is not that dangerous.  Things that cause these systems to be super dangerous are driven by a profit motive.  We could roll back in time to 2008, when we mostly saw content from family and friends.  Facebook runs experiments today when it rolls back the clock and gives boosts to content to people to which we are directly connected.  This is from people we know.  It is for free, and people get less hate speech, less violence and less nudity.</p> <p>  What is the problem then?  If we imagine a world where we only get content from family and friends, after 20 or 30 minutes, a person would finish catching up with those family and friends and go on to something else in life.  If Facebook wants to keep people on for hours and get more advertising dollars, it needs to find more content.  Facebook has begun forcing people into giant groups of 500,000 or 1 million people, and these are the pathways being weaponised, for example, by Russia.  Russia has figured out it can bootstrap these groups.  It has found hacks to build them very quickly and it forces out content to people.</p> <p>  What can we do to force Facebook back to a system that is more about our family and friends?  By requiring the company to disclose ongoing information about the performance of their systems and even those censorship systems, for example, we can begin to make it attractive for them to do some very basic fixes.  Let us imagine Alice writes something and Bob, her friend, shares it.  If Carol shares it again, it is a friend of a friend.  It might land in Dan's newsfeed and now we are beyond friends of friends.  If Dan had to copy and paste in order to propagate further - he cannot knee-jerk and hit a share button - that change alone would have the same impact as the entire third-party fact-checking system.  Facebook does not do it because it costs a sliver of profit.  It may be half a percentage point of profit because there is less content on the system.  It would be radically safer and more pleasant but it would be less profitable.</p> <p>  We must require mandatory ongoing reporting of metrics that can be audited by the public so Facebook feels shame when it knows somebody is watching.  It should be willing to use these little tricks they already know about and they work for everybody in the world and not just people who speak English.  The company will not do this unless it has to report something other than profit and loss.</p></speech>

There is an analogy with the construction industry.  Thirty years ago in Ireland and internationally, construction sites were very dangerous places to work.  Workers were killed and maimed and as a result of the development of legislation, health and safety regulation and particularly the development of tort law and significant compensation that has been paid to workers, it became very clear very quickly to construction companies that safer workplaces were cheaper to operate than unsafe workplaces.  Would the taking of direct mass court claims for compensation against all social media companies involved with disseminating damaging information have an effect in changing behaviour within Facebook and the other similar companies?</p></speech>

Earlier today we spoke about the idea of people moderating this content.  If a system is based on censorship instead of making products safer, we must have humans in the loop who get exposed to huge amounts of this horrible and toxic content.</p><p>They are the humans who actually keep the AI honest or who deal with the nuances of it.  Imagine a world where there were better employment protections for Irish citizens who were the moderators of these companies - people who are getting horrible mental health issues and some of whom are killing themselves.  It might be a thing where just giving better employment protections to Irish citizens ends up pushing these companies towards having more systems-based solutions instead of censorship-based solutions.</p><p> With regard to the larger question of how we make sure we have ways of filing claims, having some kind of class action mechanism where, say, the parents of children who have been harmed could come forward and say, &ldquo;We have all had the same problem happen and we have been deeply injured&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Our children have been deeply injured&rdquo;, would provide a financial incentive for making sure these platforms make responsible choices.</p></speech>

Getting under the hood of how social media companies share the most incendiary content to further create engagement is a really important perspective.  As Ms Haugen stated, this is not about the simplistic lens of just removing damaging content.  We tried that, and a couple of items of legislation were proposed in 2015 whereby we sought to make it an offence to annoy people on social media.  That is not the direction we need to go.</p> <p>  If Ms Haugen was to recruit the most effective team within the office of our Data Protection Commissioner or in any other office that has a regulatory role on social media, and she mentioned experts in AI and algorithmic development, would behavioural scientists have a role in that?  What would be her optimum team to begin bringing about that systemic change that she has spoken so strongly about in the recent past?</p></speech>

There is one of the things they do that I think it is really important to acknowledge, and I do not want to be somebody who just nags on Facebook because Facebook does some good things.  One of the things they do is they have probably the most robust research team in the world for a comparable social media company.  We need to keep hiring social scientists, psychologists and people who understand human dynamics.  We need to fund research into how these fields play together.  We need more intersectional people who focus on both technology and the social impacts of it.  There is a lot of very good research coming out of places like Taiwan around how we build technology that is pro-social, that helps us to have better deliberations and that makes our democracy stronger.  We should not think that technology is inherently oppositional to the market, but it is a thing we must invest in if we want to develop these pro-social technologies because it is likely the market is not going to give us these things.  The market is incentivised to keep us addicted, to keep us coming back over and over.  I encourage places like the European Union or Ireland to invest in funding research into these fields.</p></speech>

Things that make people depressed or estranged from their communities are not illegal.  We need to think holistically about the harms of these systems and require them to be disclosed to the public.

Just that one action about which safety systems, which languages and giving us some samples would allow us to see things.  For example, Facebook's own documents talk about the idea that they treat all Arabic speakers as if they speak one language even though Arabic is actually six very different language families.  There are things like the fact 75% of counter-terrorism content is classified as terrorism content.  If we had something as simple as that disclosure on which safety systems and which languages and to show us some samples, we would be able to catch that.  We would have been able to have a conversation saying things like, &ldquo;Irish English is different enough to regular English and you do not support it as a dialect, but the Irish people deserve to be safe&rdquo;.  Those are the kind of things where ongoing disclosures would incentivise Facebook to invest in more languages or to invest in the quality of the safety systems in those languages.</p></speech>

Given Ireland's position, particularly as the home of the European headquarters of many of these tech companies, can Ms Haugen outline the dangers should Ireland adopt a hands-off or light-touch approach to the regulation of these tech companies?</p></speech>

Ireland holds a profound responsibility.  It does not matter how good the Digital Services Act ends up being.  If all of that regulatory implementation happens only in Ireland, and Ireland under-invests in that regulator, if they are not actually tough and do not hold these firms to the letter of the law, there is basically no last line of defence.  With the GDPR, we saw that the Data Protection Commission in Ireland struggled to keep up and 98% of cases that have been brought have not been resolved.  If we cannot find a robust way to implement the Digital Services Act, I do not know who is going to speak for people like the Rohingya or what will be the next Ethiopia.  Right now, there is another ethnic conflict that is unfolding that has been driven by Facebook.  I strongly hope the Irish people can either stand in solidarity and have a joint European enforcement or can adequately fund a robust and tough implementer to keep the people of the world safe.</p></speech>

It changed how Silicon Valley operated.  I remember working at Pinterest while GDPR was rolling out and I believe it was vitally important in having companies even just look at the data they were storing.  Companies were not even aware of all the stuff they had on people, so GDPR is very important.  However, the reality is that because Ireland is the regulatory hub for these large tech companies, it has been flooded with GDPR violation complaints.  There are two problems.  First, a very limited number of judgments have come out of those decisions and those judgments, as they have emerged, have been deeply criticised by other parties inside the European Union.  Other parties are allowed to assess the judgments, confidentially, before they become public.  Time and again countries such as Germany, Italy and France have come forward and said that given the amount of resources and time that were put into the investigations, not enough substance is coming out of them.  Second, they are not coming out with enough teeth.  I believe that having an effective regulator is very hard.  I recognise that.  It is very expensive and hard.  It is something we are developing from scratch.  It is similar to being in the 1970s and developing the first environmental protection authorities.  I believe binding together is the way forward because each individual party in Europe is not going to be able to afford the number of algorithmic specialists, and there are just not a lot of them in the world.  Until we begin training enough we cannot expect each country to have a tough enough enforcement.</p></speech>

The decision she made to come out to the public will make the lives of many people around the world safer and better.  I wish to put that on the record.  Part of the Future of Media Commission and its establishment in Ireland is an online safety commissioner.  I would feel a lot safer if somebody like Ms Haugen was in such a position.  Many of my colleagues here would agree that we need somebody who knows the systems and the companies and Ms Haugen would be an ideal person for that portfolio or job.</p> <p>  To be honest, many of the questions I had planned to ask have been asked, so I will not repeat them.  A number of my colleagues wish to ask questions.  However, with regard to false accounts and the many millions of false accounts that exist, particularly on Facebook, in our pre-legislative scrutiny we discussed introducing a minimum age for accounts and requiring the online media companies to get more information to make sure the accounts were, first, of people over a certain age and, second, that they were not going to be used falsely for harm.  What is Ms Haugen's view on setting a minimum age for any account on social media?</p></speech>

It is a great example of where we do not necessarily need official enforcement with things such as driver licences in order to have much stronger protections for children under the age of 13 years.  One of the most shocking things I have brought forward for many people is the idea that Facebook has an estimated age on every person on the platform and it uses that estimated age, which is different from somebody's stated age, to do lots of analysis to target them with things like advertisements.  One can ask how Facebook is able to accurately predict somebody's age.  Things like who the person's friends are helps one estimate the person's age because not all the person's friends lied when the person was 11, 12 or 13 years old if the person snuck on.  Some of them waited until they were 13 years old.  It also knows the person's interests.  There are many ways to figure out approximately how old somebody is.  Facebook has found that, for some age cohorts, 10% to 15% of that age cohort were on systems like Facebook at the age of ten years old.  There has to be much stronger reporting.  Imagine if Facebook had to report for every cohort of 14-year-olds what fraction of them were on the platform at 13, 12, ten and nine years old.  It could be doing that right now and it would encourage it to be much more aggressive at finding underage people and taking them off the platform.</p> <p>  There are also systems such as facial recognition.  I have been sent multiple studies by start-ups that are investing in facial recognition and analysing facial features for estimating people's ages.  If we want to keep people under the age of 13 years off the platforms, I strongly encourage this because the rates of addiction in Facebook's own research are highest for 13 and 14 year olds.  Young people have less ability to regulate addictive behaviours.  That is why we do not let them smoke.  Similarly, there should be much more stringent controls for things like gating how much time somebody under the age of 16 years old can spend on these platforms because the self-regulation systems are not as mature.</p></speech>

However, I strongly believe that we probably need greater protections for children for all these platforms.  Right now, there are children who are developing self-soothing behaviours where when they feel an interest, they pull up Instagram and just start scrolling.  If those children are being made interested by the content on Instagram, and Facebook's research says there are many children who are developing eating disorders and things like self-harm because of the content they are being exposed to, and if their self-soothing behaviour ends up exposing them to more of the thing that is causing them harm, that is a huge problem.  At a minimum, things such as the rate limiting for people under the age of 15 or 16 years old is important, with an hour, two hours or three hours a day, some limit like that, but also being even more aggressive and saying that perhaps somebody should not join until the person is 15 years old.  I would support examining that question.</p></speech>

I begin by crediting your great bravery for coming out and speaking so publicly across the world.  All my colleagues have said you are doing the world a service, and particularly the next generation.  Hopefully, we will be in a position to protect them through your testimony here and to other parliaments around the world.  I will begin by quoting you.  In one of your discussions you said that Instagram can lead from healthy recipes to anorexia.  At another point you said that Facebook's internal research states that 13.5% of teenage girls said Instagram made their suicidal ideation worse, with 17% of teenage girls reporting that Instagram made their body dysmorphia worse.  They are the types of things we have been hearing from our witnesses' statements throughout our pre-legislative scrutiny.  There are a specific instances.  Can you extrapolate on the experiences you had with regard to the figures and particularly with young girls and how they are so affected in terms of body image?</p></speech>

Facebook has reproduced at least four times - perhaps more, as those are just documents I am aware of - what is basically the same study.  Facebook has said it publicly previously.  Mr. Nick Clegg, who I believe has some new fancy title at Facebook as head of global something or other, wrote a long blog post last year and I encourage the committee to read it, because I find it quite condescending.  It shows the type of attitude Facebook has towards the public.  It effectively said: "You have been complaining about extreme content on Facebook, but you know what?  You picked your friends, you picked your interests.  This isn't on us.  It takes two to tango."</p> <p>  However, even as he said that, Facebook had multiple instances of studies that took a blanket count and followed a couple of innocuous things.  Perhaps on Instagram they searched for healthy eating and followed a couple of topics.  Then all they did was click on the content Facebook, Instagram and Meta gave them and came back the next day and did it again.  The nature of engagement they strengthen is that the algorithms are not smart.  They are just scanning for what one might engage with, what is going to draw one in.</p><p>The reality is that people develop things like anorexia and start cutting or engaging in other forms of self-mutilation is that there is something in our brains that is drawn to these topics.  Adolescent children are going through major phases of physical change, and that can be stressful.  Kids are following topics like healthy eating and just engaging with the content.  There is no two tangoing here; this is just the algorithms.  As they engage with it, they get led to more and more extreme content.  That is super dangerous.  These are young, impressionable children who instead of being supported as they go through a stressful experience in life are being drawn into an addictive platform that ends up hurting their mental health and even their bodies.  Anorexia is not about girls that are too skinny.  It is about women 60 years from now who are going to walk the Earth with brittle bones because of choices Facebook made or a 35-year-old woman who yearns for a child who cannot have one.  That is what anorexia is.  I encourage the committee to step in and to have a strong voice.  The regulator should be adequately funded and supported so that it can be tough and make sure that these platforms work for the people and bring out the best in us.</p></speech>

Going in and saying there are magic bullets where we just turn this knob this way or turn this dial that way and it will solve the problem is not the solution.  The solution is measures like the Digital Services Act, where there are ongoing risk assessments every six months or every year, and we force the platforms to disclose to us the harms they know of and how they are going to solve other issues that NGOs have identified.  We must say they need to show us enough data so that we know they are making progress.  It is important to have that kind of system and an ongoing conversation with Facebook, and changing our relationship with it so that we stop passively receiving whatever lies it wants to tell us and instead we can come in and say we are noticing that kids are getting harmed and what is its plan.  We need laws like that to change the dynamic in order that Facebook has to work in the public interest.</p></speech>

We are referred to community standards and whether something meets the bar for community standards, which, 100% of the time, it does not.  As a result, whatever goes on Facebook stays on it.  Ms Haugen has been on the inside.  Are those in Facebook laughing up their sleeves at us in terms of the company's view of its community standards?</p></speech>

One is that Facebook has chosen to focus on a censorship-based safety system, not what we are thinking about, which is the product traces it is making and arguing if they are acceptable risks.  When we focus on censorship, it leads to this very elaborate dance where there are incredibly long documents that describe exactly what the characteristics are of violating or non-violating content.  This is a little bit like arguing about the number of angels that dance on the head of a pin.  We should be focusing on why it is that we are giving the most distribution to the most extreme content and not being able to have these defensible documents, as they call them, where they say: "No, we've thought really hard about this.  This is what is violating and non-violating."  It is right to say that language is nuanced and especially in circumstances where it is not tailored to individual cultures.  There was a Member of Parliament in the UK who told me about how he was actively sent homophobic rhetoric, but because Scottish slang is not acknowledged by San Francisco, he was never able to get any protections.  We need to stop focusing so much on individual pieces of content and focus on the overall risks to the system and making the system safer overall.</p></speech>

I would describe her as having real moral fortitude in coming out of the shadows by herself and taking on a colossal company like Facebook right around the world and speaking to parliamentarians.  It takes immense personal character to have the ability to do that and it is to be commended.</p> <p>  It is very difficult to come in at the end of a debate and to ask an original question.  I will try to differentiate my points a little bit and put a different slant on it.  Ms Haugen lifted the lid on some of the darker practices that Facebook has engaged in.  Does she think she has lifted the lid on all of it or that it is just the tip of the iceberg and there are other practices that Facebook is using that we have not yet found out about?</p></speech>

I am one person.  Let us think for a moment about the things that I learned about how Facebook is operating.  I just did a few searches.  I am one person, and I was able to capture a lot, but I was only able to capture a tiny sliver.  The fact that Facebook can operate at the scale that it does, that it can touch the lives of 3.1 billion people and be completely opaque to us is unacceptable.  We are going to keep having whistleblowers come forward from Facebook until we have managed to get greater transparency.  There are not whistleblowers coming out of Apple.  That is because Apple is radically more transparent.  People can take their devices apart.  They can measure the pollution coming out of their factories.  Apple has much less incentive to lie than Facebook does, because those in Facebook know that no one can catch them in that lie because they are the only ones that have the data.</p></speech>

Does Ms Haugen have any confidence in governments and democracies around the world being able to keep up with big tech, which can outgun governments at times, particularly when one considers what it has at its disposal?  Does she think there is any possibility of our trying to keep up with it?</p></speech>

I am an elderly millennial.  I remember the Internet in the 1990s.  The dream of the Internet was about the idea that anyone could reach out and impact people on the other side of the world.  With systems that are more transparent, like Twitter, which has a fire hose, anyone in the world can analyse one tenth of all the public tweets.  What happens when we open up and we say "We are going to give access and we are going to do this collaboratively", is that people come out of nowhere who help.  There are easily 10,000 people who closely analyse that fire hose on Twitter.  Because Facebook has chosen to be closed, however, it has both taken on a higher obligation because it is the only one that can currently solve these problems.  It has made life much harder for itself.  If we force Facebook to disclose more data, more people would take college classes where they would use that data.  Yelp, for example, does this.  Yelp has a data set where it lets people use its reviews.  As a result, 18-year-olds learn how to work with rough data.  Imagine if Facebook had 20,000 or 50,000 students around the world who are always looking at its data.  We would all be safer because we had forced Facebook to be more transparent.  That is how we are able to these things.</p></speech>

We get that Facebook's economic business model is built around that.  It has been discussed earlier today, but how can we ask a private company to change a business model which will result in it losing money, for example?  We have talked a little bit about that today.  Would one of the things we could ask Facebook to do be to change its algorithm from a tailor-made model that shows us what it thinks we want to see back to what it used originally, namely, a chronological algorithm whereby we saw what was posted by our friends chronologically?  Would that be a solution to try to take away some of the toxicity of the algorithms?</p></speech>

I want the committee to hold Facebook to account.  Facebook has forced us into lots of large toxic groups.  We talked before about the idea that 65% of the people who joined neo-Nazi groups joined them because Facebook recommended those groups to them.  At this point, Facebook cannot just change the algorithm; it has to come in and change other things about how the groups product is designed.  It has to do these changes simultaneously or, as Facebook says, we will just get more inflammatory content.</p><p>However, if Facebook had to report more safety factors in an ongoing way - a weekly update as opposed to a yearly one - or if the public were allowed to request those data, Facebook would suddenly have to take things out of its filing cabinet.  It has all of these solutions, for example, cutting the reshare chain at two or requiring people to click on a link.  These solutions exist today but Facebook chooses not to use them because of the profit motive.</p><p> Part of why it is important to put these regulations in place is because the choices Facebook is making right now will limit its long-term profitability.</p></speech>

Does Ms Haugen believe that the algorithms governing the rabbit hole &ndash; the content someone looks for then taking him or her to more divisive and extremist content &ndash; still exist in Facebook or has it tried to move away from them a little since the lid was blown on this?</p></speech>

These are large problems and until there is mandatory transparency, we should assume that they are still there or are even worse.  I left last May and people have continued making the algorithms more optimised.</p></speech>

Does Ms Haugen believe that Facebook has become too big to handle?  Over the past 100 years in the US, anti-trust laws were used to break up big companies that had monopolies.  Should something like those be used on Facebook?</p> <p>  Ms Haugen fielded a similar question when appearing before the US Congress when a Senator asked her what major changes she would make to make the platform safer for users if she were CEO of Facebook the next morning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-23a.800" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Frances Haugen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022022300002#M00700"><p>Regarding anti-trust, I know that we want simple, sound-bite solutions.  "Break up Facebook" is something that I can say in one sentence.  It is clear and crisp.  When we discuss engagement-based ranking and the idea that these algorithms are giving the most reach to the most extreme, polarising and divisive content, however, those problems are not just happening at Instagram and Facebook.  They are happening on TikTok and YouTube.  Breaking up Facebook does not solve that problem.  Mandatory transparency and having other countervailing centres of mass can solve it.</p> <p>  If I could do any one thing, I would probably open more channels for inviting public participation in safety.  For example, when we talk about the need to translate AIs into every language, there is a precedent of companies like Google developing tools that allow communities to transfer the companies' systems into the communities' own languages.  Facebook could have a strategy like that.  For example, there are 95 dialects in Ethiopia and six major language families.  Facebook could decide that the only way it could ensure adequate safety in Ethiopia would be to have community involvement in building safety systems.  That is probably the single fastest action to improve safety, but it would still not be rigorous enough.  We need ongoing transparency and measures like mandatory risk assessments so that we can evolve with time. </p></speech>

It is fantastic to have her and I thank her for all of the work she is doing in this space.  Her bravery and insight have had ripple effects across the globe.  Today is our chance here in Ireland, not just as a society or as legislators, but as a strategic location for the EU headquarters of many of the platforms in question, to use her industry experience and inside knowledge to make the online world a safer space.</p> <p>  Democracy is fragile and there need to be laws to protect it and citizens across the globe.  This is true whether you are in Ireland or Myanmar or on Capitol Hill.  Unfortunately, social media can become a weapon that threatens to destabilise democracy.  Engagement-based ranking is dangerous - Mark Zuckerberg told us this &ndash; yet we are living in a metaverse where what we see on our social media platforms are the posts that will get a corporation the most engagement and the most money.  He was right, in that it is proving dangerous to our values, our health &ndash; in particular, the mental health of our young people &ndash; and our democracy.</p> <p>  In Ireland, we used to look across the Atlantic at politics in the US and thank our lucky stars that our politics were not fuelled by money in the way it is there.  Unbeknownst to us, though, platforms like Facebook were changing that under the radar.  The sad reality is that someone can use money rather than messages to influence the national discourse and shape democratic decisions.  That is not the kind of society in which I want to live.</p> <p>  Social media poses great opportunities, especially for keeping families and friends connected, and it would probably pose nothing but opportunities if it was not monetised and did not become a global multibillion euro company, but it did, and that has meant that the threats are getting bigger &ndash; threats to democracy and stability through how easily people can engage in the viral spreading of disinformation, and threats to our health, including our mental health, through the generation of patterns of online hate messaging.</p> <p>  I was struck by what Ms Haugen said about safeguarding children of 12, 13 or 14 years of age and how modern technology like facial recognition could be adopted to make a digital age of consent work.  That is an interesting point because we in Ireland constantly struggle with the debate on how to get the digital age of consent to work without needing to share private data on children as proof of age.</p> <p>  I was interested in Ms Haugen's views on an individual complaints mechanism and how our new commission may end up drowning in complaints.  That is something that we hear constantly.  We want to strike the right balance between allowing people the ability to escalate their complaints without flooding the system to the point where it no longer works.  Ms Haugen mentioned a class action of complaints.  In Ireland, we have many great NGOs, for example, Webwise, CyberSafeKids, SpunOut and Bodywhys.  Is Ms Haugen suggesting that people complain to them and, if those people wanted it, the NGOs could escalate the complaints to the commission or is she saying that we need to have a system where we hit these companies where it hurts, that is, with significant fines, when we see that they are systemically failing to protect users?</p> <p>  I will run through a couple of questions and then hand over the rest of my time to Ms Haugen.  She is saying that the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is overly focused on content.  That seems to be a concern for her.  I would like to hear more about that.  Ms Haugen is saying that we need to look more at the root of the problem.  How do we do that through legislation?  My blunt question is whether the Bill as it stands is fit for purpose.  Will it work?  Will the EU's Bill work?  Is it more important that the EU's Bill work and that the EU give Ireland the resources we need to ensure that we can manage online safety in terms of the social media companies that are based in Ireland but providing services throughout the EU?</p> <p>  My three main takeaways from Ms Haugen's exceptional testimony today are that the algorithm needs to revert to what it was pre 2018 so that reactions and engagements are no longer driving Facebook's metrics; investment needs to happen in AI around local languages and in moderating content so as to minimise the human cost of censorship; and we need mandatory risk assessments and the mandatory enforcement of transparency.  How do we as legislators achieve that?  What laws need to be introduced?  What else do we need to do and what else do we need to incorporate in EU law or our Bill so that we can have a real and lasting positive impact?</p></speech>

That is all the time we have left.</p></speech>

It has been thoroughly vetted, many people have spent a great deal of effort on it and it is very important for whatever Ireland passes to be aligned with the DSA.  The DSA has considered the question of how to stay abreast of these platforms in an ongoing way.  Members are right, in that the platforms are large and move very quickly.</p> <p>  Ongoing mandatory risk assessments &ndash; not just those done by the company, but ones where NGOs and other parties can chime in &ndash; are important.</p> <p>  Deputy Higgins asked about handling individual complaints.  It is not that difficult to write software that could provide people with a way of making complaints and then forming classes from those.  We could have a conversation about that another time, but there is a mechanism whereby there could be a broad range of complaints that would then be channelled to NGOs.  This would highlight that 10,000 people were all complaining about the same issue, for example.</p> <p>  Look to Europe.  In most industries, the polluter pays.</p><p>This is going to be a very expensive problem.  Algorithmic specialists are rare; there are few of them in the world.  They are incredibly well compensated.  I will give the committee example.  When I worked at Pinterest, myself and a team of three other engineers, were able to increase the total profits of the company by 6%.  We increased it by tens of millions of dollars with a project that took us a few months.  This is why algorithmic specialists are paid so much because we really can make these things radically more profitable.  Ireland does not want to take responsibility for paying enough people to be able to have a robust enforcer.  Taxing platforms to make sure that there is safe enforcement is the critical path forward.  Look to Europe.  The Digital Services Act is important.  Focus on systems, ongoing risk and the polluter pays.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Haugen for her time.  You have had two hours of constant back and forth and in all of that time have never failed to entertain us with your insight, experience and wealth of knowledge on how we, fingers crossed, can do this right in Ireland for the rest of the world, and as you have said, be a global leader in all of that.

This has been a very special experience for me.  Part of my family is Irish and I am named after my Irish grandmother, Geraldine Frances Sommerville.  It is a big treat for me to be here.  I am aware that Ireland has a history of being a small country but one that has had an outsized impact on the world's history.  Ireland has stood up to strong, powerful forces before in the world.  I know that Ireland can build a strong enforcer that keeps the world safe and speaks up for people like the Rohingya who have pressed so well their voice to stand up to this trillion dollar company.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for inviting me today.  It has been an honour.</p></speech>
