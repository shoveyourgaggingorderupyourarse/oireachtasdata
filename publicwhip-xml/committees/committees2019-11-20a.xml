    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-20a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2019112000002#C00200"><p>I thank the Acting Chair.  This is a very interesting petition and is very timely in terms of the debate going on around the raising of retirement ages.  The petitioner talks about the fact that many older people who are employed but who lost their jobs through redundancy during the financial crash have been unable to find work because, according to the petitioner, companies do not want to employ older people and that forcing people in that age bracket to re-educate, upskill or change career is just not viable and that no matter what people do, some remain unemployable.  The petitioner is seeking this early retirement for those who are forced into a situation of being effectively on the dole.  People come into our offices in respect of this.  Those who are forced to retire early find themselves in that one-year or two-year gap, where they have to claim jobseeker's benefit.  They find that a huge blow to their pride and morale and that it is insulting and depressing.  Only in the last week we heard the Taoiseach speak about this in the D&aacute;il.  When he addressed the matter last week, rather harrowingly, he quoted life expectancy 30 years ago, in particular of males.  I would not have much left based on life expectancy a few decades ago.  I thank God life expectancy of males and of females is rising but in tandem with that, it will place pressure on the Social Insurance Fund.</p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs of Social Protection was before the Committee of Public Accounts Committee a number of weeks ago and it  espoused the fact that the fund was in a positive place, but based on the trends in respect of ageing and the demographics, it is not going to continue in that space and hence, one has this debate.  The crux of the issue is around the funding of this based on life expectancy in the future.  The State is faced with this in terms of where it stands and how it is going to continue to be able to fund this, based on an ever-increasing life expectancy.</p><p> Conversely, we have heard from people who want to work longer and who find it infuriating that they are not allowed to continue to work in the workplace.  It is a broader societal debate that is going to have to be had because, as in so many countries, if the fund is not there to pay pensions, it is a huge issue.</p><p> I do note the response from the Department in which it stated that an ambitious target had been set under Future Jobs Ireland to increase labour force participation rates among people over the age of 55 years from 34.5% to 38%, and that is considered ambitious.  That is depressing in itself.</p><p> To go back to the central point, the petition is reflective of something that emanated in the years after the crash, when a huge cohort of people were caught in that gap.  It might not be as prevalent now but it is worthy of recognition that that happened to people and that it was extremely hurtful to and hard on many people.  The wider debate is whether we are going to be able to fund the Social Insurance Fund in the future.  While things are positive at the moment, based on an ageing population, that may not always be the case over the next couple of decades.</p></speech>

I agree with everything he said.  In regard to life expectancy, if we look at some cohorts of people, whether the Traveller community or the long-term homeless, their life expectancy is so much lower and they should be able to access retirement and packages that come with care, including nursing home care.  It is an area I have been looking at in other committees.</p> <p>  In regard to this petition and the role of our committee, I recommend that we forward a copy of the response we received from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the petitioner and that when this is completed, we close the petition.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

The point the Acting Chair raised that certain demographics have a much lower life expectancy should not be glossed over either.</p></speech>

Is it agreed to send the petitioner the response from the Department?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I thank you for your attendance.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child on World Children's Day.  I welcome Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children, and Dr. Karen McAuley, head of policy in the Office of the Ombudsman for children.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask members and witnesses to please turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they will interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report on the meeting and adversely the broadcast on television and web streaming.  Any opening statement witnesses submit to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  After the witnesses have made their presentation, there will be questions from the members of the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-20a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019112000002#C00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak on the occasion of the World Children's Day and the 30th anniversary of the United Nations' adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC.  To make this important occasion the Ombudsman for Children's office is currently hosting an event called Child Talks.  At this event, young people between the ages of 12 and 17 years are giving talks about a range of issues, includingmental health services for children and young people; the significance of family and having a home; disability services and public transport; climate change; and the importance of young people raising their voices and being heard.</p><p>While the issues young people are highlighting at Child Talks are diverse, they also share certain characteristics.  All of the young people taking part are speaking about issues that are important to them.  In doing so, all of those young people are exercising their rights to freedom of expression and to be heard.  All of the issues they are addressing connect to children&rsquo;s rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC.<br/><br/>Each of those young people speaking at Child Talks this morning needed to think carefully about what issues they wanted their talk to focus on.  Similarly, I have thought about what my opening statement to the committee might usefully focus on within the time available to me to make it.  As Ombudsman for Children, I lead a national institution that has a statutory remit under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to promote the rights and welfare of children up to the age of 18.  With my role and the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office's core statutory functions in mind, I will offer some brief observations, having regard to the UNCRC and to the concluding observations of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child issued in early 2016 following its examination of the State&rsquo;s progress towards fulfilling its obligations to children.<br/><br/>As the UN committee&rsquo;s concluding observations illustrate, there are different ways in which we can think about children&rsquo;s rights.  We can approach them in terms of different dimensions to children&rsquo;s lives such as family, health, housing, education, protection, justice, and so on.  We can also consider children&rsquo;s rights from the vantage point of different groups of children such as children in care, children with disabilities, and children belonging to ethnic minorities.  Equally, we can approach children&rsquo;s rights having regard to the State&rsquo;s status as the primary duty-bearer when it comes to ensuring that children&rsquo;s rights are respected, protected and fulfilled, and in terms of measures that the State needs to take to make children&rsquo;s rights real for children in what Eleanor Roosevelt famously identified as the places that give rights meaning, the &ldquo;small places, close to home&rdquo;.<br/><br/>In 2003, a year after Ireland ratified the UNCRC, the UN committee published its fifth general comment.  Such comments focus on providing guidance to states, including Ireland, on general measures to implement children&rsquo;s rights under the UNCRC.  This general comment remains an important reference point because it sets out cross-cutting actions that the State needs to pursue for the purposes of realising all children&rsquo;s rights in all children&rsquo;s lives.  Among these actions are legislating, developing and implementing national strategies, co-ordinating, monitoring, providing access to remedies and redress, collecting and analysing data, budgeting, training, and raising awareness.<br/><br/>I suggest that thinking about children&rsquo;s rights under the UNCRC in terms of the general measures required to implement children&rsquo;s rights is a particularly useful approach for all of us who have roles and responsibilities in respect of one or more of these general measures.  Among other things, this approach enables us to identify what types of action we are well placed to pursue to progress the implementation of children&rsquo;s rights with, and for, children living in Ireland.<br/><br/>Section 3 of the 2016 concluding observations sets out the UN committee&rsquo;s key concerns and recommendations as regards Ireland&rsquo;s mobilisation of general measures to implement the UNCRC.  I will comment briefly on two of these measures.  The first relates to legislating.  Legislating for children&rsquo;s rights is a vital task.  As we all know, legislation can drive behaviour.  As a catalyst for change, legislation can require people to do things that they might not otherwise be minded to do, and it can enable people to do things that they might not otherwise be permitted to do.  Since the UN committee issued its recommendations in 2016, we have seen some progress in legislating for children and their rights, including in a number of areas referenced by the UN committee.  Examples in the area of education in this regard are the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 and the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019, which is currently making its way through the Oireachtas.  However, the task of fully incorporating the UNCRC into domestic law, which the UN committee has urged the State to implement &ldquo;as a matter of priority&rdquo;, is an unfinished project.  Many gaps and deficits remain in Irish law, including in areas with which the Ombudsman for Children's Office is engaging such as mental health, housing and online safety.<br/><br/>As Members of the Oireachtas, the Chair and each of his colleagues have a unique role that enables them to introduce, repeal and amend legislation.  Therefore, they are especially well placed to mobilise a key general measure to progress the realisation of children&rsquo;s rights.  When conducting pre-legislative scrutiny of proposed legislation and when examining and proposing amendments to Bills, for example, the Chair and his colleagues have a crucial role to play in making sure that legislation that will impact on children and their rights is child-centred and rights-based.  As such, they are in a position to influence positive changes for children and children&rsquo;s rights in a manner that no one else can.<br/><br/>As Ombudsman for Children, I am firmly of the view that any law that concerns children must put children and their rights first.  In a very real way, children are depending on members, as legislators, to make sure this happens.  Therefore, I urge committee members and their Oireachtas colleagues to persist in their efforts to ensure that relevant legislation is child rights compliant so that it provides a robust foundation for the development and implementation of corresponding policies, procedures and practices that give meaning to children&rsquo;s rights in children&rsquo;s lives.<br/><br/>On co-ordination, while our system of government and public administration is organised along sectoral lines, children and their lives do not fit neatly into those sectoral silos.  The challenges that this misalignment creates and the damaging impact that it can have on children is something that the Ombudsman for Children's Office sees all too often through our examination and investigation of complaints.  One example is our investigation of Molly&rsquo;s case, which I discussed with the committee in 2018.  As members will recall, one of our core findings in this case was that the difficulties experienced by Molly and her foster family were largely attributable to a lack of co-ordination between Tusla and the HSE.  Because neither agency saw Molly as a child in care and as a child with a disability, the services and supports provided by both organisations were insufficient.  What Molly&rsquo;s case highlights so clearly is why effective inter-agency co-ordination, co-operation and communication at all levels of Government and public administration are vital to implementing children&rsquo;s rights.  Accordingly, this case informed one of the recommendations that we made in our submission to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the context of its review of the Child Care Act 1991.  We recommended that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs give serious consideration to placing a statutory duty on agencies with responsibilities for children and families to co-operate with Tusla in the exercise of its functions under the 1991 Act.<br/><br/>Recognition of the importance of effective co-ordination for implementing children&rsquo;s rights is evident in the opening of the Barnahus, Onehouse project in Galway.  The outcome of work in which I was involved with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the former special rapporteur on child protection, the Barnahus represents a multi-agency approach to dealing with victims of child sexual abuse.  It sees State agencies, including the Garda, the HSE and Tusla, engaging openly with each other, with the best interests of children always taking priority.  I hope that the Barnahus in Galway marks the beginning of a nationwide roll-out of such services to benefit children in all parts of the country.<br/><br/>The need for co-ordination also informs my continued engagement with relevant Departments to encourage implementation of the youth mental health pathfinder project.  This project is one of three pathfinder projects included in the 2014 Civil Service renewal programme.  While the need for a co-ordinated, whole-of-government approach to youth mental health and other issues affecting children is evident, the challenges that can be involved in joining the dots are striking.  Administrative systems and structures should work for, rather than against, those seeking to progress the realisation of children&rsquo;s rights to the highest attainable standard of health.  I urge this committee to push the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs, Health, and Education and Skills to make sure this pathfinder project is <i>in situ</i>before the end of this Government&rsquo;s term.  If it is not, thousands of children who are in enormous mental turmoil will, at best, continue to languish on waiting lists without access to the best possible health care, which is their right.  At worst, they may not see their lives as worth living.<br/><br/>As members of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, the members appreciate fully the importance of co-ordination and co-operation among Members of the Oireachtas to progress the implementation of children&rsquo;s rights under the UNCRC.  In this regard, I acknowledge the committee's report on the impact of homelessness on children, which was published on 14 November, as well as a complementary report on family and child homelessness published by the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on the same day.<br/><br/>Viewed individually and together, these reports suggest that a political consensus is emerging about the changes in law, policy, procedure and practice needed to address child and family homelessness and to mitigate the injurious effects of homelessness on children.  From my perspective as Ombudsman for Children, this consensus and the clarity it provides are encouraging.  Agreement on what actions are needed is a key prerequisite to implementing short, medium and long-term measures to address child and family homelessness effectively.<br/><br/>Although divergence and robust debate are pivotal to the democratic process, these reports illustrate how important and constructive working together can be.  Looking ahead, I encourage committee members and their Oireachtas colleagues to finalise a programme of work to address child homelessness and to work together to drive its implementation.  As with so many issues affecting children and their rights, taking a co-ordinated, collaborative approach to progressing actions can mitigate against the corrosive impact that the ebb and flow of politics and electoral cycles can have on the best-laid plans.<br/><br/>The task of implementing children&rsquo;s rights under the UNCRC is a marathon, not a sprint.  While quick wins and fixes for children are possible in some instances, making children&rsquo;s rights real in children&rsquo;s lives requires consistent focus and concerted effort from us all.  We all need to redouble our efforts so that Ireland can stand before the committee in 2021 and honestly say that, as a State, we have finally put our children first.  I thank the committee for its time.  I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

There is a lot to consider in his statement.  I thank him for going through it.  As Chair, I believe it is appropriate to acknowledge his acknowledgment of our report.</p><p>Although the ink on it is still drying, the consensus and the collaborative work on which members engaged were worthwhile.  The complementary report of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government benefited the entire process that both committees went through at the same time, unbeknownst to each other.  Given that we came to the same conclusions, it was right and proper that Dr. Muldoon acknowledged there is emerging consensus.  As my colleagues and members of the Opposition have always said, no Member of the Oireachtas has a monopoly on good ideas when it comes to housing and we have to work together, which is reflected in my opening remarks in the report.</p><p> I acknowledge a group of students present in the Public Gallery today on International Children's Day, namely, Andrea Radu, Scoil Mhuire, Buncrana, County Donegal; Anna Crowley, Scoil Phobail, County Cork; Courtney O'Connor, the King's Hospital School;. Daniel Fitzgerald Bell, Belvedere College; and Patrick McGrath, Col&aacute;iste an Chro&iacute; Naofa, County Cork.  They are very welcome.  Another group will attend a later part of the meeting.</p><p> Dr. Muldoon highlighted mental health housing and online safety as unfinished work for which the Oireachtas must come to solutions in short order.  Mental health, in particular, is an area of deep concern to all of us, in light of the regularity with which it is raised in both D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is difficult to envisage a programme in any Department failing, year on year, to spend its own money but that seems to be a recurring issue in the recruitment of specialist individuals to support children and adults.  It is an ongoing issue.  Will Dr. Muldoon comment on it?</p><p> We have discussed the housing issue and there will now be a period of reflection at the Department while it covers it.</p><p> On online safety, the committee has previously done significant work on making recommendations to the Government in respect of an online safety commissioner.  Irrespective of what it will be called, we know what the role will be.  I am pleased that, while the beginnings of the process and the realisation took a year, it finally struck the Department.  My view, which is probably shared by members and on which I would like to hear Dr. Muldoon's view, is that because of the co-ordination of the role and its importance, it cannot simply be within one Department and there has to be co-ordination.  Dr. Muldoon's office plays an important role in that oversight and he might comment in that regard.</p></speech>

The Civil Service wanted to prove that could be done.  It chose mental health as the most important area to pilot in 2014.  It was reiterated in the national youth task force recommendations in December 2017 as a top priority for the Government at that stage.  I wrote to four Ministers, namely, the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform, Health, Education and Skills, and Children and Youth Affairs, about the project.  They all agreed it was a Government policy, that they wanted to make it happen and that it was important to do, but the co-ordination has not yet happened.  My understanding is there is a proposal before the Office of the Attorney General to examine how it will happen.</p> <p>  Nevertheless, I urge the committee, as Members of the Oireachtas, to try to push the matter forward, even on an administrative basis, while the legislation is being sorted out.  People in the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health will sit in the same room and try to smooth the way for the poor child and parents trying to find mental health access.  If a child is referred by a teacher as a result of a mental health issue, there should not be three or ten different doors to knock on.  The pathfinder project is the start of a possible solution to inter-agency co-operation, to take responsibility, spread it across the Departments and recognise that the child is the focus of all our actions, not a sidebar to who is in charge of what.  If the committee could exert pressure or authority on making that happen before the next election, in order that the pathfinder project will be established and secure, irrespective of who is in government in the future, it would go some way towards helping children.  While it will not be the answer to everything, if there are people from three Departments in a room saying they have control or responsibility, we will see something.</p> <p>  I earlier researched a simple example of Government units not co-ordinating.  Tusla regionally manages 17 sections, the HSE has nine community healthcare organisations, while the Garda restructured approximately three weeks ago from 28 to 19 divisions.  If I ask someone to co-ordinate among the Garda, the HSE and Tusla, there could be three managers together but they may say they need two from one county, one from another or there may be disagreement over who is in charge of which division because they are based in different areas.  Children fall between such cracks.  We could easily get the divisions of the Garda, the HSE and Tusla to be the same, which would mean the manager in charge of each section would have the same geography.  Such simple steps could be examined by the Government as a whole to see whether they could be taken.  It would mean there would not be four or five managers, some of whom may not show up to a meeting because they consider it to be a different area from their own.  Such simple matters could be examined at the highest level.  If there is to be restructuring in any event, why have people not considered them?  The pathfinder project is the same.  We can bring people with a level of authority into the same room and say we will need to spread the workload.  From a mental health point of view, that is one of the highest level areas on which we can work.</p> <p>  On the failure to recruit, there are areas to examine.  It is the worst possible recruitment area at this stage and we need to take a different approach to it.  I suggest-----</p></speech>

If there is a crisis, I suggest there is an entitlement to act differently.  The committee clearly highlighted the 18 strands in need of recruitment and the steps that will have to be taken.  In a crisis, we can adjust the rules and say we need to do something differently.  We may need to train somebody or give him or her something different, such as better continuing professional development or various forms of encouragement, on the basis of it being a crisis area.  I have highlighted County Wexford on numerous occasions, as have members.  Many other areas are not doing well.  We can certainly take a different approach in that regard.  Due to the crisis, one cannot continue with the same approach all the time.</p> <p>  I have highlighted the issue of funding on numerous occasions.  We have increased the funding for mental health to 6% of our total health budget, or &euro;1 billion.  We still do not know how much of that &euro;1 billion goes towards children, given that, despite numerous requests I have made, the figure has not been broken down.  My best guesstimate, for which I am being optimistic, is that &euro;200 million, or approximately 0.5% of the overall health budget, goes towards children.  In the rest of Europe, 10% of the health budget is spent on mental health, a great deal more of which goes towards children.  They are simple steps at a macro level.  If we could determine how much is spent on children, we could start to work towards increasing it, as I have previously highlighted.</p> <p>  My colleague will discuss online safety.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-20a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karen McAuley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019112000002#E00500"><p>We are familiar with and welcomed the report on cybersecurity the committee published some time ago.  We have noticed and appreciate that the whole question of online safety, not least in respect of children, although it does not exclusively concern them, is a matter of concern to many people, including at our office.  The issue is being addressed in different ways by various Oireachtas committees because it has multiple strands.  Co-ordination is very important.  We made a submission to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment as part of its public consultation, which, as members will know, focused on the question of establishing an online safety commissioner, among other matters.  It also examined the roles such a commissioner might have.</p><p>Our submission noted that several roles were being contemplated.  They related to certification, oversight, audit, issue of notices, imposition of fines, reporting, appeals and mediation.<br/><br/>A plethora of things are being considered in terms of what an online safety commissioner would do.  One thing we can encourage the Department to do when it works on the legislation to establish an online safety commissioner, whatever it is called, on a statutory footing, is to really look at whether the proposed statutory functions will complement each other and whether they will complement the work that the commissioner would do <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>other bodies, for example, the role of the commissioner <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the Department of Education and Skills or the role of the commissioner <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the Department of Justice and Equality and the agencies under its aegis in terms of the criminal law element of this.  It is very important that the legislation, once published, provides clarity.  It is likely to be the case that the commissioner cannot do everything, nor would it be appropriate, but it is about identifying its appropriate role.  We would expect a regulatory mechanism as opposed to a judicial mechanism or one of law enforcement.  The appropriate roles must be identified and we must ensure that they complement each other.<br/><br/>We understand that the Department is working on an online safety and media regulation Bill.  We hope to hear more about this early in the new year, and when it is published, we will examine it carefully to see, among other things, that the envisaged roles are appropriate for a regulatory body that which is established on a statutory footing.</p></speech>

One is to promote the rights and welfare of children, which is where the policy and participation work of the office comes in.  It is for enabling our duties under section 7.  On complaints and investigations, we need to look at what role can we play.  The complaints we deal with are about public bodies.  Many of the bodies that will be covered by this are not public sector bodies.  We might, for example, have a role relating to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and in relation to the online safety commissioner itself, but it is unclear in terms of our complaints remit whether we would have a role and what it might be in terms of the actual company.</p></speech>

Dr. Muldoon mentioned inter-agency difficulties.  This is something he has also addressed in the past, and several times while I have been Chair of the committee.  He set out some practical examples where Tusla and Garda districts can mirror one another, and I am sure that also happens with the HSE and other institutions.  Returning to how the online safety commissioner will operate, I know that since 2012 and the referendum on children's rights, and since the Children First Act was passed and enacted and Tusla was established and so on, the issues of children and youth affairs have exercised themselves in their importance in society.  Looking back to problems of the past, is this perhaps a symptom of what is not quite a callous disregard but an element of unwillingness to consider it a priority?  Is that still there within Government agencies?</p></speech>

It is a crucial part, but we also have Better Outcomes - Brighter Futures, which is signed up to by all 17 Departments.  That is where we need to drive it through, that each Department, Secretary General and Minister has signed up to those and we need to see that co-ordination happen.  The Civil Service itself and the Secretaries General recognise that when they say they will create a pathfinder project that will be the template for other pathfinder projects, but we need to make that happen so that we can begin to co-ordinate more and more rather than say things are jobs for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or not their own job.  This is everyone's job.  Children must be central to Government and it can no longer be done through silos.  There are ways of doing this and better co-operation and collaboration is done all over the world.  That is why I find the pathfinder project in mental health to be a starting point for other collaborations, whether physical health, environment or whatever.  There might be six different Departments involved in a scenario such as the digital commissioner and online safety, such as Justice and Equality, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Taoiseach, Health, and Children and Youth Affairs.  A pathfinder project that provides a template that allows that co-ordination can be very beneficial throughout the whole of a child's life.</p></speech>

I was in the Chamber complaining about services for mental health, in Wexford in particular.  I am sure they will be well aware of what I was raising.  I am getting text messages not only from parents but also from staff in the area.</p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon mentioned that the Government does not have much longer.  It will be six months if we are lucky.  Is he concerned that at every election, mental health becomes one of the topics of conversation, yet when each new Government comes into office, nothing is done.  As Dr. Muldoon said, he has been trying to do things for years.  Wexford is a perfect example.  Two and a half years ago, it was promised a new premises.  Now the premises is there and they are still not in it, there is no consultant and no registrar.  What is Dr. Muldoon going to do as the Ombudsman to the Government, or the next Government?  There will be a different Minister for Health, or for mental health.  How will Dr. Muldoon cope with that?  Can he do anything now to safeguard whatever work has gone through?  We spoke of online safety, for example.  I had a Bill passed through the Seanad about taking down harmful content, websites in particular, that would teach children how to deprive themselves of food, how to self harm or how to take their lives.  That has gone through.  That will die a death unless someone in the D&aacute;il runs with it before the Government leaves office.  We were promised a mental health committee.  The previous committee was helping to scrutinise the HSE and so on, but that does not exist any more.  How will the Ombudsman for Children keep going?  How will he safeguard this so that whatever work has been done will be minded?</p></speech>

The politicians have to mind it.  It is the politicians who have to make commitments and follow through on them.  It is people like ourselves who need to ensure that the promises are in the manifestos so that mental health is on the agenda and that they are followed through.  Often mental health was not even on the agenda, so the previous Government programme was very positive in that regard.  I have to ensure that it happens and I must keep pushing for that.  I would row in behind any politicians who would do that and I urge Oireachtas Members to continue to keep it on the agenda for their parties while they are thinking about what their manifestos will be.  I will also follow through with Ministers, and I am due to meet a number of Ministers before the end of the year on mental health and the concept of the pathfinder.  It is an ongoing process.  I cannot engage in politics but I will engage with all politicians to ensure that this stays on the agenda and that no stone is left unturned.  I cannot force the Oireachtas to do things but I can continually hold a mirror up to its actions and show the reactions.  The Senator's work has been exemplary in highlighting that, and many members of this committee have done that to show the true-life effects.</p> <p>  I have been down to Wexford to meet the children, not just the parents, who have been effected.  It is heartbreaking to see it.  We are spending a lot of money bringing someone in every week to spend two days in the area.</p><p>I suggest that we could probably hire and train somebody for less money.  We could make sure he or she stays in place.  We could create a separate set of rules for the recruitment and training of people in crisis areas.  If the will existed to do so, we could bring in younger people and tell them "this is your future and we will support you".  I will continue to pursue this sort of initiative.</p><p> I would not be as downbeat about a change of Government because that would offer opportunities.  When new people and new politicians come into different positions, it presents the possibility of new wisdom and new energy.  It is part of my job to continue to keep this going.  I will not drop my energy levels.  I will not drop the enforcement.  I will not stop following through on any of the actions I have taken.  I urge all members of the committee to keep pushing this on the agendas of all their parties.  We must make sure it stays at the highest level of priority.  From my point of view, mental health is the key part of this.  We have been looking at issues like disability and homelessness.  Every one of them is connected to mental health.  If one has the resilience that comes with good mental health, one is capable of dealing with a great deal of other stuff.  I will continue to push this.</p></speech>

In addition, those who are applying for jobs have absolutely no idea where they will be located.</p></speech>

People should be able to apply for the jobs they want and move on from there.  I understand the concept underpinning this approach, which is that it allows for a geographical fit.  There is a balance to be struck, however.  If people on a panel are contacted to say that there is an opening in Clare, it is possible that someone on the panel will want it.  Similarly, someone might want to do the actual job.  I think there is a way of doing it.  The improvements that are needed must come from within the Civil Service.  The political parties must push for such improvements.  I suggest that the pathfinder approach represents the Civil Service forming its own new way of doing things.</p></speech>

The Government will not do it because it is not urgent enough.  Nothing is urgent enough for mental health.  We no longer have a committee on mental health.  Sometimes I think there is a movement coming from the public that will create a tsunami of protest.  I believe that is the only way to get the Government to change its attitude to mental health.</p></speech>

I welcome the young adults in the Gallery.  It is great to have them here as we mark the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  I thank the witnesses for finding the time to attend this meeting.  I know they have left an event that they were hosting in Dublin Castle.  I would like them to share with us and with the viewers who are looking in what exactly is going on in Dublin Castle.  There is a little disconnect.  I would love to be in Dublin Castle, to be honest.  It would be important for the viewers looking in to get a flavour of what is going on over there today.</p></speech>

Last year, we started an event called Child Talks, which is essentially a TED Talks event for children.  This year, we invited children and young people to send in a short video in which they talk about a children's rights issue for which they have a real passion.  We received a large number of applications and we have ended up with 12 young people speaking in Dublin Castle today about these issues.  We have spent the last four months working with them, giving them speech and language classes, giving them speechwriting classes and helping them with their performances.  Young people from all over the country will be able to stand up and speak for seven minutes on a range of topics that are important to them and close to their hearts, including climate change, period poverty, personalised budgets for disability, mental health and school transport.  They are being given an opportunity to be heard in the same way that 157 children got to be heard on climate issues last week.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is opening the Child Talks event and will stay to listen to these young people as well.  From our point of view, this is an example of children's rights in action.  Approximately 450 people from all over the country are coming to watch.  The event will be live-streamed on RT&Eacute; News Now to enable children and teachers in schools all around the country who cannot get to it to hear what is said.  The essence of this event is to bring children's voices to as many people as possible.  They are being allowed to talk about the issues they want to talk about and not just the issues we might think they want to talk about.  For me, it will become a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.  As young people start to talk about these matters, we will start to bring them up in here and the Oireachtas will have a greater opportunity to make changes in these areas.  That is what Child Talks is about.</p></speech>

I think it is a game-changer or a step-changer.  We saw the event that was held in the D&aacute;il last week on the initiative of the Ceann Comhairle.  Dr. Muldoon's office is doing similar work.  Young people need to feel that their voices are being heard.  It is fantastic that the event is being live-streamed into schools around the country.  I compliment Dr. Muldoon and his colleagues on giving children a voice, acting as a conduit or safe space and commissioning their reports.  I love when the reports come out every year.  I could not believe the report on school bus transport.  I am going back to this report because it was a big issue at the time.  The work of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is hugely appreciated.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on a positive aspect of Dr. Muldoon's report.  He mentioned the young people who have spent a great deal of time preparing reports in advance of today's event.  I compliment Dr. Muldoon on his preparation of his positive and focused report.  The theme this morning is one of collaboration between all the various agencies.  I ask Dr. Muldoon to explain the positives of the Barnahus, Onehouse Galway pilot project.  Where does he envisage that this could go?  What are its benefits for young people, entire families and the wider community?  Where does Dr. Muldoon see this going?  I know it is a pilot.  What are the problems with it?</p></speech>

Under this model, a child who has suffered sexual abuse and has alleged sexual abuse is brought to one venue where he or she is offered a forensic medical examination and gets to meet a member of the police.  In Iceland, Barnahus goes a step further by having a judge <i>in situ</i>.  When the child is interviewed by the police member, the judge will be listening and watching from a different room with the alleged offender and his or her barrister, who can ask the child questions through the police member.  That is the end of the process.  The child is finished with any legal set-up within 24 or 48 hours, at which point the judge makes a decision on whether the case will go forward.  We have adapted the model for Ireland because we have a slightly different legal system.  The Barnahus, Onehouse Galway pilot project has a medical forensic system.  A child who makes an allegation is brought to the Galway set-up for a forensic medical assessment.  He or she meets the garda and the social worker at the same time, which means he or she does not have to repeat the conversation and does not have to engage in different places.  The public servants who serve them come to them in that setting.  It has taken us a long time to bring about this fantastic set-up.  I have been working on it for at least ten years.  We now have the garda&iacute;, the social workers and the medical forensic personnel co-locating.  We also have support from CARI, which provides a volunteer to assist the child.<br/><br/>There is one thing missing from our point of view.I keep pushing for it.  There is no therapeutic support in that service at this moment in time.  The child goes back on a waiting list for ordinary psychology or something else.  That is the missing link as far as I am concerned.  We need to push on.  We have seen what can be done if all the people I have mentioned are co-located.  We went to New York, Oxford and Belfast, where this has been done and is happening.  When all the agencies are co-located, they work much more effectively through personal relationships and interactions.  People learn about one another's work.  It creates an opportunity to have a much safer and more collaborative piece of work for the child.  Children do not feel that they are being pushed from Billy to Jack at different times.  They do not have to go to different people to repeat their stories.  Similarly, their parents and other family members know they have to go to one place only.  When they do so, they are introduced to one person who introduces them to the next person.  The story is passed on.  They do not have to take charge of repeating it.  We hope to put in place a therapeutic strand to enable children to move on to therapy fairly quickly.  That creates a holistic support for the child or young person in question.</p><p>That means that system allows the child to recover from a mental health situation and move forward.  It also means the forensic and criminal justice system looks after itself much more quickly.  The child does not have to worry as much.  It is not a case that after being interviewed by the Garda, a person could be interviewed by social workers in three months and then he or she might get the chance to go to therapy.  All these things happen one after another.  It all happens fairly rapidly and they co-ordinate together.  That is a huge step forward.</p><p> One of the best examples I always give was when we went to Oxford.  They gave an example of a phone call coming into a social worker at 4.45 on a Friday evening.  In this scenario, somebody is concerned about a child because the father has threatened to take the child out of hospital and run away with him.  The policeman is sitting beside the lady taking the phone call, and as soon as she writes down the address and before she has hung up the phone, the police have a policeman at that house checking things out, simply because they are sitting in the same room and working together.  We all know that at 4.45 on a Friday evening in any social work office, nothing will be done subsequently until Monday afternoon.  Those are the simple things and just by co-locating we will change the system, change the thinking and change the opportunities that come for our children.  We will provide proper children's rights systems.</p></speech>

That is a pilot that is taking place.  If Dr. Muldoon had the magic ball in front of him, how many of these service centres would we need in Ireland?  Ireland is not that big.  It has taken ten years to bring that to pilot stage, so are we planning forward on where the next step is?</p></speech>

It was called the child advocacy centre at that stage.  They essentially think that four or five service centres would be sufficient and then the spokes would go out from those.  That would not be too far away.  Even Galway and the top of Donegal are a long way away for forensic assessment.  Maybe we would have one in Sligo, one in Limerick or Cork and one in Dublin.  That is the rough sense of it.  Those would be the specialised areas and then the therapeutic engagement would be out closer to the home.  It is already set up, there are already thoughts and plans in place on how it could be done when it rolls out, and it is hoped it will follow that same pattern.  Again, for me, it is about making sure the therapy is there as well.  If that piece is tidied up, it will be a big help, but the therapy has to follow.  Not all children will need it, but at least they know it is there and it is part of the same system.</p></speech>

I am sorry for being late but I picked it up as Dr. Muldoon was talking about the pathfinder project.  That is something I am trying to push through in the D&aacute;il.  It is with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that is where we need to move it on from.  I do not know if any correspondence has come back or if Dr. Muldoon knows anything from his side.  I need to table another parliamentary question on it.</p> <p>  I heard the discussion on online bullying and cyberbullying.  If this has been stated already, please let me know and I can check the transcript.  I refer to social media and the Office of the Ombudsman's findings on the culture of social media.  I am starting to see more evidence that children are being influenced by what adults are doing on social media because it is open to everybody and everyone can see it.  I know we have had hearings in this committee where we have discussed peer-to-peer communication between children across social media platforms, but I am more worried about what children are seeing adults do on social media and how we will grasp that nettle via free speech versus censorship and all the other parts that go around this debate.  From where I have seen social media go in the past six months to two years and the culture of how people are conducting themselves on social media, that may have a huge subliminal effect on children and on what they are reading and seeing.  It is incumbent on all of us that we look at this from a different viewpoint, that we do not just look at it singularly from a children's point of view but that we look at the culture of this across the board-----</p></speech>

It is difficult for us to do this because the technology is moving so fast, and because the technology is driving the culture, everything is moving extremely fast and it is only in retrospect that we start to pick this up.  I would be interested in the witnesses' thoughts on that or if any studies have been done.  On the mental health side, the subliminal effects and how we conduct ourselves are things I am starting to research more and more because nine times out of ten we would not have these conversations face to face with people that we have online.  This can be read online and there is a digital footprint there that can be read as well.  What kind of effect is that having?</p> <p>  I also have a fear outside of the area of reading negative messages on social media in terms of how interpersonal skills are developing for children in the education system, that is, how they speak to each other and how people approach each other.  All too often we see the medium of communication is through technology and is very technology focused.  What kind of effect is that having on interpersonal skills or on communication?  That goes back to the mental health sphere again in that the interpersonal communication is not there.  It is across a medium of younger people feeling more comfortable texting than speaking face to face.  Are we losing the art of conversation where grey areas and nuances can be viewed or seen as opposed to a conversation being labelled or put in a box because it fits the technology or the algorithm it faces?  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>

My understanding is there is some proposal in with the Attorney General for decision, and I will be pushing to get that out as quickly as possible, even if it needs to be adjusted.  I said earlier on that we can still create a pathfinder project office without the legislation in place.  We could do it on an administrative basis for a period of time and allow ourselves a bit of leeway while we get that legislation sorted out.  I am seriously disappointed with the fact the idea was established in 2014 and we are still only looking at the legislation options now.  That should have been done a long time ago.  It could have even happened within the national youth task force in 2017 where we have had two years to put that together.  That is unfortunate from my point of view and I would love if we could get it established before the fall of this Government.</p> <p>  On social media and online communication, I will pass on to my colleague, Dr. McAuley.  There is that sense that we have children and young people here.  There are still many young people and children who are very good at the communications side of things, but the Deputy is saying there is that possibility that cultural change will happen.  From my point of view, the real answer will be in education.  How we establish our culture will come from the four year olds upwards.</p></speech>

We have to go back to the basics and decide how we will interact as a community and a culture.  I am always talking about this.  It is a huge philosophical debate and it is difficult know where to start.</p></speech>

I am not sure whether there is a monopoly on wisdom on it.  We all know it is very complex.  We all know that people individually and collectively have a role to play, starting with personal responsibility for our actions and our decisions about what we do and do not do and what we say and do not say to people, whether online or off-line.  This does not just need a multi-agency approach or whole-of-Government approach, it requires a whole-of-society approach.  It is about looking at what measures can be mobilised appropriately in the right way.  We must ask where law is necessary, where criminal law as opposed to civil law is necessary, where regulation is necessary and what can it do and what can education do.  We have spoken about this issue previously and I know committee members are aware of it.  We said, and we are not alone in this, that the whole question of educating children and young people from a very young age, from the very beginning of their formal education, so they are equipped with the knowledge and skills in an age-appropriate way to navigate this environment, is very important.  There is a range of measures and people who have a role to play in different ways.  There is not one simple answer and we all know this.</p> <p>  We work with our colleagues in the European Network of Ombudspersons for Children and our focus this year was on the issue of children's rights in the context of digital media and the digital environment.  As part of this, we worked with young people from various countries throughout Europe.  One of the things they were very keen to emphasise, and we heard this from children and committee members will be familiar with it, is that it is very important to frame this conversation with regard to the positives and negatives.  We are all concerned for children's well-being, welfare and safety and, understandably, we can focus on the protection side of things and on the negatives with regard to the damage that can be done.  We also need to take on board the fact that social media is very important to children and young people.</p></speech>

Looking through the lens of children's rights, any number of children's rights are engaged in this domain and it is important to take a balanced approach to it.</p> <p>  Given the day that is in it, it would be appropriate to mention that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child is working on the development of a new general comment on the whole question of children's rights in a digital environment.  It is expected this will be ready towards the end of next year or early 2021.  It is some time away.  The committee is engaging directly with children and young people from throughout the world to hear their views.  It is an area on which our office will continue to work.  We must figure out not only what is an appropriate role but also what is an effective role that our office can play in this area.  It is not enough for us to express concern.  We have to figure out what we can do.  Something we all need to think about is how we engage directly with children and young people on this issue to make sure we get their perspectives and ideas.  They are very good at coming up with very practical solutions to certain issues.</p></speech>

We need to have a balanced debate.</p> <p>  Senator Freeman spoke about political motivation in the context of mental health and asked where we will go with the next Government.  I do not have to preach to the converted and the witnesses and I are on the same page.  Mental health has come from such a low base.  In the 1990s, few people voted on mental health issues.  They may have spoken about it but they did not go to the polling stations to vote on mental health.  Now more and more people are doing so and it is up to the likes of us across the party divide to keep pushing this.  In the next election when people go to doors the voters will decide.  Voters will state they will vote on mental health and ask about the policies.  I remember going to doors with my father in the 1990s with a policy on mental health and people were looking at me asking why we had a policy on mental health and asking what it was all about.  That was in 1997.  We have come all the way from there.  We have come from such a low base.  To be honest, the witnesses are right and the people will drive it by how they vote on it, if they vote.  It is incumbent on us, as politicians, to get this.  That is my tuppence worth.</p></speech>

This is something about which I feel very strongly.  There is the notion of monkey see, monkey do.  I do not know how we can expect children to behave any differently from adults.  I do not know when the digital safety commissioner will come into place.  I am very frustrated that it has not happened already.  Will it be possible for a digital safety commissioner to place an onus on digital companies to have an awareness campaign?  It sounds ridiculous that we have to be thinking about making adults aware that they should interact with one another in a respectful way.  Short of going back and rearing people it is hard to see how a state, country or government can tell adults what constitutes appropriate behaviour.  A great deal of what we, as politicians, put up with online is in the realm of harassment and bullying.  Most of us do not go on about it too much because we are so used to it but the fact we have become used to it is a problem in itself.  It is a cultural problem.  Do the witnesses believe the digital safety commissioner can play a pivotal and important role in shifting the direction we are going in?  I do not know where this will all end.  That may sound negative.  We have to think of practical ways in which we can improve the situation.  Could an awareness campaign and investment by technology companies make an impact?</p></speech>

Unless we, as adults, do not call this what it is, namely, bullying, harassment and inappropriate, how do we expect children to call it what it is?  It is incumbent on us to step forward.  It might be seen as weakness or not being able for it.  We are able but we need to call it for what it is.  Until such time as adults identify that this behaviour is inappropriate, we cannot expect children to see it.</p></speech>

There is online bullying and harassment.  We see it and we call it what it is.  There are also the grey areas, which we find it very difficult to define because everything is boxed into an algorithm.  Somebody may be writing something with the best intentions but it can be interpreted in a different way because it is devoid of emotion.  There is no emotion behind it.  The tone of voice is not there and neither is the body language.  It is not in context.  It is incumbent on us to educate ourselves.  I do not know how we will do this.  That is my point and I am throwing it out there.  How  do we put on the filter so that we think about how content will be interpreted?  I try to do it when I am writing.  I ask how it will be interpreted when people, particularly children, read it cold.  This is not to blame anybody.  It is about knowledge and understanding.  It is about educating ourselves on how we do it.  We are behind the eight ball because the technology is moving so fast and human capability is not able to catch up.</p></speech>

The things that we thought ten years ago were very funny as sarcastic comments, for example, are much more important and words are very much seen as meaning what they mean.  The subtleties and grey areas that were mentioned are being lost for a new generation.  Every generation faces a challenge.  This is probably our challenge and it has to come from us, as adults.  There is a new generation of parents who will understand that and will create a new style for parenting their children in a digital world.  New parents are aged between 25 and 30 years and, therefore, are digital citizens.  They will have grown up in a digital world and will need to teach their children the subtleties and protective manoeuvres or skills.  We will not be totally alone doing this.</p><p> In the context of a digital safety commissioner, as my colleague, Dr. McAuley stated, it has to be part of a whole product.  It has to be part of education, justice and communications or the whole realm.  We have to decide, as a society, are we willing to create a new chapter for these young people and what inputs will make them safe.</p><p> Can we bring the multinationals to bear on this issue?  I have no doubt that we can.  We will also have to a European wide thing as well.  Our colleagues in Europe are doing so.  In Brussels, they are looking at this as well.  I mean the data protection commissioner and all of those sorts of people.  The members will know the breadth of people that are involved.  If we have a template and can create a conversation, as the members have started here today, over the next 12 to 18 months one can create a consensus that, in turn, can create opportunities for us to change things.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleagues, Dr. Susan Finnerty, Inspector of Mental Health Services, and Ms Rosemary Smyth, director of standards and quality assurance.  We are pleased to be here today to discuss workforce planning.<br/><br/>The commission is the regulator for mental health services in Ireland.  We are an independent statutory body established in April 2001 under the Mental Health Act.  The commission&rsquo;s mandate is to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to protect the interests of persons admitted and detained under the 2001 Act.  In addition, under the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, the commission is responsible for establishing the new decision support service to support decisionmaking by and for adults with capacity difficulties.<br/><br/>At this juncture, it is important to point out that 90% of mental health services are delivered in primary care settings.  A further 10% are delivered within specialist mental health services, including community residences.  Under the 2001 Act, the statutory scope of mental health regulation is limited to inpatient services only, which are estimated to make up less than 1% of mental health services in Ireland.<br/><br/>Although the Inspector of Mental Health Services can inspect all mental health services, there is effectively no regulatory oversight of the majority of services that are delivered outside of inpatient facilities.  We welcome the work of the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older persons, Deputy Jim Daly, to facilitate change in this area by commencing a process to amend the current Mental Health Act.<br/><br/>The principal functions of the Inspector of Mental Health Services are to visit and inspect regulated services, that is, approved centres or acute units, annually to assess compliance with the regulations, rules and codes set out by the commission; to visit and inspect any premises where mental health services are provided; and to review the quality and safety of mental health services in the State.  Following every inspection, a detailed report is produced and published by the commission.  The inspector also reports annually on themed inspections carried out each year.  For example, in the past two years, the inspector has reported on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, 24hour supervised community residences, the physical health of people with severe mental illness, and mental health rehabilitation services.  While we do not have regulatory oversight of these areas, the fact that the inspector visits and we publish the report creates a transparency about the reality of life for people who are receiving our services.<br/><br/>As a general comment, it is evident that the provision of mental health services is inconsistent across the country.  The services lack proper planning, resourcing and integration to ensure each geographical area receives the same level of quality and care.<br/><br/>Regarding mental health policy, in a wellorganised health system, policy is set by the Government on foot of a political mandate.  It is then implemented by the relevant stakeholders or service providers.  Implementation is monitored against agreed metrics using a data evidence based approach and reviewed and evaluated on a regular basis.  The Irish national mental health policy, A Vision for Change<i>, </i>has been in place since 2006.  Its core concepts, which are admirable, are recovery, person centred services, partnership, user and family involvement and the delivery of multidisciplinary, communitybased services.  However, the commission has referred on numerous occasions to the absence of any independent monitoring of A Vision for Change, a situation that has remained unchanged since 2013.  The commission strongly advocates that any reviewed or refreshed document should include and consider modern evidenced based approaches to service transformation, leadership, workforce planning and development.  It should learn the lessons of the years since 2006 in terms of the application of policy.<br/><br/>At the highest level of our mental health services workforce, it is both noteworthy and disappointing that the Health Service Executive removed the post of national director for mental health.  The removal of this core leadership position sent out a clear and unambiguous, although perhaps unintended, message that mental health is not a priority.  It is also evident to the commission that this has negatively impacted on the delivery of services nationally.  That it was permitted to occur, in addition to the slow, <i>ad hoc</i>and unmonitored implementation of A Vision for Change, is disappointing.<br/><br/>In terms of resources, Irish mental health services have significant resourcing challenges, not least in staffing.  To make progress in these areas, adequate funding is required.  The commission welcomed the additional funding allocated by the Government to mental health services in 2019.  However, we are conscious that the current level of expenditure on mental health is still less than the target set out in A Vision for Change, which was a document from 2005.<br/><br/>As will be discussed in more detail, the commission is cognisant of the continued difficulties in maintaining and increasing levels of adequately trained staff.  The HSE&rsquo;s workforce planning document, published in October 2018, outlined that the mental health workforce is at 76% of the levels recommended in A Vision for Change.  Interestingly, the main data findings indicate that community staff, which is where our vision was to be, account for only 27% of the overall workforce in mental health.  Based on our inspections, we are aware of the serious effect that a lack of adequately trained staff has on the quality and quantity of services.  Given the labour intensive, human oriented nature of mental health care services, it is imperative that the mental health service budget be increased to at least the level outlined in A Vision for Change if full and effective staffing is to be provided in mental health care teams across the country.</p><p>Research clearly indicates the economic returns and benefits of investing in mental health supports and the effective training of staff, as well as the enormous cost of limiting investment, both on the health and the economy of our country.  If we are to put in place modern community services and move out of the shadow of institutional care, workforce planning and change management are key.</p><p> Additional funding is fundamental to changing workforce practices and development.  However, there is also a need to change how the State uses existing funding to redevelop services.  Creative and innovative approaches, improved team working, building up community services and changing work practices are having an impact in certain CHO areas, while others appear to be stagnant and trapped in a closed loop of unhealthy logistical and clinical practices from the traditional institutional system.  The mental health services in the country that are of the highest quality have adapted by changing their approaches and practices.  Some services have recruited and trained mental health support workers to undertake nonnursing duties, which has allowed for the further development of specialist nursing roles.  Nursing staff in some services facilitate additional specialist outpatient services, for example in early intervention and homeless services.  These services contribute to reduced admissions to inpatient facilities, shorter stays and early discharges.  As a result, the pressure on the staff in approved centres is also reduced.  Lack of these community services has the knockon effect of longer lengths of stay for people in inpatient services, which has resulted in overcrowding in some facilities.  Another key development is the use of the voluntary sector in providing services to people with psychiatric illnesses in nonresidential community care.  That is often forgotten.  If we are to move into communities in the future, it will not be with just the HSE.  It must also be with the voluntary sector and the people who are at the coalface.</p><p> In countries with highly developed mental health services, clinical workforce planning is rooted in and supported by prudent and decisive strategies and programmes.  While these may exist in Ireland, it is not evident to the commission that governance, leadership development and transformation strategies link to or drive workforce development our mental health services.  It is disappointing to observe the continued lack of development of rehabilitation services in Ireland.</p><p> I want to talk briefly about performance management, development and support, PMDS.  This is often forgotten about but it is critical to enable a service to develop and function.  Following on from public service agreements, PMDS is now common practice across the civil and public services.  It is a process for establishing a shared understanding about what is to be achieved and how it is to be achieved, and an approach towards managing people that increases the probability of success.  If we are to transform our health services, it is an essential aspect of governance and management to facilitate individuals and teams to link performance to policy and operational plans.  The commission is aware that in 2012, the HSE introduced a formal performance management system to fulfil the terms of the public service agreements.  However, the commission has found very little evidence of this approach in practice.  The commission has reservations about the success of any national policy, workforce initiatives or plans that are not underpinned by an appropriate performance management framework.</p><p> We inspect approved centres in the context of regulation 26, which relates to staffing.  The most common reason for noncompliance within regulation 26 over the three year period was subsection 4, which relates to training.  We also look at skill mix and the number of staff.  That does not raise its head as much as staff training.  The regulation states: "The registered proprietor shall ensure that staff have access to education and training to enable them to provide care and treatment in accordance with best contemporary practice."  Essentially, many approved centres were noncompliant with this because not all health care professionals were up to date with mandatory training in, for example, basic life support, professional management of aggression and violence, fire safety and the Mental Health Act 2001.</p><p> The past number of years have been difficult in the context of providing and maintaining a high-quality and safe mental health service for our people.  However, we have ample opportunity for the future lives of those people suffering with mental ill health to transform our mental health service, if we put in place, fund and implement the right policy.  The end goal for each and every one of us must be to move out of the shadow of institutional care by creating modern, wellstaffed community services in the areas where people live and can be close to their families and homes.  The commission recommends that any workforce planning should be aligned with national policy to ensure that the system as a whole develops, innovates, and transforms.  The Department of Health and the HSE should reinstate the national director role for mental health to ensure dedicated, senior level executive oversight and accountability.  The transformation of our mental health service must be evidencedbased, connected to and underpinned by a performance development and support system.  I thank the committee for listening.  We will be happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

Some 65 are currently on the register.  The inspector is entitled to visit every other mental health service but the legislation does not provide for enforcement, so there are no powers, following our findings, to enforce, close down or attach a condition.  We are using moral authority at present to bring about changes, mainly in community residences.  Other services are not regulated as such.  We visit them but no body currently regulates them.</p></speech>

The Mental Health Commission produces detailed inspection reports of inpatient units.  We often see very serious breaches of regulation and policy within our institutions.

Our acute hospitals, maternity hospitals, etc., are not regulated at all, notwithstanding everything that has happened.  At least there is scrutiny and rigour regarding the acute services.  We are beginning to find that the currency of beds in acute services is a thing of the past.  We need to get into the currency of people, who live in communities, not institutions.  I have regulated charities and was previously a regulator in HIQA.  I think the mental health service is developing in such a way that it is transforming in the community but the regulation and law have not caught up.  The idea that regulations will keep people safe is a faulty concept.  What will keep people safe is the staff and others who look after them.  From our perspective, in the review of the Act, we would like to be able to regulate the entire mental health service.</p></speech>

I hear consistently across different aspects of mental health services that this has had a detrimental impact on the delivery of services within the mental health sector.  The commission has called for the role to be re-instated.  Have the witnesses seen, in practical terms, a real impact from the loss of that director from the top table?</p></speech>

Previously, when in HIQA and the Charities Regulator, having access to people at the highest level effected change because there was significant competition for resources.  Ms Smyth can speak to the fact that without a leader at the appropriate level, mental health services tend to get pushed to one side.</p></speech>

When we identify areas of non-compliance and breaches of regulations, particularly in the context of premises where significant resources are required to rectify the breaches, it is really from a national level.  When we are addressing it at a local level we cannot get the same response; we get a response to the effect that "We do not have the money, we do not have the budget."  It has to go to national level.  When the national director was in post as the regulator and person responsible for registration and enforcement, we could definitely see a difference and see impact driven down to the local levels.  Once that post was removed, it was very hard to engage with the appropriate people to ensure action plans were being put in place to ensure compliance.</p></speech>

I know there is Sl&aacute;intecare, transformation and so on.  However, I just ask a simple question as to who is in charge and who is running the show and the service.  When we ask that question of the HSE, it is very hard to get a clear answer.  That is nothing to do with any individual.  When we go to the trouble of creating a national policy which comes from the top down, I do not understand who decides we are not going to apply it.  That is worrying.  If people had gone to the effort of communicating with others to create a national policy and then there was just an <i>ad hoc</i>approach whereby someone decided we were not going to apply it, that would not be good enough from my perspective.</p></speech>

I just want to touch on the issue of the appointment of non-specialists as consultants.  This was not mentioned in the opening statement so I hope our guests do not mind me raising it.  I refer to the big issue whereby people who are not qualified in psychiatry are being appointed as consultants.  What impact is that having?  The President of the High Court has stated that this is scandalous.  He has reported the situation to the Attorney General and a number of other bodies.  What is Mr. Farrelly's view on that?  What is its impact?</p></speech>

We have mental health tribunals where we work to vindicate the rights of people who are detained.  We would not allow any consultant on those tribunals unless they were on the specialist register.  Just to be clear, we would not employ someone to vindicate people's rights unless he or she was on that specialist register.  In terms of the health service and whom it employs, I will ask Dr. Finnerty to come in.</p></speech>

The training to become a psychiatrist is long and very detailed.  To put somebody who has not had experience into psychiatric care management and have him or her leading a team is concerning.  We would call for any consultant psychiatrist who is appointed to have the relevant training.  One would not appoint a surgeon who did not have the relevant training.</p></speech>

To qualify as a specialist, doctors go through extensive training.  Even in terms of leadership, it was described to me how a person who had to have a nurse help them to put an IV in one week was leading an entire team the next week.

That results in orders being revoked unnecessarily and, as a result, people are having to go through the whole process again or are perhaps undergoing early discharges without receiving appropriate treatment.  From that perspective, it is quite concerning that the most vulnerable people who are using the mental health services are not afforded an appropriately qualified person to manage their care.</p></speech>

It may be a bit of a quirk but in the 2018 HRB report, in respect of admissions for children and adolescents, it is stated that while its statistics are in respect of every child under the age of 18, the Mental Health Commission is restricted by the 2001 Act and only includes children under 18 who are not married.  It must be somewhat unhelpful to be putting statistics together when different arms of healthcare within the State are using different metrics, aside from the fact that it would seem quite anomalous and somewhat archaic and something that should be changed at this stage.</p></speech>

It does not cover the fact that young men and women, children and adolescents, should not be accommodated in adult units, whatever definition we apply.  Compared to our nearest neighbours such as the UK or Scotland, on our evidence base and statistics and how we judge things we are definitely a little bit behind the curve in Ireland.  We are more than happy to work with any agency to ensure that statistics for the public are good and correct.</p></speech>

Donegal has two and half times the admissions as Monaghan while the two counties are relatively close to each other in terms of population.  Monaghan also has the highest suicide rate, according to the National Office of Suicide Prevention.  I also hear that Monaghan has pretty decent community mental health care.  Can we extract any correlation or causation?  Why would one county have admission rates that are dramatically higher than those in another county, while that other county has very high suicide rates?  Is there anything we can take from that or is it more dangerous than anything to be looking at the statistics like that?</p></speech>

Donegal and Cavan-Monaghan currently are in the same CHO area so the governance would be the same.  Not all people who die by suicide actually get to the psychiatric services.  They usually attend primary care services.  One aspect that could be looked at is how they access the psychiatric service, whether there is open access for people who are mentally ill and who are suicidal.  It also points to an element for which I do not have any figures, namely, primary care facilities and resourcing in those areas.  We would be looking not only for general practitioners but also for counsellors, psychologists and so on based in community care and primary care.  That area might be explored.  Unfortunately I do not have the answer.</p></speech>

It is how it is spent and, as we go out into the community, realising that it is not always doctors, nurses and GPs but the next frontier for people in terms for not-for-profits.</p></speech>

We know that there is a group of stakeholders refreshing A Vision for Change.  Ultimately, one imagines that the Government, through the Oireachtas, enables the Department to drive through a policy.  Policy should be owned at that level.  Then the HSE and the different agencies should made accountable and funded according to that policy.  It is confusing as to who owns the policy.  Even A Vision for Change was not necessarily set out by the HSE.  There is a weakness in that regard.  It is difficult to know who owns it.  There is a board of the HSE.  As far as I am concerned, the accountable people for implementing it must be at that board level and making sure things are happening.  When one looks into mental health services, it is hard to get clarity and accountability of who is in charge and who is governing them.</p></speech>

I do not believe our health service in its entirety has grasped the concept of PMDS.  I am not sure it is culture within the HSE or Tusla.  It is not just mental health services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-20a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019112000002#G01700"><p>From my background and previous work, I have a fairly detailed knowledge of PMDS, particularly development aspect of it.  There are a number of factors involved.  Clearly, it is unfair and unreasonable to expect that staff will participate in PMDS in a situation where many of the failings are the result of understaffing and under-resourcing.  It is tough in that environment.  It is also extremely hard to do the development section of PMDS when one is under-resourced.  If one does not have enough staff to cover one&rsquo;s roster, one most definitely cannot release staff to get the necessary training.</p> <p>  People are signed up to PMDS via the national wage agreements.  There is an element in that which has to be properly resourced, however.  There is much work that has to be done in advance of the health service being ready to properly engage.  PMDS can be incredibly positive but it is an exercise in finding out the failings of an organisation.  An individual cannot be responsible for that.  A site or a community health nurse is not responsible for the fact they are operating off a team which is less than 50% of what it should be.  If one tries to do PMDS with that individual, it is tough.  There items in his or her job description that they just cannot get to do because physically one does not have the time.  When one gets to the development aspect of PMDS, it is tough to do that.</p></speech>

Everybody else has managed to give it a go since 2012 across the different areas.  It is interesting that it seems to be absent.  From our perspective, the idea of connecting everybody together is important as it is not just individuals but teams.  Particularly when one is under-resourced and struggling, that is the time one meets a couple of times a year with one&rsquo;s manager to connect on what is achievable and not.</p> <p>  One of the first pillars of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation this year was to look at that area which was due to happen either in this or the previous quarter.  I appreciate that it is difficult for people.  However, unless one gets that time to think about things and connect them, one will always be scrambling.  It is tricky but it is not meant to be draconian tool.</p></speech>

We would be ignoring the elephant in the room if we did not mention them.  I do not think one can make a direct comparison.  The Public Service Pay Commission specifically focused on issues relating to the health service in view of the challenges and difficulties around recruitment and retention, a nice way of saying that the health service is understaffed.  It is not fair to the men and women working in the health service to draw a direct line comparison with people working in other sectors of the public service.  That comparison does not exist on a like-for-like basis.  Before one would talk about PMDS, one would have to address the issue of the chronic understaffing which is evident in the mental health services and right across the health service.  It would make any issue relating to PMDS exceptionally challenging.  This is not because individuals do not want to engage with it.  From my experience, which is fairly extensive, healthcare workers actively want to engage in PMDS but there are issues with time and so forth.  It was stated community makes up less than 27% of the staff in the mental health service.  One hears about the postcode lottery.  Does that leave areas where cover is just not there?</p></speech>

The variation in funding and staffing across the country is quite stark.  Just taking the CAMHS, child and adolescent mental health services, in particular, services in community healthcare organisation, CHO 2, Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, were funded &euro;90 <i>per capita</i>.  In CHO 5, it was only at 45%.  There does not seem to be any particular reason for this.  Sometimes, it appears that he who shouts the loudest or puts forward a better business case tends to get the staff.  It is a postcode lottery as to what access to services one gets.</p></speech>

I was a member of the health board and learned a few lessons there, some which have stood to me in good stead.  There is a presumption that the rule prevails across the country.  There should be no changes from one area to another.  The same conditions arise, perhaps to a greater extent in some areas depending on its social and economic make-up.  Will Dr. Finnerty comment on whether the seriousness of the discrepancies between one area and another is creating a problem for the delivery of mental health services?</p></speech>

The provision of rehabilitation services are very important for about 14% of people who suffer from serious mental illness so that they may live in the community and reach their potential.  Some CHO areas do not have a rehabilitation service.  What services there are are scant to say the least.  That means people do not have access to that essential service and they are languishing in highly supervised residences and acute units.  That example is quite stark.  I looked at the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, two years ago.  Its staffing is only 60% of what it should be.  In some areas there are good, accessible CAMHS and in other places there are not.</p></speech>

It tends to be a knee-jerk reaction.  There will be people in acute services who need rehabilitation, which is provided in the private sector a long way from their homes.  That is not ideal.  There have been some moves by the HSE to provide other agency services and staff such as housing officers or individual placement and support, IPS, which is the placement service for people looking for jobs, and that has started to be rolled out.  There is some recognition that maybe the nursing or medical model does not always work and we have to look outside the box.</p></speech>

We have closed down many of the institutions but we have not necessarily replaced them and thought about the community services.  If a new policy develops and goes through the political system, people should be held accountable for its implementation and they cannot decide what not to implement.  There is a plan there.  A model such as Sl&aacute;intecare, but with some sort of a module around mental health because it tends to get forgotten about, seems to work where people are held accountable.<br/><br/>Another thing that would be useful in the political system would be an agreed approach around reviewing the Mental Health Act and getting that through.  It was a good policy.  The problem was its <i>ad hoc</i>implementation.</p></speech>

Has the system improved in its favour or have things gone the other way in the past ten years?  I ask mindful that we have incurred the most serious economic crash in our history and that two things came together as demand increased and resources decreased.  That was very difficult to manage and still is.  All the indications suggest that the estimates to date are way short of what will be required.  We must bear that in mind when we deal with this.  Have things improved or deteriorated in keeping pace with the rest of the health services?</p></speech>

We no longer have large institutional buildings.  They have all closed down and we have modern mental health services now.  That is an improvement for those who have to use the acute inpatient services.  There is also reform of the legislation so that anyone who has been involuntarily detained has an automatic right to review, which is very positive.  I would reiterate the point on the lack of parity in service provision in the community, CAMHS and rehabilitation.  Outside inpatient services, service provision is patchy, in that it is good in some areas but needs to be improved elsewhere.</p></speech>

Do the referrals come from school medical examinations?  Are they from reports from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or some other source?  Some time ago, I asked a parliamentary question on the number of children aged between eight and 13 years who had attended at emergency departments having self-harmed or attempted to do so, and did so repeatedly.

There is a whole population of young people who require some form of counselling or support but not necessarily in CAMHS.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has put counselling psychologists and assistant psychologists into primary care, and that would be the first port of call.</p> <p>  The investment in primary care is key for young people, whether it is Jigsaw or psychologists in primary care, counsellors or social workers at that level.  That will allow the CAMHS teams to deal with children such as those described by the Deputy, with repeated self-harm, depression, early psychosis and so on.  That is where the investment is needed.</p></speech>

Regarding one of the things that emerged from the research about medication, one can see the number of people who go on antibiotics and fail to complete the programme.  It is not about adherence, rather it is about an individual citizen who has paid or whose family has paid taxes for years.  If this person becomes unwell, he or she seeks treatment.  If something is properly explained to a person and that person is given a choice, he or she usually goes along with a programme.  Adherence is not so good if a person only gets two or three minutes and the medication and its side effects, such as putting on weight, are not explained.  Most people would admit that medication that is now available has come a long way and has advanced in recent years, but it is moving to an idea where someone is not actually having something done to him or her.  Rather, he or she is being provided with a service that he or she must understand and be part of.  That movement is beginning to happen.</p></speech>

To my mind, this is a very false economy.  I would like to see a more uniform process applying in all cases so that there would not be peaks and valleys in either the quality of the services available throughout the country and the quality of attention given to individual cases, particularly in the case of young people who, very often, decide to withhold information as to whether they are taking their medication.  That has been my experience.  I would not have dealt with as many cases as the witnesses would deal with but I deal with a fair number of them.  I would like to be reassured about that in terms of continuation of their medication programme.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses comment on that because some services have been amalgamated?  For example, mental health services in south Tipperary have been amalgamated with mental health services in Ennis.   I understand that this has led to substantial pressure on beds and admitting patients and led to subsequent overcrowding.</p> <p>  My second point concerns presentations to general practice and, going back to Deputy Durkan, who is the source of referrals.  In general practice, one is left trying to filter things that need to go to CAMHS, namely, serious mental health issues and those that can be dealt with counselling or other services.  Unfortunately, the number of team members missing from CAMHS teams is substantial.  For example, there may not be a psychologist or a team may only have half a social worker, as it were, or lose a community psychiatric nurse, who may be on holidays or maternity leave and may not be replaced.  In many cases, CAMHS teams other than the psychiatrist - the backup personnel - are not there because the teams are understaffed.  It then falls to the GP to decide if an issue is a serious one, in which case he or she will send it to the psychiatrist in CAMHS, or whether it can be medicated by himself or herself.  There is pressure on GPs to medicate themselves because the backup talk therapy and support services are not there.  In some cases, there may be unnecessary medication because the alternative talk therapies are not there.  Is there a sense that there is overmedication because of a lack of the other supports that should be there within community psychiatric services?</p> <p>  Regarding recruitment and retention of staff, one of the findings of the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Future of Mental Health Care was that there was a disconnect between the HSE centrally and front-line needs at ground level.  A total of 25 steps needed to be taken before a staff member could be recruited.  It is to be hoped, with the new Sl&aacute;intecare proposals, there will be a regionalisation of services so the number of those steps will be reduced substantially so that a staff member can be recruited in a relatively short time.  Will the witnesses address this point?  What engagement does the commission have with Tusla regarding children's problems and child services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-20a.186" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Susan Finnerty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019112000002#J00700"><p>Regarding the overcrowding in some units, it is interesting to note with regard to where someone lives in the country whether his or her local psychiatric unit tends to operate at over or under capacity.  There are examples of both.  The Chairman mentioned Tipperary and the south east.  Two psychiatric units in that area have closed - St Senan&rsquo;s psychiatric hospital in Enniscorthy, which was an old asylum but had an admissions unit, and St. Michael's unit in Clonmel, which was an acute psychiatric unit.  What has fallen behind is the development of community services in that area.  While the number of beds has been reduced, community services such as home-based treatment teams have not been put in place.  The area has crisis houses but they tend to get blocked up.  Admissions tend to be much lower in Cavan-Monaghan, which has well-developed community services, and services do not operate at over capacity.  The key is the development of community services, not necessarily more beds.  It involves stopping people getting into acute units and not being able to be discharged.  Rehabilitation, which I mentioned earlier, is an example of that.  Without developing rehabilitation services, people will become long-stay patients in acute units and will block beds for people who need to come in.</p></speech>

He painted a picture with which we would be familiar.  GPs tell the commission about being left with a dilemma about how to care for a patient, including the risk.  That comes back to community services and planning.  We seem to be stuck in accident and emergency in this country but other 24-hour wrap-around services are available to a GP.  This was all being done 20 years ago in other countries but we seem to be consumed with inpatient beds as opposed to developing the community services where people want to be treated.  We need to be clear.  Nobody wants to go to a psychiatric inpatient unit.  If care was available in his or her area, particularly in rural areas, he or she would access it.  The State must be commended on Jigsaw.  This is not the HSE but is funded through the HSE and the State.  Many of these services, such as Pieta House, are born out of gaps because the services are not there, so we need to identify the gaps and see how we create the momentum around that in communities.</p> <p>  We do not have full visibility regarding overmedication.  From working with various doctors and nurses, I think we are fairly clear in Ireland that medication is used appropriately.  We have a fairly professional and good workforce.</p><p>I can understand it in an emergency, but generally that does not seem to be a major issue.</p><p> Some of the medications have side effects, particularly weight gain.  We met Tusla recently to discuss the potential of a memorandum of understanding.  We just put one in place with the HSE, which is a risk-based protocol.</p></speech>

It can take six months to fill a post.  From working with the services experiencing overcrowding, one in the south east that has received a derogation from that because of the pressure from our organisation over overcrowding.  This particular service in the south east has 50 vacancies.  It has been permitted to recruit directly to fill those posts.  It filled some consultant posts in recent weeks, which has helped.  It will also get some additional nursing posts.  For example, to help with the overcrowding, it had set up a service involving four nurses on the team to do preassessments.  They only work from Monday to Friday.  They were able to manage the overcrowding from Monday to Friday but then it peaked again at the weekend because they did not have the resources for that time.</p></speech>

There is a lengthy process to get sanction to fill a post.  Obviously, the funding comes with that and there has to be appropriate funding for it.  There are issues in attracting people to the services, particularly in attracting CAMHS consultants to more rural parts of the country.  Dr. Finnerty can elaborate on this.</p></speech>

The people appointed to posts in areas such as Donegal and Kerry are working in isolation.  For example, an occupational therapist would need to travel quite some distance to meet colleagues or to attend conferences and so on.  As Deputy O'Reilly said, people who work in those jobs want to develop themselves and so on, but they can be very isolated in some areas.  It becomes a vicious circle: the less staff the service has, the less likely it is to attract.  It can also be hard to retain the people who are there.  It is not quite as simple as having the posts and advertising; there are other factors.</p></speech>

We have many consultant psychiatrists helping us in the tribunals.  The leader is the consultant psychiatrist.  Where there is a vacant post, teams tend not to build up as quickly.  Those teams tend to build up where is a committed consultant.  If they move on to something else, during the period they are not there, there is a tendency for the team to not do as well.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their help.  Many families and communities in Kerry have been ravaged by mental health issues, resulting in suicide and the loss of family members, which has rocked families and communities to the core.  We are sick and tired of the Government talking up the financial improvement in the country.  If it has improved the country's finances, this has not been shown in the mental health services in Kerry.  We are at a very low ebb at present and there does not seem to be any accountability for what has happened.</p> <p>  A couple of years ago - I had not been long a Deputy - a 20 year old presented in a local hospital.  I will not name the hospital because I do not want to personalise healthcare workers who are doing their best in the conditions in which they have to work.  This young man was in a very bad state on a Friday.  He was being released and the family was so concerned, they came on the phone bawling crying to me.  They said they could not imagine how they were to take care of him for the weekend or who would be responsible for him because six years earlier, his father had committed suicide in the back yard.  They were very upset.  Luckily enough, I got to talk to a particular nurse in that hospital who was not dealing with mental health.  I ensured he was kept in there for the weekend and the following weekend.  That man is perfect to the world today.</p> <p>  Another whose grandmother contacted me was mot so lucky.  It was the same kind of story.  He went in there for the weekend feeling very down.  He was let out on that Friday and he is no longer with us.  That family are very upset because they feel he could have been saved.</p> <p>  Life is so important.  I had an uncle who said, "There's only the breadth of your nail between being dead and being alive."  In cases like this we are losing people.  We have lost so many through suicide.  There was a lot of talk about a Bill that went through recently to save lives on the road, but we must try to save lives in whatever area it is, and we are not doing it.  A few years ago, three boys committed suicide while in care, which should not happen.  It is shameful that happened and it was not so long ago.</p> <p>  I read a report Mental Health Commission report by Dr. Finnerty.  In respect of services in Kerry and Cork, it stated that while there are supposed to be seven dedicated rehabilitation and recovery teams in the team, there are just two poorly staffed teams in place to cover a population of 680,000 people in both counties.  The report stated that to deal with demand the HSE was using an out-of-area service, a model that has been strongly criticised internationally.</p> <p>  Dr. Finnerty also said that in the course of her research she spoke to several people with enduring mental health illness who were frustrated and angry and were stuck in a system that was not meeting their needs.  Because of the unmet need for rehabilitation, many people with enduring mental illness have repeated admissions to inpatient psychiatric units and are then discharged, only to be re-admitted when things breakdown again - the so-called revolving door of admissions.  The short-sightedness of not providing adequate mental health rehabilitation services, from both a human rights and a financial viewpoint, is quite astounding.</p><p>Dr. Finnerty said that in some cases patients were moved away from their homes and local treatment teams for up to two years.  The commission has asked the HSE for an action plan to address the concerns raised in the report.  Only two poorly-staffed rehabilitation teams are in place to serve a population of 689,750, though the A Vision for Change mental health strategy states that a minimum of seven is needed.  According to A Vision for Change, 70 nurses are required but only six are available.  Some 340 people in Kerry and Cork are living with mental illness in institutional care, which is considered a high proportion of the population.  Major capital spend is needed for one 24-hour-----</p></speech>

Major capital spending is needed for one 24-hour supervised residence in Kerry.  I appeal to this committee, the Minister for Health and the Department to provide this service in Kerry because it is not available when it should be.  There are no services at all on the weekends.  Staff also have relatively little training in areas that are recommended for people with severe enduring mental illnesses, such as cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis, cognitive remediation, family therapy and social skills training.  I thank Dr. Finnerty for raising and highlighting this issue.  I am glad of the opportunity to support her on it.  We must work together and do more because the Minister for Health clearly does not recognise the need for mental health services, which are required and deserved by the people of Kerry.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, poor services are not isolated to that area.  Donegal, for example, has no rehabilitation service at all.  However, the population of more than 600,000 has only two rehabilitation teams and many people are in some type of institutional care, whether hospital or community residences, from which they cannot move on.  As we said earlier, access to services is a postcode lottery.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the kind of universal treatment received by people with mental health issues.  They all seem to be given the same kind of antidepressant that slows down their movements, which is very upsetting for the parents of 16, 17, and 18 year olds.  They immediately recognise that this is the same treatment given to people in their late 30s or 40s, and are slow to take it up a second time when they see the effect it has on their children.  It impedes them from going forward when something raises its head again.  Would more one-to-one care deal with that differently, rather than giving people antidepressants at the weekend and sending them home, saying they will be all right?  We know what happens then.</p></speech>

When people are seriously mentally ill, psychotic or suicidal, sometimes they need medication for a period of time to get over that hump.  The other talking therapies, and support in the community and so on, should kick in at that stage, but that does not always happen because the services are understaffed.  People may stay on medication for longer than they should be.  Certain groups of people need to stay on medication to keep them well and functioning in the community.</p></speech>

That organisation does fantastic work and needs additional funding to expand because it is meeting a need that is not otherwise being met.  It allows self-referrals, which is important.  It stated that the number of children being prescribed psychiatric medication has increased by nearly 500% over the past decade and Professor Brendan Kelly said that the recruitment crisis in the HSE is a factor in that.  We learned from the Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care last year that the HSE spends approximately &euro;400 million a year on psychotropic drugs but only &euro;10 million on talk therapies.  The work of the witnesses highlights the lack of rehabilitation units, and I know from talking to families that one of their biggest issues is with children and adults being shown the door once they are patched up in a psychiatric unit.  There are no supports in place for family members on how to deal with a situation, or supports for the patients in terms of aftercare plans and rehabilitation.  Ultimately, they often end up spiralling downwards.  Between 65% and 75% of all admissions to inpatient mental health units are readmissions, which is anecdotally due to people not getting the right supports.  There is a debate about whether we rely too much on the biomedical model versus a biopsychosocial model.  What are the thoughts of the witnesses on that?  Medication has an important role and doctors only prescribe it when needed but it is often needed because doctors have few alternatives to offer people in a very desperate situation.</p></speech>

While it also developed a relevant number of community services, the big challenge is to transform those, or else we would be having this conversation every year.  We need community services that are not just led by doctors and nurses, because no matter what medication people are on, they will still want to talk to someone.  They need education to comply with their medication and understand what it is about.  The key for us is applying a policy that allows us to get to Ireland.  Ireland has a good opportunity in this area because we are so small compared to other countries, and, therefore, we have the capability to set up these services.  There has been a policy drift and its application has not occurred for various reasons.  We have gone through a major recession and have heard many other reasons, but the policy must be applied in the Department by the HSE and it must be held to account.  I assure the committee that wherever we are given the relevant regulations, we will regulate and create transparency.</p></speech>

There is only one CAMHS emergency bed in the country, and that is in Galway.</p><p>None of the other units will take somebody as an emergency.  What is happening is that when the person is in the emergency department everybody is ringing around trying to find a bed and if the risk is great the person ends up being admitted to adult units.  The lack of emergency beds in CAMHS is quite stark.</p></speech>

He also suffers with autism so he spent most of the time with a blanket over his head because the bright lights, distress and the movement around him were very stressful for him.  Not only was that an outrageous situation, but it is also striking than when a consultant child psychiatrist could be located the psychiatrist had to contact every child inpatient unit to try to find a bed, fill in forms and applications and give reasons.  That is an outrageous waste of the time of a consultant child psychiatrist at a weekend.  Surely there should be a bed manager or a single point of application.</p></speech>

The group looks at who is waiting for an inpatient CAMHS bed and tries to match a CAMHS bed with the patient.  Usually that is quite successful.  The emergency is the problem, that is, the Friday or Saturday night when a young person is in distress and arrives at an emergency department and there is nowhere for the person to go.</p></speech>

When considering the future, there is no reason that those facilities could not be open 24 hours a day.  People are coming back to the same point, which is what parents, children and people are looking for.  In fact, when we did our road shows in Galway a group of service users told us about setting up a cafe.  They are looking for a safe place and the GP is looking for a safe place.  We are so caught in the shadows of institutions that we do not seem to have the creativity or the policy oversight to say we are going in a particular direction.</p></speech>

I am aware from talking to some managers that a lack of integration is probably to put it too loftily as very often they do not even talk to each other.  How do we address that?  What is the impact of the complete lack of integration between the different aspects of the HSE or have the witnesses dealt with that?</p></speech>

The centre of our attention should be the patient or the child and mapping the services they receive.  The Deputy mentioned Tusla, for example.  There are some very good people working there.  One can look at the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and the educational services in the Department of Education and Skills.  It is the idea of co-ordination.  In Ireland, we always seem to think in a particular way, even in our strategic thinking.  In other countries there is a trust for mental health that is as big as our mental health services.  It is led that way, and then integrates.  The idea of inter-sectoral and cross-sectoral approaches has always been a challenge in Ireland, but it is something that must be thought about and worked through.</p></speech>

We looked at physical care for people with mental illness who were in hospital and we found there was a lack of integration.  People with mental illness were falling between the stools of acute hospital care, where they were unable to access services such as physiotherapy or speech and language therapy, and they were not part of the community so they were not able to access it there.  They were not getting access to these services.  Anecdotally, a number of acute units in acute hospitals found it quite difficult to integrate with the overall hospital so it is difficult to get physicians and surgeons to come and see patients in the ward.  The patients must go to an outpatient appointment even though they are in the same hospital building.  It is improving, but there is that them-and-us attitude.</p></speech>

Providing accommodation to patients in the mental health services was transferred a couple of years ago from the HSE to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  In fact, when I was told that, I contacted one of the county councils and it was news to the housing section in that county council.  People there had never received any information about it, and I do not believe they have since.  Something I deal with almost weekly is the situation when a person is being discharged from an inpatient unit.  He or she has been patched up and shown the front door.  Often the person has other issues as well.  The person may or may not have an addiction.  The council will say that it cannot put the person into the usual emergency accommodation, which is often bed and breakfast accommodation and is not suitable.  However, it has no other suitable accommodation.  The person either ends up homeless and spirals back downwards or ends up in emergency accommodation, basically a room over a pub or the like which will not help the person either.  Is there a plan for providing suitable accommodation for people with mental illness?  There does not appear to be.</p></speech>

The services work closely with voluntary agencies such as HAIL Housing, Respond Housing Association and the like to provide accommodation.  One of the big difficulties is that there is a very large number of what we call 24-hour supervised community residences.  There are at least 113 of them housing approximately 1,300 people.  A number of those people do not have to be there.  I refer to rehabilitation again because if the rehabilitation teams were in place they could move out to more independent living.  This would free up facilities that are owned by the HSE, in most cases, for development in homelessness services, rehabilitation services and so forth.  That issue must be addressed.  Since we are discussing workforce planning, there is a large number of nurses in those supervised residences who could be employed in the community offering services to people with either acute or enduring mental illnesses.  It takes 12 whole-time equivalents to staff one of those community residences and we have 113.  A significant number do not need to be there.  That would free up housing for more acute crisis houses and so forth.  It must be examined in the context of what the HSE is currently providing as well as looking to the housing authorities.</p></speech>

If one walks out the door it becomes almost impossible but if one refuses to leave, the department will find some way to resolve the housing situation.</p></speech>

The biggest change in psychiatric services over the past 30 or 40 years has been the closure of our institutions.  That was a dramatic change.  Has there been a satisfactory progressive development of replacement services?</p><p>Are they improving year on year and is there a momentum developing to deliver the community services that are absolutely necessary to replace those institutions?  My memory of 30 to 40 years ago is of a psychiatric nurse being a person who turned up in a white coat to bring somebody for admission.  That is now a thing of the past and we have wonderful community psychiatric services.  Is there a progressive realisation of the development of those services?</p></speech>

People who work in mental health tend to be compassionate people who want to make a difference.  If one looks across the country services are basically <i>ad hoc</i>, scattered and slow.  There is a tendency for people to concentrate on inpatient services where regulation does not help.  The concentration should, however, be on the community.  There are improvements but one could not say that they are necessarily directed from the centre in an organised way.</p></speech>

They generally have not only mental health but addiction issues.  There seems to be a separation of services where if one has an addiction one receives addiction services, but if one has a psychiatric problem, one is dealt with by the psychiatric services.  There is quite a siloed disconnection between those two services.  How can that be bridged?</p></speech>

They would deal with people who had a dual diagnosis.  I am only aware of one addiction counselling service in the midlands.  It tends to be farmed out to other services and there may not be the greatest connection between them.  Instead of being seen as a whole person, people are being hived-off to different services for what should be a person-centred, holistic care.  I do not believe there is any move to provide addiction services within mental health teams.</p></speech>

The commission is looking at this at the moment.  I am working actively with the HSE to identify the types of services referred to by Dr. Finnerty.  A great number of services are bought in by the HSE.  Our exercise with the HSE at the moment, which we have also discussed with the mental health unit in the Department of Health, concerns what type of service is being provided within those services.   Our role of statutory oversight of those services operates with a view to bringing those services under the umbrella of mental health services and appropriate regulation.  We are looking at this piece of work at the moment.</p></speech>

Where do the best services apply?  How do they do this comparison?  How do we compare?  What are their staffing levels like?  Presumably, our eyewitnesses attend professional conferences at European and international level.  Are their services as good or are they way off the mark?</p> <p>  What are the levels of suicide in various other European countries?  From the information that our witnesses have been able to glean, how do we compare?  I have an idea of what the answer to that is but I am looking for confirmation of that.

We recently conducted an external review of our regulatory framework and it was found to be quite robust.  We compared seven jurisdictions, four within Europe, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.  We were unique in being the only jurisdiction that has a stand-alone mental health regulatory framework.  We were ahead of other jurisdictions and are the only jurisdiction that has specific rules on restrictive practices such as seclusion and restraint.  The Act and these regulations only apply to such inpatient settings and facilities and do not have application for the wider sector.  From an assurance perspective, as a regulator, our standards are robust in how we regulate and we have that affirmation from our external review.</p> <p>  On how we keep ourselves up to date, we are a member of a group of international regulators, which most European countries are a part of.  We meet annually to discuss various topics.  The restrictive practices topic is one that comes to mind and it is very strong in that agenda, together with inclusion of service users.  That is something that this group have again looked to Ireland for assistance and help on as we have been seen to be the leader in including service users in our planning, in preparing our documentation against which we regulate.</p> <p>  On staffing levels, we look to other jurisdictions.  Workforce planning came up in the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, as well, in that is there is no benchmark on what should be the appropriate staffing levels within mental health services.  The UK, in its National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, guidelines, provides some guidance on acute units and what the staffing should be there.  We defer to those guidelines and have our standards at what we think should be the appropriate number of people on these units.</p> <p>  On the levels of suicide, that is something we cannot really comment upon, because sudden and unexplained deaths are reported to us but the determination is not made by us as to whether it is suicide.  That falls to the coroner.  We are, however, working with the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  Dr. Dodd has recently taken up post as the clinical lead there.  We have met with him and are looking to do some joint work on international standards and the reporting of suicides, because there are many areas that could be developed in a better way here and learnings to be taken.  This is something that we intend to pursue with the National Office for Suicide Prevention.</p></speech>

Is it not necessary on an ongoing basis to keep in touch with the standards and the quality of services available elsewhere in order that we do not slip too far one way or the other, but more particularly, in order to be able to address the areas of particular deficiency and thereby provide a better quality of service?  How often would such references be made by the Mental Health Commission and would such interaction happen to enable such an exchange of views with those in other jurisdictions?  I believe the figures on the levels of suicide are available right across the European Union.  Can the commission give the committee any indication on the extent to which it can focus on that issue, with a view to identifying the worst case scenario, improving it insofar as we are concerned here, and providing an improved quality of service?</p></speech>

Everything we do beyond this eats into a resource for which we are not necessarily funded.  I assure the Deputy we read everything that comes out, for example, the latest report in the UK on overcrowding and overcapacity of inpatient beds, and map them across.  With regard to suicide prevention statistics, an office has been put in place by the State to concentrate on this.  Unfortunately, from our perspective we must concentrate our resources on protecting the approximately 2,000 people detained against their will.  We concentrate on the 1%.  We would love to have the statutory remit to expand and look at the 10% and get the appropriate funding to do this from the State.</p></speech>

It has difficulties with the recruitment of staff and building up teams.  It also has difficulty in providing inpatient beds.  At present, its main worry in all areas of mental health is the provision of out of area services, which also happens here.  Somebody in Donegal would probably be provided a bed in Galway but it could be anywhere else.  The child and adolescent mental health beds for people in Limerick are in Galway.  It is a problem.  It is probably not as vast as it is in the UK but it is a difficulty.</p></speech>

I am a GP and if I see a teenager who may be depressed or have an anxiety disorder, and I am sure the Chairman will agree with me, I send the patient off and refer him or her in good faith.  Often the team reviewing the referral states it is inappropriate.  One professional doctor refers somebody who genuinely needs help and the referral is undermined.  Sometimes doctors are accused of not even having seen the patient and that they discussed the situation with the parents.  That is disgraceful.</p> <p>  I have said numerous times in the Seanad, and I have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, about it, that access for GPs to a 24 hour emergency phone line to the child and adolescent mental health service with regard to very vulnerable teenagers would be a solution-driven pragmatic approach.  It would not be abused.  I would probably use it only once a year if I had a case involving a suicidal teenager, instead of sending him or her to the emergency department or having to admit him or her to the adult mental health unit in Castlebar.  That unit does great work but it is a dreadful place, particularly for a young person.  Undermining referrals from GPs is not good because there is a breakdown of communications between the mental health and community teams.  A 24 hour emergency phone line would probably be beneficial and prevent admissions to the acute units.</p></speech>

What happens is that doctors refer people to the accident and emergency department and spend considerable time ringing around trying to find a bed.  The doctor usually fails and that teenager is admitted to the adult acute unit.  Added to this is the problem that community child and adolescent mental health teams are poorly staffed.  In my most recent report, I estimated they were staffed at approximately 60% of what is recommended in A Vision for Change.  I also made the point that some areas are better resourced than others.  I gave the example of Galway, which is particularly well-resourced in comparison with other places, such as the south east, which has only &euro;45 <i>per capita</i>-----</p></speech>

The GP would not refer the child to the mental health services unless he or she had a serious concern.  Often GPs receive a letter stating the referral was inappropriate and asking whether the doctor had seen the patient.  That is totally unacceptable.  It happens on a regular basis in Mayo.  It undermines the entire service being provided.  It also undermines the patient's relationship with the GP because the parent is often copied in on the letter.  They have had the courage to come in with the child to disclose whatever needs to be disclosed to the doctor.  They trust their GP, with whom they have a long-term relationship.  The doctor makes a referral in good faith and then a letter is received by the doctor, with the parent copied in, stating the referral was inappropriate.  I do not know about this.  People are falling through the cracks.  Mental illness that is not dealt with in children and teenagers does not go away, it just manifests later.  A review of the structures regarding referrals and accepting referrals needs to be undertaken.</p></speech>

It is not that anyone is second guessing the doctor's judgment; it is trying to navigate through the system in the most appropriate way.</p></speech>

I totally understand all of this.  I understand they are not second guessing clinical decisions.  I am only concerned about the patients and I am afraid people are falling through the cracks who should not be and they are not getting the appropriate services.  Sometimes the way the child and adolescent mental health service communicates to families can be seen as flippant to the concerned parents of a teenager who might be in trouble.</p><p>That perhaps requires a review.</p></speech>

We are quite informal in Ireland and there is no one monitoring or accounting for that.  People slipping through the cracks is something that we hear about continuously from professionals, families and everyone involved.  We are building primary care centres and it should not be the case that the only alternative to a general practitioner is an accident and emergency department in order to ensure someone is safe.  We must build our community services so there are hubs to which people can go 24 hours a day.</p></speech>

The SIPTU health division represents approximately 45,000 workers in the health service.  Our membership is based across the public health system, private healthcare and section 39 employers.  Our division is organised into several sectors which include support grades, nursing and midwifery, health and social care professionals, healthcare assistants and the National Ambulance Service.  Our division represents members in all areas of the health service, including acute mental health, intellectual disability and care of the older person.  In addition, SIPTU health division supports our members in all industrial relations aspects arising within the hospital groups and community health organisation areas.  Our network of organisation and support includes national representatives, local officials and shop stewards, activists and members.</p><p>We are proud to represent these members.<br/><br/>In consideration of our presentation today, we note the following definitions of workforce planning which have been published previously.  In 2017, the Department of Health said: &quot;Workforce Planning is a core process of Human Resource Management which is shaped by the organisational strategy and ensures the right number of people with the right skills, in the right place, at the right time to deliver short- and long-term organisational objectives&quot;.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has said:</p><blockquote>Without adequate skillsets where and when they are required, objectives cannot be achieved.  Workforce Planning aims to draw together all of the various factors &ndash; including staffing, skills, learning and development, financial resources, succession planning &ndash; to develop a cohesive plan for the medium term.</blockquote><p>In his 1996 book, Mr. Peter Reilly defined workforce planning as a &quot;process in which an organisation attempts to estimate the demand for labour and evaluate the size, nature and sources of supply which will be required to meet that demand.&quot;<br/><br/>To summarise our submission with regard to the funding model, while our members note the principles of an effective workforce planning system, most do not recognise it within their workplace.  The health service is overcome with consistent funding issues which are apparent from the end of one year to the end of the next.  The current model of funding for our health service does not work and must change.  If policies such as Sl&aacute;intecare are to have any chance of succeeding, the model of funding approved for the health service must provide for the needs of the service and ensure it achieves the right number of people with the right skills, in the right place, at the right time to deliver short, medium and long-term organisational objectives.<br/><br/>In our opinion, the current model of funding for our health service is destined to fail each year.  Concerning workforce planning, the current model requires line managers to prepare plans for the needs of the service in the following year.  When this is completed, it is subject to various levels of scrutiny before being submitted to senior HSE management.  While we do not have an issue with oversight and scrutiny, which we accept is required, our concern remains that, following the multi-layer overview by senior HSE management and officials of the Department of Health and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the final approved funding plan generally looks nothing like the original one submitted at department level.  This results in a continuing battle playing out in each department where line managers are left struggling to provide for the ever-expanding needs of service.<br/><br/>In order to achieve the full aims of Sl&aacute;intecare, support for staff to develop and expand their roles is essential.  There is distinct evidence that SIPTU members embrace the development of their roles when supported through resources and funding.  The examples of the development of the roles of paramedic and advanced paramedic from the previous title of ambulance driver in the national ambulance service and the development of the role of health care assistant are demonstrative of staff within the service embracing change and upskilling of their roles.  Equally, within the area of health and social care professionals, radiographers have expanded their role to include cannulisation and the administering of contrast in computed tomography, or CT, scans and to undertake duties formerly assigned to dosimetrists.  The committee will also be aware that nurses and midwives have expanded their roles to share duties previously assigned to medical staff to ensure the most appropriate staff member undertakes responsibility of a task at any given time or on any given day.  These are just a few examples of changes which have been undertaken to provide a better, more efficient service to the patient or service user.  We contend that these examples, of which there are more, demonstrate the willingness of staff to embrace greater responsibility, a pushing of boundaries and a new model for the provision of healthcare in Ireland.  Unfortunately, our members argue a significant percentage of this responsibility is left on their shoulders only.<br/><br/>SIPTU members also contend that the focus of the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to health management is almost entirely on cost reduction from day one of each year.  This results in departments not receiving approval to recruit identified safe staffing levels and those in employment not having guaranteed access to funding for postgraduate courses which are undeniably essential to the service provided.  Our union argues there is something materially wrong in our model of healthcare when, for example, a department requires radiographers to upskill and undertake a postgraduate course in ultrasound but the members of staff are asked if they can provide the funding themselves.<br/><br/>On the system for approving recruitment within the HSE, the system of approval for the filling of vacancies or for submitting business cases for staff in new and existing posts is designed to frustrate and does not do what is needed, which is to fill vacancies.  Line managers and staff within the system are left totally demoralised by the extensive effort and repeated procedures required to fill vacancies for essential posts.  Even where replacement of a post is approved, it is common for recruitment to take well over a year to complete.  During this time, staff are left carrying the demands of the service, all too often with insufficient staffing levels.  This does not just affect the replacement of vacancies as it is the same procedure which also undermines the replacement of those on maternity leave and so on.  In such circumstances, it is commonplace for the HSE to confirm a replacement for the person on maternity leave literally weeks before the staff member is due to return to the workplace.  As a result, managers and staff have informed SIPTU that they use the system for the replacement of posts without any expectation that their application will be approved or, if it is approved, of when such approval will be received.  The system of recruitment within the HSE is designed purposely to cause this frustration and is extremely damaging to our health service.<br/><br/>The current system of approval requires business cases to be submitted at multiple levels of the organisation.  This results in a situation where staff, department level management and hospital and group management can all agree on the need for replacement staff in a given a post but national central management, which is not connected in any direct way, must provide final approval or no one will be recruited for the position.  This is very narrow-minded and counterproductive for the HSE as it results in the loss of eligible qualified candidates for employment to the private sector and overseas opportunities.  Evidence of the level of recruitment for our key grades over the past number of months and years is provided in the text of this presentation.<br/><br/>SIPTU contends that the recruitment procedure in the HSE must be overhauled immediately.  National officials within the HSE and Department of Health reject the suggestion that there are instructions for a recruitment embargo, freeze or moratorium.  While it would appear they are seeking to steer away from the stigma of these labels and their effects in the past, they are very much present in all their former aspects, albeit under the disguise of business cases and multi-layer approval bureaucracy.<br/><br/>In the context of the challenges of gaining approval for the filling of an accepted vacancy, money is spent on other expensive forms of employment, such as hiring agency staff, as an alternative.  We trust the committee will be aware that the most recent estimate of the costs associated with agency expenditure in the health service for 2019 is in excess of &euro;200 million.  This includes a figure of over &euro;60 million on healthcare assistants and &euro;50 million on nurses and midwives.  The data also suggest our health service has purchased in excess of 500,000 working hours this year to date through expensive agency arrangements rather than direct employment.  SIPTU contends that the system of refusing approval for recruitment while utilising hundreds of millions of euro on expensive external employment options must be revised.<br/><br/>The reality is that many agency workers are employed in the same hospital or ward for years rather than the HSE deciding to recruit.  Agency work may have a place in our health service for short-term, immediate or unexpected replacements.  It cannot, however, be used as a replacement for direct employment for the filling of vital front-line health worker posts.<br/><br/>We need the right person in the right place at the right time.  In this submission, we have highlighted some of the central principles required to successfully incorporate a concept of workforce planning within the health service.  The modern-day health service utilises a multigrade, team-based approach.  SIPTU believes the maintenance and development of this model will serve to benefit staff and patients alike.  We are acutely conscious of the cauldron which is faced every day by staff providing services and, indeed, by those seeking to gain access to services from the outside.</p><p>SIPTU believes it is crucially important for all stakeholders to work to change the experience for staff and service users.  We believe that a successful workforce planning model will be of assistance in supporting the change that is required to achieve this.  There is no doubt that staff want to provide services in an environment that respects the dignity of all.  SIPTU contends that the "right person, right place, right time" principle supports such an environment and presents an opportunity for staff to upskill or focus on duties and responsibilities which are in accordance with their qualification standards and their professional registration.</p><p> We note the recent framework for a safe skill mix between nursing, general staffing, specialist medical and surgical care settings in adult hospitals, as launched by the Minister in 2018.  We contend that an examination of the appropriate skill mix and the safe staffing levels is crucial when services are being provided to patients and service users.  It is noted that some grades are suffering from the effects of chronic understaffing and the restrictive labour market.  This is due to pressures from the private sector and foreign employment opportunities.  We believe there is merit in examining the possibility of seeking agreement on new methods of service provision.  We think it would be appropriate for all stakeholders to be involved in this.  There is a need to ensure the skills, duties and responsibilities of graduate-qualified staff who are at the pinnacle of their qualification or registration are maximised to provide support as part of a team-based skill mix approach.  SIPTU believes such a model is challenging on several fronts, but will result in a changed environment for those who are providing services and for those who stand to benefit from it.</p><p> A significant focus on the development model of healthcare is recommended within the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  In that context, it is appropriate for our submission to be accompanied by a brief comment.  SIPTU is actively aware of the challenges that are being experienced in communities where people are facing the realities of a two-tier health system as they seek to access services.  When citizens face having to access healthcare, their last concern should relate to how much money they will need to afford private treatment.  This model breeds inequality and forces an additional burden on the public system through longer waiting lists.  Equally, we note that barriers to care in our community are being experienced in areas where they have never before been experienced.  This can be attributed to the insufficient number of medical doctors in general practice in many towns and cities.  Existing GPs are unable to cope with the level of demand.</p><p> While there will be many challenges in implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare report, we support the principles underpinning it.  As a union, we are seeking to bring an end to the bottleneck in accident and emergency departments.  The never-ending and ever-expanding waiting lists must be dealt with.  Community services must be developed.  There is an urgent need for additional bed capacity.  If the prescribed future for healthcare in our country is to succeed, lessons must be learned from the existing failed model of service delivery.  Staff must be given opportunities to develop and upskill.  The concept of multi-grade team-based working, which ensures that when duties are being allocated, they are assigned to the most appropriate person at the right time and in the right place, must be further enshrined.  We must support our staff through career opportunities and education supports.  This will ensure the public health service is the first choice for health workers in this country.</p><p> SIPTU would like to convey its deep concern regarding the slow pace of progress in securing the necessary funding to support the advancement of Sl&aacute;intecare.  In our opinion, a token level of funding is being afforded to this project as part of an effort to convey the optic that implementation is proceeding.  We note that &euro;20 million a year has been earmarked for the HSE and for Government Departments to date.  This is insufficient to tackle the current challenges in funding the necessary actions to bring about real change.  As I make this point, I note that funding of approximately &euro;680 million per annum has been identified for Sl&aacute;intecare.</p><p> We thank the committee for its time.  Our submission includes a brief outline of the key sectors of our union within the public health service in reference to workforce planning.  Before I conclude, I would like to mention an aspect of this issue that is not normally discussed.  I refer to the arrangements put in place by some agencies when the health service identifies permanent posts.  If a person who is registered with an agency goes to take such a post, the HSE must pay a fee that is demanded by the agency.  We discovered recently how expensive this can be.  In some cases, it is as if the employee is bonded to the agency in some way.  This must be investigated by the HSE and perhaps by this committee.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Bell for his comprehensive submission.  Before I bring in members of the committee, I wish to ask a few questions.  I ask Mr. Bell to give us some insight.  We know that workforce planning is tricky in the short term.  It is probably even tricker in the long term.  I will mention two issues to illustrate that.  In the long term, we have Sl&aacute;intecare, and in the short term we have the winter initiative, winter plan or whatever word they are using to describe it this year.  I ask Mr. Bell to give a brief indication of the involvement of the union in both cases.  I do not need to remind him of the number of workers represented here this morning.  Will Mr. Bell provide an indication of the level of involvement, consultation and engagement that SIPTU has had with regard to winter planning in the short term, and in the longer term with regard to Sl&aacute;intecare?</p></speech>

Basically, we had a number of communications from the HSE advising us of what the plan was going to be.  There was some local consultation but in some cases, we realised that the consultation was of limited quality.</p></speech>

We have made presentations on that matter at this forum.  There has been zero engagement since that time.</p></speech>

We discussed the moratorium with representatives of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation when they were here last week.  I suppose there is a bit of a misnomer with that.  People think the moratorium is a new thing that was imposed recently.  Does Mr. Bell estimate that a full recovery was made from the moratorium that was imposed in 2007?  Did the health service get back to full staffing levels before the new moratorium kicked in?  I have no hesitation in saying, as I did at the time, that the impact of the 2007 moratorium is still being felt across the health service today.  Does Mr. Bell share that view?</p></speech>

We do not believe we have recovered from previous staff moratoriums.  I will defer to my colleagues here who have more direct experience in this area.  In the past, the HSE would have said that it needed to enforce a recruitment embargo or moratorium - it does not matter which language we use to describe it - but that is no longer the practice.  In many cases, people have applied for posts on foot of competitions that were advertised and have been deemed to be successful, only to be advised subsequently that there is no starting date for them.  Such cases can drag on for a number of months or a year.  In some cases, the successful candidate has moved elsewhere by the time the post comes to be filled.  In such circumstances, a very skilled person will have been lost.</p></speech>

It is estimated that up to 500,000 working hours are being worked by such staff.  Will Mr. Bell give us an indication of the level of increase in recent years?  More crucially, is he aware of a value for money audit of the purchase of such labour, as opposed to directly employed labour, being conducted by the HSE?</p></speech>

We are raising this issue at the forums we share with other unions, including the national joint council and the health service oversight body, which deals with the public service stability agreement.  We believe the current level of spending is out of control.  No attempt is being made to erect any barriers to it.  There is no recognition of the fact that some of the policies being implemented, such as the embargo or pause on recruitment, are feeding directly into this.</p><p>There is no recognition that some of the policies being implemented, such as the embargo on recruitment, or the recruitment pause, are directly feeding into this.  We see that other parts of the health service suffer even greater consequences.  In community care, for instance, the hours for our most vulnerable citizens who require homecare were cut back.  It seems to be easy enough to say there are no further hours available and expenditure will not be increased.  This is kicking in right across the service.  In some of the areas, most of the damage being done in the delivery of the health service is invisible to the eye unless someone is demanding a service for the care of the elderly or a service related to an intellectual disability or mental health issue.</p></speech>

In the event that we made the requisite investment, would we get them back?</p></speech>

The recruitment process of private sector employers is very direct and aggressive.  They know the market exists.  There are various incentives to attract staff.  The recruitment process itself is very fast and focused.  We want public health service employment to be seen as the employment of choice.  Various strategies would have to be agreed to attract the staff back.  There are very good reasons people would like to work in the public health service, and there are various opportunities within the public health service.</p> <p>  Competing with those who attract staff abroad is a bit more complicated because sometimes various professionals and health workers see that the development of their career and skill set can be achieved abroad.  However, the problem that arises is partly related to the fact that there may be precarious work.  In other words, staff may end up doing agency work or may not be able to get a full-time contract.  That is not just in one particular sector of the health service; it is spread right across.</p></speech>

They have gone through the issues grade by grade and outlined the current position and the various effects of Government policy or the lack of progress.  I thank them for that.</p> <p>  After my questions, I will have to leave, unfortunately.  Normally, I stay for the whole meeting but Fianna F&aacute;il is introducing a motion in a few hours in the D&aacute;il on emergency department care.  I have to do some work on that so I apologise for my having to leave after my questions.</p> <p>  On emergency department care, the witnesses have covered many areas.  One of the main pressure points in the health system is the collapse in decent waiting times for patients going through emergency departments.  We have seen figures that have never been seen in this country before - figures that are really not seen in any other European country that I can think of.  One issue is that we do not have safe staffing levels in our emergency departments.  Another is that we are not taking care of our own staff, be they consultants, nurses, radiographers or any of the other wonderful people the witnesses represent.</p> <p>  Specifically on emergency care, how are SIPTU's members feeling?  Are there issues that are particularly egregious?  If the witnesses were in charge, what would be the first steps they would take to try to make things better?</p></speech>

I am responsible for nursing and midwifery staff but also the health and social care profession, including radiographers and radiation therapists.  A number of these would have a role within this.</p> <p>  We described the emergency departments as the bottleneck of the health service.  There is a bottleneck because there is so much on one side and such a little gap on the other.  Filtering is also an issue.  Clearly, the staff working in this area are working under major pressure.  They are doing so all the time.  Part of the difficulty is with getting the necessary resources and services to assist.  It is really about being able to look after patients to "get them moved on" within the system, such that they are either being admitted or discharged.  We all hear about the long delays faced by patients in being seen and in waiting for a bed.  Many of these factors feed into one another.  </p> <p>  We mentioned the difficulty in regard to general practitioner access.  In this regard, we have mentioned the difficulty concerning diagnostics.  Many people talk about accessing diagnostics.  They do not talk about anything else in this regard other than the need to access diagnostics, as if it were just a matter of a button that just has not been pressed and as if it were easy to do so.  The reality is that the services are under major pressure.  We have given examples in our paper showing that the reality is that most diagnostics departments have not had a review of their staffing levels, possibly for decades.  When people talk about the fact that the departments are fully staffed, they should note that they were possibly fully staffed when they were last examined, in the 1990s, but that does not mean they are fully staffed now.  In addition, staff are trying to use equipment that is well beyond its sell-by date.  Moreover, funding cannot be obtained for staffing.  I recently dealt with a case in which people wanted to know why certain equipment was not being used.  The equipment was funded but there was no funding for somebody to use it.</p> <p>  The difficulty faced by the nurses, doctors and support staff working in an emergency department is that they need to be able to work with and integrate with the other grades of staff in order to make the decisions ultimately necessary to determine the pathway for the patient.  The problem in the emergency departments is that these difficulties extend well beyond their corridors, although it is clear that safe staffing is an issue.  It is a national disgrace considering the pictures of people sitting on chairs and the like.</p></speech>

I am one of those who keep saying we need to open the diagnostics suites for longer.  One of the points I make is that in many of our hospitals, an MRI machine might be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  I had arguments with hospital managers over an elderly man who was strapped to a backboard and in urgent need of an MRI.  The conversation was to the effect that since they believed he could not be admitted before 5 p.m. and that it was Friday, he should be kept strapped to the board until Monday morning, when an effort was to be made to admit him.  In this case, the diagnostics suite stayed open.  One of the points made to me as somebody who argues diagnostics suites need to be open for longer is that, in Australia, the patient receives a letter saying he will get his MRI at 2 a.m. on Saturday night.  It is said to me that the unions would never allow that here.  I am told such a system is all well and good and that I am awfully naive because the unions would stop me dead in my tracks.  I do not believe that.  The witnesses represent the unions.  What is their response to people who say that?</p></speech>

Since she is a radiographer by profession, she will be able to deal with the question to some degree.</p> <p>  Specifically on the unions, in 2012 we actually agreed the extension of the working day for radiographers according to an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. model.  It was agreed that it would be brought in from Monday to Friday in the first instance.  Basically, the day was extended by one third.  Does the Deputy know how many staff were deployed in order to achieve that?  Zero.  What happened was that medical staff, or clinical staff, were arriving in the diagnostics department asking why a particular room that was open the day before was not open.  The response was that the staff who were in the department the preceding day between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. would be in at 12 noon because they were now working from noon until 8 p.m.</p><p>People will talk about these great ideas but great ideas need funding and that is why we are discussing this issue.  There is not an education fund for radiographers.  We have examples of radiographers throughout the country who, through credit union loans, have funded their own postgraduate education.</p></speech>

There was an increase of 90% in the number of CT scans and a 12% increase in the number of CT scanners.  We have 19 CT scanners per 1 million population.  That includes the private sector.  The equivalent figures for Korea, Iceland, Denmark and Spain are 38, 44, 40 and 18, respectively.  The figure for Spain does not include private centres.  As a person who has to deal daily with people seeking access to diagnostics, I would happily do anything I can.  However, as Deputy O'Reilly noted, whatever staff one had on the floor on 31 December 2007 was taken as the new whole-time equivalent.  If the unit had five more staff earlier in the year than on that day, its whole-time equivalent was reduced by five.  That has not been restored.  Every year, on 31 December, that is the new norm.  The unit loses its position numbers and can have fewer staff this year than it had in the current or previous years.  The volume of diagnostics increases by 10% by putting more and more pressure on the system and the scanners.  The majority of CT scanners in use here were installed in 2009.  Their sell-by date was 2017 and we have no hope of replacing them.</p></speech>

As stated in the submission, we may be given a name a few weeks before the person is due back from maternity leave.  This means we will have bolstered and covered that work and moved people around.  The Deputy asked how staff feel.  Staff in every grade dealing with emergency care are overwhelmed.  We do not have enough resources in terms of equipment, people or  time.  We see the patients coming in.  We deal with those sick patients and do our best to provide diagnostics.  The Deputy will note the increase in the volume.  We are overwhelmed because we are not being supported with the provision of equipment or people at any level.</p></speech>

We have issues in community care where patients are going to hospital who should be cared for in the community.</p> <p>  On the ambulance service, members may not know that when an ambulance is dispatched to a location the ambulance crew must take that patient to an emergency department.  We have highly skilled advanced paramedics and emergency medical technicians.  By "highly skilled", I mean they can issue up to 44 different types of medication at the scene but they have no power to discharge.  The ambulance crew must bring the patient to the accident and emergency department unless that patient discharges himself or herself.  That issue has been overcome in the Scottish ambulance service which has two distinct services.  One is a hear-and-treat service where the people in the control room involved in planning services for the ambulance dispatch can determine if the patient needs to go to his or her GP or pharmacy and does not require the use of an emergency vehicle.  The other scenario is where an ambulance crew arrives in a community or an incident has occurred.  Much of the care of the elderly could be considered from the perspective of how ambulance personnel treat those people.  They cannot recommend anything other than taking the person to hospital unless that person decides not to travel and in such cases, he or she must sign off on that.  My colleague, Ms Marie Butler, will explain how some people in the community care area are ending up in emergency departments unnecessarily.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-20a.297" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019112000002#V01900"><p>Deputy Donnelly's original question was what would we do immediately.  I would immediately recommend that healthcare assistants be utilised in the emergency departments.  Many patients come into hospital and they may only need to be looked after.  They may need to be brought to the toilet and their personal needs taken care of.  Often they are left sitting on a chair because there is nobody to do that work.  While those engaged in diagnostics, clinical work and assessments are under great pressure, much could be done to enhance the patient's experience at that level.  That is an under-utilised resource.  Healthcare assistants are qualified support grades.  They do not get enough recognition for the work they do or could do to alleviate the patients' suffering at that early stage of their journey.  Many elderly people end up in accident and emergency departments for no medical reason when they could be taken care of in their own home but, again, there are no resources available.</p> <p>  There are many reports on the gaps in professional services.  However, I do not believe we would find a report that would set out the work health support grades do in the community.  The nearest we have is the healthcare assistant report which is an independent review of healthcare assistants and the types of work they provide.  If we wanted to find what support grades do externally in community care, we would not find an independent report that deals with that.  That is a gap.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report refers to moving into the community but healthcare assistants and healthcare support assistants, which were previously known as home helps, are only mentioned twice.  That indicates that there is a great deal of emphasis on diagnostics, clinical work and assessments, and rightly so, but there is a major resource that is not being tapped into.  I believe the reason is that people do not know what these support staff do.  In the absence of independent reports, it is difficult to know what they do.</p></speech>

We must look at that.  For example, in several hospitals, the number of men, women and children on trolleys waiting for a bed is broadly equal to the number of delayed discharges in the same hospitals.</p></speech>

Community healthcare assistants are under-utilised.  There are community healthcare assistants in mental health services and intellectual disability services.  They are all over the place but nobody knows what they do.  We should consider that in tandem with other issues such as diagnostics and assessments, given that, naturally, people want to get well.  The patient experience could be greatly enhanced if the support grade was given a bit more recognition.  We strongly recommend that the recently published healthcare assistant report be given full support by the Department of Health and the HSE-----</p></speech>

Staff have hidden pregnancies for fear of not getting promotions or of something happening to them, while junior doctors have had their training records falsified by hospitals because they work hours well in excess of European directives and are supposed to receive training.  There have been burn outs in all the grades that SIPTU represents.  "Overwhelmed" is the word Ms Monahan used and that I will use later, and that we have heard more and more frequently.  Healthcare is busy.  It has always been, and will always be, a busy, high-pressure environment - such is its nature - but it cannot be overwhelming for staff or patients.  SIPTU represents workers throughout the country in many organisations, some with healthy HR practices and others with unhealthy HR practices.  In respect of how it treats its staff and of its HR practices, how does the HSE compare with good and bad employers in Ireland, about which SIPTU has an awful lot of knowledge?</p></speech>

In voluntary section 38 hospitals, the management is close to the staff.  It is not a large geographic spread.  I refer to hospitals such as St. Vincent's University Hospital, with which the Deputy will be familiar.  Sometimes issues can be resolved more quickly or staff matters can be attended to on the basis that it is closer to the staff member.  While we do not want to generalise because it would be unfair, given that we view the HSE as a national organisation, it should deal with issues concerning staff consistently across the board, whether it is a grievance, a policy on dignity and respect at work or whatever it is.</p> <p>  Sometimes, however, we have found that our union gets into difficult positions where some HR managers decide there will be a regional variation of a national policy.  That makes us engage on issues where we have agreed the policy at national level, how the staff members should be cared for and the employer's rights, but in cases of grievance resolution, for example, one may find that one set of hospitals in the north east will comply with policy set down nationally by the HSE corporate employee system, whereas in Cork it may not be interpreted that way.  We then have to jump through hoops to try to have the matter resolved.  That leads to bad industrial relations and tensions in the system, which does not need more tensions.  It leads to difficulties.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, there are people in professions who would say they have been left behind, as can be seen in the movement of people into the private sector or abroad.  Nationally, it is a difficult organisation because of the pressure on it.  Most of the difficulties encountered are due to the sheer pressure people are under in their workplace.</p></speech>

To be fair to people within HR roles and so on, there has been a demonstrative change in their ability to negotiate, sit down and discuss problems.  The tools they are given to problem solve are minimal.  Aside from localised discussions that may take place, it is evident in the types of cases that go to conciliation within the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and so on.  This is no disrespect to people who work and provide a valuable service at the WRC, but it is clear that the managers attending hearings are not given the remit within which to solve the problem, while those who have the remit ensure they do not attend.</p></speech>

Some of the most sophisticated arrangements are in place in that employment, such as on the national joint council and others.  The problems are wide.  It is not in the gift of anyone within the HR department, with the best will in the world, to resolve such issues.</p></speech>

We have discussed how people are treated when working for the HSE or voluntary hospitals.  Following on from the point the Vice Chairman raised, there is a new player on the field.  When the HSE tried to resolve issues nationally with its employees, there was a continual intervention by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Some of the issues we now face, such as staff recruitment, the pressure of people getting posts, including promotional posts, and so on, it feeds back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which demands the final say because it is an expenditure issue.  We found ourselves in a national dispute this year, as members will recall, whereby we had an agreement to deal with people's pay and conditions through an independent process.  The obstruction was not the HSE <i>per se </i>or the Department of Health; rather, we found ourselves in a confrontation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  With respect, the people responsible for the health service are the Department of Health and the HSE.  We found ourselves to be in a continuously difficult position in that regard, and other groups have had a similar experience.</p></speech>

I have been around the health services for a long time and the system does not seem to change because the issues that have been raised were raised 20 years and they have not changed since then.  That is the case in particular with part-time staff, agency staff, short term, part time, whole time and the various descriptions of staff within the service that seem to impact negatively at all times on the delivery of the service.</p> <p>  In recent days, I also heard reference to the fact that Ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world.  I reminisced on the days of the Celtic tiger when we were high on the list of the wealthiest countries.  Of course, it is not true.  Our wealth is based on salaries and house property values, which are unsustainable and can fluctuate from day to day.  We know that because it happened previously.  The problem is that we are not recovering to the point from where we fell in 2007 as fast as we need to, but we are getting there as fast as we can.  That is the conundrum.</p> <p>  When the moratorium on recruitment was introduced, was any provision made to prioritise front-line services or was it just the case that recruitment generally would be opened up?  Could Mr. Bell indicate what happened?  It appears there was an over-abundance of administrative staff as opposed to front-line staff.  All staff are important because they all have a part to play in the delivery of services.  Was nothing done in the health service to prioritise front-line staff?  In a bakery, for example, the baker has to work.  Was anything done to ring-fence the need for front-line staff when recruitment opened up?</p></speech>

The health service has been subject to two massive shocks in a 40-year period due to recession followed by cuts in public expenditure.  In the meantime, the demand for the service continued to grow.  We are talking about the changing demographic in the country whereby there is a big requirement for care-of-the-elderly services.  There is a concentration on trying to put that type of service into the community, which is right, but it has to be funded.  We all talk about funding on the basis that healthcare, whether we like it, is labour intensive and every service is connected.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Donnelly's question on whether priority has been given to front-line services, he should remember that the HSE, and the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform, for their part, have never formally confirmed that there is a recruitment embargo or a moratorium.  That has never been said.</p></speech>

What we see is certain areas of funding being exhausted, for instance, in community care.  My colleague, Ms Marie Butler, referred to that.  We also see greater pressures on the ambulance service because it is involved in providing services, not necessarily at the beginning of the process.</p></speech>

I have always said, and will continue to say, that nobody is employed in the HSE, in any of the voluntary hospitals or in section 39 organisations that is not required.  The problem in some cases is that there are not enough of them or that they are not given the leadership they need to develop into providing the very best care they can provide.  In response to Deputy Durkan, I think we are going to continue to experience these pressures unless we get serious about what the political system, including Oireachtas Members, has agreed on the way forward, namely, Sl&aacute;intecare.  We have tried to look at all the challenges that are coming against us.</p> <p>  I refer to something that is in the background but is also adding to the stress on the health service in terms of expenditure, which is the continuing expenditure on the children's hospital.  That is taking resources and we do not know where it will end.  I listened to a programme on RT&Eacute; radio recently where it was stated that nobody could confirm whether the hospital would cost &euro;2 billion or &euro;2.5 billion.  We are concerned about how we can develop the health service if that drag is on the budget.  There is also capital expenditure, which means we need to develop new hospitals and new facilities, including primary care centres.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-20a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019112000002#X00900"><p>I understand what Mr. Bell is saying but to go back to the various drags on the system, they are different.  One is capital expenditure and there is a different means of funding that, as those of us who are involved in the health service know, which does not affect the current expenditure at all.  I accept that it affects overall borrowing but not current expenditure.  I have strong views on that issue.  I have long been a member of this committee and I was a member of the committee that devised Sl&aacute;intecare.  I have been on all sorts of committees in recent years.  I was around when an bord snip nua became involved.  I was very conscious of the recommendations of an bord snip nua, which dug much deeper than was applied eventually, unfortunately so.  The point is that we were forced to live within our means, and our means were very limited and they were on a downward trajectory at that particular time.</p> <p>  I do not expect Mr. Bell to have the answers to my questions but he does have a pivotal role in dealing with the issues at ground level and on the front line, whereby he may have a different assessment of what is required.  Regarding the cost of the children's hospital, I have looked everywhere and I have found no solid assessment of an estimate based on anything other than a guess.  The overrun, as it may well be considered in some quarters, is not an overrun.  It was a failure to assess accurately the costs in the first place, based on sound economic advice.  That is not my problem.  My problem is to try to do something in the aftermath or to make some contribution to it.</p> <p>  In terms of value for money, my belief has always been that the permanent filling of posts is better with less reliance on agencies, but it never seems to change.  Even when we had money during the Celtic tiger boom, there was no shift or change at all in that regard.  That ties in with what the witnesses said.  One could find oneself with fewer staff at the end of the year, depending on where one was when the chopper came down.  We accept all of that.  The next part is how we proceed from here.  Sl&aacute;intecare will be expensive and there is a lot of other attendant expenditure as well.  What I cannot understand is why it is not possible within the health service to identify precisely, within reason, the budgetary projections.  That has not happened for some years.  It has not happened for a long time, even though my colleagues might tell me that it is a recent phenomenon.  That is not true.  It has not happened.  I am concerned whether a means can be found whereby all those responsible, including the witnesses, the committee, or whoever is responsible, can identify the projected expenditure or if we need to opt for a flexi-budget that has a contingency built into it because it is a demand-led service and we can expect the demand to increase in one area or more or whatever the case may be and how and if we can provide for that.  We must keep in mind also that taxpayers must pay for all this and the extent to which they are able to shoulder the burden.</p><p>SIPTU is in a unique position to be able to identify the things that happen at ground level and the outcomes relating to which might be better determined if we took a different approach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-20a.322" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Bell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019112000002#Y00200"><p>Before I defer to my colleague, Mr. Figgis, I will answer one question.  Deputy Durkan talked about the budgetary provision or the Estimate.  Perhaps we should ask ourselves while we are in this forum, who makes the final call on the budget?  I think I know the answer to that.  When health service managers put forward their requirement, it is based on what they anticipate to be the patient and service user need.  The cost of those objectives are then presented, and this is about maintaining the normal service.  The HSE, when agreeing the Estimate, has a lot of interaction, I suggest, with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform about what will be spent.  One then finds that the actual estimate of what the HSE believes it requires to operate a full complement of public health services, whether we like it or not, is cut back.  In every single year in which I have operated in this service, which amounts to 21 years, I have witnessed a situation in which either the budget was not sufficient or we had supplementary budgets, even though we were told some time ago we could no longer have supplementary budgets for health.  The budget, or the Estimate, is therefore doomed to fail right from the start because it does not address the actual needs that will present or that are projected to present.  It should be remembered that this is not an exact science; as Deputy Durkan said, it is a demand-driven service.  We are not saying we should just see what falls out at the end of the year.  We understand that there must be a budget, that managers must manage their budgets and that our members who perform those services have a role to play.  If, however, we do not face up to what the actual budget requirements are and how they are arrived at, we will end up in the same position all the time.</p> <p>  When it comes to recruiting and retaining staff, we are wasting a lot of money.  I ask the committee to consider the agency costs that have arisen, which are one example, and the amount of money being spent on contracts.  I do not wish to be confrontational, but I take slight issue with the idea that the cost of the children's hospital does not impact the health service.  It does because we cannot invest in capital projects that are required in the health service.  We saw the recent concerns of the citizens of Waterford about their mortuary.  That is just one example.  We have other services in respect of which our members are fighting off private sector interests.  In the Mater Hospital here in Dublin, for example, a new sterilisation department is required for the preparation of surgical instruments.  The Department of Health says it has no money to replace the existing facility, that it would much prefer a private sector organisation to be brought in and that perhaps that the latter could build the facility and run the service.  Ultimately, however, with respect to everyone here, it is still the taxpayer who will pay for that, and that is before we stray into the other areas of diagnostics and what happened with CervicalCheck.</p></speech>

He asked whether there is a co-ordinated or integrated approach to the filling of vacancies, employment, etc.  The last time there was a co-ordinated and integrated approach was when the opposite was being done, that is, when there were incentivised schemes such as those relating to early retirement, voluntary redundancy, etc.  However, there was no correlation at all regarding the effects this would have on the service.  It was really just a case of getting as many out as possible.  It was the classic sledgehammer approach.  What we have not seen since then is a rebuilding of the health service.</p> <p>  We recently carried out, by joint agreement with the HSE, an independent review of the radiology department in University Hospital Kerry, which has had its own challenges.  I refer to this purely as an example.  We implemented a review and agreed terms of reference.  We also appointed independent people to come down, and it was to be chaired independently as well.  They prepared their report based on the existing safe staff guidelines published by the professional body.  That report stated that that department had 60% of the staffing it should have had.  The HSE and the hospital group in the summer of last year accepted that report and all its recommendations.  I met with them about ten days ago under the auspices of the WRC because it was impossible to get any progress made.  Their current plan is such that they have no approval to go any further and that the department will remain 30% down on recommended staffing levels.  They have no plan whatsoever to fill the vacancies they accept are there.  Everything is overheating because there is such a small staff complement.  In this example, 60% of staff every day of the week are trying to deal with what 100% of staff should be doing.  That is just one example among, I would imagine, most departments in most locations throughout the country.</p> <p>  The difficulty we have in the model of recruitment is, as we have said in our paper, that it is about frustrating matters.  There are not only so many layers that people must go through but also the layers even outside of the health service in that these things ultimately go to the Department of Health or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As we said, line managers are asked what they need to provide for the safe level of service in their departments and to meet the demands made of them.  They come up with those plans, they base them on safe staffing guidelines and, by the time they go through the rigmarole of the bureaucracy, they either get back something that looks nothing like what they asked for or just do not get back anything at all.  At a meeting I was at two weeks ago a person said to me, "I am at the stage now where I just keep submitting every two weeks.  I do not change anything; I just keep submitting the plan."  One wonders to whom such people are submitting their plans.  Clearly, they are just landing on someone's doorstep and they just do not open that post.</p></speech>

To what extent has overall staffing throughout the health services increased in the past year or two years, given that during an bord snip nua's regime it went down dramatically?  There have been many staff increases.  This goes back to my question as to which area the staff increases have gone to.  It is fine to say these are crucial posts.  All of them are.  If I was in one of the posts, I would say mine was a crucial post.  The question, though, is whether staffing levels have gone up by 2%, 3%, 10%.  To what extent have staffing levels gone up in general throughout the public health sector?  I know there have been increases.  Have they gone in the direction which is likely to affect most fundamentally the delivery of services to the public?</p></speech>

The whole-time equivalent figure for HSE and publicly funded employment, for all grades, as of September 2019, was 119,126.  That represents an increase from December 2018 of 1,269.  The Deputy will remember that we are still trying to recover from the gap left by the number of workers who left the service under various inducements over ten years ago and who have since retired.  He will also notice that there has come to be an even deeper reliance on agency provision.</p><p>That demonstrates that those staff are required but they are not in direct employment.  For value for money, if we were talking in those terms, a continual fixation with agency work is driving the budget in the wrong direction.  There is a commission that must be paid for those staff.  There are also the VAT implications.  VAT, at 23%, must be paid.  Of course, agency staff, like other workers in the health service, are entitled to be treated equally with their full-time colleagues.</p></speech>

I have one or two questions of my own.  There has been a suggestion that there are HR practices that, if overhauled, would improve working conditions.  My view would be that without the requisite staff, one can overhaul and restructure all one likes.  There seems to be, from my memory anyway, fairly sophisticated HR practices in terms of communication, committees and meeting points.  Has Mr. Bell a view on that?</p></speech>

We are now talking about a restructuring within a restructuring.  Dare I say it, it is almost like we are returning to the health board system and there are these regional units, the community healthcare organisations, CHOs.  My colleague put this correctly.  It is the autonomy of those who are managing.</p></speech>

There are certain issues with which we end up in difficulty, and we all ask how we got to this space in the end.  With position and rank come responsibilities.  In some cases, it is difficult to get to a position where one is clear on who the decision-maker is.  That has become frustrating over the past while.  I note the media commentary over recent weeks on where the director general of the Health Service Executive sees restructuring developing, but we have not had a full dialogue with that particular person at this stage.</p></speech>

It is fascinating that the matter is still being discussed since there is a willingness on behalf of the trade unions to expand the scope of practice.  In its submission, SIPTU states: "To this end we suggest that the Review of the roles and responsibilities of HCA is given full endorsement and that the support and the resources it needs are provided, so that this role can be developed along a cohesive and professional pathway." That is motherhood and apple pie.  That sounds great.  Will Mr. Bell give us an insight into why that is not happening?  It seems, on paper, like a good idea.  When one of the first reviews of it was done, perhaps 12 or 14 years ago, it was probably a fairly good idea.  SIPTU is calling here for it to be "given full endorsement".  Will Mr. Bell outline who is not endorsing it in the first instance?</p></speech>

There has been, I am glad to say, some progress made in recent times, led by my colleague, Ms Butler.  The Chairman will see that in many areas of the health service there is basically no understanding of how the healthcare assistant role has developed, and we are still trying to develop it.  The ongoing review has been dealing with the acute hospital setting.  My colleague, Ms Butler, will outline what exactly has been going on there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-20a.343" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019112000002#Z01100"><p>In December 2018, or back a bit further to 2016, we asked the Department of Health to conduct an independent study into where healthcare assistants were at the time.  That independent review eventually launched in December 2018 and the HSE fully endorsed the recommendations.  One of the issues with the healthcare assistants is that the role has developed differently in different areas.  In some areas healthcare assistants are doing observations and quite intricate patient care while not in other areas.  They all must have Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 5 now.  There are a number of areas where they are developing quite well.  Certainly, in some of the acute hospitals they are developing quite well.  It is much slower in maternity and in mental health.  It is much slower even in care of the elderly and in other areas.  However, the independent review clearly shows how and where they could be developed further.  There is no real objection to it, other than an unwillingness to get going on it.</p></speech>

One of the recommendations in the review is that there would be a permanent national forum set up for all matters relating to healthcare assistants so that there would be a one-stop shop for everything to do with healthcare assistants, from which would permeate all that needs to happen to make this grade of worker work within the community settings, the acute settings or wherever.  It has been agreed by the HSE to set that up, but that is where it sits.  It has not been resourced.  They have not put the people in.  That needs to be done.  The idea of the permanent forum is that it would look at the healthcare assistant role in all of the different services and develop it from there as a support to the professional grades.  It is not in competition with the professional grades.  We are not looking to be nurses, doctors or anything else.  They just want to do their role professionally in a way that they can and to develop to the roles that they can do.</p> <p>  In the report, there are approximately 16,500 people in support grades who could be considered healthcare assistants.  That does not include the 6,000 home helps or, as they are called now, healthcare support assistants.  As I stated, that is the only report that I am aware of independently conducted into a support grade, and yet Sl&aacute;intecare is moving everything that moves into the community and there is no report being done on how support grades operate currently in the community, let alone how they are supposed to operate in the future.  While we accept fully the importance of medical care, diagnostics, etc., the only impediment to the healthcare system being rolled out is it is not happening.</p></speech>

By 2030, according to the World Health Organization, we will be short 15 million health workers globally.  People think that refers to the developing world or non-developed world, whatever term one uses.  The biggest stresses will be in the provision of health service in the community.  If we accept that, and my colleague, Ms Marie Butler, has outlined it clearly, the healthcare assistant has to have a place in assisting in the delivery of health service while not being in competition with any other professional group.  The greater the expectation for community care, the more healthcare assistants there must be.  It means the ambulance service must provide a different service from what it and its professionals provide.</p> <p>  We believe there must be a concerted effort to make sure that healthcare assistants and their equivalents in community care are properly regulated so that it is understood that when people are providing health services in vulnerable people's homes, there is governance, even from a regulatory body.  That is important on the basis of where healthcare is going, and especially in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

Before I speak to the three technical amendments I intend to move in respect of the Criminal Records (Exchange of Information) Bill 2019, I will briefly summarise the Government&rsquo;s position in respect of the Bill.  As this committee is aware, the Bill is transposing two interrelated EU legislative acts, namely, Council Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA of 26 February 2009 and Council Decision 2009/316/JHA of 6 April 2009 on the establishment of the European criminal records information system, ECRIS.  This system allows for the transfer of criminal record information between member states for use in criminal investigations and proceedings and for other proceedings and matters where it may be necessary for authorities to run a check on such information.</p> <p>  It also creates a specific obligation on each member state, for example, Ireland, to inform those other member states when their national citizens are convicted of criminal offences here.  Pending legislation, the National Vetting Bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exchanges this information with authorities in other member states on an administrative basis and in accordance with the framework decision.  This Bill will place those procedures and requirements on a statutory basis.  It will not give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na any new powers but rather will codify the procedures to apply to the exchange of criminal records information on relevant EU nationals with other countries in the EU.  </p> <p>  The committee will also be aware that we are currently subject to infringement proceedings on account of the delay in our notifying measures for the transposition into our national law of the framework decision.  This delay is due to competing legislative priorities during the period since drafting of the Bill was approved.  Regard needed to be taken of the new EU Commission's proposal, which emerged in intervening times, to change the ECRIS.  I am eager to ensure that this situation is addressed.  I was pleased that we could approve the publication of the Bill in July 2019.  As members will be aware, the Garda National Vetting Bureau has been operating ECRIS on an administrative basis.  We are now underpinning this with legislation.   </p> <p>  The amendments are related.  There are three interconnected amendments relating to section 6(1) of the Bill providing for the general parameters-----</p></speech>

It might not always be the case that such criminal record information is legally required for criminal proceedings.  I am proposing that the reference to &ldquo;by or under any enactment or rule of law for&rdquo; be deleted in this subsection in order that the Garda National Vetting Bureau is not unnecessarily constrained in its requesting of information from other central authorities for the purposes of criminal proceedings against a given person in this jurisdiction.  This is in accordance with the provisions of the governing European framework decision.  The limitation on the Garda National Vetting Bureau requesting criminal record information under ECRIS, provided for by the reference to &ldquo;by or under any enactment or rule of law&rdquo;, is only applicable in the context of specific purposes other than criminal proceedings that are set out in Schedule 3 to this Bill.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are consequential amendments to the removal of text in amendment No. 1 in order that the text of the subsection, following this removal, reads appropriately.  </p></speech>

If I understand him correctly, the Minister said that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can request information in cases other than criminal cases.  I am very worried because it appears that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been requesting and providing information across the board for a number of years without any legal or statutory basis.</p><p>I want to tease out that because, if I am right, it is potentially very serious.

The fact that it has been operating on a non-statutory basis does not, in any way, affect the authority of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the legitimacy of the process because it comes under the framework decision as agreed.</p></speech>

We approved the drafting of the Bill in 2012.  We also had to take account of the European Commission's proposals in the form of a 2016 directive and a regulation in 2019.  These were designed to change and further adapt the records information system.  As I have said, the Bill has been subject to some delay.  That is why I am keen to proceed with this at the earliest opportunity, which is now.  I am grateful to the committee for making time available.  I am very keen to be in a position to enact the legislation before the end of the year.</p></speech>

I can say, however, that in the normal course of events, a particular period of time is given within which appropriate domestic legislation is to be enacted.  From our perspective, it is important that we proceed with our own domestic legislation, which we are now doing.  Since our central authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, was connected to the system a number of years ago, we have been in a position to exchange information with the central authorities in other member states, particularly on issues of national security and counterterrorism across the European Union.  We are now placing this on a statutory footing in accordance with what other EU member states have been doing in recent years.</p></speech>

It is important that all Departments, and particularly the Department of Justice and Equality, continue to carry out assessments on legislation required to ensure full compliance with our international obligations.  All Departments, not only the Department of Justice and Equality, need to be in a position to prioritise legislation in order to facilitate the transposition of these directives in a more timely manner.</p></speech>

It is certainly my wish, as Minister for Justice and Equality with responsibility for the criminal justice area, and the wish of the Government that the relationship between the UK and the European Union would be as close as possible following the withdrawal of the UK from the Union.</p><p>I am aware of the value and importance of a positive and co-operative engagement and relationship, not only in the sharing and exchange of ECRIS type information but across a range of security issues.  I do not wish to speculate on what the outcome will be and on whether the withdrawal agreement will take effect sometime next year, which would facilitate the movement into the future relationship.  In the criminal justice area and in the matter of international security, there are issues of a fundamental nature that will be the subject of discussion.  It is my intention to ensure there would be the closest possible relationship, having regard to our geographic proximity, to the common travel area arrangements and to our North-South arrangements.</p></speech>

The bigger question is that this has been operating on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis for quite some time.  What problems and challenges have emerged over that time?  Has the Department of Justice and Equality done a review to see what difficulties there are with the type of information that is shared or not shared, with whether a crime is a crime in one country and not in another and with spent convictions?  That would seem most opportune.  The legislation is necessary and I agree with it but what have we learned from the <i>ad hoc</i>administration of it?

I would invite members to look at the Schedule to the Bill before us to see the common table of offences that have been characterised.  It has been a feature of the administrative engagement and system since 2012 that there is a clearly defined framework and that there are schedules itemising specific offences in a way we are now enshrining in legislation, rather than merely formalising on the basis that I would not accept it was informal or <i>ad hoc</i>.  There was a framework.  We now have the statutory underpinning of that framework.  The Deputy can see the wide variety of criminal offences that will now be the subject matter of the legislation.</p></speech>

It seems to me as a general point that the Department might look at issues such as that as a learning exercise.  The Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 is good.  It is off topic but it is the same point.  The legislation was brought in and the uptake by victims was low but there has been no review of that.  Similarly, a review of a system such as this would be helpful to identify problems.</p></speech>

By coincidence, this was the subject matter for a parliamentary question from Deputy Pringle earlier.  I would be happy to engage further on that.  The uptake is low.  The system applies across the country.  There is no regional disparity but we need to look at why the uptake is so low and whether a greater level of information can be supplied because it appears to me that in some circumstances victims and complainants might not be fully aware of the Act.  I indicated to Deputy Pringle in reply to his parliamentary question that I would be happy to engage further and I say the same to Deputy Connolly.  Looking through the Schedule here and going back to Deputy Connolly's earlier question, we have the codification of offences here before us but there may well be something of a less than consistent feature on the matter of spent convictions.  In other words, there might be a conviction that is spent here and governed by our legislation that might not necessarily be covered by our international colleagues.  It will depend on whether a conviction is spent in another jurisdiction.  That will be a feature of the exchange of information.  If an offence is spent here and is not spent in another jurisdiction, that will have to be taken into account in the context of the transfer of information.</p></speech>

I take the Minister's point about the term &quot;<i>ad hoc</i>&quot;, but with a system that does not have statutory undertaking for such a long period of time, a review is essential.  Similarly, with legislation that is in place but is not being taken up, reviews are essential.  That is the bigger point.  That review should be informing the Minister today on the issues that have been identified as challenges and problems so we can pass proper legislation.</p></speech>

I said to Deputy Pringle I would be happy to engage further to determine the reasons the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 has had a low uptake.  The Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 has been updated by a numbers of Acts, not least the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, which placed the victim and complainant centre stage.  I would have thought issues in the context of the debate surrounding that legislation might have increased the information level to ensure a greater uptake.  That Act only came into force last year, so it is less than two years ago.  I am not downplaying the point raised by Deputy Connolly and I will engage further.</p></speech>

Most of the relevant questions have already been dealt with.  There is one thing that strikes me with this.  A conviction may be spent, and I have an example of this from an individual who came to me about this a number of years ago, where in his youth he had issues with mental health problems and got into spots of bother, as he described it, and it was reported in the media.  To this day, when one searches for his name on Google, this matter comes up.  Even if his conviction was spent, what would the position be there?  If an employer or someone were to search for his name, he would run into this difficulty.  He contacts the publications that published the stuff about him, which is in his past entirely and he is a different person now to who he was then, but this continues to be a shadow that follows him around all of his life.  That is unfair and unfortunate and everyone would agree with that.</p><p>I am aware of a similar situation of a young person who had a small drugs conviction.  Again, this continues to follow him around.</p><p> Although this legislation may deal with the official element of spending the conviction it will still not deal with that issue of a record of it existing in the media and on social media, and in how court reports are made and how they are sometimes available through national publications such as national newspapers.  The record is there to be found, forever it seems.  This needs to be looked at.  Often it is not the official conviction but the reporting of it that has the most impact.  This is certainly the reality for the two people I have spoken to.  While I am aware that it is totally outside of what can be legislated for and what we are speaking about today, it needs to be examined to see what we can do to deal with that aspect.</p></speech>

I remind the Deputy, as I did earlier, that this is the subject of debate under a Bill that is in the Seanad this afternoon.  I too am keen to ensure the issues that have informed Deputy Kenny are referenced as we review the spent convictions legislation.  The object of it, and the whole idea behind it, is to ensure that if a conviction is spent, it is done and that it does not form any part of adverse influence on a person's employment prospects, social interaction or wish to travel to another jurisdiction.  I would be concerned if media reports were continuing, having regard to the passing of the inclusion of the offence, as in the case the Deputy has referred to.  It is an ongoing debate, which is currently before Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It may well come before this committee early in the new year.</p></speech>

Is mise an comhordaitheoir rotha&iacute;ochta n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta le Cyclist.ie.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas as ucht an gcuireadh teacht anseo inniu.  I am the national cycling co-ordinator with Cyclist.ie, the Irish Cycling Advocacy Network, which is the umbrella body of cycle campaigning in Ireland.  The network comprises 25 groups and is a mixture of urban groups, rural groups and greenway groups stretching from the Inishowen peninsula down to Clonakilty, west Kerry, Connemara and everywhere in between, so we have all the corners covered.  We are the member for Ireland of the European Cyclists&rsquo; Federation, which advocates at a European level at the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.</p> <p>  Our vision is that cycling becomes a normal part of everyday life for all ages and abilities in Ireland in a way that it is in many other European countries.  For every different type of trip, whether cycling to school or college, heading to work, going to sports training and matches, going shopping or going to cultural events or other leisure and recreation outings, we cover all the different types of cycling.  We are particularly conscious that in many parts of Ireland, particularly rural Ireland, the number of children cycling to school has fallen off a cliff in the past 30 years.  For example, in 1986, when I was in secondary school myself, more than 19,000 girls cycled to secondary school, whereas according to the most recent census data from 2016, only 694 secondary school girls were cycling to school and more than 2,000 were driving themselves to school.  It is shocking.  Something is seriously amiss.</p> <p>  On the regulatory side, we welcome the new regulation regarding the dangerous overtaking of cyclists announced on 11 November 2019 by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  We are cautiously optimistic there will be serious and systematic enforcement of the new regulations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The impact the new laws will have on driver behaviour is critically linked to the enforcement regime to be employed by the Garda.</p> <p>  We sent a detailed submission to the committee at the beginning of October.  The main point is that the proper resourcing and development of cycling nationally, as proposed in many Government strategies, can have wide-ranging positive impacts on many aspects of society.  Increased everyday cycling levels will improve national health and well-being, including mental health.  We are very conscious that one in four children and six in ten adults are currently obese or overweight, as noted in the Healthy Ireland obesity policy in 2016.  Increased everyday cycling levels will also provide an improved public environment in villages, towns and cities throughout the country and, critically, they will support national competitiveness by reducing congestion.</p><p>We know from a report published a number of years ago that congestion in the greater Dublin area currently costs &euro;350 million per year.  Increased cycling also supports local economies and increases tourism.  Critically, it will also support Ireland meeting its climate change targets as the transport sector currently accounts for approximately 20% of our carbon emissions.<br/><br/>The &euro;12.6 million allocated for cycling in 2018 is equivalent to approximately 1% of the total transport budget.  This should be increased tenfold in order to bring Ireland&rsquo;s cycling infrastructure and investment into line with that of our EU neighbours and realise other broad societal benefits.  Furthermore, investment in cycling provides generously high rates of return on investment compared with other public transport investments.  <i>Cyclist.ie</i>calls on the Government to realise these economic and social benefits by increasing, significantly and immediately, the funding allocated to cycling both as a transport mode and a leisure activity.  We call on the Government to follow its own recommendation and invest a minimum of 10% of the capital budget for land transport in cycling from 2020.<br/><br/>We recommend a few areas on which cycling funding should be spent.  First is the provision of high-quality cycling infrastructure, which is being developed across Europe.  Cities such as Brussels, to which many Members travel regularly, Paris and London were dominated by car traffic over the last five decades.  They have been transformed in the past ten years by the provision of high-quality infrastructure, pedestrianisation and taking cars out of the city centre.  Even Paris's big, hostile roundabouts are being converted to become pedestrian and cycle friendly.  We see e-bikes as an important part of the future of mobility and a subsidy should be provided for purchasing them.  There might be competition between Cork, Drogheda and Kinsale to become the e-bike capital of Ireland or even Europe.  E-bikes have huge potential.  It is also essential that we set up a national cycling office in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It does not have one at the moment, leaving a big gap in the infrastructure to create change.  Many other interventions could be introduced to make cycling safe and normal, such as contraflow arrangements for cyclists, which are very common in Brussels; good traffic-free links to sports grounds, GAA pitches, stadiums, towns and suburbs; and speed enforcement.<br/><br/>On my behalf and on behalf of Ms Forsythe and <i>cyclist.ie</i>, I thank the Deputies and Senators for their attention<i>. </i>We are happy to answer any questions from the committee.</p></speech>

I am the chairperson of Dublin Cycling Campaign and am accompanied by its vice-chairperson, Ms Louise Williams.  Dublin Cycling Campaign is a membership based charity in Dublin which promotes cycling and is 100% run by volunteers.  We have a shared vision for a more liveable Dublin where people of all ages and abilities can cycle safely and comfortably.  We believe that if more people in Ireland cycled, society would be stronger, happier and healthier.  Our contribution will obviously have a Dublin and urban focus but it can also be applied to many towns and urban centres around Ireland.</p> <p>  Why should we promote cycling?  Cycling is an amazing tool that tackles many of the problems Irish people face.  It is a congestion-beating mode of transport.  Congestion is worsening and is stealing valuable hours from people's lives and destroying their quality of life.  Walking and cycling both have a major role to play in improving public health in Ireland through exercise, as well as reducing air and noise pollution.  Cycling can tackle social isolation and social accessibility.  It is a cheap and easy mode of transport that connects people to vital services or to work.  Cycling can also tackle our climate change objectives.  When towns and cities are designed with walking and cycling in mind, as has happened in Seville, Strasbourg and Paris, people of all ages and abilities cycle, either for local trips or to connect to public transport for longer trips.  The more the Government does to promote cycling, the stronger, happier and healthier Irish society will be.</p> <p>  People cycling face many problems that, if tackled, would enable and encourage more people to cycle.  Dangerous overtaking is a serious issue and our members report instances of the practice on a regular basis.  Many of these incidents are backed up by footage recorded on helmet cameras, which is terrifying to watch.  There are three pillars involved in tackling this issue, namely, awareness, legislation and enforcement.  The Road Safety Authority's, RSA, awareness campaign was the first step in dealing with this, and the new regulations introduced by the Minister were the second.  The third and final step is strong enforcement of the new regulations.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to be given the resources and training to enforce this new legislation.  In the UK, West Midlands Police has seen great results from its Operation Close Pass.  When a police officer is close passed on a bike, the police either offer to educate the driver or take the driver to court.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could also allow members of the public to upload their video footage to aid in prosecutions, as London&rsquo;s Metropolitan Police Service does.</p> <p>  Speeding is another issue people cycling face.  The Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s Free Speed Survey 2018 revealed that 98% of drivers in urban areas break the 30 km/h speed limits, and 81% speed in urban 50 km/h zones.  This level of speeding is a major cause for concern for people who cycle, parents who bring their children to school and older people who should feel safe in their neighbourhoods.</p> <p>  Harassment and intimidation of people cycling is also a major concern for us.  We are concerned at the level of verbal and physical harassment targeted at people cycling.  We regularly hear reports of intimidation, with a number of women in the campaign subjected to both verbal and physical gendered abuse.  We need strong political leadership on this issue in order to tackle it.</p> <p>  The number one thing the Government can do to promote cycling is build a network of segregated cycle lanes which protect people from motor traffic.  The existing painted cycle lanes do not offer enough protection to people who cycle or provide enough incentive or confidence to people who would like to cycle but are too nervous or afraid to do so.  Wherever high-quality segregated cycle lanes have been built, we have seen huge increases in the numbers and diversity of people cycling.  All the cities in Ireland and all major towns in the greater Dublin area have plans for cycling networks - we just need to build them.</p> <p>  BusConnects Dublin offers a huge opportunity as it proposes to deliver 200 km of segregated cycle tracks.  This will be transformative for Dublin and will provide the backbone of the greater Dublin area cycle network.  The project is not without its challenges, which must be worked through.  BusConnects alone will not deliver a cycling network for Dublin.  We also need to complete many other projects, including the Liffey cycle route, the Dodder greenway, the Santry greenway, and the east coast trail.  One of the issues in delivering these routes is the long lead-in time for infrastructure projects.  The Liffey cycle route was first planned eight years ago and is no closer to construction today than it was then.  The Royal Canal greenway in Dublin received planning permission in 2015 but the majority of it has not started construction yet.  All these projects have been delayed again and again because of a lack of capital funding or human resources in either Dublin City Council or the National Transport Authority, NTA.  Allocating 10% of the land transport budget for cycling, as recommended by the Joint Committee on Climate Action, will provide the resources these organisations need to deliver this vital infrastructure.</p> <p>  I will talk briefly about heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, in urban areas.  In April 2018, Harry Boland, a 19 year old engineering student in Trinity College Dublin, was killed by a left-turning truck on the Stillorgan Road.  Similarly, Neeraj Jain, 34, who came to Ireland from India to study and work, was killed by a left-turning truck in Kilmainham while cycling to work.  HGVs are a leading killer of people cycling in urban areas.  Educating people about the blind spots of HGVs or adding more cameras and mirrors is not a systematically safe solution.  People are human and will make mistakes, but mistakes should not get people killed on our roads.  The EU is requiring new HGVs produced after 2021 to meet high direct-vision standards.  This effectively means that there are no blind spots around the cab of the HGV, which significantly reduces the number of fatalities for people walking and cycling.  The five-axle truck ban in Dublin city is hugely beneficial for people walking and cycling.  The next step is to provide legislation which would allow local authorities to only permit trucks that meet these high standards in tight urban areas.  Many of those details need to be worked out, but local authorities must be granted some powers from the Oireachtas in order to do that.</p><p>I want to address the duty of the State to protect life.  On the night of Neeraj Jain&rsquo;s death 19 days ago, the cycling community and local residents held a vigil at the site of the collision.  As we stood at the junction, we watched the traffic.  Each local resident would tell a story about how they have almost been in a collision while walking or cycling at this junction.  They told us that they have sent letters of complaint with regard to the traffic to Dublin City Council, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health and Safety Authority.  The traffic around this area has only worsened because of the construction of the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  The junction is poorly designed and does not meet modern road safety standards.  The risk to life was evident to us.  Given that complaints had already been expressed about that junction, we must ask if the State is failing in its most fundamental duties to protect life.</p><p> I thank the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-20a.446" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Ferrie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019112000002#E00300"><p>I thank the committee to present to it today on behalf of I BIKE Dublin.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Alan Downey.</p> <p>  Cycling in Dublin should not be the preserve of the brave and the foolhardy.  We should aspire to be a city where people of all ages and abilities can choose to cycle.  The societal benefits are manifold, with reduced congestion and air and noise pollution, along with better physical and mental health outcomes.  In the Netherlands, 75% of secondary school children cycle to school.  In Ireland, that number is 2.1%.</p> <p>  I BIKE Dublin was established in 2017 as a direct action group to advocate for safe cycling infrastructure for people who cycle in Dublin.  Our aim is to change the public discourse around cycling, influence public opinion and draw attention to the daily challenges faced by people who cycle as a result of poor infrastructure, as well as a consequence of the illegal use of what infrastructure does exist.  While our focus is on Dublin, the same issues and principles apply to towns and cities across the country.</p> <p>  It has recently been calculated that upwards of 30 separate organisations comprising local authorities, Departments, State agencies, task forces and private companies share responsibility for transport in Dublin.  For campaign groups and local communities, this presents an intractable problem.  Every time we think we have found the body responsible for a particular issue, we are referred to another body.  Our solution, as well as our campaign method, has been to expose the problems at source and force a decision.</p> <p>  By way of example, the problem of coach parking on the Alfie Byrne Road cycle lane during large events was tossed around between Dublin City Council, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Transport Authority, NTA, with no one taking overall responsibility for it.  This persisted until we forced the issue by creating a human chain of 75 people along the cycle lane during a recent event in Croke Park.  Dublin City Council has since installed bollards along the route.  The NTA has allowed coaches to park in its coach park on Sheriff Street while Croke Park has amended its travel advice on its website accordingly.  The problem has been solved but it required direct action.</p> <p>  Our actions have directly resulted in many incremental improvements such as the installation of wands and orcas in hotspots.  More recently, following the death of Neeraj Jain earlier this month, our actions have shifted towards highlighting the failures of the authorities which should be planning for, providing funding for and enforcing the rules which will enable a safe cycling city.  The growing number of people joining our actions is testament to the growing exasperation with the current environment for people cycling in Dublin.</p> <p>  Tens of thousands of people get on their bikes in Dublin every day.  Tens of thousands more would do so if they felt it was safe.  Earlier this year, Moyagh Murdock, CEO of the Road Safety Authority, claimed that Ireland has the second safest roads in Europe.  If our roads are so safe, why are so few children and women cycling?</p> <p>  In 2013, the NTA published the greater Dublin area cycle network plan.  It promised 2,840 km of a comprehensive, integrated network of safe cycling routes.  To date, there is no sign of this plan being implemented.  Over the past two years, the managements of over 100 organisations, including Google, Vodafone, Workday, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin Chamber of Commerce and SIPTU, have called on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Roads Authority to progress these plans in order to provide their workers, students and members with safe routes to commute by bike.  Over 400,000 people are represented by their employers, places of education or trade unions in this call, yet there has been no discernible action to date.  Meanwhile, the Cabinet has approved almost &euro;1 billion in funding for new roads projects in the past month alone.</p> <p>  Cycling infrastructure is relatively cheap to build and has a high return on investment.  London's transport authority reports ratios of 20:1 for cycling investment.  The Netherlands spends &euro;500 million per year on cycling infrastructure, which generates &euro;19 billion in health benefits alone, a 38:1 return on investment.  We need the Government to show it is serious about funding cycling by allocating at least 10% of the land transport budget towards cycling infrastructure as recommended by the United Nations Environment Programme and as endorsed by the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action and, most recently, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport itself in a report on last year&rsquo;s ministerial discussion on smarter travel.</p> <p>  We also need to see leadership from the Government to ensure the various bodies with responsibility for transport and road safety are at one on the urgency of delivering safe cycling infrastructure.  We refer the committee to presentations made to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action by delegates from the Velo-City Conference on 26 June.  One of its key recommendations was to provide grants for e-bikes.  E-bikes are particularly important for older people, offering a cheaper alternative to running a car.  If the infrastructure is safe, it could extend active life and health by many years.</p> <p>  Dublin can lead the way and be an exemplar for safe cycling infrastructure throughout the country.  This is not about making Dublin a cycling city.  This is about recognising that Dublin already is a cycling city and providing the infrastructure to match.</p></speech>

Last year, it was reduced to nine people who were killed cycling.  This year, so far, the figure is nine again.  It is a serious issue when a much higher percentage of cyclists are injured and killed than other road users.  The witnesses&rsquo; points are well made and well taken.</p> <p>  The second half of our meeting will involve the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the NTA.  I want to see a consensus for change and all agencies working together.  Obviously, education and awareness are important.  Being able to see cyclists is important too.  Quite often, when I drive home at night, I cannot see cyclists as, unfortunately, some of them wear dark clothes and come at one out of the blue at junctions.  There is an issue about visibility, awareness, better lighting and safer intersections.</p> <p>  I will allow Senator Mark Daly to ask the first question as he has another urgent meeting to attend.</p></speech>

Mr. Ferrie pointed out the amount of money allocated towards road infrastructure.  The local authorities do not seem to be clear from where the money is coming.  Accordingly, the action plan put forward by the Government does not seem to have the money to back it up.</p> <p>  Have the witnesses any feedback on this from local authorities which are willing to put in the infrastructure and the necessary dedicated cycling infrastructure?  While I am referring specifically to Dublin, in Kerry, for example, the plans put forward by the local authority to ensure they also comply with the framework have not been vetted.  More importantly, the funding is not being put in place to match the ambition.  There is a disconnect in that.  Is that the feedback the witnesses are getting from local authorities?</p></speech>

The witnesses&rsquo; points are well made.  They have pointed out the advantages of cycling in modern society.</p><p>What is happening at the minute is there are plans and a lack of implementation on a transport network that was never designed for cyclists.  That is the issue.  It is intended to have cycle lanes on roads that are not wide enough.  Everybody agrees on the need for cycling and the need to provide infrastructure and investment for cycling.  The Chairman referred to the lack of visibility among cyclists.  Does the cycling community have any responsibility for the current situation?  Is the fault all one way?</p></speech>

We can try to encourage people as much as possible to light up their bikes.  Dublin Cycling Campaign is running the Light up your Bike! campaign.  We are distributing lights that were given to us by the RSA.  Cyclists are required to have lights on their bikes after dark.  The Garda can issue fines on the spot for a failure to do so and it should do more of that.  There needs to be more enforcement of the road traffic laws across the board and the requirement to have lights on bikes after dark is one such law.</p> <p>  On the Senator's question as to whether roads are wide enough for cycle lanes, finding space on roads can be difficult.  On many roads, particularly in Dublin, there is space and cycle lanes would not take space from other traffic.  We see this in the BusConnects plans.  The cycle facilities it is proposed to add to roads such as the Finglas Road and Malahide Road will not take space from pedestrians or motor traffic.  There is space available which can be given to cyclists.  In other areas, harder choices will have to made but we are seeing communities, particularly in Dublin, make these choices, including as part of BusConnects.  Communities are opting to make certain roads one-way in order to find space to add more bus lanes or cycle infrastructure.</p></speech>

The funding allocated to cycling is not adequate.  We have been trying to find out from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport how much is spent on cycling and we have not got an answer.  It would appear cycling is bundled up with things such as cycling and walking, sustainable transport and greenways.  We are estimating what percentage of the figure allocated for each of those areas is spent on cycling.  It also appears that the Department has not isolated how much is being spent on cycling.  As we all know, if it is not counted, it will not happen.  The Department should calculate how much it is spending on cycling and ensure the 10% figure recommended by the various bodies that have been mentioned is allocated to cycling.</p> <p>  We could discuss the issue of securing funding all week.  Local authorities compete for funding.  Most funding for cycling comes from the National Transport Authority but there are other funds.  Local authorities are fighting to get money from those funds.  It is up to each individual local authority to make its case and to seek the funding.  There is insufficient funding available and it is always a battle for a local authority to secure funding.  We lobby to try to get funding for the projects we believe are important.</p> <p>  Senator O'Mahony referred to rural areas and roads that are not designed for cycling.  That is a problem but there is considerable space on many rural roads to provide separate infrastructure and traffic calming for cycling in towns and villages and on their outskirts.  There is space for traffic calming measures and cycle lanes and also scope to impose lower speed limits.</p></speech>

I grew up in a rural village about three miles outside of Galway city.  When I was growing up, all the old people cycled to mass every weekend and all the kids cycled to school.  We used to cycle into the city every day to go to secondary school and we did so <i>en masse</i>.  Loads of us cycled.  We used to gather at the crossroads and it was a social thing.  What happened, however, was that the roads were improved, meaning they were widened and straightened and suddenly the cars started travelling faster.  Vehicles also got bigger and more powerful and people were less inclined to let their children go out on the road.  The road infrastructure has changed.  It is not that roads are not wide enough but that they are designed to allow people to drive as quickly as they can from one point to another.  We are not asking for something new in requesting that cyclists be allowed to use the roads.  Cycling has a long tradition in Ireland.  Bicycles were on these roads before cars, believe it or not, and we would like to see-----</p></speech>

I listened to their requests and I agree with them.  They referred to the Netherlands.  We must acknowledge that the Netherlands is a lowland country.  It had to rebuild after wars so it had a chance to get infrastructure in place.  In this country, we have narrow roads and streets and maybe we are trying to do a rushed job because other issues are kicking in, for example, the need to take action on climate change.</p> <p>  There are three categories of cyclists, namely, those who cycle to work, recreational cyclists who use the roads mainly at weekends and athletes who are competing.  Trying to facilitate each of those categories is where the problem arises.  The biggest concern is that we are rushing.  I cycled to national school and then I went to boarding school.</p><p>I cycled afterwards.  I have taken part in a 180 km charity cycle.  I love cycling but we need patience.  I agree with our guests that children do not cycle to school.  I suppose it is because of the mindset of the parents due to security and other reasons.  I fully support cycling getting funding and I agree with our guests regarding 10% of funding going towards cycling.  How do we implement it without disenfranchising everyone, however?  One see people cycling four abreast.  I have concerns about cyclists wearing ear plugs.  We do not know whether they know that vehicles are behind them or whether they are switched on to what is behind them.</p><p> Roads constitute the big problem in my part of the country.  I appreciate health and safety but the implementation of the new laws could create problems.  Unless we shut down more roads and say that some roads are reserved for cyclists while others are just for cars and lorries, we will have a problem in rural Ireland until more greenways are built.</p></speech>

There are things that can be done quickly without disrupting road traffic in Fingal.  We have a few developments happening like side roads, greenways and things that will connect schools, housing estates and town centres.  These kind of things would provide benefit without disrupting traffic and the need to say that half a road must be given over - within the city anyhow.  What I also find when I cycle between these areas is that although drivers feel they may be able to get somewhere faster if the cyclist was not in their way, I often pass them shortly afterwards at traffic lights or as they hit a junction or another line of cars.  Some people perceive that cyclists hold them up and are in the way and that if cyclists were out of the way, they would get to their destinations quicker.  Regarding certain roads with a long stretch between towns and 80 km/h speed limits, I am not familiar with all of the roads where these speed limits are in place.  However, these roads are so narrow and the distances so great that motorists would effectively be held up for long periods.  A different type of infrastructure is needed in those cases.  In terms of what we can do quickly, we could develop those shorter roads that link small sections of towns to provide people with access so that they do not need to use  cars to cover those short distances.  Once that is safer, we will find that more people will be able to cycle.  We see it between Baldoyle and Portmarnock, where I live.  Just under 2 km of greenway is being completed on a very narrow road where I have had a few close passes involving dangerous overtaking by cars.  Once that goes in, it will enable so many more people to cycle from schools, of which there are over 20 in the area.  It is a very highly populated area.  The link for those people at the moment is that they must take the car, which creates the congestion that then creates the traffic that slows everybody down and creates the environment where drivers feel they must go faster to get where they are trying to go.</p></speech>

We pestered the clerk and the Chairman for some time to put this issue on the agenda.  I am very pleased that we are hearing from our guests.</p> <p>  We should change the narrative relating to this issue.  This is not a case "you"; it is about "we".  Regardless of whether or not one cycles, we all benefit.  If we thought differently, we might well act differently.  I have asked quite a lot of parliamentary questions to find out what the spend is.  It is incredibly difficult to pin it down, which is one problem.</p> <p>  Another problem is the fact that no one has ownership of the issue.  Somebody made a point about 30 different organisations.  That kind of fragmentation does not help in terms of driving change.  If somebody owns it, it gets done.  If there is a budget for it, it gets done.  I am an offender who primarily drives into town when the D&aacute;il is sitting and I can see the growing number of people who cycle.  We have created the conflict between cyclists and motorists because we have not designed the city and our towns to accommodate a more sustainable form of transport, be it cycling or walking.  The Luas is a fantastic and very important investment but the number of people who cycle to work outnumbers the number who commute using the Luas.  Nobody says that the investment in the Luas should not have happened but if we put even a fraction of that into cycling, we might arrive at an arrangement where there is less conflict.  When I travelled in different cities in Europe, I tended to take photographs of good ideas such as contra-flow systems or proper segregation of cycling.  One sees large numbers of people cycling but one does not see the conflict.  A very good submission that contained lots of ideas was made in October.  I would like us to take those ideas, put them into a report and make some recommendations to the Department and Minister so that there is an outcome from today's meeting.</p> <p>  A colleague of mine who is a councillor in Naas is a cyclist advocate.  Terrific work has been done there in terms of a plan that was put in place.  One will see other people who, because they are personally invested in something, are the ones who make a difference.  It should not have to be like that.  There is an extremely good plan in NAAS in respect of which there is a lot of buy-in.  Where something like that is put in front of people, it is amazing how they will see sense in it.  However, it must come from public bodies rather than just from advocacy groups and there must be support for it.</p> <p>  The number one issue is getting infrastructure right.  We have a great distance to go.  We mix bus lanes with cyclists.  Bravery awards come to mind.  The way we design things is problematic.  We do not target the spend at the numbers who are cycling.  Are our guests happy with the design manual?  Does it need to be changed or is it just the implementation?  They referred to having people embedded within the Department as opposed to just the NTA.</p> <p>  On the fiscal side, it makes complete sense.  It was only when our guests put it in the submission that it jumped out at me that it is so obvious that it should be done with regard to inequality or even advantage in terms of a financial incentive for e-bikes or extending the cycle to work scheme to cycling to school so that there is some degree of investment.  Our guests might talk us through some of those types of ideas or questions regarding the submission, which is the basis for the kind of report we should make.  It is not a question of us reinventing the wheel but we could make some good recommendations on foot of the submission.</p></speech>

Leadership is essential to ensure that change happens.  The plans are there.</p> <p>  We need to challenge our assumptions about how people are cycling.  We should not assume that because many people commute by bicycle that they are the only type of cyclists for whom we should cater.  We should be thinking about people dropping their children to school, caregivers and a range of others who wish to cycle.  It is very important that we begin to challenge and examine those assumptions.  If we fail to so do, there is a risk we will only cater for people who wear Lycra and go as fast as they can on urban streets.  The city centre is not really an appropriate place for sport cycling because that would exclude some people who may wish to cycle.  Approximately 26% of those who cycle in Dublin are women.  Some people who study cycling and know far more about it than we do have stated that women are an indicator species in the sense that having a greater proportion of women cyclists indicates there are good routes that are segregated and well maintained.  Clearly, that is not the case in Dublin.  Leadership is important.  It is also important that we do not design assuming that we are catering for everybody.  Doing so involves a strong risk that it would, by default, be a design for men who tend to cycle in a certain way.  The Dublin City Cycling Campaign believes that would be problematic further down the line. </p> <p>  On how we design our city, Dublin City Council has a list of priorities, with pedestrians first, followed by cyclists, public transport users and drivers.  We must acknowledge, as has been done quite comprehensively at this meeting, that those methods of transport are sometimes put in conflict.  That is what the Chairman witnessed in the case of a cyclist coming at him out of the blue.  I understand that he experienced and saw the cyclist's vulnerability.  When considering a design context such as that, we may have a tendency to blame the person who is most vulnerable.  What we need to do is recognise that the lighting is appropriate for cars but not for people who are cycling.</p></speech>

I am not blaming anybody.  One does not expect it.  One thanks God that one did not hit the cyclist who was going the wrong way on a particular road.  It often happens around Dorset Street, although I am not sure why.  I do not know if others have had the same experience.</p></speech>

The better the design, the less one will encounter that kind of behaviour.  The more clarity there is on the boundaries between those who drive and those who cycle - all present do both - the better.  We need to challenge our assumptions about how people who cycle will cycle.  We must ensure we get it right with the right leadership.  We need to think of elderly people and those with mobility challenges who could use e-bikes or other mobility aids to cycle.  We need to be able to design for everybody.  It is our duty to avoid discrimination and ensure there is equality within design structures.</p></speech>

The NTA design manual forms part of that.  The first point is that it should be used.  Many schemes are developed without reference to it.  The manual needs to be tweaked and improved, and it needs to be used.  The provision of high quality routes is partly a technical challenge.  It is often a political decision on to whom one wishes to give the space.  In too many instances, not enough high-quality space in the road environment is given to school children, older people, women or other groups which currently do not cycle to the same extent as is the case in many other countries.  There are political and technical elements to the problem.</p></speech>

The NTA has referred to updating it but we have no further information on that.  If the committee could ask the NTA the status of the new design manual, that would be great.  The existing manual does not design for all ages and abilities, particularly at junctions.  Many of its designs may be acceptable to more confident and fit cyclists but they are less suitable for younger or older cyclists or those not used to cycling.</p></speech>

The latter offer a great opportunity.  Cycle routes are being built into the estates, but the provision tends to be fragmented and does not look at the total package.  One ends up with nothing at either end of the estate or a conflict where there is permeability into an existing housing estate but no receiving infrastructure.  That issue arises continuously.  There are great opportunities to put new infrastructure in place but if it is not properly connected, it loses its value.</p> <p>  A couple of decades ago, a State agency carried out a costing on the loss of a life.  That is quite controversial because one can never put a monetary value on a life.  The figure was used in cost-benefit analyses of potential road upgrades to show the benefit of upgrading roads with bad accident profiles in order to prevent further loss of life.  It is an awful way to measure things, but it worked in terms of upgrading some very poor quality roads.   The relevant cost allocated was approximately IR&pound;1 million - it goes back to pre-euro days.  The cost-benefit analysis woke people up and brought home to them the economic value of such upgrades.  Although it is an awful way of doing it, it gave a metric against which the cost and benefit of an upgrade could be measured.</p></speech>

I cycled to Leinster House earlier after dropping them off.  We go from a 1990s estate in Fingal, through a 1990s estate within the Dublin City Council area and end up in a very modern estate on the border between the Dublin City Council area and Fingal.  The quality of infrastructure on the journey varies vastly.  There are completely unsegregated and very narrow lanes, a very wide lane and a lovely greenway through the new estate.  We had to campaign for the greenway to be opened when the school was finished.  The builders did not wish to open it until the houses were finished, but they had to do so to allow access to the school.  The ongoing building work means that heavy equipment is parked on cycle lanes for the entire length of the road from Donaghmede roundabout to Belmayne.</p> <p>  We have looked into initiating cycle-buses.  I have worked with parents in other parts of Fingal on these.  The infrastructure is so fragmented that even though a cycle-bus is intended to compensate for a lack of infrastructure for children cycling to school, there are certain points and junctions through which we could not bring a cycle-bus of children.  The cycle-bus would end up starting so close to the school that it would serve no purpose.  I fully agree with the Deputy on fragmentation and the catch-up that is required to integrate older infrastructure with the wonderful greenways and green lanes that are built in new estates but not fully connected with existing infrastructure.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Keeffe is correct that there is an urgency in terms of taking speed off our roads and making a transition.  The Joint Committee on Climate Action, of which I am a member, has discussed this issue.  The 10% target rightly outlined by our guests as required was reiterated.</p><p>It is very notable.  Perhaps the witnesses will comment on it.  I know that officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will be coming in later.  I understand the transport budget has increased by &euro;300 million this year.  How is the Department doing with its efforts to achieve the 10% target?  The question of balance has been discussed.  The balance is probably poor if the target is just 10%.  It seems to be a minimum that there would be 10%.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, in the Dublin area there are more people cycling than using the Luas.  It is an infrastructural need.  I am particularly interested in how we can make progress in those areas where a cycling plan has been set out.  A proposal involving 2,800 km of cycle paths has been set out for the greater Dublin area.</p><p> I would like to speak about the question of planning and cycling.  Some projects do not seem to refer to the design manual, despite its flaws.  Is that about the national cycling office?  How important is the national cycling office in ensuring a few greenway projects that are about bikes are not put in as an afterthought when plans are being drawn up for many other transport projects that are about cars?  We must ensure all our planning is planned for all users and is planned to be usable.  Anything new that is being built should be planned with the idea that it will at least intersect with cycling.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the particular role of the national cycling office.  In what way will this structure differ from having some officials within the NTA driving the big picture?</p><p> I was very struck by the discussion on cycling infrastructure in rural areas.  The conversation often seems to be solely about greenways.  It seems to be approached from a tourist perspective, rather than from the perspective of someone who is living 2 km or 3 km outside a town and should be able to cycle safely into that town.  I know there have been great initiatives in places like Ennis.  Efforts have been made to make it possible to cycle again.  The conversation can sometimes end up being about cyclists versus drivers.  Many people are both cyclists and drivers.  The real issue is not simply representing the interests of cyclists.  The real issue is that it is in the public interest for there to be more cyclists.  It is about those who are not cycling.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on those who do not cycle.  I was really struck by the idea that there has been a 90% reduction in the number of girls cycling to school.  At a time when everything globally is telling us we need to move towards cycling, it is not simply a matter of measuring the loss of life.  That is the one thing I would suggest.  It is one thing to measure the loss of life, but the greater loss that is harder to measure is what is lost when people decide not to cycle because of safety concerns.</p><p> The health and other benefits of cycling have been mentioned.  Reference has been made to the Netherlands in that context.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on the benefits of cycling we can measure and on what is lost when people decide not to cycle.  I would like them to focus on two cohorts within that.  First, it seems to me that if women are not cycling here at the same rate as in other countries, this must be an equality issue.  We can assume that an extra 15%, 20% or 30% of women would cycle, as they do in other countries, if the conditions here permitted it.  If they lived in the Netherlands, they would probably be cycling.  The same people would cycle in a different environment.  Second, I ask the witnesses to comment specifically on the issue of making it safe for people of all abilities to cycle.  I say this in the context of the need for the next generation to start cycling while they are in school.  Do the witnesses believe a specific cycling strategy for the next generation needs to be rolled out in our schools?  What role might be played by safe zones or calm zones in this context?  I know there is an issue for many people.  They are worried not about the cycle, but about cars pulling in when they are dropping their children off.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the idea of creating a safe space where children can cycle and safely disembark when they get to school.</p><p> I am asking about specific measures on equality and about specific measures on the next generation.  I am also asking about the benefits of cycling and the loss when we do not encourage cycling.  I am also asking the witnesses to comment on the national cycling office.  How do we accelerate the achievement of the 10% target?  Should there be annual measures?  I hope this committee will be in a position to hold to account the achievement of the 10% target.</p></speech>

If I do not cover all the other issues, Ms Williams might cover some of them.  We have said in our submission that there should be a national cycling office within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This would be a policy-driven office that would promote cycling.  Somebody at a senior level should promote all aspects of cycling and deal with all the issues that have been raised by Senator Higgins, including equality issues, schools issues, health issues and issues affecting the next generation.  That person would also deal with infrastructure and would ensure the national cycling manual is brought up to date and serves its purpose.</p> <p>  The response we have received to our request for a national cycling office is that there is a new cycling office within the NTA.  This is a design office.  In effect, it is employing people to design new infrastructure, which we welcome.  It appears to cover Dublin only.  It may well cover the Dublin City Council area and not the other three local authority areas in Dublin.  It does not cover the other cities - Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford - that are covered by the NTA.  The NTA covers Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford and does not cover all of the other towns and villages in Ireland.  In our view, we need a national cycling office within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to drive policy.</p> <p>  We also believe there should be a cycling officer in each local authority.  This is not just our view - it is in the national cycling policy framework, which is under review by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The only local authority I know of that has a full-time cycling officer is Dublin City Council.  The other day, I heard somebody in a management position in another local authority saying it was not obliged to have a cycling officer.  We believe there should be a cycling officer in every local authority.  We believe each officer should draw up a cycling plan for the local authority in accordance with the national cycling policy framework.  That would deal with many of the issues that have been raised by Senator Higgins.</p> <p>  The Senator asked how we can speed up the allocation of funds.  Funding can move slowly.  The demand is there.  The Government's climate action plan contains a commitment to allocate 10% of funding to transport.  We accept that it may be a bit late to get that for 2019.  It is certainly not too late to get it for a year like 2022.  We need a rapid increase in the allocation of funding for cycling.  We heard recently about moneys on the transport side being allocated to road projects.  As far as I am aware, there has not been a similar announcement of moneys being allocated to cycling projects.</p> <p>  I will touch on the greenways issue.  It seems to me - others can contradict me - that many local politicians are managing to secure money for greenway projects.  I live in the South Dublin County Council area.  We are looking for funding for a Grand Canal greenway between Lucan and the border with County Kildare.  The rest of the Grand Canal greenway seems to have secured funding, but the part of it that might serve commuter cycling in the Dublin and north Kildare area has not received an allocation.  It seems that in rural areas, there is a push to get allocations for greenways.  It is very difficult to get anything done to encourage cycling among people who live within a mile or two of the local town or village.  I think Senator Higgins mentioned such people.  Very often, there are no huge barriers to the installation of safe cycling infrastructure in such areas.  Many medium-sized Irish towns have little bits of cycling infrastructure, but they are not continuous.</p> <p>  The Senator raised a number of equality issues.  She asked how we can cater for the next generation.  We have to make it safe for children to walk and cycle to school.  Fingal County Council has introduced a welcome "school street" initiative in Malahide.  We think that kind of thing should be done in every town and village in Ireland.  There should be a transport plan for every school that does something to enable children to travel to school on foot or by bicycle.  We must devise safety plans around schools.  Such plans may involve cars parking a few hundred yards away and the children being walked into school from there.  We must start to try to get everybody, particularly young people in every school in every town and village, to walk and cycle more.  The infrastructure, including the street design, should be in place to make walking and cycling seem attractive.  We are talking about the next generation.</p><p>Climate change is coming at us.  We need to get people out of their cars and into more climate-friendly and healthier forms of transport.  Louise Williams will talk now about the equality issues.</p></speech>

I do not have specific figures for Ireland because of the complexity of tracking but there is no doubt that cycling has many physical benefits for the individual together with his or her well-being.  As somebody who cycles regularly there is a lot of well-being that I can benefit from.  The more people who cycle, the less congestion we will have.  We are all interconnected on the roads and we are all trying to get away from that hostility between road users.</p> <p>  I will mention briefly schools, teenage girls and cycling.  Green Schools have done some very interesting research into this that the committee may have seen.  The name of the campaign is #andshecycles.  It carried out focus groups with teenage girls.  This is a very important aspect of looking at mobility in our country and asking what people are saying and experiencing by listening to the people who are directly affected.</p> <p>  Two main issues rose from teenage girls.  One was that cycling was not cool.  I do not think anybody around this room will be able to address that because we are not cool.  The second thing mentioned by teenage girls is of absolute concern to all of us, which is verbal harassment by boys and men.  There is a targeting of teenage girls which is part of this whole hostility and context within which quite an amount of harassment, violence and disputes are occurring.  We have the responsibility to create an environment where teenage girls feel comfortable cycling and can experience that independence.  Women and cycling have always been interconnected, with this idea of emancipation embodied by the suffragettes who took to their bikes.  Women can really benefit and have the right to benefit from cycling.  We should be able to cycle free of harassment.  It is of particular concern that teenage girls were feeling the brunt of this and are avoiding cycling.  This is a rational choice for a teenage girl.</p></speech>

That means that there is less space for people who want to cycle.  It also means that we are facing challenges in a general context.  One sees that parking is happening left, right, and centre in lanes that are supposed to be allocated for people who cycle, which means that we have to veer out into the path of buses, other cars, and drivers.  Impunity is a massive issue.   We have talked about 98% of drivers who were speeding in 30 km/h areas and about impunity on the roads.  The enforcement has to happen, not just so that more people can cycle, but so that more people do not lose their lives.  That is what we have come here to talk about.  That is not a minor issue, it is a major one.</p> <p>  It is something that I BIKE Dublin has done a huge amount of work to address and to highlight.  We need to support more of this and need An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take it much more seriously.</p></speech>

In particular,  we note the point made by Ms Williams about young teenage girls, and females generically, being abused, which is absolutely unacceptable.</p> <p>  In reply to my earlier question, Ms Williams stated that this does not happen in other countries.

One in four children in Ireland is either obese or overweight, and some six out of ten adults.  This is building up a huge long-term public health problem which will express itself in the public health system in the decades to come.  These are not separate realms.  Public health is intimately intertwined with our transportation policy and that is not really recognised in how funding is allocated at the moment.</p></speech>

I remember a cycling campaigner called Mike Curtis who died on Merrion Square 30 years ago.  It was one of the reasons that the Dublin Cycling Campaign was founded.  I knew Harry Boland and his family; Harry died in Stillorgan last year.  I met the colleagues of Neeraj Jain last week and his family.  Both his and the Boland family and their communities were completely devastated.  Ms Williams is correct to highlight this issue.  As the Chairman has said, our cycling population has a modal split by about 3% nationally, but it is accounting for three times that figure in the number of road deaths.</p></speech>

As Dr. &Oacute; Tuama has said, that latest health survey today shows that 60% of people are obese.  Cycling-active travel every day is the best way of tackling that issue.  As Mayer Hillman the great UK doctor and every analysis has shown, even with the high incidence of accidents, the reality is one will live longer if one cycles.</p><p>The truth is that our conditions for cyclists are atrocious.  Those who came here for the Velo-City conference could not believe people cycle in this city.  It is scandalous that we have not addressed the issue.</p><p> To answer Deputy MacSharry's question on behaviour, there is a general level of abuse.  Women in particular perhaps are sensitive to it but there is a general level of abuse against cyclists at present and it has escalated in the past two or three years.  For some reason it is online and it needs to stop.</p><p> The issue regarding cyclists being lit up has radically changed in the past 20 or 30 years.  The cycling campaign did a survey in the mid-1990s through the UCD marketing and development programme that showed a very high percentage of cyclists did not have lights on their bikes.  I do my own survey because it is important that we light up and I believe it is now much higher.  I believe it would be close to 80% or 90% of cyclists.  It should be 100%.  It has radically improved partly because the lights are cheaper and better and LED technology has improved.</p><p> Cycling behaviour is improving.  In this city as the number cycling increases, I notice we are starting to self-police.  When cyclists come to traffic lights they stop.  We will solve the issue of behaviour by creating sane traffic and transport infrastructure.  I hope that at the same time we address the issue that 98% of motorists are breaking the 30 km speed limit throughout the country every day on every road.  The figure for those breaking the 50 km speed limit is 80%.  Speed kills.  We need to stop this cyclist versus motorist argument.  Someone here told us about seeing four cyclists cycling abreast in Mayo.  Big groups of people cycling overtake each other and we might occasionally have this as a rare occurrence.  Cars also overtake each other.  Two cars passing is the equivalent of four cyclists abreast.  I do not go bananas about it.</p></speech>

We have had reports, studies and analysis, and we have all gone off to Utrecht and looked at best practice, but yet we have singularly failed to make a change.  We have bits and pieces.  We have green flags at every school but the number of people cycling to school in particular has gone into freefall.  There seems to be a correlation between having more green flags and a drop in the number of schoolchildren cycling.  There are green flags for transport.  We are all flags but no substance.</p> <p>  There is a budget issue but it cannot just be that.  What is it that is stopping us making the radical change?  What is behind the disregard for this issue?  Many of the witnesses have been campaigning for years.  In their opinion, what is the biggest obstacle?  We have &euro;250 million for widening a road between Westport and Castlebar.  That amount would sort every school in Galway and Mayo with safe routes to school.  It would transform the county if we were to put it into active walking and cycling.  Why is it that we keep putting &euro;250 million into road widening?  As Mr. Ferrie said, that makes for more and more cars.  It is a never-ending car-based system.  What is behind that?  What needs to change?  It is not the technical knowledge because we know what we have to do to make roads safe.  What is stopping us from doing it?</p></speech>

There is still a large number of people who do not believe that cycling can be a large part of the transport solution throughout Ireland, which it absolutely can be.  We only need to look at other countries to see the potential of cycling and the benefits it can bring.  This is definitely one of the issues.  With regard to delivering projects, the Royal Canal project received planning permission in late 2015 but most of it has not started construction.  The delays include staff being removed from the project to work on the Luas cross city, getting a licence from Irish Rail, getting a licence from Waterways Ireland because it owns the canal route, and removing Japanese knotweed and drug paraphernalia.  Then we had to redesign the bridge over the Irish Rail line because it might need to be double tracked as part of DART expansion.  In these tight urban areas sometimes these projects can be very complicated.  At the same time, we are constantly chasing the National Transport Authority and Dublin City Council to keep these projects moving.  I honestly believe that if we were not doing this, the projects would not be anywhere near as far along as they are, even though many of them are still nowhere.</p></speech>

We upgraded the Grand Canal and it still has problems.  The junction at Leeson Street is a mess.  It was a good piece of infrastructure.  Instantaneously, the volume of cyclists increased by 50%.</p></speech>

It is getting to that stage where there might be almost as many people cycling as there are on the buses.  How come people do not see the benefits?  When I am at the bridge in Rathmines there are 20 cyclists where one car would fit.  Perhaps not.  Perhaps there are a dozen or 15.  With regard to the use of space, who cannot see the benefit of this for transport planning?  Who does not understand this could make Dublin like Copenhagen or Amsterdam?  How come this is not clear?</p></speech>

The responsibility is fragmented.  It is very difficult to find out who is responsible for particular things.  When we have such fragmentation, one group holds up another, perhaps not deliberately but because they have different priorities and plans.  We are not getting the leadership we need from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on this.  Perhaps Dublin needs a transport czar or someone who takes overall responsibility for this.  Money is being spent in Dublin city on resurfacing roads and the roads are being repainted with the same substandard cycling infrastructure there was before the roads were resurfaced.  This does not make any sense to me.  If there was joined-up thinking between the National Transport Authority and Dublin City Council, this would not happen.  We would get the benefits of improved cycling infrastructure when we are improving the surface of the road.  For me, the key issues are the fragmented nature of the system, the lack of communication, the varying priorities of the various groups, and the lack of political leadership.</p></speech>

By transport czar I mean someone with an overview and authority.  Perhaps it needs to come from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I do not know.  There needs to be leadership that brings these competing groups together.  We cannot have a situation where the National Transport Authority, which is doing great work with BusConnects, is on a different track even within its own organisation.  It prepared the greater Dublin area cycle network plan and then it prepared BusConnects, and there are complete discrepancies between the two.  One does not follow the other.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking generally throughout the delivery of this infrastructure, which needs to be resolved.</p></speech>

Each of the political parties needs to be pushing cycling to the core of national and local policy, but the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has special responsibility to show leadership.</p></speech>

That is notwithstanding the criticisms Dr. &Oacute; Tuama has and is perfectly entitled to make.  I suggest it is important that there be some interaction on joined-up thinking in this area.</p></speech>

I welcome everybody and apologise for being late.  I am new to my role as Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on transport.  I know Mr. Ferrie via Twitter, but I have not met the rest of the witnesses yet.  Our policy on transport has not changed despite the change of personnel.  The witnesses will be familiar with the policy and that will continue to be pliable, to the extent that the witnesses or the wider cycling lobby might have views on issues that concern us.  I start my contribution by stating I have the utmost respect for Deputy Eamon Ryan and his party's long-standing research on climate change and sustainable solutions.  When it comes to a road, however, we could strip out the entire HSE budget, dedicate it all to sustainable transport and the country's problems would be solved overnight.</p> <p>  It is not realistic, however, even from the leafy suburbs of Ranelagh and south Dublin, to state that we should not build certain roads.  There are infrastructure deficits all over the country and any Government, of whatever type, will have to be conscious and mindful of that reality, whether that Government is led by Taoiseach Ryan, O'Dowd, Catherine Murphy or whomever.  We will always have competing priorities.  It is a matter of getting cycling a higher priority within the agenda, as opposed to not building a certain road for &euro;100 million or &euro;250 million.  If it were that simple, that would have been done when Deputy Eamon Ryan was a Minister.  He knows better than anybody, however, that the cake is only so big and every Minister in every Department will always want all of it for themselves, if they could get away with it.  Things do not work like that, unfortunately.</p> <p>  Regarding the concept of a transport czar, Mr. Ferrie referred to 30 agencies being responsible for transport in Dublin alone.  How would it be possible to get anything done?  Whether we refer to a czar, a chancellor, an emperor or a Taoiseach, however, the truth is that we already have one, namely, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Sadly, what we also have is drift.  The Government is no longer acting as the Executive in the area of transport.  I am not being political in stating that because this drift goes back to when we were in Government ourselves and back into the 1980s.  Governments are now expensive commentators.  References are made to a matters being for Dublin City Council, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the NTA and-or Dublin Bus.  These are regarded as matters for everybody but us and there is no leadership.  The attitude is that we are not experts and that therefore we will be guided by the expertise.  This ensures that we get to kick something down the road for so long for review and examination that the initial data will be out of date by the time it comes to a conclusion and we will get to review it again.  Within that whole process, we have plausible deniability and are able to defer any budget expenditure.  That is greatly frustrating.</p> <p>  We are striving for the 10%, but where is it in this year's budget?  I mean no disrespect to the Senator I am about to quote, but Senator Lombard, in a press release after the budget, stated that &euro;114 million was going to be spent on cycling infrastructure this year, including the greenway and two urban programmes, the smarter and active travel initiatives, etc.  Do the witnesses have a view on that claim?  Looking at 2018, research from the organisations represented here showed we had spent about 32.26% of funds on the sustainable transport capital side, within the land transport capital budget.  If that breakdown was applied to this year, then the total budget for land transport capital spending is &euro;1.82 billion, 32.26% of that is about &euro;587 million on the sustainable side of the equation and 3%, which was the percentage we got in 2018, is &euro;17 million.  If we add the greenways into that figure, which is as much tourism as it is transport, we max out at about &euro;41 million.  That is 2.25% of the total budget and that means we are going in reverse.  I am interested in hearing the witnesses' opinion on that situation.  Later, I will be asking the representatives from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the NTA to clarify how they categorise funding spent on cycling.</p> <p>  I turn now to integrating cycling into our public transport system.  We all know the system is creaking at the seams and it is impossible to get a person on to it, never mind a bike.  Where are we on addressing that issue from the perspective of the cycling organisations?  If I want to cycle around Ireland, that involves a tourism aspect.  Let us take the case, as well, where I want to commute into Dublin from Mullingar and bring my bike so that when I get to Connolly Station, I can cycle from there to St. Stephen's Green, for example.  How are we measuring up in that context?  That aspect leads us into parking and related issues at public transport hubs.  Those are my comments and questions and I would like the witnesses to address them.</p></speech>

It is exceptionally important work.  Along with Deputy Eamon Ryan, Cyclist.ie, the Dublin Cycling Campaign and I BIKE Dublin have been banging this drum for many years and, hopefully, they are now being listened to at last.  Deputy MacSharry did not intend his comment to be taken this way, but when a contribution on a subject like cycling is prefaced by stating that this might matter in the leafy suburbs of Ranelagh but that we also have to worry about roads infrastructure across the country, then I am obliged to point out that cycling matters to every community.</p> <p>  We have to move on from portraying the perception that this is a transport solution only serving the needs of a minority.  That is not the case.  Cycling has the potential to transform the way we move people around all of our cities and towns, as well as rural Ireland.  Coming in along the canal from the direction of Fairview and Clontarf, as I do from time to time, there is extraordinary infrastructure in place.  There is also poor, but not terrible, infrastructure along the N11 into the city.  If we consider the overall situation, we can see that the beginning of something special is under way.</p> <p>  Mr. Baker referred to CSO data.  In Dublin and the greater Dublin area, GDA, more people cycle to work and study every morning than use the Dart, Luas and commuter rail combined.  That is an extraordinary community of people who have chosen to use their bike as their main method of transport to get to and from work and-or study because it makes sense.  It is a quicker, healthier and more sustainable method of transport.</p> <p>  The Chairman is right to raise the issue of BusConnects.  That is an opportunity being presented to us right now.  We cannot allow the dumbing down of that initiative or for priority to continue to be given to travel by car, mostly with single occupancy.  That is a mode of transport that is completely unsustainable, not remotely healthy and possibly the slowest way to get around this city.</p> <p>  I hope we can somehow galvanise the support of the cycling community here in Dublin and increasingly similar communities in places like Galway, where we have the example of the great work of the Galway cycle-bus.</p><p>That shows what is possible when children as young as five or six years of age are offered an opportunity to cycle to school safely.  That is, thankfully, being replicated in some other cities nationally.</p><p> There is something very special waiting to happen here.  It is about leadership and all of us who are Members of the Oireachtas and who recognise the value of what can happen here need to work together on this.  I know that Senator Bacik worked hard last year and there is now a small group of people who are committed to working towards safer cycling infrastructure for all.  We need to expand that group.</p><p> I thank Deputy MacSharry and, indeed, his predecessor as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson in this area, Deputy Troy, for the excellent work they have done in producing a comprehensive cycling policy, something that Fine Gael has not done.  We need to move to a point where we begin to develop a very strong consensus across the whole of the Oireachtas about what is possible and not lose sight of the potential that exists for a healthier, more sustainable, more efficient and quicker way of moving people around our towns and cities.</p><p> However, this is not limited to towns and cities.  There are people who approach the edge of Galway city every morning in their cars and come to a complete halt.  It is then taking somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour to travel the 4 km to 5 km to their places of work.  I know that Galway City Council is working on a new transport strategy for the city and it tells me that new cycling infrastructure is an intrinsic part of that strategy.  I hope that is the case and that the council is not dissuaded from that ambition.</p><p> This is an opportunity waiting to happen across the whole country and we should work towards it, not become disillusioned, and work to support these extraordinary people who have been pointing out to us the benefits of this for many years.  I thank our guests for coming in.</p></speech>

We will want to hear from them afterwards if they do not get to say everything they want to now.  The National Transport Authority and the Department is to link through someone they nominate to set up regular meetings urgently.  That name should be communicated to the clerk to the committee afterwards.  That will be a one-stop shop, as far as we are concerned, in getting action and change.</p></speech>

There are three ways that cycling and public transport can connect, but I will first talk about why it is important.  Cycling is great for local trips but there is obviously a limit to the distance one can get a bike and an e-bike pushes that limit further.  For many people, connecting a bike onto public transport is a fantastic way of travelling.  It has many of the benefits of a car, in that it can go from point to point, but with the speed benefits of cycling and the distance benefits of public transport.</p> <p>  Taking a bike on the train is still very difficult on Irish Rail because many intercity trains do not have enough space on them to take bikes.  We hear of many people who are trying to get to the Waterford greenway or the Westport greenway from Dublin and who want to take their bikes on the train, but it always proves impossible because it is booked out and oversubscribed.</p> <p>  Allowing bikes on trains in tight urban areas is probably not something we want to pursue too far because our public transport is creaking at the seams and there is not really space for bikes on commuter and DART trains.  In urban areas, we should be looking at high-quality bike parking at public transport hubs so one can cycle to the bus or train station and continue one's journey on the bus or train.  Bike sharing is also an option, such as the dublinbikes scheme and the bike systems in Cork and Limerick.  Those allow people to share bikes at the other end of their journeys.</p> <p>  There will be opportunities in the many upcoming public transport infrastructure projects to ensure good cycling integration.  MetroLink is a prime example.  It will be a fantastic metro system if we build it in 2027 and it will be an opportunity, particularly in the Swords area, for people to cycle to the metro stations and then continue into town.  The metro will only serve about half of Swords but it will only be a ten-minute cycle from the other side of Swords to the metro station.  It is an ideal connection if we put in enough high-quality bike parking.  We see this working in Dublin.</p> <p>  Many people in the Ballinteer area cycle to the Luas station in Dundrum to get into town because they do not have a good bus route and are about a 30-minute walk from the Luas.  It is a five or ten-minute cycle down the hill and there is good, segregated cycling infrastructure.  We cannot get D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to put in enough bike parking at that station.  Every time more bike parking is put in, it fills up within a month or two.</p></speech>

The &euro;114 million that Government spokespersons talk about is for cycling, walking and sustainable transport.  We came up with roughly the same figure.  In fact, our figure was slightly more than Deputy MacSharry's but we will not argue about it.</p></speech>

It still comes out at only 2.5% of spending on transport.  We need to know how much is going to be spent on cycling and we need to see that figure moving very quickly.  Edinburgh committed to increasing its allocation for cycling by 1% every year.  We need to see our spending figure analysed and pushed up fast.</p></speech>

Leadership and joined-up thinking are missing and everybody has made that comment.  We also need to normalise cycling, and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, has been brilliant at that.  Cycling is a normal way of getting around.  I BIKE Dublin invited a Senator out on a cycle and it was a powerful experience of empathy with cyclists and understanding the experiences of cyclists for that Senator.  We would love to invite more people out for a gentle cycle one day.</p></speech>

It is important that everybody talks about how normal it is.  Perhaps we can water down some of the "us" and "them" bun fights and talk about how we can build a better city, tackle congestion and improve public health.  That is an important part of it.  Deputy Catherine Murphy is also welcome on such a cycle.  It can be low key or we can invite other people to come along, whatever suits, and makes people feel comfortable.  If it is a tentative and short cycle, that is great, and if it is a longer one, that is brilliant.  We should support communities to go out and cycle and allow more people to experience the freedom and independence of cycling.  Teenagers can experience the autonomy that is so important at that age.  The more we do that, the more we will be able to dismantle some of the hostility, and perhaps leadership will flow from that, with the support of committee members.</p></speech>

I stopped at the side of the road just to watch groups of teenagers cycling together.  I have not seen that since I was a teenager.  They knew that it was a safe place to be.  We talk about mental health issues and social isolation among our teenagers, and there is no better way to make friends and sustain friendships than going on a bike ride together.  Seeing gaggles of teenagers chatting away to one another time after time on that greenway was really special.  There is no reason that could not be replicated every morning on the way to most schools in this country.</p></speech>

In response to Deputy MacSharry, I mentioned in my opening statement about the amount of money that is being spent on roads, and that was not to say that we want some of that money, although it would be great if we could get it.  I was emphasising the difference in cost of putting in cycling infrastructure.  The European Cycling Federation has recently done a study that shows that constructing and maintaining one mile of infrastructure for motorised traffic costs 240 times more than high-quality bike lanes.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, there are considerable returns on investments in cycle lanes.  Looking at the cost-benefit analysis, capital outlay and return on investment is important in assessing and allocating funding for transport and particularly for capital projects.</p><p> To follow on from what Ms Williams was saying, Mr. Downey, I, and our colleague, Ms Lucille Redmond, who is in the Public Gallery, accompanied Senator Craughwell on a cycle around Dublin city on Monday afternoon.  The Senator was quite critical of cyclists on Twitter last week and somebody challenged him to get on a bike himself.  He had not cycled in more than 50 years.  He told us that the last time he rode a bike was in 1968 and that he had not cycled since he left Galway.  In fairness to him, he accepted the challenge.  He rented a bike and we cycled around.  We saw some of the good and some of the bad of Dublin's cycling infrastructure and he got to experience at first hand what it is like.  I invite members to watch the video report Newstalk made in which the Senator talks about how he now has a very different understanding of what it is like to cycle in Dublin.  He said that it has changed the way he drives in Dublin and that he now realises that, when he is driving, he is in charge of a dangerous weapon.  He also realises how that can feel for people cycling alongside him.  I reiterate what Ms Williams said.  We would be very happy to invite any or all members of the committee to come on a cycle around the city.</p></speech>

Absolutely.  It will probably be after Christmas, if that is okay.  He can communicate with the committee secretariat.  I thank all the witnesses very much.  It has been very useful.  The joint committee will now suspend until 11.50 a.m., when we will have a session with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority.

It is my fault.  We listened to everybody in the last session and ensured we heard them all.  I appreciate that we ate into the time that had been given for this session's witnesses, who are very welcome.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones completely, please, as they interfere with the recording equipment.</p><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na finn&eacute;ithe nua at&aacute; againn.  From the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport we have Ms Deirdre Hanlon, assistant secretary; Mr. Ray O&rsquo;Leary, assistant secretary; Mr. Garret Doocey, principal officer; and Ms Lorraine McGurk, assistant principal officer.  We also have from the National Transport Authority, NTA, Ms Anne Graham, CEO and Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO.</p><p>Before we commence, I have to read a statutory notice, which I am sure the witnesses have heard many times before.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that we have to leave the room by 1.15 p.m.  That is our deadline for leaving.  I apologise again to our witnesses for the delay.</p><p>Before we start, when we had representatives of the different cycling bodies here, I said that I would ask both the Department and the NTA to arrange to meet regularly the people we have named here to discuss the issues that arise.  Their bodies are genuine and they have a lot of experience and some very good ideas.  They also have significant concerns and criticisms.  We would like to establish a formal forum where the State agencies can meet representatives of these bodies to listen to their views and, if at all possible, implement them.  I take it that it will be in order to do that.  I see the witnesses nodding their heads.</p></speech>

I understand that the committee wishes to focus on the road traffic (traffic and parking) (amendment) regulations 2019 and national cycling policy.  To assist me in dealing with members' subsequent questions I am joined by Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO with the authority.</p> <p>  In terms of national cycling policy, the role of the NTA is to plan and deliver cycling infrastructure in accordance with national policy developed by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The NTA has developed cycling infrastructure plans for the greater Dublin area on a statutory basis and for the regional cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford on a non-statutory basis.  These plans are used to direct the investment in cycling infrastructure which will facilitate the development of a network of safe cycling facilities in those cities.  The authority allocates the funding provided by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to local authorities to deliver this infrastructure.  </p> <p>  A key objective of the NTA is to increase the delivery rate of cycling infrastructure.  Accordingly, the authority has put in place a dedicated cycle office to bring a number of projects forward for planning and construction.  This is in addition to the projects that the local authorities are developing with the assistance of the NTA.  </p> <p>  BusConnects Dublin is the largest cycling infrastructure project ever designed in the state.  This project will deliver 200 km of segregated cycling infrastructure on the key radials into the city.  BusConnects in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford will see similar ambitious cycling plans included.  The authority has developed a cycle design manual which sets the design standard for cycling infrastructure to be designed for our cities and towns and will ensure that there is a consistent approach to designs.  That concludes my statement and I and my colleague will be happy to respond to any questions the committee may have. </p></speech>

Reflecting those areas of the committee&rsquo;s interest, the Department is represented by the road safety and active travel areas of our remit.  I am joined by colleagues who deal with the road safety brief in the Department, Mr. Ray O&rsquo;Leary, assistant secretary, and Ms Lorraine McGurk, assistant principal officer, and by Mr. Garret Doocey, my colleague in my sectoral area which includes active travel policy and investment.  The NTA has also joined us.</p> <p>  The Committee is aware of the road traffic (traffic and parking) (amendment) regulations 2019 that came into effect last week on 12 November 2019.  These new regulations signed by the Minister build on previous legislation regarding dangerous overtaking.  Specifically, they separate out the offence of dangerous overtaking of a pedal cyclist from the general dangerous overtaking provisions in the legislation.  They also increase the fixed charge that can apply to this new offence.</p> <p>  We are aware that a number of groups, such as cycling advocacy groups, had previously expressed a preference for a different approach, namely, that a minimum passing distance be enshrined in law, specifically 1 m on roads with speed limits of up to 50 km and 1.5 m on roads where the speed limits are higher than 50 km.  However, when we engaged with the Office of the Attorney General about the practicality of such legislation it had serious concerns about the enforceability of such an approach.</p> <p>  As a result, the Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the RSA, came up with an alternative approach that would be workable and legally robust, and that is the legislation that commenced last week.  The regulation specifically targets drivers who put cyclists at risk.  </p> <p>  Over the past number of months and weeks the RSA has run advertising campaigns across various media to make drivers aware of the new legislation and the importance of passing at a safe distance.  New warning signs have also been prepared and have been included in the recently updated traffic signs manual.  The first of these new signs was installed last week in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area and many more are set to be erected by local authorities throughout the country.  Both these signs and the current advertising campaign will act as a reminder to drivers to only overtake a cyclist where it is safe to do so.</p> <p>  Of course, road safety legislation is only one aspect of Government policy and intervention that impacts on cycling in Ireland.  The overall policy stance and funding for cycling are also important considerations for this area of activity.  At a policy level, the Minister and the Department are committed to supporting and encouraging more sustainable forms of travel.  This is central to our approach to climate action and to helping to achieve a better quality of life and more liveable cities for people.  </p> <p>  We want to facilitate more people being able to us more sustainable travel modes for more of their journeys .  Active travel, a term that encompasses cycling and walking as a means of transport, is obviously a critical component of this approach.  At a policy level our objective is to encourage walking and cycling.  We recognise that both of the active modes have a strong role to play, either as a primary mode of transport themselves or very often as a complement to other sustainable modes.</p> <p>  We expect that the committee is interested in two key areas, namely, what are we doing on funding and what our overall approach on policy is.  On Exchequer support for infrastructure, on the funding front considerable progress has been made in the last two or three years in identifying and securing additional enhanced Exchequer funding that can support cycling and other sustainable forms of travel.  </p> <p>  Under the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 plan, the type of multiannual funding we need to allow the delivery of infrastructure is now being provided.  In the earlier years of this decade, we were able to fund the development of cycle network plans so these plans now exist for all the cities.  Since the last two budgets, we now have substantial step-up in funding that will enable the planned investments to be undertaken.  For example, next year alone there is some &euro;100 million to invest across the Department&rsquo;s two principal programmes that support active travel.</p> <p>  Our focus now needs to be on ensuring delivery and good use of the substantial funds we are receiving from the taxpayer.  A challenge for us is to ensure a sufficient pipeline of projects is moving forward and brought successfully through the planning system, and is ready to absorb the increased level of funding available now and into the future  The NTA's new cycling office will help us to ensure that, between the NTA and the various local authorities involved, the ambitious projects for expanding and enhancing urban cycle networks will progress and get delivered.</p> <p>  The committee will also be aware that funding has is available from Government for the development of greenways, predominately across more rural areas of the country.  Of course, the purpose of the Government&rsquo;s investment under the greenways programme is somewhat different.  It is less centred on commuting and sustainable travel and more focused on providing joint cycling and walking infrastructure that provides a local amenity and an attractive tourism product.</p><p>The committee will be aware that the Department has been working on a review of public transport and active travel policy over the past while.  In the past week, the Minister opened a public consultation on these topics.  As part of this, he published a range of background information papers and analyses prepared by the Department to support a well-informed public conversation.  Among these is a specific paper on active travel which is helping us in this area.  The public consultation seeks the views of transport stakeholders, public representatives and the general public on what is important in public transport and active travel policy, what we have got right, where we need to improve and how we should we prioritise.</p><p> This is the first formal review of our policy in over a decade.  As part of this work, we have used the occasion to look back at two documents we published in 2009 - the National Cycle Policy Framework 2009-2020, and Smarter Travel: A Sustainable Transport Future &ndash; to see how we have progressed.  Of course, 2009 is memorable for other reasons, principally the global financial and economic crises.  The grave fiscal position that Ireland needed to address in the years thereafter meant that we did not receive the level of investment that had been anticipated when the policies were initially drawn up.  Obviously, this affected our capacity to deliver the various actions and measures.  The position has changed and there has been a substantial stepping up of funding.</p><p> A decade on from our last policy statement, we want to concentrate now on shaping our path ahead.  What do we want to achieve with policy in this area?  Do we need to refresh our priorities?  How can our experience inform our future approach?  What can we learn from other places?  The Minister&rsquo;s consultation will run until late January.  We are engaging with stakeholders during this period with a view to stimulating discussions on what is the first review of Ireland&rsquo;s sustainable mobility policy in ten years.</p><p> We hope this opening statement is a helpful introduction to today&rsquo;s discussion and that we can be of assistance to the committee in its consideration of cycling policy and cycling safety.</p></speech>

The biggest issue arising from the earlier session earlier was the issue of establishing a national cycling office, which would not necessarily be located in the National Transport Authority because its statutory remit extends only to Dublin city and surrounding areas.  This new office should drive the agenda for change and investment and push cycling as a policy issue with all the other parties nationally and regionally.  I will ask the witnesses to address that point when they respond.</p> <p>  On the consultation, representatives of a number of cycling campaigns appeared before the committee this morning.  Ms Hanlon stated the Department is committed to meeting stakeholders.  How does the Department identify stakeholders?  Who will they be?</p></speech>

We are looking at sustainable transport, of which there are various types, and then more detailed aspects such as cycling and active travel.  The stakeholders on the State side are easy to identify.  We know the various bodies and have strong contacts with them.  We have built up fairly strong relations with several stakeholder bodies.  Through the NTA and local authorities, there is a familiarity with the groups that represent different interests in this area.  About a year and a half ago, the Minister hosted an event in the Mansion House which was attended by a number of groups and to which several cycling groups were also invited.  They are also invited to attend another engagement tomorrow, a technical workshop event which will examine the detail of some issues.  We notice that groups involved in cycling are easier to identify because they make themselves known, feature in the media and appear before Oireachtas committees.  Our interest is in promoting, encouraging and facilitating active travel, which is cycling and walking.  It is harder to identify groups that represent the public interest in the area of walking.  We endeavour to make up for that by seeking the views of various parties that have expressed views in this area and wish to engage in public consultations.  We advertise the public consultation widely.  It only opened about seven days ago so we have not yet been inundated.  However, we expect to see a flow of submissions coming in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I have the greatest respect for the work the NTA does.  The issue is not so much with the design because we accept that this has to be done by professionals and qualified persons who are able to do the job.  The issue for the cycling representatives we met today is one of policy and who drives policy nationally.  It should not be the function of the NTA.  While it is appropriate and proper that the office reside within the NTA, the key point being made this morning was that it must push the boundaries.  It must determine where to get more money and where to spend it and identify what people want.  Operating that agenda is entirely separate from what the NTA is doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-20a.641" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Hanlon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019112000002#S03300"><p>I will expand on that and assist Deputy MacSharry in the discussion on this point.  The policy is driven and made at Department level.  The NTA is an important player in this and it works at the level of strategy, technical design and interaction with the local authorities around delivery.  At the policy level in the Department, the Minister has looked for us to put an increasing focus on this in the past couple of years.  The funding he has secured for it has stepped up in recent years.  We are looking at how to align the funding available now and in the future, which is unlike the levels of funding available five or ten years ago, with getting projects delivered.  The delivery of infrastructure has been identified by everybody, including the cycling groups the committee and the Department have met, as a key and critical feature that needs to be delivered, alongside some other features which I will address in a moment.  Our emphasis at policy level has been on ensuring the NTA is in contact with the local authorities to get them to develop the plans they need to develop.  That has been done and now it is about getting the projects through, having them technically designed and providing the assistance the local authorities need to do that.  It is also about getting the projects through the planning process.  There has been difficulty in some local authorities with achieving progress in the planning process for cycling schemes.  Decisions have to be made on the allocation of road space between cycling and other forms of transport.  Some local authorities have experienced difficulty with elected members coming to a view on what is the appropriate way forward and on what they can agree to.  We have place much emphasis on that thus far.</p> <p>  The Department also has a strong understanding that road safety policy and legislation, which are areas on which the Department leads and works closely with the Road Safety Authority, are critically important to cyclists and other people using the roads and footpaths.  A number of measures have been progressed in the past while, including some by the Department and Minister, for example, the regulations we are discussing today.  Others have been progressed with agencies such as the Road Safety Authority, which is doing the advertising campaign that is needed on the soft side to complement the hard legislative measure and get the message and understanding across.</p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan briefly mentioned the normalisation of cycling.  That is one of the critical things we are trying to achieve in the Department.  We have a policy around behavioural measures.  We have brought in a scheme of training in cycling that is being developed and rolled out in conjunction with cycling groups.  Predominantly funded by the Department, it teaches children at an appropriate age about cycling and moving safely on the roads and about the things they need to be aware of.  That has just started.  We have been able to do that in the past couple of years and we are expanding and rolling it out further.  We now want to evaluate it and look at rolling it out further for training older children and adults.</p></speech>

We basically have a structured design team within the NTA.  That is not what I understood the office to be.  It is specific to infrastructure.  Ms Hanlon mentioned all the good things taking place in education, challenging stigma and normalising cycling, to which Deputy Eamon Ryan referred.  That is all great but people are interested in the delivery of infrastructure.  I will move on because other members want to contribute.</p><p>On the money that is available, Ms Hanlon mentioned a sum of &euro;100 million for active travel.  Senator Lombard, in a press release after the budget, stated &euro;114 million had been made available for cycling through funding for greenways.  As we heard earlier, <i>Cycling.ie</i>has done an analysis showing that in 2018 the budget for cycling would be about 3% of the transport budget.</p><p>If we note the percentages from the total land transport budget for 2020, the amount is &euro;1.82 billion.  In the past, subheading B8 was for sustainable transport, and approximately 32.26% of that budget in previous years was allocated to it.  That would put the figure at approximately &euro;587 million, which would mean approximately &euro;17.62 million would come towards this area.  If we add to that the &euro;23 million for greenways, that adds up to approximately &euro;41 million.  Other figures have been given that would bring it closer to &euro;50 million, which is less than 3% and closer to 2.25% or 2.5% of the budget.  How does Ms Hanlon categorise expenditure on cycling and what are the real figures?  We have Senator Lombard's figure of &euro;114 million and Ms. Hanlon's figure of &euro;100 million in terms of active travel.  However, taking account of the figure from Cycling.ie, from what we heard from our guests earlier this morning and my calculations, the figure is somewhere between &euro;40 million and &euro;50 million, including greenways, which are as much to do with tourism as transport.</p></speech>

If we consider 2018, the spend the Department supported under the two principal programmes was approximately &euro;37 million.  The allocation under those programmes for 2019 is &euro;48 million.  The allocation for them for 2020 is &euro;100 million, which is a considerable step up.  We need to ensure when spending taxpayers' money that the projects are in place, ready to absorb it and that we can get them done.  That does not include the money being spent on greenways.  Money is allocated for greenways in addition to that.  The allocation for greenways next year is &euro;23 million.</p></speech>

We examined the greenways programme a few years ago, which is on the travel and transport side.  While it comprises cycling and walking infrastructure, its focus is not on transport as such.  It is not about getting somebody from one place to another.  People are not travelling on them with that type of purpose, as if they were commuting.  It is about having a local amenity for communities and a good strong tourism product for certain rural areas.  It is led on the tourism side but that does not mean it is divorced from what we are doing with respect to cycling.  We have a connection with them.  We deal with issues of common and mutual interest and topicality and we keep in touch with what is happening.</p></speech>

There is a benefit from greenways for walkers and cyclists.  The allocation for it is &euro;23 million and nobody is arguing with that.

I take issue with the idea that footpaths and cycleways are more or less the same piece of infrastructure.  While in some cases they are, in others they certainly are not.  As I noted earlier, where new housing estates are developed, they will typically include cycling infrastructure, but there will be permeability and the route will pass through a housing estate that does not have it.  That causes an immediate conflict because it has not been provided for.  We are not building a network but rather increments that might lead to a network over time.  There is great frustration when someone intends to cycle somewhere but experiences a range of obstacles.  The public, in many ways, are leading from the front, given the growing number of people who cycle.  Nevertheless, we will never normalise it unless a safe environment and network are provided for them to cycle, and we will not encourage people to take up cycling.  I refer in particular to certain groups who have been highlighted, such as women.</p> <p>  The question is how to develop the network.  The issue of institutional arrangements was raised, and there is a question as to whether they are an inhibitor, which is why the views of the cycling office at the Department, in particular, are being sought.  There are some matters I do not understand and would like to clear up.  Ms Graham spoke about the statutory basis in the greater Dublin area.  What does that include?  My notion of the greater Dublin area might be wider.  Does she mean the city and county of Dublin?</p></speech>

Some of that will be inevitable because there are various local authorities and approaches, but is an attempt to reach a logical institutional arrangement, where there is one point of engagement on both policy and delivery, likely to rest with the NTA or will it be combined with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport?</p></speech>

That the NTA is in place means it breaks down some of the barriers, not least in respect of cycle routes that cross local authority boundaries.  One of the strengths in the cycle design office we have put in place is that it can work across those boundaries, which should ease the bringing forward of plans for construction.</p></speech>

I understand the kinds of conflict there may be, such as where shops may lose parking space in the street because it will be turned into a cycleway.  Such conflict will remain until demand increases and people see the success and change, which will be beneficial for other areas.  Is there an exemplar network anywhere in the country?

We agree that a number of cycle projects have been initiated throughout the region but they have not been joined up, which is why we wanted to put in place a plan - a network - to show we needed to join up all the bits of infrastructure in the region and to provide those connections.  The Sutton-Sandycove route is a prime example of where we are trying to build one major route but it is being delivered in sections.  A number of exemplars, in respect of the infrastructure put in place in recent years, are segregated cycle infrastructure.  Braemor Road in Churchtown is one example.  The design manual is in place to be able to have consistency in designs and to ensure there will be the best cycling infrastructure in our cities and towns.</p></speech>

I recall seeing at a train station in another country a ramp at the side of steps to allow people to wheel up and down bicycles.  There are other basic measures such as facilities for storing baggage.  What engagement has there been?  Is there dedicated money for such infrastructure?  I acknowledge there is a capacity issue on trains and buses but that will sort itself out over time.  Is the design of such infrastructure automatically a central feature when dealing, for example, with the procurement of new carriages or where a train station is to be upgraded?</p></speech>

In my area, I am familiar with those on the two canals.  I accept that it is not a straight route all the way and that there are pinch points but it is taking an incredible length of time.  What are the impediments in that regard?  For example, is it a matter of finance or design?</p></speech>

For one of the schemes on which we are working, at the Royal Canal, the budget is in the multiple millions of euro.  It is not a small-scale scheme.  The funding is now available but we have to catch up on the planning aspect.  There are also challenges to have the scheme approved, for all the reasons the Deputy mentioned.</p><p>There are others in respect of which there are environmental issues to be addressed, in particular on the Royal Canal.  These are not unusual impediments.  Rather, they are the usual impediments but it takes time for the issues to be dealt with.</p></speech>

This demonstrates that there is a desire for this mode of travel.  When one factors in the number of people that could travel that route and take pressure off city streets it makes complete sense to get that done quickly.</p> <p>  Mr. Creegan mentioned that a percentage of the NTA's budget is spent on active travel.  What is that percentage and how does it relate to other spend?</p></speech>

Some are better than others.  We cannot put our finger on why that is the case.  In some cases, it may be down to resources and the fact that the people involved have multiple projects to deal with such that these projects may be low on their priority list.  I would not be capable of identifying the causes, but it is fair to say that there is a different approach in some local authorities.</p></speech>

Is there a role for the NTA in co-ordinating and streamlining those requests?  </p> <p>  My second question is to the witness from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and relates to enforcement of the road traffic legislation.  Is the legislation open to legal challenge in respect of the interpretation of dangerous overtaking?  In many cases, dangerous overtaking occurs on a 50:50 basis.  I travel to Dublin via the Long Mile Road.  I have noted that on parts of that road the cycle lane is 1.5 m wide and on other parts of it the cycle lane is 1 m wide.  In that situation, how would a garda make a judgment in regard to dangerous overtaking?  Will an assessment be made on the basis of a collision and so on?  Is it possible that we could be facing many legal challenges in the Four Courts in regard to this legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-20a.726" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray O'Leary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019112000002#V01500"><p>I will respond to the second part of the Deputy's question.  Enforcement will be a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The legislation that was introduced took account of views in regard to enforceability.  My recollection is that the Deputy raised questions in a previous discussion about the enforceability of a minimum passing distance of either 1 m or 1.5 m.  The legislation takes account of those views.  It is important to stress that there always has been a general offence of dangerous overtaking.  The question of dangerous overtaking is long established in Irish road traffic law.  In the current legislation we have separated out dangerous overtaking of cyclists because they are particularly vulnerable road users who are sharing the road space with mechanically propelled vehicles, unlike pedestrians in normal circumstances, and therefore they are particularly vulnerable and there is an increased penalty in terms of the fix charged notice.</p> <p>  On the question of legal challenge, legislative provisions are always open to challenge by a citizen.  I cannot say whether this legislation specifically will be open to challenge.  In bringing forward this specific legislation, we decided that it was best to build on a long established offence in Irish road traffic law that had been tested through the courts and had been the basis of previous action by the various parties.  These issues were borne in mind in bringing forward and distinguishing dangerous overtaking of a cyclist from dangerous overtaking generally.</p></speech>

At that time a motion was tabled to the local authority requesting that on the N73, which was the road from Mitchelstown to Mallow, these heavy goods vehicles be required to pull in at designated areas to allow other traffic to pass.  We need a gentleman-type agreement on country roads in regard to cyclists.  I have spoken to various people about this issue.  In bygone days there was a gentleman's agreement among road-users in that slow moving vehicles would pull over to allow other vehicles to pass.  Nowadays, our roads are increasingly busy with cyclists.  The N73 is a national secondary road.  As one approaches that road there is a sign advising motorists to be aware that owing to the width of the road oncoming traffic may be in the middle of the road.</p><p>Lately, while stuck in traffic congestion I assumed there was a slow car in front of me.  When I eventually got to this section of road, one cyclist had held up 40 cars.  I know there were 40 cars because the person in the car in front of me asked.  It causes confusion and frustration.  It can lead to road rage, which we are trying to avoid.  I enjoy riding a bicycle as well but road users must share the road and care about each other.  Much of the focus is on what happens in Dublin but we must not forget rural Ireland.  We welcome the greenways but as previous speakers have said, they are for recreational purposes.  Something more must be done to get more money to rural Ireland, as Deputy MacSharry noted, not just for footpaths but for cycle lanes.  We need proper legislation as well.</p></speech>

To some extent this is always an issue and we cannot legislate for or against what might be called "road courtesy".  It can be encouraged through education.  The State cannot do everything to change behaviour but we can encourage it through education, enforcement and, in some cases, engineering or investment.  For example, greenway investment provides an alternative.  One of the biggest issues, whether it is in rural or urban areas, is the limited amount of road space.  We are trying to manage a limited amount of road space with a limited amount of funding to maintain and invest it and make the best use of it for the many different people who want to use it.  This takes in the tourist, the tractor and the cyclist.  One of the advantages of greenways, for example, is to create space for more vulnerable road users and reduce the chances of them being in "conflict", to use the word in the engineering sense and where it refers to different kinds of users on the same stretch of road.</p> <p>  The Deputy might be aware that on the national secondary route from Tralee to Dingle, a cycle track was built into the side of the road despite environmental objections being made.  The track required some extra width and an environmental organisation objected to the inclusion of a cycle track being added to the improved road.  That has been delivered but such a project is subject to environmental capacity and resources available for investment.  There will always be a mix of different solutions.  We might work with local authorities where investment in an alternative route or in enhancing the existing route is feasible.  Engagement with stakeholders can be useful in trying to encourage people to respect each other, whether that is a driver respecting a cyclist or the cyclist respecting the driver.</p> <p>  From the road safety perspective, we do not like using terms like cycling safety.  We talk about road safety for everybody because people do not live in boxes.  The same people who use bicycles use buses, footpaths and cars.  Therefore, it is about trying to create the conditions where people using public infrastructure can do so in an optimal way.</p></speech>

Between 2014 and 2018 the figure was 11 per year, so the trend for cyclist deaths is up while it is significantly down for road users as a whole.  The number of road fatalities in 2009 was 238, compared with 142 last year.  That includes pedestrians.  The point by the witness is very well made but cyclists are undoubtedly at a particular risk.</p> <p>  I referred earlier to the cyclist injury report and collision data from 2008 to 2016 that is due early next month.  It would be important to have representatives of the Road Safety Authority before us to discuss that.  We will learn much from that as I understand it goes into every reported injury and fatality and we can get a really clear picture of what more we need to do.</p></speech>

I spoke about the public consultation we are doing and one of the questions being put in the public consultation is the question of engagement with various stakeholders both in this and other areas.  It is about seeing whether we should or how we can widen existing processes, or whether they should be formalised.  We are very open to ideas around that and to progressing it in future.  The Deputy speaks about the proliferation of parties involved in this, and we are looking at institutional structures under the public consultation.  We are inviting views on this and are open to hearing them.  It is about asking what is the best way of having that interaction at the policy, strategy, implementation and user levels, which is really important.  It is about ensuring that the views of users, when they come in, are not just targeted at one of the parties but that they influence and inform what is happening at the policy and strategy levels, as well as at the delivery and implementation levels.</p></speech>

Cyclists are also more likely to get off a bike and not cycle again.  There are not many drivers who have a frustrating driving experience and never drive again but this happens with cyclists.  It is not just about individuals and there is a negative social consequence if the collective social policy goal we have identified nationally is that we want people to cycle.  It makes it everybody's business and not just the business of those involved if people are deterred from cycling.  We have heard about the work on design but what about the work on cycling promotion and encouraging people to do it?  That is what is different about potentially having a cycling office in the Department as opposed to having people who can offer expertise on the detail of cycling design.  The Department or a local authority could have a cycling officer who is not just looking at how to accommodate the needs of cyclists but how we can create new cyclists in future.  It is a stated collective public goal.</p> <p>  There was mention of a figure of approximately 12% or 14% of budget for active travel from the National Transport Authority.  What part of that relates to cycling?  The Department mentioned an increase of &euro;385 million in the budget, with over &euro;354 million relating to capital increases.  I am on the climate action committee and I know there is a 10% target so does the Department envisage that 10% of the new capital infrastructure might move to cycling?  How can this be accelerated?</p></speech>

This question has a "yes" or "no" answer and is for Ms Graham.  When we discussed the disability issue in public transport previously I asked Ms Graham how long it would take, at current resource levels, to have saturation coverage in terms of vehicles that are accessible for disabled people.  She answered that it would be at least ten years with current funding.  I will apply the same question to cycling.  At current resource levels, how many centuries will it be before we have saturation in terms of cycling infrastructure?</p></speech>
