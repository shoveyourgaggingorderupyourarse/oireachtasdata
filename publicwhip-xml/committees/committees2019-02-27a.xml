Today this committee will meet representatives of the Central Bank of Ireland to discuss the bank's January quarterly report, which contains its latest analysis of macroeconomic and fiscal risks.  The bank's forecast and analysis is particularly important in the context of Brexit.  I think everything is important in the context of Brexit.  Before we call the officials from the Central Bank, I propose that we go into private session to deal with housekeeping matters.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019022700002#D00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee.  I am joined by Mr. John Flynn, head of the Irish economic analysis division, and Dr. Thomas Conefrey, manager of structural macroeconomic modelling and also from the Irish economic analysis division.  I will start with a brief summary of the outlook for the economy and the macroeconomic forecasts set out in our recently published quarterly bulletin.</p> <p>  The Irish economy grew at a strong pace in 2018, supported by the strength of activity on the domestic side as well as a relatively favourable international growth environment.  While headline gross domestic product, GDP, growth last year was distorted by the activities of multinational enterprises, the evidence from a range of domestic spending and activity indicators is that the domestic economy, overall, grew robustly.  We estimate that growth in underlying domestic demand last year was approximately 6%.  The strength of domestic activity has been underpinned by continuing strong and broad-based growth in employment, which has stimulated incomes and supported the growth of consumer spending.  The growth of key domestic components of investment, such as building and construction, has also accelerated.</p> <p>  Looking ahead, the Central Bank&rsquo;s most recent forecast, shown in the accompanying table, is that if a disorderly no-deal Brexit scenario can be avoided, the outlook for the economy in coming years remains broadly positive, although with some moderation in growth in prospect.  We expect economic growth of 4.4% this year, with a moderation to 3.6% next year.  This moderation partly reflects the projected impact of a less favourable and more uncertain international economic environment, with prospects for growth in our main trading partners having been lowered in recent months, and also some dampening impact from the uncertainty associated with Brexit.  The moderation also partly reflects the limits imposed by domestic capacity constraints due to the tightening of conditions in the labour market.  The most recent published forecasts also represent a modest downward revision compared with our previous bulletin, which was published in October.  Exports, private consumption and investment are all weaker than previously expected, while, following budget 2019, the contribution of Government consumption to economic growth this year is stronger.</p> <p>  The main impetus in respect of growth in coming years is expected to come from domestic demand, driven by further growth in employment and incomes, though some moderation in employment growth from current rates is projected.  Reflecting the moderation in employment growth, and with some uncertainty about economic prospects weighing on sentiment, the growth of consumer spending is projected to ease towards 2% over this year and next.  Regarding investment, while overall investment has been quite volatile in recent years, primarily reflecting the activities of multinational enterprises, some key domestic components of investment, such as building and construction have rebounded strongly.  While this growth is forecast to continue, the outlook for some other components, such as machinery and equipment investment is more mixed, reflecting some negative impact from increased risks and uncertainty.  Taken together, the growth of underlying investment spending is expected to moderate.</p> <p>  Given the outlook for consumption and underlying investment, the growth of underlying domestic demand is also projected to moderate and grow by 4.1% this year and 3.3% next year.  On the external side, while exports grew strongly in 2018, with projected growth in trading partner countries being revised downwards, some moderation in export growth is also projected, with exports forecast to grow by 4.3% this year and 3.9% in 2020.  With Brexit-related uncertainty weighing on demand, the weakness evident in the UK market last year is likely to persist.</p> <p>  Turning to the outlook for the labour market, while moderation in the pace of employment growth in line with the outlook for aggregate demand is forecast, growth of 2.2% this year and 1.7% next year is set to exceed growth in labour supply of about 1.5% in both years.  As a result, the unemployment rate is projected to drop from an average of 5.8% last year to 4.9% this year and 4.7% in 2020.  As has been the case for some time, gains in employment have been broad-based, with employment growing strongly in many parts of the services sector and in the construction sector.  In our central forecast, growth in employment, while moderating, will continue to be relatively broad-based.  In light of the outlook for employment, we also expect a further pick up in wages which, combined with expectations of modest inflation, should translate into higher real incomes and purchasing power for households.  We are forecasting the average increase in compensation per employee to increase from 2.8% last year to 3.4% this year and 3.6% in 2020.</p> <p>  Turning to Brexit, we have previously published work examining the potential medium-term impact on the Irish economy of both an orderly transition to a World Trade Organization, WTO, scenario and an orderly transition to a free trade area-type agreement such as the current withdrawal agreement.  In our most recent bulletin, and using our economic modelling tools, we also examined the possible macroeconomic implications of a sudden and disorderly Brexit on the outlook for the Irish economy.  Given the unprecedented nature of a no-deal Brexit scenario, quantification is highly uncertain and this exercise represents a scenario analysis and not a forecast, in that it looks at what could happen under certain assumptions, not necessarily what is most likely to happen.</p> <p>  With a disorderly Brexit, significant additional frictions and costs arise.  These result not only from the introduction of new trade arrangements, but also from a breakdown in some of the arrangements that make trade possible - for example, as a result of regulatory and customs issues, Border infrastructure issues and legal uncertainties.  This would be likely to have immediately damaging consequences for trade and the functioning of supply chains for production, distribution and retailing.  Modelling and forecasting tools can be used to estimate the impact of long-term changes to trade arrangements, but are less suited for predicting the short-run effects and potential disruption arising from a breakdown in those arrangements.  The scale of that disruption would also be influenced by the ability of firms and retailers to adjust to any new arrangements, as well as any policy responses or mitigating actions taken as a result.  I mention this to emphasis the uncertainty inherent in these estimates.</p> <p>  Nevertheless, it is clear that a no-deal Brexit scenario would have severe and immediate disruptive effects, which would permeate almost all areas of economic activity.  Certain sectors and regions would be disproportionately affected, particularly the agriculture and food sectors, as well as Border regions and other rural regions with a heavy reliance on agriculture and a particular reliance on the UK as an export market.  We estimate that a disorderly Brexit could reduce the growth rate of the Irish economy by up to four percentage points in the first year.  Given the current favourable forecasts for the economy as a result of domestic demand and the strong non-UK multinational sector, our assessment is that there will still be some positive growth in output this year and next even under a no-deal scenario, but materially lower than in the central forecast.  It will be closer to 1% growth in both years.</p> <p>  Brexit is not the only risk to the economic outlook and other material domestic and external risks persist.  On the domestic side, while some moderation in underlying domestic demand is in prospect following a period of strong growth, labour market conditions are still set to tighten further.  As the economy moves closer to full employment, there is a need to continue to guard against the risk that strong cyclical conditions give rise to overheating dynamics.  On the external side, in addition to Brexit, there continue to be some clear downside risks facing the Irish economy.  The international economic outlook has weakened since the publication of the last bulletin, while risks related to international trade and taxation persist.</p><p>In view of Ireland's position as a small, very open economy and the important role that multinational firms play, changes in global trade, taxation and currency arrangements have an important bearing on economic performance.</p><p> I thank the members for their attention.  We are now available to take any questions.</p></speech>

I have a number of brief questions.  They are the kinds of questions we have put to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, the Governor, the Minister and so on over time.  Are our guests of the view that there is an over-reliance on corporation tax receipts?  They might have a comment to make on that, which we could add to previous comments.</p> <p>  It seems we may be in territory whereby the idea of a no-deal, fall-off-the-cliff-edge Brexit, may not, dare I say it, be as strong a possibility as previously feared.  I certainly hope this proves to be the case.  Could Dr. Cassidy expand a little on what he had to say about the other two scenarios to which he referred, including that relating to the UK trading under WTO rules?</p> <p>  Last week, the Chairman and I were present at EU parliamentary week.  One of the events was addressed by the vice president of the European Investment Bank.  I wish to raise two questions in this regard.  First, public expenditure on capital programmes has shrunk by 20% across the EU.  Regarding investments in public infrastructure and our climate change obligations and challenges we face, the vice president stated that the private sector must be incentivised to lead in many of these big capital projects.  Our guests might comment on that matter.</p> <p>  The employment figures are really good news, but we heard last week that youth unemployment in some of the modern economies in Europe is at about 30% to 40%.  Where are we in the youth unemployment figures?  What is the trend and trajectory in this regard?  Clearly, our rate is nowhere near as high as 30% to 40%, but what do our guests think accounts for the high rates in some European countries?  Are youth unemployment rates higher than overall unemployment rates?  I would like to hear any comments our guests might have on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019022700002#E00400"><p>I will address each of the four parts to the Deputy's question in turn.  Regarding over-reliance on corporation tax, it is clear that there has been an unprecedented surge in corporation tax revenues since 2014-2015.  The increase has been in the order of 125%, such that revenues are now approximately &euro;10 billion.  This accounts for around 19% of overall tax revenues and is extremely high by historical and international standards.  On one hand, the increase in corporation tax receipts we have seen is very welcome.  On the other, corporation tax, particularly for Ireland, given that 40% of corporation tax is paid by the top ten multinational firms, is an inherently volatile source of taxation revenue.  We do not predict that there will be any decline in the revenue from the tax, but the volatility inherent in this source of revenue is such that we just do not know what the future is for corporation tax revenues.  There must be some risk that the share of revenues will decline in the future.</p></speech>

Is that on the basis of market circumstances?  Is it perhaps to do with a fall in firms' market share such that they are not earning as much, as opposed to the way they account for this?  Am I right in that?</p></speech>

I emphasise that we are not forecasting a decline in revenue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1311" speakername="John Lahart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019022700002#E00700"><p>Sure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019022700002#E00800"><p>Uncertainty is the key element.  A decline could come about as a result of either firm or sector-specific circumstances.  It could come about because of a deterioration in the global trading environment or because of a change in the international taxation environment.  Of course, Ireland participates fully in global taxation regimes and environments.  There are a number of possible sources of uncertainty.  Our advice has always been that it is very likely that some element of the surge in corporation tax revenues over the past four to five years could represent a temporary or transient windfall element and that it would be much more prudent for that element to be put aside and saved rather than committed to permanent expenditure increases.  The extent of the increase in corporation tax revenues is very similar to the surge we saw in construction taxes prior to the boom.  The increase in corporation tax revenue has contributed 40% to the overall increase in tax revenue since 2014 to 2015, which is significant.</p></speech>

My understanding is that there is a complete disproportionality in the figures as to what property tax revenues prior to the boom amount to in terms of overall Government revenue compared with corporation tax revenues at this point.</p></speech>

I know that overall housing-related tax revenues amount to 16% to 17%.  Income tax always dominates in terms of what it contributes.  The amounts are roughly similar, but the question is whether we consider housing as opposed to overall property, and there might be an element on top of that.  I will confirm that for the Chairman.  We have concerns about the degree of reliance on corporation tax receipts.  While we welcome the high amount of revenue, we think the prudent course of action is not to spend what could turn out to be a temporary source of revenue.</p> <p>  Deputy Lahart referred to the other scenarios.  Yes, we think that some form of deal is a more likely outcome than a disorderly, no-deal Brexit.  He referred to two other scenarios, first, that some form of deal such as the withdrawal agreement materialises.  In this case we would see a transition period until the end of 2020 and, after that, some restrictions on trade coming into effect but free trade and therefore no tariffs between the economies.  Under these circumstances, we think that the long-term impact on output would be such that output would be around 1.7% lower than under a scenario in which Brexit had not taken place and that there would be around 19,000 fewer persons in employment than under a no-Brexit scenario.  The other scenario the Deputy mentioned is one in which there is no deal but there is a transition period until that no-deal scenario.  Under those circumstances, the impact on output over the longer term would be such that output would be around 3.2% lower than under a no-Brexit scenario and there would be around 50,000 fewer jobs.</p></speech>

The impact on the overall economy would be rather similar, that is, around 1.7% less growth over the medium term and around 18,000 or 19,000 fewer jobs.</p> <p>  The third part of the Deputy's question relates to public investment.  Overall, public capital investment fell extremely sharply after the crisis, by around 60%.  As a result, there was a significant depletion of the overall public capital stock, which remains very low.  There is certainly now the opportunity, after several years of very strong growth, for an increase in public capital investment.  This could have the positive effect of increasing productivity across the economy and could also be used to attain regional objectives.</p><p>We support the projections in the national development plan to 2027.</p><p> From an economic perspective, if the private sector participates in that, it is useful in terms of risk-sharing across the economy, as well as the business incentives it can bring.  Hopefully, the private sector can be involved over the coming years.  The public capital investment plan has to be set out regardless because we now need to address our public capital stock.  It would be welcome if that could be done in collaboration with the private sector.</p><p> We would fully welcome public capital investment but we need to acknowledge that it is occurring at a time when the economy is operating at close to full capacity.  If the full benefits of this capital investment are to be enjoyed, then it is important it does not crowd out the private sector.  It can do this by contributing to capacity constraints for private producers.  If higher capital spending is debt-financed, it will have the effect, when the economy is close to full capacity, of pushing up both prices and wages which then makes the private sector less competitive, particularly exporters.  Our recommendation is rather than debt financing under these circumstances, it is better if public capital investment is met by financing from elsewhere in the budget, whether through taxation or other expenditure measures.</p></speech>

It has fallen significantly.  It is currently twice the average unemployment rate.  It is high but it has fallen much.</p> <p>  One positive development is that a phenomenon we saw during the boom was the tendency for young males to go out of education and straight into employment, particularly in the construction and related sectors.  From current data, it is clear that the tendency for that to happen has declined much.  The labour force participation rate for young males in the 15 to 19 year old age group fell quite significantly in 2008 and 2009 and has not recovered.  In one sense, one might think that is a negative.  When we look at the data, the major reason for that seems to be that they are staying on in education, which is a benefit in the long run.  Improvements in youth unemployment and a greater tendency for younger cohorts to continue in education, which benefits their earnings and their employment prospects in the long term, are the case now.</p></speech>

Is it a case of hedging one&rsquo;s bets either for a cliff-edge Brexit or various types of softer Brexits which will impact hard on us after 2020?  The European Commissioner, G&uuml;nther Oettinger, stated a no-deal Brexit will probably lead to a general recession.  I assume that will mean quarter after quarter of declining output.  Is it the case that the cliff-edge Brexit is an existential threat to our economy?  We have seen the anxiety - to put it mildly - in the farming sector.  It is a significant bedrock in our intrinsic domestic economy.  Is the Central Bank being too sanguine about its scenarios or actual forecasts?</p><p>On budget 2019, we have been asking about the Revised Estimates and the possibility of another budget.  Has the Government taken on board sufficiently the profound risks of Brexit, an event which we are days away from?</p><p>The great Fintan O&rsquo;Toole said geography is destiny.  Napoleon once said, when he would not send us troops to help us to get rid of the English yoke 200 years ago, that &ldquo;<i>L'Irlande est une &igrave;le derriere une &igrave;le</i>.&rdquo;  Is it the case that Brexit will have a profound impact on us?  We are located in the North Atlantic Ocean with this large economy between us and our European partners.  There are all kinds of logistical issues which we are going to have to unravel, whether it is Irish Ferries going out of Dublin Port or Rosslare.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Lane, stated at the European Financial Forum that the financial sector has become strong enough to withstand profound shocks.</p><p>The D&aacute;il is debating Second Stage of the Brexit omnibus legislation and we all have this sense of unreality discussing changes to significant areas of tax law and whether they will be implemented.  The Central Bank has a core role in the Stock Exchange and the insurance industry.  How does it view its viability going forward?</p><p>What are the estimates for the levels of household debt going into the early 2020s?</p></speech>

There is no prior example of such a large economy suddenly withdrawing from such a large trading bloc.  Our economic models are useful in projecting medium-term and long-term outcomes based on historical relationships.  They are less good, however, at predicting short-term outcomes of this sort when one has such uncertain events.</p> <p>  We are projecting a major impact in the first two years after Brexit.  We are projecting that economic growth over the two years combined, rather than being above 8%, would be closer to 2%.  A decrease of 6% is three quarters of growth taken off the economy in the first two years which is a major impact.  I certainly hope that we are not underplaying the extent of the estimate.  Our estimates are somewhat more adverse than those projected by the Department of Finance for the first year.  Projected growth could be somewhat above or somewhat lower than 1.5%.</p> <p>  This is a shock which would permeate almost all areas of economic activity.  We know about the direct impact upon exports, particularly those parts of the economy where a high share of their produce is exported to the UK.  There are certain sectors of the economy which are particularly vulnerable both to tariffs and trade frictions, non-tariff barriers, such as delays in moving goods into and out of the country.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that the sector most affected in that regard would be the farming, agricultural and food producing sectors.  Around 42% of the exports of the food sector go to the UK.  Many parts of that sector, particularly beef, are already encountering problems with viability even before Brexit comes into effect.  The food sector is subject to the highest tariffs of any types of products if imposed.  For example, tariffs on beef exports could be up to 60%.  In addition to overall severe macroeconomic effects, we would highlight there are parts of the economy, not only the food and agriculture sectors, that will be affected.</p><p>Overall, the economy now exports only 11.5% of our goods to the UK.  In a way this is a very misleading figure because the overall export figure is inflated by such high exports from multinationals.  Approximately 42% of the exports of indigenous Irish-owned firms go to the United Kingdom.  We also import more from the UK than we export.  In addition to food products and consumer products, approximately half of the imports of Irish firms are intermediate products used in the production of other goods and services.  Disruptions to supply chains and production processes will be encountered throughout the economy and will particularly hit small and medium enterprises.  In our estimates, we tried to take into consideration all of these effects.  We believe these are severe overall macroeconomic effects and that we will see particularly severe effects on various parts of the economy.</p><p> Over time, after the first one or two years, we believe the overall effects will begin to level off.  The reason for this is we see two separate things happening.  In parts of the economy, including parts of agriculture, the decline will continue beyond the first couple of years.  It will be persistent.  On the other hand, we will have such adverse effects in the first one or two years because in many respects the economy is just not prepared.  The trading infrastructure of many firms will be taken by the suddenness of this.  Over time, the economy, our ports and customs facilities and the ability of small enterprises to fill out the new customs forms will adapt to an extent and begin to recover.  Much of the economy will begin to recover and it is hoped new export markets will be found.  We will have some positive reaction over time but that is not to downplay the overall seriousness of these effects.</p><p> I will come back to Deputy Broughan's other questions but he asked a lot of technical questions at the beginning about scenarios versus forecasts.</p></speech>

In the case of a forecast exercise, such as the central forecast in our bulletin, we make assumptions on all of the factors we believe would impact on the evolution of the Irish economy in 2019 and 2020.  A scenario is a much more limited exercise.  In the case of the Brexit work, we vary only the nature of the UK's relationship with the EU.  In this particular exercise, on a no-deal Brexit, we looked at the evolution of the economy if the UK's relationship reverts to a WTO-type relationship and all other factors we believe will affect the path of the Irish economy over the coming ten years were held unchanged.  If we were doing a forecasting exercise, we would think about all of the various aspects that would impact on the growth in the economy over ten years, such as other changes in the external environment and all of the other ingredients that go into a forecasting exercise.  In this particular no-deal scenario analysis we are only varying this single part, which is the nature of the UK's relationship with the EU.  It is a more limited exercise in this sense.</p></speech>

He asked about the budgetary situation.  I will summarise our position in that we recommended a more ambitious budgetary position should have been taken with a larger surplus for 2019 and beyond.  Our main reasoning in this regard was, given high current debt levels, to leave the economy better prepared for Brexit or any other shocks that may come down the line.  Up to 2015 or 2016 we saw a substantial improvement in the public finances.  This has stalled more recently.  The best indicator of this is the primary budget balance, in other words, a budget balance excluding interest payments, which has stabilised or even deteriorated somewhat since 2016.  Our view is that during this period the economy has experienced extremely strong economic growth.  Growth has outperformed expectations in almost every year.  We have seen an unprecedented surge in corporation tax revenues and, as per our previous discussion, we have concerns that this might not be sustainable or might contain a windfall element.  The economy is clearly getting closer to full capacity, a time when Government spending should not seek to add overheating pressures or capacity constraints in the economy.  We still have extremely high public sector debt.  It is the fourth highest in the European Union, at approximately 105% of national income when national income is properly measured as gross national income adjusted.  For all of these reasons, we believe the environment was right for a more ambitious fiscal policy and running a higher surplus, and we believe this would have been particularly important not just to reduce overheating pressures but to increase the resilience of the economy to withstand any possible economic shock.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the risks relate not only to Brexit as there are also significant risks relating to current uncertainties in the global economy, taxation environment and trading regime.  I hope this answers the question.</p> <p>  Overall, household debt remains high in Ireland by international standards.  It is still measured as a proportion of household disposable income, which is the best measure.  It is still the fourth highest in the European Union, standing at approximately 125% to 130% of household disposable income.  It is clearly on a downward trend, having picked up extremely quickly following the crisis.  It has been on a steady downward trend for two reasons, namely, that households have been paying off their debt as part of a deleveraging process and, more noticeably, as household incomes increase, the ratio will decline.  It is falling by approximately ten percentage points per annum.  If current trends continue, this means it would fall below 100% in the coming years.  It remains rather high but the more it falls, the more resilient to any future shock the economy becomes.  The position we are in now, which is a legacy of the crisis, is that Irish households overall, particularly certain cohorts, including those age groups that bought houses during the early 2000s, have extremely high debt.  This makes them extremely vulnerable in terms of any shock to income or house prices.  This reinforces the need for overall economic prudence.  The banks' contribution in this regard, the mortgage market measures, is also important.</p></speech>

Irish banks have significantly reduced their loan books.  Their lending ratios have improved significantly.  Their capital ratios are now significantly stronger and more robust than they were before the crisis.  We also have a much more intrusive supervisory system than we had before the crisis.  The Central Bank has taken a number of actions in addition to more intrusive supervision.  The purpose of the mortgage market measures is to prevent banks from lending too much in the way they did in the early 2000s and to prevent borrowers and households becoming over-indebted in the same way they did then.  In addition to these tools, the Central Bank has other macro-prudential tools now available to it, which we have already deployed.  These are the capital requirements we impose on the banks, the ultimate objective of which is to safeguard the stability of the financial system as a whole.  In recent years, we have introduced two capital buffers.  One is a countercyclical capital buffer and one is a buffer for large systemically important institutions.  Both of these serve to increase the stability of the particular banks.  The banking system is in a much safer position and we have introduced measures to ensure this will remain the case.</p><p>While Brexit will have a severe overall economic impact and some temporary market dislocation cannot be ruled out, overall the risk to the financial system as a result of Brexit is manageable but it is something we are monitoring very carefully within the bank.</p></speech>

Brexit is the big challenge at the moment but, as the witnesses have been quick to point out, it is not the only one.  I want to touch on employment, housing and non-commercial properties and the factors at play in those issues.  From reading the report, we are reaching full employment and there is now a transition of employment across sectors that is leading to wage increases.  That is my reading of it, in summary.  How much will that play into a possible risk of overheating the economy?</p> <p>  Another area touched on in the report is housing.  We have almost reached capacity in construction due to skill shortages and because we are reaching full employment.  I do not understand the references in the report to non-commercial properties maintaining a very moderate level of growth.  Reports produced by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, and the Department suggest that the greater risks of overheating in the economy are coming from the commercial sector rather than the non-commercial sector.  Will the witnesses briefly discuss that and how we could address it?  We only have so many workers in the construction sector and are reaching full employment, so how do we overcome that?</p> <p>  The report states that more properties are becoming available for rent in the Dublin area.  There has been an increase of approximately 7.1% in the number of properties available for rent in Dublin and, as a result, we are seeing a slight decrease in rental prices there.  That is not being replicated outside Dublin and fewer properties are becoming available for rent elsewhere.  The figure in the Central Bank's quarterly bulletin is a 4.5% decrease in the number of properties for rent outside Dublin and rental prices are going up.  The report indicates that there is a significant issue with supply and demand outside Dublin.</p> <p>  I was taken by surprise at the figures for the Dublin region because Dublin always seems to be an area where there is little supply of housing, yet the report states there has been an increase in the number of properties available to rent in the capital.  I am not questioning the figures but that is not the information we hear in constituency offices or debates in the Oireachtas.  We hear that Dublin is at saturation point and there is no place to rent in Dublin.  However, that is not borne out by the analysis in the report.  I ask the witnesses to address that issue.</p></speech>

These are all extremely important issues for the economy at the moment.  Let me first deal with the issue of overheating and employment trends.  It is important to emphasise that we do not currently see overheating in the economy.  Prices and wages remain contained.  Unlike a decade ago, we are certainly not seeing any signs that economic growth is being fuelled by either excessive domestic credit or inflows of money from abroad.  The situation now is very different to then.  We are seeing that the unemployment rate has been falling steadily.  We are getting closer to a position of full capacity and there are signs of increasing tightness in the labour market.  There has clearly been an uptick in wages.  Figures released this week show that the average increase in weekly wages during the final quarter of last year was 4.1%, up from 3.5% in the previous quarter.  There has also been an increase in job vacancy rates which is now at an historically high level.  There has also been an increase in job switching rates, the rate at which people are switching jobs within an economy, and we have produced an analysis of this year which shows that this tends to be an indicator that further wage increases are on the way.  While we do not currently see overheating, we are seeing signs of getting closer to full capacity.</p> <p>  Within the labour market, some sectors are clearly experiencing more pressures because of a shortage of available workers which is leading to higher wages in those sectors.  The sector that particularly stands out is the information and communication technology services sector.  Wages in this very fast-growing sector are increasing by approximately 7%, which is perhaps what one would expect.</p> <p>  Across the rest of the economy, employment growth is strongest in the construction sector.  I will come back to that in a moment because it relates to the second part of Deputy O'Brien's question.  Employment in construction increased by about 11% over the past year.  We are also seeing strong employment growth in accommodation and food services and in sectors like education and public administration.  It is quite broad based across the economy.</p> <p>  Wage increases are fastest and vacancy rates highest in some of the modern services sectors.  Aside from the information and communication technology, there is a high vacancy rate in financial and professional services.  Wage pressure is more contained in other, more traditional parts of the economy.</p> <p>  Our concern is not that we currently see overheating but we are looking out for whether wages and prices start to increase at a faster rate than might be justified by the performance of the economy.  We are not seeing that now.  The increase in wages across the economy is very welcome, particularly because of the wage cuts and moderation experienced by so many after the financial crisis.  It is right that the benefits of economic growth are being spread.  This is a cautionary word about ensuring we do not get into the position we got into in the past.</p> <p>  There are things to do with supply, labour demands and the differences between the different elements of the sector when considering the housing market.  I share the consensus that the main issue currently facing the housing market is a shortage of supply.  Housing supply last year was around 18,000 units which is extremely low in comparison with the needs of the economy.  The medium-term needs of the economy are probably somewhere closer to 35,000 or 40,000 units a year so 18,000 was well short of that.  Housing supply is picking up at a strong rate.  It is increasing by maybe 25% a year but this still only brings us up to about 23,000 units this year and 28,000 units next year.  Even by 2020, the number of houses being built will still not be enough to meet the needs of the economy.  This means pressures will manifest themselves in both prices and rents.  The pressures in the rental market have been much greater than in the housing market for a number of years.  House prices are still approximately 20% below where they were before the crisis, whereas rents are now significantly above where they were in 2007.</p><p>I was asked about regional trends.  Prices first began to pick up in Dublin and this was followed by the rest of the country but the rate of both price increases and rental increases across Dublin is now lower than in the rest of the country.  Price increases in Dublin are running at between 3.5% and 4% per year, compared to 6.5% nationwide.  This probably reflects a couple of factors.  One may be the earlier pick-up in prices in Dublin but affordability is also a factor.  Prices and rents rose high enough to become less affordable, pushing the price pressure to regions outside Dublin.  Another interesting trend is lower-priced houses increasing at a much faster rate.  Prices at the higher levels are flat or declining and, because prices are generally higher in Dublin, this leads to a slower overall increase in the capital.</p><p> I was asked about the supply of houses.  We did an analysis of what was required to address the deficit in the housing sector in coming years, in particular the availability of construction sector workers.  The author was Dr. Conefrey.</p></speech>

We looked at what happened to construction workers who lost their jobs during the crash between 2009 and 2013 and found that a significant number of people who lost work either moved into other jobs or emigrated.  We did not find evidence of a significant pool of unemployed construction workers.  It was suggested that we were running out of these workers.  The role of migration is important for Ireland and the labour market is extremely open.  In good times we see significant inflows and there are outflows during a downturn.  In the year to April last year there was a net inflow of 34,000 workers.  Even though the domestic supply of construction workers is likely to be quite low, there should be inflows of workers to sectors with labour scarcities and this should help ease labour shortages in tight sectors.  A pick-up in inward migration, however, creates pressures in other parts of the economy.</p></speech>

It is only since 2015 that net inward migration has turned positive, though it has turned positive at a quick rate and last year 34,000 more people came into the country than left.  This alleviates labour supply constraints somewhat and construction is increasing as a result, but there are additional pressures on demand because these people need places to live.  The overall effect will be positive for the sector because it will add to the net supply of housing.</p> <p>  I was asked about the supply of rental properties in Dublin as compared to elsewhere.  A change is under way in the rental market, and in commercial property, relating to the financing of investment in the sector.  Commercial investment and the buy-to-let rental sector are no longer being financed by the banking sector.  Finance is now coming from equity investment and institutional investment and this has a lot of different effects, positive and negative.  The positive effects include risk sharing and the long-term stability of the rental market that comes from institutional apartment ownership with longer contracts.  It creates additional demand in the economy, however, for a fixed supply of housing.  There has been a change in the structure of the commercial market and this affects not only commercial properties such as offices, retail and industrial, but rental apartments too.  The Deputy suggested that there was more availability in Dublin than in other counties and this might partly reflect the changes too.  Rents are higher in Dublin so the incentives are higher for institutional investors in Dublin.  The Central Bank is looking at the impact of non-banking financing on the overall property market and we are hoping to publish more about this important research theme in the coming year.</p></speech>

I was struck by the comments of the Governor, Professor Philip Lane, who spoke recently in Dublin Castle.  He said the immediate cliff-edge risks of a hard Brexit had largely been addressed because of the work of the Central Bank.  Can the witnesses go into more detail on what they have done?  What immediate cliff-edge risks did they identify and what steps did they take to address those?</p> <p>  The Governor also spoke of the redistribution of financial services away from London, which has been the centre point for such services within the European Union.  He said it would bring challenges as well as opportunities.  The opportunities are clear in the shape of jobs relocating to Dublin but what are the challenges for Ireland?  What are the challenges of more dispersed financial services markets across the EU and its member states?</p> <p>  Of all the key financial risks to the economy, do the witnesses consider Brexit to be the biggest?  Is the Government sufficiently prepared for a disorderly or no-deal Brexit at the end of March?  If not, what do we need to do now to prepare ourselves in the course of the next 30 days?</p></speech>

We have had close interaction with the Department of Finance over recent years and a lot of work is being done but I am less close to the preparations that are being done outside the financial sector.  Are we prepared as an economy for the end of March?   I would say we are as well prepared as any other economy but not fully prepared.  I do not believe any country in Europe, including the UK, is fully prepared for a no-deal Brexit.  If firms and the Government had known a year ago what the outcome was going to be they could have prepared but there has been such uncertainty and so many different scenarios that the degree of preparedness for the most adverse scenario was never going to be 100%.</p> <p>  Our remit on the macroeconomic side is to provide advice, economic analysis and commentary but I believe the Deputy's question to have been about the financial system, the stability of the system and supervisory issues.</p><p>The bank has been working on these since well before the referendum.  I remember having our first meetings about preparations for the potential of Brexit around the summer or autumn of 2015 and we have worked intensively on potential Brexit risks in the three and a half year period since.  With respect to the type of work we have done, we have engaged closely with the banks to ensure they have sufficient capital and have undertaken stress tests in order to be able to withstand all Brexit scenarios.  From the outset, we have emphasised in all our communications that while a no-deal Brexit was not the most likely outcome, it was always a possible outcome. </p></speech>

I will give an example of the some of the cliff-edge risks that have come on our radar during recent months and quarters that we have had to address on many occasions along with the Department of Finance because we have shared responsibilities.  There was a risk to the settlement of Irish securities in the event of a no-deal Brexit within the whole European framework and there were risks regarding the settlement of derivatives.  Both of these risks have now been mitigated by European level legislation which allows for the settlement of securities and derivatives to be continued for two years in one case and three years in another beyond the Brexit deadline of 29 March.</p> <p>  We had concerns about the continuity of insurance contracts post Brexit.  If there were insurance providers into this jurisdiction which were no longer authorised after Brexit came into effect, what would be the status of existing contracts with those companies for Irish citizens?  As part of the overall legislative package announced last week, legislation to allow the run-off of these insurance contracts to occur over the next two years was announced by the Government and it will hopefully come into effect in early March.  We have also been dealing with a very large number of authorisations for new applicants to come into Ireland, with which we have been engaging successfully in terms of the size of the sector.  </p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the challenges for firms locating here.  I will not refer to any individual firms but in addition to a substantial increase in the size of the balance sheet of the Irish financial sector as a result of Brexit, we will also see new types of very sophisticated business models attracted here.  We have known this has been on the horizon and this has involved challenges in terms of upskilling, interactions and liaising with other supervisors to ensure we are fully prepared to fully supervise all aspects of the business models of these new types of operations.  We have done much in that regard.</p> <p>  On the question of whether Brexit is the biggest threat, it is clearly the most immediate one.  If a no-deal Brexit materialises, it will certainly be the largest threat the economy has faced since the financial crisis.  Over the longer term, I am not inclined to rank the threats.  We will know about Brexit sooner rather than later.  With respect to the figures I mentioned earlier, if a deal is agreed, the aggregate figures are reasonably large but not excessive, with the important consideration that certain sectors of the economy such as agrifood would be severely affected.  With respect to the risks we are seeing in regard to the global taxation environment and risks regarding potential protectionist threats, Ireland is one of the probably about the fourth or fifth most open economy in the world.  We have a very high degree of reliance on a small number of multinational firms and a high degree of sectoral specialisation.  Approximately 55% of our goods exports are in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals sector and approximately 47% to 50% of our services exports are in IT type services.  There are vulnerabilities there.  We would be particularly affected if there was an escalation in protectionist trends or any changes to global taxation arrangements.  These are all material risks.  Brexit in the short term is the most immediate and the most in focus, but I certainly would not underplay the other medium-term risks.</p></speech>

They point to growth being around 4% lower in the first year than in our main forecast and a further 2% lower in the second year.  We expect this would still leave positive growth over those periods, probably of between 1% and 1.5% in each year compared with 4.5% and 3%, respectively.  Our scenario in the event of a no-deal Brexit is for materially weaker growth but avoiding recession and for output and employment growth both remaining positive.  I emphasise the inherent uncertainty regarding these estimates.  We do not have prior experience of the type of shock and disruption in which a no-deal Brexit would result, so either better or worse outcomes than those cannot be ruled out.</p></speech>

When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, appeared before the committee, I asked him if he perceived the need to have a supplementary budget mid-cycle.  He was adamant there was no need to do so as there was enough funding available across Departments to deal with whatever might come.  That sounds strange given that we do not know what is coming.  What is Dr. Cassidy's assessment of that particular position indicated by the Minister for Finance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.62" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019022700002#K00700"><p>In the event of a no-deal Brexit and the adverse implications I mentioned, which the Department of Finance have also spelled out, it is clear with respect to the public finances in the past that the appropriate policy response would be somewhat different, including our own policy advice in that regard.  In the more likely scenario whereby a no-deal Brexit is avoided, for the reasons I mentioned, we would like to see larger budget surpluses than are currently envisaged.  In the event that there is a disruptive no-deal Brexit, despite the fact that public sector debt is still high, the state of the public finances allows in that situation for the running of a countercyclical fiscal deficit through the operation of what we call the automatic stabilisers on tax revenues and transfer payments.  What we mean by that is that the public finance situation automatically and without the need for a budget alters in the case of an economic shock.  Owing to lower incomes, people would pay less tax.  Government spending on unemployment benefits and other transfers would increase and the increase in spending on benefits and the lower tax collection would keep more money in the economy, help to limit the fall in aggregate demand and cushion the impact of the shock.  These are what we call automatic stabilisers.  Automatically, there is some relief for the economy without the need for a budget, albeit that the deficit worsens, although that is appropriate in such circumstances.  The state of the public finances allows for that.</p> <p>  Without getting into whether a supplementary budget would be required - I am certainly not saying one would be required - beyond those automatic stabilisers, the nature of a hard Brexit and what it would involve in terms of the impact on the economy and possible changes to the structure would allow for some one-off measures.  These might be used, for example, to support Brexit trade routes or perhaps targeted measures at those parts of the economy that would be particularly affected by Brexit.  In addition to automatic stabilisers, there would be scope for some one-off measures to alleviate the effects and to help the adjustment of the economy towards a new post-Brexit situation.  The nature of those would be a matter for the Government.  The critical factor I would emphasise is that they would need to be explicitly temporary measures.  We need to avoid permanent spending commitments that we may not be able to finance over the longer term, particularly if there was to be a shock to corporation tax revenues or another shock to the economy.</p></speech>

I have one final question.  The quarterly bulletin published by the Central Bank raises the prospect that we might see an increase in foreign direct investment, FDI, because of Brexit.  On what evidence was that based?  How likely is it to happen?  By how much do the witnesses see it increasing?  Could Dr. Cassidy provide a little more detail about the process behind coming to that conclusion?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.68" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019022700002#L00600"><p>We expect to see an increase in foreign direct investment, particularly over the medium term.  We think this will be one of the mitigating effects which will somewhat reduce the longer-term impact of Brexit.  The reason is that all of the foreign direct investment that locates here does so to sell goods and services outside of Ireland.  Much of that activity is undertaken to sell to EU markets.  Around 40% of our exports are to non-UK EU countries.  Once the UK is no longer part of the EU, international firms will have less incentive to locate in the UK with a view to selling into the Single Market and the EU.  If they are looking for alternative locations, Ireland may be the optimum location.  We may see foreign direct investment that is currently in the UK being redirected here.  New investment seeking to locate in the EU, which previously might have considered the UK as a prime option, may instead come to Ireland.  We expect to see an increase in FDI.  We are already seeing very tangible signs of that in the financial sector.  There is a good reason for that.  Firms in the financial sector need to get authorisation in order to locate.  Financial services sector firms need to make their plans much earlier than those in many other sectors.  Therefore, as I have mentioned already, we have seen a very large increase in authorisation applications for the financial services sector and we will see significant new investments in that sector.</p> <p>  Outside of the financial services sector we expect to see a positive impact.  The extent of that is still a little uncertain.  It will take a little bit longer.  Firms probably have more capacity to wait and see what exactly the nature of the new arrangements will be before they make definitive plans.  We do not have estimates of the positive impacts on growth, but I have seen estimates projecting an increase of about 3% in output because of higher foreign direct investment over the medium to long term.</p></speech>

Dr. Cassidy mentioned that one of the potential drivers of higher FDI in Ireland is the diversion of FDI from the UK.  It is important to note that a lot of the studies in the UK on the impact of Brexit anticipate a reduction in FDI inflows to the UK.  In the event of Brexit taking the form of a WTO-type shock the numbers are quite big - a reduction of about 25% in UK FDI.  The partial diversion of some of that to Ireland, in line with its current share of FDI, would be-----</p></speech>

That projection of investment is presumably predicated on a harder Brexit.  Would that development be delayed if there was an agreed soft Brexit with ongoing negotiations on the future arrangements?  Would the witnesses expect that investment not to happen until those negotiations on the future relationship are concluded?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.74" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019022700002#L01200"><p>Whether the outcome is a hard or a soft Brexit will have an impact on the amount of foreign direct investment we are likely to see here.  We still expect to see some more foreign direct investment even in the event of the softer Brexit scenarios.  There are two reasons for this.  First, the choice of a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit has a smaller impact upon trade in services.  Once Brexit takes place, whether it is hard or soft, there will no longer be passporting of services between the UK and the rest of the EU.  Under all circumstances in which Brexit takes place and the UK is not a part of the Single Market, the incentives for foreign direct investment to locate here will still exist, particularly in services.  There will still be a benefit under both circumstances.</p> <p>  With respect to goods, there will still be barriers to trade as long as the UK is not in both a Single Market in which there are no regulatory checks and a customs union in which there are no customs checks to enforce rules of origin, even in a free trade agreement.  UK goods exports still will not have unrestricted access to the EU.  These restrictions will be smaller in the case of a deal than in the case of a no-deal outcome with tariffs and the like.  In summary, we expect to see more FDI flows under all circumstances, but the incentives will be even greater in the event of a no-deal outcome. </p> <p>  In regard to timing, the scenario in which there is a deal, which we still think is the most likely, involves a transition period up to 2020.  That allows firms a lot more time to prepare their investment strategies.  I certainly do not see any benefit in the no-deal scenario, even in foreign direct investment.  The suddenness of the change in arrangements will lead to uncertainty and a decline in sentiment right across the economy, including in exporting sectors.  More disruptive and bigger changes in the trading arrangements will add a lot more friction, trade costs and the like.  We would benefit in terms of FDI in both circumstances, but I do not see any silver lining in a no-deal outcome.</p></speech>

I have a question to follow on from that.  What particular sectors will be hurt?  Could the witnesses be a bit more specific?  The chemicals industry was mentioned.  The graphs showing the contribution chemical exports have made to export growth are quite stunning.  The graph shows that without increased chemical exports our exports would be negative, which is a pretty stark indication of the reliance on one particular sector.  I presume another sector that has contributed very significantly to our growth over recent years is the IT sector.  I do not see either of those being significantly impacted by Brexit one way or another.  The Central Bank's representatives' commentary suggests that most export growth goes to the United States and, interestingly, Belgium.  The IT sector will not be significantly impacted.  If I understood what Dr. Cassidy said about financial services, there could be a positive spin-off for us if anything.  There is no particular negative impact there.  Where will the negative impacts be?  I presume they will be felt in agribusiness because of the huge portion of agricultural output that is exported to Britain.  I imagine tourism will be hit.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on that.  To what extent does the Central Bank's analysis take these swings and roundabouts into account?</p><p>Does this Brexit crisis not highlight much more deep-rooted structural weaknesses in the economy that need to be addressed no matter what happens, regardless of whether there is a soft or hard Brexit?  One such weakness is that we are considerably over-reliant on a few sectors.  If problems emerge in any of them, the economy will be in serious trouble.  If this is true, what should we be doing about it?  Diversification is what is needed.  Do our guests believe that Ireland is moving to take serious steps to diversify its economy or is industrial policy concentrated on growing the sectors on which we rely and potentially increasing our vulnerability in the medium to long term?</p></speech>

I will try to address each question in turn.  I will first refer specifically to the chemicals sector, including in the context of the figures to which the Deputy referred.  The fact that he referred to them is absolutely correct but I can update the position slightly because we have a few more data.  Overall, there was strong export growth in the economy last year.  If the contribution of the chemicals sector is excluded, it was approximately zero.  It was slightly negative at the time we produced the box.  We now have an additional two months' data.  Effectively, there would have been no overall export growth in the economy last year without the chemicals sector.  Some 55% of our goods exports are chemicals and pharmaceuticals and 47% of our services exports relate to IT.  Therefore, there is the high degree of sectoral reliance that the Deputy referred to.  I will come back to that because it is very relevant to the final part of the Deputy's question.  We export a lot of chemicals to the United Kingdom.  We do not believe that this sector will be particularly affected.  There are no tariffs in the chemicals sector.  Non-tariff barriers are much lower.  The chemicals sector is a highly profitable sector in any event.  When we talk about sectoral effects, we should note that while a large proportion of chemical exports goes to the United Kingdom, we do not have chemicals in mind.</p> <p>  We very much have in mind the agrifood sector.  I will come back to that.  We also have in mind Irish exporters across other parts of the economy.  Exports from Ireland to the United Kingdom comprise only 11.5% of our total exports.  That is a very misleading figure because that total export figure is boosted so much by the chemicals exports.  That is a goods figure.  Some 43% of the exports of Irish-owned firms go to the United Kingdom.  Therefore, Irish-owned firms are extremely vulnerable to the effects of Brexit.</p> <p>  Let me first mention the food and agriculture sector and then some of the other affected SMEs.  Last year, 42% of our food exports went to the United Kingdom.  Exporters of beef, other meat products and dairy are very exposed.  Tariffs on food products are by far the highest among any types of products.  The ESRI has estimated that the effective tariff on meat products in a no-deal Brexit would be 59%, or almost 60%.  On dairy products, it would be 47%.  Food and agricultural products involve moving time-sensitive goods and goods that are fresh and need to be moved quickly.  They are also most subject to regulatory delays, such as phytosanitary checks.  The food and agriculture sector is undoubtedly extremely vulnerable to a no-deal, hard Brexit.  The ESRI has estimated that whereas overall exports to the United Kingdom could fall by 20% in the worst-case scenario, the decline in exports of beef could be 65% and the decline in exports of dairy could be 60%.  The agrifood sector is, therefore, extremely exposed to a disorderly no-deal Brexit.  </p> <p>  There are Irish-owned SMEs across a range of sectors that are particularly exposed.  In the region of 93% of the firms that export to the United Kingdom are Irish-owned SMEs.  Around half of those have no export market apart from the United Kingdom.  Therefore, there are many firms in other sectors of the economy that will also be affected.  In addition, many of the small and medium enterprises that do not export to the United Kingdom import intermediate products from the United Kingdom.  The restrictions on trade, trade friction and the like will increase costs and may reduce the availability of those intermediate products, thus affecting the supply chains and production processes of SMEs.  All parts of the indigenous enterprise sector will be affected rather than the multinational sector, which tends to be much more diversified.  It tends to have much more experience and skill in exporting to different countries at the same time, and it tends to be less vulnerable to tariffs and non-tariff barriers.  I have outlined the sectors of the economy that we believe are most exposed.</p> <p>  I agree that we are extremely reliant on the multinational sector.  This sector continues to serve Ireland extremely well.  It contributes significantly in terms of employment created, revenues for the Exchequer and the contribution to overall growth.  It creates higher-paid employment than other sectors of the economy.  There is also evidence, although perhaps not as much as we would like, of skills transfers to other parts of the economy.  That needs to be balanced against the fact that there is a high degree of reliance.  The top five multinationals account for approximately 33% of goods exports.  We are vulnerable to any downturn affecting multinationals, be it a shock to one of the individual firms, a shock to one of the relevant sectors - be it chemicals and pharmaceuticals or computer services - or a shock to the global trading arrangements.</p> <p>  The other potential impact is if the multinational sector crowds out the indigenous sectors as opposed to being a complimentary force within the economy, that is, if it is able to pay higher wages and obtain more skilled workers or capital.  What we need to ensure is not a change of the economic model.  We strongly need to encourage the multinational sector and provide a supportive environment but, to reduce the two risks, we need to do two things in addition.  First, public finances must not be overly reliant on the revenues from the multinational sector and the corporation tax revenue, which is so high, at 19%.  Second, we need to ensure that we have a dynamic, successful indigenous sector in the economy.  If anything, Brexit will accelerate the diversification in terms of exports because many producers will need to find new markets.  Developing and supporting that sector needs to be a very important part of policy.</p></speech>

It indicates that Government net financial wealth fell by &euro;2.3 billion during quarter 2 of 2018 as the increase in liabilities outstripped the increase in financial assets.

It was touched on earlier.  I refer to the sale of large amounts of property-related assets to institutional investors who have moved in on Irish property.

The assets side which is above the line - the financial assets side - seems to have been reasonably stable for five or six years.  The large increase in the negative net financial wealth position clearly represents a massive increase in liabilities after the crisis hit when Government borrowing increased enormously.  It seems to have stabilised since 2014.  The text may be a single quarter figure which seems to have declined.</p></speech>

It has increased dramatically both in terms of financial and property assets.  One can look at that alongside the Central Statistics Office survey on income and living conditions, SILC, reports on the distribution of those assets, which show a very high concentration.  I believe they show that the top 10% own 58% of it.  Is the over-concentration of wealth, both property and financial, in the hands of a very small number of people a vulnerability when we speak of risks and vulnerabilities in an economy?</p></speech>

From the perspective of vulnerability, the distribution of those in indebtedness is probably the greater vulnerability.  There are important and interesting distributional trends within these aggregate figures.  On the debt side, overall indebtedness, which is the figure below the line on the chart, has declined significantly but Irish household debt is still the fourth highest in Europe.  There are certain cohorts within that, particularly the age group between 35 and 45 years, who are still extremely highly indebted.  This is the generation which purchased property just before the crisis in the early 2000s.  From the perspective of wealth, indebtedness and net worth, the vulnerability of that cohort to a shock to either income or house prices is the greatest vulnerability.</p></speech>

The global economy makes this less likely, but interest rate rises must pose a substantial risk to that cohort.  Anecdotally, many people who have managed to bring their monthly finances into line because of the reduction in interest rates would be extremely vulnerable if interest rates were to rise.  How do interest rate rises compare with the other factors to which Dr. Cassidy referred?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.99" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019022700002#N02000"><p>I agree.  There has been a sustained period of extremely low official interest rates.  While mortgage rates for those on variable interest rates have been higher than those in other European countries, there is a very large group of people who are on tracker interest rates.  In fact, the share of tracker interest rates among those who bought property just before the crisis and who are, therefore, the most vulnerable cohort is extremely high.  While those mortgage holders may have suffered negative equity and reductions in their wealth because of prices, they have been protected to an extent from an affordability perspective by tracker mortgage rates remaining so low.  Once official interest rates begin to increase, that cohort will start to see an increase in their repayments for the first time.  There is a potential financial stability risk there.  During the time that has gone on, most borrowers have been paying down their debts so the vulnerability has reduced.  However, there is a cohort which is highly indebted and which will find repayment burdens increasing significantly when interest rates rise.  That will increase the risk to a shock but even under normal circumstances, they will find themselves more stretched.  This is an area where it is crucial to examine the different groupings as the aggregate figures mask the vulnerability somewhat.  However, the cohort of those aged between 35 and 45 years who bought at the peak prior to the crisis is vulnerable to higher interest rates.</p></speech>

I have had the pleasure to meet the group on a number of occasions.  There are a number of things at issue, the first of which is the abolition of the old borough council in Drogheda.  Drogheda is an historical town with a proud tradition and the removal of statutory powers from the borough council was abhorrent, as it was in the case of my town of Navan.  The removal of borough council status resulted in the removal of the managerial structure, which meant that there were no specific engineering staff for Drogheda, as well as no specfic budgetary policy.  That was the wrong decision for a town the size of Drogheda.</p> <p>  The second issue is that a significant part of Drogheda sprawls into County Meath.  Drogheda is the base for commercial activity and educational purposes for people living in parts of County Meath within the boundaries of Meath County Council.  </p> <p>  The petition is specific in seeking city status for Drogheda.</p><p>On the interim measures, I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, has come forward with proposals, not just for this part of Meath and Louth, in terms of Drogheda, but other areas where there is urban sprawl from a main town into an adjoining county.  That was pulled from the legislation that we dealt with just after Christmas, in respect of creating urban area committees.  There is huge potential for us, as legislators, to consider that option in order that we can get cohesive planning because bad planning has happened in the past by just natural sprawl.  We must ensure that citizens who live in these areas of sprawl get the services that they require, which should be the focus of everything that drives us, regardless of whether one lives on the Meath or Louth side, the Kilkenny or Waterford side or the Roscommon or Westmeath side, in deference to my colleague seated beside me, Deputy Eugene Murphy.  We must look after these citizens and ensure they get a good deal for the town in which they live.   </p><p> In respect of the campaign here, I note the presence of my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd.  He is an advocate for the town of Drogheda and a former member of the local council.  I also note that the town is naturally growing.  In terms of its status, I have an issue, which I have conveyed to the committee and publically as well, with statistics being used in the composition of the overall figures that would take in not just part of the coastal area of Meath but the wider hinterland of Meath into Duleek and so forth.  I have a problem with the practice that I have articulated.  There is a way forward for the people of Drogheda, as a proud town, to obtain what they want but I reiterate, as a representative of the county of Meath, that parts of Meath cannot be annexed in order to achieve that goal.</p></speech>

The area has grown phenomenally in Drogheda, east Meath and south Louth.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has released figures that show the town of Drogheda has a population in excess of 40,000.  On the north side of Drogheda there is planning permission for over 5,000 homes and on the south side of Drogheda, there is huge development both in County Meath and in Drogheda itself.  I think a critical mass will be reached by the next census.  The CSO has told me that the population of the town will exceed 50,000 within the next five years or so.</p> <p>  I believe that the petition should be left open.  Also, the correspondence received from the Department does not address the issue of city status at all, which is one good reason to keep the petition open.  There is an even better reason for doing so.  The people of the Drogheda area have no control over their destiny, they have no local council and all of the administration is based in Dundalk.  This is a town that is bigger than the administrative counties of Longford or Leitrim.  It is unacceptable that Drogheda would not be designated a city and have its own city manager. </p> <p>  Galway was deemed a city when its population reached 38,000.  What happened then was that the county manager of Galway became the city manager for Galway city and the county manager for Galway county.  That person held both positions until retirement, after which the jobs were advertised separately.  As part of the process, the present county manager should be made a county manger of the city of Drogheda and when she ceases to hold that office, a county manager for the city of Drogheda should be appointed.  In that way the budgets would be merged and there would be a complete regulation of how budgets are managed, who gets what and who contributes to what.</p> <p>  In east Meath there are huge planning issues and a huge controversy about developments, which are the subject of serious complaints and high-level investigations into planning irregularities.  There was one plan for the whole area that was produced by Meath County Council and Louth County Council but it was overturned by a former municipal council area in east Meath, which led to a huge and disgraceful controversy.  To avoid all of that I ask that we seek further clarification, contact the Central Statistics Office and examine the process.  This is the first time that I have attended this committee and I am not an official member of the committee.  However, I call on the committee to examine the process by which an area gets city status, and I mean discover the nuts and bolts of what one must do in terms of administrative joining up together.</p> <p>  One cannot hold back the town of Drogheda and it is going to be a city.  It is the biggest town in Ireland outside of the main cities.  I ask the committee to keep this issue alive, hold further debates and seek more facts.  We must control our destiny.  A local bid committee is trying to raise funding to improve the town and have additionality from the business community.  The committee is very anxious that that would happen.  Drogheda wants to improve and grow, the recognition of which would be to make Drogheda a city.  Making it a city is only a word.  Drogheda must have a city manager and the accompanying administrative powers and infrastructure. </p></speech>

We must have regard to the response that we received from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government through its assistant secretary general.  Once one reads the document, one realises that it does not address the issue of city status, which is the subject of the petition that we are dealing with today.  On that basis, there is a proposal here to acknowledge the fact that Deputy Cassells has addressed his concerns about the population of 6,500 that would come from the Meath side and the issues addressed by Deputy O'Dowd in respect of the CSO projections about reaching city status within five years or thereabouts.</p></speech>

I respectfully suggest that they would be dealt with within the relevant line Department or line committees that deal with the environment and housing as that is the most appropriate way to do so.</p></speech>

It would be important for the status to be addressed as well.</p> <p>  As I stated in my speech, I fully support the reinstatement of the entire administrative structure.  Indeed, I have a Bill that has reached Committee Stage that seeks to achieve that aim not just for Drogheda but for every major town in this country.

The purpose of today's meeting is to have an engagement with Mr. Pat Rabbitte following his nomination by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, as chairperson designate of Tusla with effect from 1 January 2019.  This is an opportunity for the joint committee to discuss with Mr. Rabbitte his vision and strategic priorities for his term of office.  I welcome Mr. Rabbitte to the meeting and thank him for appearing before the committee.</p><p>I draw the attention of the witness to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind those present to turn off their mobile telephones or switch them to flight mode as they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  Television coverage and web streaming may also be adversely affected.</p><p>I advise Mr. Rabbitte that any submission or opening statement he has provided to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I call on Mr. Rabbitte to make his opening statement, after which there will be questions from committee members.</p></speech>

As the committee will know, I have spent most of my working life in public service of one kind or another and I approach the challenge of chairperson of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, from that perspective.</p> <p>  The agency is tasked with improving the service for vulnerable children and families throughout the country.  Although it is a young agency, very considerable progress has been made since its establishment in 2014.  It is my observation that in the intervening period, there has been little enough attention given to the very positive narrative that Tusla has to tell.</p><p>Perhaps that is the nature of the very demanding and sensitive work that goes on in child protection, day in and day out.  Of course, deficiencies in the agency have also been highlighted in recent years and it is undeniable that challenges continue to exist.  It is also undeniable that there is a transformation under way in the priority that public policy now attaches to caring for vulnerable children and in supporting families who need assistance, as compared to even more recent history.</p><p> As regards the quality of service and consistency of practice, it is unavoidable that there are legacy issues and cultural changes that must be confronted.  Resources are finite and recruitment of professional staff, particularly social workers, is very challenging.  Additional resources over the past couple of years are very welcome but there will never be sufficient resources to meet all of the challenges.  In respect of the core business, the shortage of social workers leaves the agency vulnerable to criticism when non-compliance with best practice is sometimes established.</p><p> The statute from which Tusla derives its existence, the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, is uniquely prescriptive.  As a result, there are hugely onerous responsibilities on the board and on the chief executive and executive management.  Perhaps this is a positive pressure to continue to raise our standards on the protection of children as compared to the past.  However, it does mean there is an inordinate demand on executive time to dwell on compliance and bureaucratic matters.</p><p> Tusla has come through a difficult time over the past 18 months or so.  In my view, the agency is the stronger for it, provided we can show that we have learned the lessons.  The challenge of caring for vulnerable children and families will never attain perfection.  However, an enormous amount of thought and work has gone into bedding down the new agency and evolving best practice.  I hope I will be able to help drive that ongoing progress and motivate the undoubted capacity within Tusla to further improve and develop our child and family protection services.  I am satisfied that we have the people with the necessary skills and dedication to provide our vulnerable children with a world-class service.  Tusla needs to be more transparent and there is no reason the agency should fear greater openness, which is not to say that, on occasion, there are very particular reasons for restraint.  There are sometimes competing rights, and reasonable judgement must apply.  We may be mistaken if we presume we can change the inherited culture of an organisation by excessive micromanagement or by multiplying the mechanisms for oversight.</p><p> There are a number of immediate priorities that I would like to progress.  I will be glad to try to answer any questions the committee members have for me.</p></speech>

We are addressing an issue in respect of Mr. Rabbitte's chairing of Tusla.  He is a former colleague so it feels very strange to be on this side of the table when he is on that side.  I acknowledge Mr. Rabbitte's stellar public service.  As he stated, he has spent much of his life in public service.  On a personal level, I am of the view that he will bring a perspective that reflects that public service to his role as chairperson of Tusla.  He will have a very strong understanding of the dynamics that drive the type of work we, as public representatives, so and the challenges we face in representing constituents whose families interface with organisations like the HSE and Tusla.  He will have a very intimate knowledge of that and, because he has that perspective, it will very much drive the type of culture to which he refers.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Rabbitte's opening statement.  I sense from it that there is a need for Tusla to be very open in terms of how it operates and also in recognising the challenges that it faces as an organisation.  I wish Mr. Rabbitte well in the role.  Today is perhaps just a starting point in deepening the relationship between Tusla as an organisation and this committee.</p> <p>  Mr. Rabbitte made reference to the challenges he faces, particularly in respect of the shortage of social workers, which has a massive bearing on the interaction between the family unit and the State in terms of the societal issues that exist.  I want to delve a bit deeper into the issue of recruitment.  We had a very positive interaction with Tusla in respect of the challenges it faces and the interactions it is having with academia in the context of trying to recruit social workers in a very competitive space where, arguably, the issues that exist mean that it is competing on a global level for talent.  I wonder if there needs to be a stronger political input at Government level and on a cross-departmental basis between the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills, for example, in the context of ownership of this as a policy issue.  I would like to hear Mr. Rabbitte's perspective on that, although I am conscious that he cannot stray too much into the political space.  We know there is a shortage of social workers and what the consequences of that shortage are.  We know people are doing their best within the organisation to manage their caseloads.  We also know that those caseloads are increasing exponentially, with a consequent rate of attrition among social workers.  If we can crack that nut collectively as between the Oireachtas, the Minister and Tusla, we will be doing a good day's work in respect of the operation of Tusla.</p> <p>  My only intervention today is to see if we can get a greater perspective, even at this early stage, in respect of what the Oireachtas needs to do or focus on in respect of the recruitment issues and what Government could be doing in respect of facing those challenges.</p></speech>

He is right about the relationship between the agency and politics and the political environment generally.  A great deal more can be done in that regard.  Outside of this committee, I greatly doubt if Members of the Oireachtas are as familiar with the work of Tusla as one might expect, given that, as constituency politicians, they encounter these issues from time to time.  The responsibility for that rests with Tusla in terms of promoting the good narrative it has to tell, as well as the deficiencies that have been highlighted in various inquiries and so on.  There is a good story to tell and I would welcome forging that closer link with politics to which Deputy Sherlock refers.  I am very happy to invite the Chairman and his colleagues to the Brunel Building to meet us for a presentation tailored to meet their needs and to address the suggestions that would come from members of the committee.</p><p>That might be of help to both of us.</p><p> Deputy Sherlock raised the big issue of recruitment.  I am aware that the committee recently had an opportunity to discuss this issue with the chief executive and members of the senior management team.  There is undoubtedly a major issue for the agency.  It is also a large part of the explanation for some of the deficiencies highlighted in the HIQA report, for example.  Even though Tusla has recruited 800 social workers since 2014 - it has had to run very fast to stand still - the net gain has been minimal at 4%.  Last year was a good example.  We recruited approximately 60% of the available social workers - I think the exact number was something like 142 - but 158 social workers retired or left the service for other reasons.  That gives the committee an idea.  In 2018, 142 social workers were recruited and 158 social workers left through retirement and other reasons.  It is a huge issue for us.  We have to look at whether the training and education of social workers should continue to be the remit of the traditional universities only.  I think we have to look outside the traditional universities.  We also have to look at the possibilities for people in other grades to convert to becoming social workers.  Why, for example, should there not be a conversion course for social care workers?</p><p> I will respond to Deputy Sherlock's particular point by emphasising that this issue cannot be resolved by Tusla alone.  I would love to get into the car with the chief executive and go to see the new president of Technological University Dublin and the heads of the institutes of technology.  Those colleges have successfully produced skilled people for industry and business.  I am sure they would be responsive, but that is not the way things happen in the public service.  There is a high-level committee dealing with this matter.  As far as I can see, the universities have not made provision to increase the output.  I think 215 places are available each year.  I have not seen any proposals from the universities to tackle this problem next year.  In the meantime, there is great pressure on Tusla.  In an area I was dealing with recently, 33 social workers left last year.  There are 92 social workers on maternity leave.  That cannot happen without leaving gaps.  It really is a significant issue for us.</p></speech>

I will continue on the same theme.  Like Deputy Sherlock, I have a unique connection with Mr. Rabbitte.  In our case, we share the same surname.  It is a very unusual one.  I hope to keep the tradition of having a Rabbitte in Leinster House for another while.</p> <p>  As I have said, I would like to pick up on Deputy Sherlock's theme.  I am a Deputy for Galway East.  In the past, people would not have come to us regularly to talk about issues relating to their engagement with Tusla.  I assure Mr. Rabbitte that in the last three years, not a week has gone by without a representation coming before me looking for me to engage with a case.  I think this is where relationships need to improve and openness needs to get a little better.  If I have an issue regarding planning or anything else, I can deal with the county council.  If I want to have conversations with the chief executive of the council or any of the planners, there is no issue.  If I have an issue with the education and training boards, there is a direct line on which I can talk to people.  That is not the experience with Tusla nationally, regionally or locally.</p> <p>  This is not the first time I have made this point in this room.  I sometimes feel that it is a lockdown situation.  As Mr. Rabbitte has acknowledged, matters are sometimes dealt with on a need-to-know basis.  There must be dialogue and communication somewhere.  There has to be an understanding.  As my party's Front Bench spokesperson in this area, I feel I should have a relationship of openness with Tusla, but it is not there.  That is not for the want of trying on my part.  When people come before me, I fail to make progress in every single case.  That should not be the case.  When I engage with Tusla at local and regional levels, I am put on a recording.  There is an open conversation.  The call is recorded and there are three people sitting in on it.  To me, that is not how business should be done.  It leaves a sour taste.  Ultimately, we are talking for children in all of these cases.  We are concerned about the welfare of the child.  Families are looking for help in circumstances in which they feel they cannot make it.</p> <p>  I welcome what Mr. Rabbitte has said here this morning about bringing us forward and showing more openness to us.  That is something that actually needs to happen.  I ask him to ensure it does during his time as chairperson.  I have spoken previously about local government and the Department of Education and Skills.  Why can we not have the same level of support?  Why can we not have a two-way mechanism of communication between the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla?  The Chairman of the committee has raised this matter on numerous occasions.  I will leave it at that.  I will take Mr. Rabbitte at face value when he states that he will make progress.  That is what he has said to Deputy Sherlock.  I do not like the manner in which Tusla operates at this time.  There is a lack of responsiveness to phone calls and emails.  When one makes a call, one feels that it is not welcome.</p> <p>  Mr. Rabbitte stated that he would love to get into a car and drive to the institutes of technology, etc., to meet those involved.  I wonder whether we could look at this in another way by facilitating work experience.  We have to give young people in institutes of technology an opportunity to do work experience.  At present, there is no such opportunity.  Surely there has to be a mentoring programme at third level.  The transition year programme in secondary schools involves mentoring, etc.  A young lady has come to me to say she would love to get work experience.  She thought she would be able to do it in Yap Galway, but that service has now closed.  I would love to get involved with that level of care.  The young lady in question is in fourth year at Athlone of Institute of Technology.  She would love to be able to apply for a job with Tusla when she finishes fourth year.  People sometimes like to know what work experience is like, but it is not facilitated.  I totally understand everything to do with Garda vetting, etc.  These people would have it.  They are six months from qualifying.  Surely they are the people we should be putting the fishing line on and hooking in.  That is not a commentary.  It is a door that Mr. Rabbitte should be able to open.  He should be able to facilitate work experience and mentoring programmes and academies.  We are not talking about creating new spaces - we are talking about holding on to what is there.</p> <p>  I wonder whether the people who work in Tusla have the tools to do their jobs and to be facilitated in their caseloads.  This is something that has arisen in the past.  Has it arisen since Mr. Rabbitte took up this position?  We know that people are totally over-burdened with caseloads.  The difference between the caseloads of people who work in Tusla and the caseloads of people who work on similar matters in other organisations is twofold.  Do the staff of Tusla have the necessary mechanisms, including the IT mechanisms, to upload information when they leave a house and sit in the car?  They should be able to move on, rather than having to come back to the office to do paperwork that will then have to be aligned with the IT system.  What is the level of IT?</p><p>Implementing the affordable childcare scheme has taken more than three years because the information technology was not sufficient.  What IT is available to people on the ground?  Finally, Mr. Rabbitte said there are a number of immediate priorities he would like to progress.  Would he care to share them? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.145" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019022700002#D00200"><p>I would like to say to Deputy Rabbitte - I have always wanted to say that - that I understand her frustration about the major issues she has raised.  As she said, times have changed.  A lot of issues that were concealed or hidden in the past are more frankly confronted now.  I ask her to understand that intervening in a family is a very fine balance.  By training, social workers are very sensitive in walking that narrow line.  Perhaps the best way of enhancing our mutual knowledge about a <i>modus vivendi</i>in this area is the kind of engagement and political contact about which both Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Sherlock have spoken.  For example, last Friday the board spent a full day in Mullingar addressing issues affecting the midlands region.  The regional and local staff made detailed presentations to the board, which were immensely impressive.  There is no reason this could not be replicated for local Deputies, Senators and councillors.<br/><br/>I can see a potential difficulty in circumstances where a Deputy is confronted by parents in his or her clinic concerning a particular case.  It is very difficult in those circumstances to make a phone call to anybody - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla or whomsoever.  There is not much point in giving people half-baked information that can only be misleading.  There is room to enhance that understanding, as both Deputies have talked about.<br/><br/>Deputy Rabbitte is right about how times have changed.  There were 57,000 referrals last year.  If I stopped a person on the street and told him or her there were 57,000 referrals to Tusla last year, he or she would be amazed.  When I started in the job I asked the senior management team at my first meeting if that number was good or bad.  To a person, the team members said it was good because it meant that these issues were now being dealt with.  It means the existence of the agency is becoming known and obviously mandatory reporting is having an influence.  A 40% increase is amazing.  It shows the agency's workload.<br/><br/>Deputy Rabbitte asked whether staff, especially front-line staff, have the necessary tools to do the business.  They are certainly much better equipped than they were.  For example, an IT system has been in place since last July that is integrated across the entire system and the entire country.  The general response from staff who input information is that the system is a huge advantage.  Staff members have been provided with the devices they need.  Perhaps I should not make a blanket statement to that effect, but certainly a very large number of them have.  That is being advanced all the time. <br/><br/>On the question of work experience, I would not rule out any dimension in addressing this shortage.  Speaking of information technology and the tools of the trade, maybe there are straightforward administrative staff who could take some of the burden off social workers and let them focus on the professional area where they are needed.  I would not rule anything out.  However I am frustrated by pressure on the agency from different quarters, which I fully understand, to repair gaps in the service.  This critique comes with the acknowledgement that there is a shortage of social workers, not only here, but across the western world.  Regardless of that, we should somehow be able to address the gaps.  We are not showing any urgency about doing that.  If we aimed to have a similar number of social workers per thousand people here as in England, we would have to address a shortage of 1,500 social workers.  There is no point in my telling the committee that we need another 1,500 social workers, or in the agency preparing a workforce plan that says so.  That is simply because we are not going to get them.  They are not there.  In those circumstances, we have to look at creative solutions.  I would not rule out any of them, but there is a great need for more urgency in progressing this.  As Deputy Sherlock said, this involves the Department of Education and Skills.  We are competing with the HSE and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, for the 215 social workers turned out every year by the traditional universities.  We have circumstances where somebody wants to switch to an NGO after working for Tusla for two or three years.  There is always going to be movement of staff in and out, no matter what we do.  We can certainly work at strategies for retention and making the job more attractive.  Deputy Rabbitte may well be right that there are possibilities in allowing social workers to focus on the professional job that is their priority.</p></speech>

He is most welcome.  Like Deputy Sherlock, I find it a bit strange to see Mr. Rabbitte on the other side of the committee room, without his ministerial hat on.  His offer for the committee to meet him and the members of the executive team is welcome.  We have done that before.  It is probably something we should formalise and do on a more regular basis.  It would improve the committee's ability to perform its duties.</p> <p>  Other Deputies have touched on the lines of communication between committee members that enable us to perform our duties.  As Mr. Rabbitte is probably aware and may recollect, in the previous D&aacute;il term a circular was issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform instructing State agencies to set up an Oireachtas helpline or email service so that Members could liaise directly with an individual or group within any given Department or agency.  Tusla needs to look at that more closely to improve its ability to communicate with us in a timely manner.</p><p> As Deputy Rabbitte has pointed out, it is impossible for us to entertain a specific query when there is an element of pot luck regarding who we get on the end of the phone.  We will certainly not get an individual who is actually dealing with the specific case within the agency.  As far as I am aware, none of us is a professional in this field.  However, we have responsibilities.  Certain aspects of our role present us with difficult cases.  I am sure Mr. Rabbitte will be aware of the ongoing issues in Scouting Ireland which have brought numerous individuals to the doors of members of this committee and Members of the Oireachtas in general.  Some of the cases are extremely difficult for the individuals in question and also for the Members of the Oireachtas who are attempting to support them.  As Mr. Rabbitte has already commented on this issue, I am making a contribution rather than asking a question.</p><p> I would like to ask Mr. Rabbitte about the implementation of the strategic action plan in response to the HIQA investigation, which was published last summer.  The investigation threw up a number of difficulties for Tusla and for other agencies as well.  I refer, for example, to the question of whether they dealt with the Maurice McCabe issue in an effective manner.  Would Mr. Rabbitte be able to bring aspects of his vast experience in these Houses to bear on Tusla?  Does he think that elements of the HIQA report, which no doubt he has read or perused, should be implemented more quickly?  Are there are any other suggestions emanating from it?</p></speech>

I will come back to it.</p> <p>  I have been looking at the question of an Oireachtas helpline in the context of a different aspect of the matter, which is answers to parliamentary questions.  It is a very difficult area.  The Minister is very exercised by this issue as well.  I have had discussions with her about it.  The report I have received on it suggests to me that there are inadequate resources devoted to this area.  It is very important for the public to have confidence in Tusla.  The people with whom I interact in this role are professionals who are really dedicated to doing their jobs.  In my observation, they do not really engage very much with the outside world.  I think we need to look at that.  The business of answering parliamentary questions can be quite tricky because there is a very restricted space between when the questions come to us and when the answers need to be back with the Minister in time for her to prepare to go into the House.  If the question is tricky - it is clear that many Deputies will not submit a question unless it is tricky - it can be very difficult to get in touch with the key hands-on person to source the information.  I think we can improve the process.  I think we need to improve it.  I take the Chairman's general point about an Oireachtas helpline.  We need to look at resources in this context.</p> <p>  We need to look at the possibility of a spokesperson for the agency.  If one looks at many other bodies, one will find that they all have people, whom any member of this committee could name off the top of his or her head, who communicate to the Oireachtas and the world at large and who speak on radio and television about their areas of responsibility.  We badly need such a person.  It would be a shame if there were members of the public whose only knowledge of Tusla was the Maurice McCabe affair that was mentioned by the Chairman.  Many good things are happening in Tusla, but we are not putting them out there.  I agree with the Chairman that egregious errors were made in the Maurice McCabe situation.  In my observation, Tusla as an organisation was entirely too defensive in the way it responded to it.  I recently received a letter from the Charleton tribunal clarifying the point that Mr. Justice Charleton did not indict the agency.  He indicted the local management and the local people concerned with the Cavan-Monaghan situation.  That clarification was welcome.  Nonetheless, I would say that in my observation, it unnecessarily convulsed the organisation.  It was overly defensive about it.  What happened should not have happened under any set of circumstances.  We all make mistakes.  When it happened, people should have come out and simply told the truth.</p> <p>  Obviously, the HIQA report referred to by the Chairman is to the centre and front in the tasks we now face.  To go back to Deputy Rabbitte's question, one of my priorities for the agency is to continue to implement the recommendations of the HIQA report, insofar as resources permit.  Good progress is being made.  As the Chairman knows, the Minister has established an expert assurance group to ride shotgun on the implementation of those recommendations.  There is regular engagement in that regard.  In fact, I am meeting the chairman of the expert assurance group on Monday.  Progress is being made.  In some areas, we are back to the question of resources and priorities.  If the members of this committee were confronted with a situation in which a choice had to be made about the protection and welfare of the children of today, as compared to historical or retrospective cases of many years ago, I think most of them would decide that we must firstly ensure no child today is at risk without an effective and immediate response from Tusla.  One of HIQA's conclusions that seldom makes the headlines is that regardless of the deficiencies it highlights, it always points out that there has never been a risk to a child which has not received an immediate response from Tusla.  That is very important.  HIQA is very important in terms of driving standards and so on.  By definition, it often engages in a fault-finding exercise.</p><p>We should remember, as Deputy Rabbitte said, that it is not very many years ago that we attached a very low importance to this area.  Suddenly, there seems to be a universal expectation that we should be at leading-edge on every aspect of it, some five years after the agency was established.  There is need for balance there.</p><p> The questions the Chairman raised are part of my priorities.  My first priority is to put a chief executive in place.  The post, notwithstanding the confidentiality which surrounds it, although I do not see why there is be, is being advertised on 8 March.  That is a very important appointment for obvious reasons.</p><p> Staff retention and recruitment is a further priority.  Continuing to implement the HIQA recommendations is another priority.  I talked about improving communications to the public and the political environment and that is another priority.  Addressing unallocated cases is a further priority, although not in terms of priority, as these are all matters that have to be progressed in sync.  On the question of unallocated cases, it is comforting to be advised that there are not  cases, which are not being attended to, piling up somewhere in a cupboard or a filing cabinet, and I have met the local management in Galway, I was in Mullingar last Friday and I have been in other areas.  "Unallocated cases" does not mean they have not been screened.  If there is any immediate risk to a child, that is attended to.  That is important because people have the impression that if it is an unallocated case, it is not getting attention at all, and that it might be substantive and urgent.  </p><p> In that regard, Deputy Rabbitte's point about whether staff have the tools of the trade to do the job is relevant because until last July, it was a paper-based system.  That is a hugely significant point in the world we live in.  It accounts for some of the criticisms of HIQA about discrepancies or inconsistencies in practice between different parts of the country and so on.  I am advised that that IT system is working very well and is greeted with positivity by the staff also.</p></speech>

There are nonetheless so many services that the agency provides that the general public needs to hear about on a more regular basis.  In those priorities listed by Mr. Rabbitte, the agency's communication with the general public on the family supports and resources that are available through it should become more central to the message that is being put out there by the agency.

I intended to plough ahead but on mature reflection, I felt that it might be more prudent to wait until a chief executive was in place because I do not think the recruitment of a spokesperson should be seen to function for the chairman.  It should be for the agency and the chief executive who has the responsibility there.  I agree that it is a position that-----</p></speech>

I had questions to ask him but he has answered these.  I want to touch on the promotion of Tusla.  This is vital work.  I am well aware of the fantastic work Tusla is doing across all communities in this State, in supporting families and young children.  I recall speaking to the previous CEO and saying to him that this was something that we needed to get out there.  These are the positive stories and good work that is being done in communities.  I wish Mr. Rabbitte the very best with that and, hopefully, that will be taken on board.  There are families who are not even aware that these services exist.  I would very much like to see that being rolled out across communities.</p> <p>  I was very happy to hear Mr. Rabbitte talk about the retention of social workers.  This is not only a problem for the agency, but it is also one for the children.  We have children who have developed really good relationships with social workers that were built on trust.  When social workers move on and a new social worker comes in and that trust needs to be rebuilt again.  I welcome the fact Mr. Rabbitte talked about social work administrative staff.  That is vital because we need our social workers on the ground, working with children and the families.  We do not want to see them having to go back to offices and getting bogged down in administrative work.  Does Mr. Rabbitte believe that we could look at the possibility of an internal operational review of that particular kind of work being carried out in Tusla itself?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019022700002#F01000"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The short answer to the point on promotion and explaining Tusla to the public is that there is general agreement on that.  The board was supportive of the idea.  I raised it at the first meeting I had with the Minister and she certainly thinks that it is a very good idea that the public should know and have confidence in the organisation and that some of the good work the Deputy referred to should be put out there by us.</p> <p>  Having said what I said about HIQA, and how somebody must invigilate standards and best practice, some of the HIQA material I have seen is very high quality as to rigour and so on, but by definition it is a fault-finding exercise.  When the report comes out, one will find laid out very simply what the problems, deficiencies and non-compliance are.  It is very easy to promote such material.  There is rarely a pat on the head or an acknowledgement of the very many good things that are going on at the same time.</p><p>I agree with Deputy Mitchell that that should be done.</p><p> Unless the Deputy has a particular point to make on it, I would like to think that kind of internal review is going on all of the time.  I have said to the board that in my experience I have never seen a more prescriptive piece of legislation than the statute that establishes Tusla.  That reflects the circumstances in which it was born, and some of the high profile material that came into the public domain.  It is hugely prescriptive and piled on top of that are several mechanisms of oversight.  We have been discussing, for example, the expert advisory group.  It seems to me, on balance, that it has been helpful because it has put a focus on that particular area and it has driven the agency to respond.  The scale of oversight includes oversight agreements with the Department, protocols on this, memoranda of understanding on that, the expert advisory group, HIQA, performance statements, interaction with the Department, regular meetings with the Minister, structured meetings with the Minister meeting the board, and appearances before the Oireachtas committee.  Any one of those could be very good on its own, but sometimes I wonder whether more is less and if the senior management can afford to apply itself to the job it should be doing.  One cannot relegate the preparation of reports for the Department, the Minister, the Oireachtas committee or whomsoever to junior staff.  It has to be done by the senior staff.  We should be careful that we do not take away from what is their primary duty, namely, to drive change management and implement the matters that are now in the public domain.  It is not that we do not know what needs to be done better, but it is having the time to cause it to happen.</p><p> Culture is a very difficult thing to tackle in any organisation.  We have an inherited culture.  There probably are people who say they have been doing this for 25 years and they know how it should be done, and they do not care how it is done in some other region.  There is a culture there and, as Deputy Rabbitte said, times have changed.  We need to confront that.  Only senior management can drive that change programme.</p></speech>

I have a couple of quick questions for Mr. Rabbitte.  I agree with what he said about the change in culture.  It takes years to build culture and one can break it in a day.  One can build the culture of a company and then it can just go in an instant.  However, that does not contradict what Mr. Rabbitte just said about building up a good culture again.</p> <p>  I was on the Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care and I have worked in IT.  We are coming from the outside.  I have come across what was said about Tusla in other organisations and I am aware of how electronic communication fosters accountability.  With electronic communication there is always someone at the other end and he or she can be identified.  I was surprised and shocked to hear there is no electronic communication in Tusla.  That has been highlighted on the mental health side as well in terms of the operation of public service organisations.  There is correlation there as well and, as Mr. Rabbitte said, there needs to be catch-up.  Coming from the outside I cannot understand why the catch-up did not happen earlier.  I do not want to go back over old ground but I think that is the reason there was a lot of surprise and shock that such electronic communication did not exist.</p> <p>  Where are we in terms of the introduction of electronic communication in the change management agenda and the implementation of new systems, in particular mobile systems for social workers that free up their work so that they can be front of house?  There are also systems that would help the business function of Tusla and free up the time of senior management.  What is the level of progress with the change management process?  Are we 50% there or 70% there?  What is the status of electronic integration with the Garda?  Some of the examples that were highlighted related to a communications breakdown or mismanagement.  I should choose my words carefully.  There was a mismanagement of communications between both sectors.  Electronic communication was not there so there was no record.  Even basic emails can work.  I asked Mr. Rabbitte's predecessor about email consultation.  It is an electronic form of communication, as opposed to paper communication.</p> <p>  I want to put on record the good work done by social workers and those on the front line in Tusla.  I want that message to go out.  Sometimes, we can harp on about things and it is our job to try to identify problems and turn stones over to find out where we can improve the system, but the message must not supersede what the system is there to do in the first place, namely, to provide protection.  It is imperative on us to get that message out into the public domain as well.  I would appreciate if Mr. Rabbitte could answer my question on change management.  I thank him for coming before the committee.</p></speech>

His last point about the work social workers do is very important.  Some of us would find it very difficult to do that job, week in, week out.  People do suffer from burnout.  I do not belong to the Jos&eacute; Mourinho school of management where I criticise my own players.  I do not think that is a good policy.  There is a lot to praise in Tusla.</p> <p>  I am reluctant to answer Deputy Neville's question about the percentage of the change management process that has been achieved and whether it is 70% or more in terms of social workers having the mobility and wherewithal to do their jobs without being reliant on the old system.</p></speech>

Change management is happening and it has a timeline.  Is it over two, three or four years?  That is how it happens in any major organisation.  I want to ascertain where Tusla is in the timeline for change management, as opposed to the specifics.</p></speech>

It is important to remind ourselves that the agency came into being at the nadir of our fortunes economically.  Deputy Neville is in a majority.  People throw their hands up in amazement that we had a paper-based system until recently.  The facts of the matter are that insufficient moneys were allocated during the foundation period of the agency for all of the reasons that we know.  Fortunately, things have changed.  Economic recovery has been faster than anybody suggested at the time.  Whether it is even is a political question and does not concern us here.  The Minister has found significant additional resources, especially in the past two years.  People expert in the area assure me that the national childcare information system, NCCIS, is working very well.  They place a lot of value on the fact that it is embraced by front-line staff.</p><p>There may be some exceptions to that about which I am not being told - I do not know - but, generally speaking, people see it as a positive.  It certainly offers great possibilities with regard to the time wasted under the old system.  As well as setting the foundation of the agency in the economic circumstances of 2014, we also have to recognise that we have had three chief executives in that very short time.  I hope the chief executive will be confirmed in the post in the next couple of months, although that might be ambitious.  Driving the change management programme has to be the priority of whoever is confirmed in the post.  The expertise and professionalism is there in respect of the core business.  The role of the chief executive has to be that of a manager.  Driving that programme will be his or her priority.  We have been talking to the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  As I have said, the post will be advertised on 8 March.  I cannot give the committee any assessment of how quick or how successful the process will be.</p></speech>

We are talking about an organisation with 4,000 employees and 500 agency staff which has a very precise statutory obligation to discharge in a very complex and sensitive area.  Would every chief executive out there apply for the job with the salary and duration of tenure offered?  The duration also concerns me.  I have made representations to the Minister on both the salary and the duration.  If one was to look for somebody outside of the jurisdiction, would such a person transfer to Ireland for a five-year term in light of the present day housing circumstances and other issues?  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will always provide reasons for not changing the salary.  That is its natural impulse, for obvious reasons.</p></speech>

There is a strong argument for a seven-year term.

I do not expect a substantive answer at this stage.  I want to put on record the fact that this committee had been dealing with matters in Scouting Ireland and that a helpline has now been set up.  More than 200 cases, and possibly well in excess of that number, have been reported in<i>The Irish Times</i>.  If we are talking about the relationship between the Oireachtas and Tusla, my concern is that there should be some understanding of the dynamic between Tusla and Scouting Ireland in respect of the handling of those cases.  If the number of cases has gone north of 200 - and there is a Scouting Ireland helpline in respect of that issue - I would like to return to the issue at some point in the future, perhaps when the chief executive has been appointed, in order to inform ourselves of the dynamic that exists with regard to the handling of those cases.  I do not even expect a response to that point at this juncture.  I just wished to put it on the record.</p></speech>

We will hear a presentation from LGBT Ireland.  We invited representatives of the Iona Institute to this meeting but since the institute had made a presentation via Dr. Joanna Rose at our meeting on 19 December last, it did not propose to add to its testimony.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome from LGBT Ireland, Dr. Lydia Bracken, legal adviser, and Ms Paula Fagan, chief executive.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the joint committee.  If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses that any opening statements they make to the committee may be published on its website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Ms Fagan to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by our legal adviser, Dr. Lydia Bracken, who authored our recent submission, and we will split our opening statement time between us.  Our aim today is to give the committee an understanding of the specific challenges facing same-sex parents and their children in the absence of a clear legislative framework in Ireland relating to donor assisted human reproduction and surrogacy.</p> <p>  By way of introduction, I should explain that LGBT Ireland is a national charitable organisation which provides support and advocacy services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and their family members.  We provide this through a confidential help line service as well as face-to-face supports through our peer support groups.  The issues raised through our front-line services inform our advocacy work.  In 2017, calls and emails requesting information on parenting rights were the most frequent advocacy inquiries to our organisation.  This led us to hold a series of public meetings and events in Dublin, Cork and Galway in 2018, where we met with hundreds of families and same-sex couples planning parenthood.  It is their experiences that inform our submission and input to the committee today.</p> <p>  The proposals we put forward are based on protecting the best interests of the child and are informed by reference to the rights of the child under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 42A of the Constitution.  It is argued that the best interests of the child are met through laws that recognise the reality of life for the child and that ensure the child can be fully cared for by the adults whom he or she regards as parents.  For children raised in families headed by same-sex parents, this means that they should have the opportunity of acquiring a legal relationship with both intended parents and those parents should have all the legal tools necessary to care for their children.</p> <p>  The reality for children being raised by same-sex parents in Ireland today is that they have no way of establishing a legal parental relationship to both parents who care for them.  This disproportionately affects donor conceived children with same-sex parents as their relationship to both parents is often questioned, causing considerable stress and uncertainty for these families.  This is particularly so where medical consent is required or when obtaining legal documents such as passports but it also arises in everyday situations, for example, providing consent for school trips.  Several families we spoke to have children with serious health conditions that require ongoing medical attention, and for these parents the stresses caused by the lack of legal rights put an additional strain on them.</p> <p>  While we acknowledge this is complex legislation and support the thorough examination of all issues involved, we ask that the committee progress its deliberations urgently.  This is a time sensitive issue, and families and couples planning parenthood cannot wait indefinitely.  The lack of clear regulations leaves couples making decisions about donor assisted human reproduction pathways based on what they think and guess the legislation will be, which may have far-reaching implications for their future family life.  As each day passes the number of families living in legal limbo is increasing and this will continue until legislation in this area is fully commenced and widely communicated.  It is imperative that the proposed legislation includes retrospective provisions to cover families that already exist.</p> <p>  I will hand over now to Dr. Bracken to continue our submission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.179" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019022700002#L00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting us to attend today's hearing.</p> <p>  Our submission concentrates on the proposed regulation of surrogacy as set out in the Bill, with a particular focus on how the proposed regulation would affect male couples who have already become parents through surrogacy and those who may seek to do so in the future.  In our view, the proposed regulation of surrogacy as set out in the Bill would not adequately protect the best interests of children born through surrogacy, so amendments are required.  A major issue in the proposed regulation is that there is no provision in the Bill to recognise children who have already been born through surrogacy.  For male couples, this means there is no facility to retrospectively recognise both men as joint legal parents of their child.  The only option is for the couple to apply for second parent adoption, which we do not believe to be an adequate solution.  By contrast, where a child has been born through donor assisted human reproduction, DAHR, once Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 are commenced, the intended parents will be able to retrospectively apply to be jointly registered as legal parents.  A similar process should be put in place for surrogacy.</p> <p>  International surrogacy is currently excluded from the Bill, meaning that the legislation will only apply to domestic arrangements.  This is problematic because the exclusion of international surrogacy from the Bill will not prevent couples from accessing services abroad.  It simply creates significant difficulties for the family when they return to Ireland with their child.  The child has no control over the circumstances of conception and so should not be disadvantaged by virtue of the fact that he or she was conceived through surrogacy abroad.  We argue that it is in the best interests of the child for his or her relationship with the intended parents to be legally recognised in Ireland following the international surrogacy arrangement.</p> <p>  We also believe that the model of parentage that is proposed in the Bill, whereby the surrogate is recognised as the legal mother at birth and parentage is later transferred to the intended parents by way of a parental order, is inappropriate.  A major difficulty that arises with this delayed or post-birth model of parentage is that, at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth, the non-genetic father is not recognised as a legal parent and cannot be recognised until the time that the parental order is granted.  The application for the parental order cannot be made earlier than six weeks and not more than six months after the child's birth.  This approach leaves the child in a vulnerable position as he or she is cared for from birth by the intended parents, one of whom will not have any legal parental responsibility or decision making powers for at least six weeks.  Instead, the surrogate, as the legal mother, retains decision making responsibility for the child until the time the parental order is granted.</p> <p>  We argue that a pre-conception model of parentage would better protect the rights of all stakeholders in the surrogacy process.  Pre-conception court orders would provide approval of the surrogacy arrangement and determine the parentage of the child before conception takes place.  This would ensure that both of the intended parents have full legal powers to care for the child and ensure that the child is legally integrated into his or her family from the moment of birth.</p> <p>  Certain additional issues relating to assisted human reproduction are of particular concern to LGBT Ireland members, such as non-clinical DAHR procedures and international DAHR.  While we acknowledge that these issues are not addressed in the Bill and are, perhaps, outside of the scope of today's hearing, we believe that they are in need of attention.  The Bill could be used as a way to amend the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 to ensure that it accommodates the widest range of families possible.  These areas, and our recommendations for reform, are discussed in detail in our submission and we are happy to speak to them today should any member wish to do so.</p></speech>

We had more matters than usual to deal with this morning and I thank them for their patience.  I have some questions initially and we might have the opportunity of another round of questions later because this is a matter we must tease out.  The submission refers to issues around a second parent adoption.  Dr. Bracken said: "The only option is for the couple to apply for second parent adoption, which we do not believe to be an adequate solution."  Perhaps she will outline the difficulties with it, apart from the obvious two levels of parent which is not going to work.</p><p>What specific difficulties do the witnesses foresee?  Some people would consider second parent adoption to be a workable solution, while recognising that it is not ideal.  However, I believe this will create more problems than it fixes.  The witnesses might outline their views on that. </p></speech>

There is a two year waiting period before second parent adoption becomes an option in the first instance.  Where the waiting period has not been met and the spouse or cohabiting partner has been caring for the child for less than two years - for example, where the child is under the age of two - a full joint adoption will be required.  In a full joint adoption, the birth parent has to give up his or her existing legal rights and jointly adopt with his or her partner or spouse.  That changes the child's status in terms of the biological parent and is an unnecessarily complicated situation.  This is the main legal reason that second parent adoption is not a viable solution to be used in cases of donor assisted human reproduction, DAHR, or surrogacy.</p></speech>

It is waiting for this legislation to come into effect, so that option is not currently available to people.  As Ms Bracken outlined, we do not consider it appropriate, particularly from a child's point of view.  Children understand adoption.  They know people in their classrooms at school who are adopted or others in their families.  They understand on an emotional level what that means.  It is a very different situation where the parents intended to have the child and have always been there for them.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Fagan for outlining that because, while it may seem on the surface that this approach ticks all the boxes, I believe it will create more problems, including difficulties for the child.  We must focus on that.  It might save us an enormous amount of work if we look at other jurisdictions where such a provision has been implemented correctly.  Do the witnesses know of countries which have done this?  Perhaps we can copy their homework.</p></speech>

That type of approach is used in a number of jurisdictions around the world.  New Hampshire was mentioned as a model of very good practice at the previous hearing.  My academic research has looked at the South African model.  Both models are very appropriate.  They are both based on pre-conception court orders, where one goes to court before the child has been conceived.  Within that court process one gains authorisation to engage in the surrogacy, and parentage is allocated at the outset.  This provides certainty at the beginning as to who the parents are once the child is born.  It means that once the baby is born, the focus can be on caring for the newborn and going to court again to fix legal parentage issues is not necessary.  Those two jurisdictions are very good models of surrogacy, and perhaps provide appropriate blueprints which Ireland might look to when regulating this area.</p></speech>

People are potentially facing legal battles at a time of their lives when they are up in the middle of the night.  The last thing that one wants to do in such circumstances is dig out one's work clothes and make one's way to court.</p> <p>  An issue that was discussed here on a previous occasion, and which is being discussed in other fora, is surrogacy.  Very valid issues have been raised about the potential coercion of women, particularly vulnerable women or those from a disadvantaged background.  Will the witnesses speak about the potential protections for women that we, as legislators, can put in place?  Nobody in this room or outside it wants to be responsible for a situation where we assent to the coercion of vulnerable women outside or within this State.  How can we legally provide those protections?  Nobody wants that to be an unintended consequence.</p></speech>

To do both it is important that we focus on an altruistic model of surrogacy.  Rather than engaging in a commercial surrogacy regime, which poses the risk of offering financial incentives for people to act as a surrogate and skewing any informed consent provided, a focus on an altruistic model would ensure that people are not being distracted by other financial issues going into the arrangement from the outset.  In addition, it is important that surrogates are provided with appropriate counselling in advance in order that they understand their role and to ensure they are not being coerced into it.  They should also be provided with independent legal advice to ensure they have made an informed choice to become a surrogate and understand the legal and social implications of their role as a surrogate.  By putting those safeguards in place, we can protect women who act as surrogates and the children, as well as intending parents.  Those safeguards can be legislated for.</p></speech>

There are also provisions on counselling and independent legal advice for surrogates.  We could draw on those other jurisdictions to find a model of best practice to ensure that coercion does not occur.</p></speech>

Are there any concerns about a lack of rights for the surrogate in terms of the parental switch?  We have just had a big referendum on bodily autonomy for women.  If I understand the proposal correctly, at some point before birth, whether during the pregnancy or before it, a court order will be made to the effect that from the moment of birth the two parents, neither of whom is bearing the child, are the legal parents of the child.  The corollary is that the woman giving birth loses any of those rights ahead of time.  Are there any issues of bodily autonomy for the woman bearing the child during the pregnancy?  Might a woman give birth and then want to change her mind in terms of giving up the child?  How are those two issues being considered in terms of court orders being in place ahead of birth?</p></speech>

If any issue arises during the pregnancy, it is for the surrogate to determine.  She retains her bodily integrity in that way.</p> <p>  I will preface my comments on a surrogate wanting to change her mind by stating that I am a legal academic as opposed to someone with specialist knowledge in sociology or psychology, but the research that I have read shows that such cases are highly unusual.  At the previous committee hearing on this issue, a figure of 4% was mentioned.  I am not sure of the origins of that figure, but from my research, in the United Kingdom there have been three reported cases in the past 20 or 30 years of a surrogate refusing to hand over the child.</p><p>That case has gone to court.  Of course, there may be other cases or issues that do not make it to court or problems arising.  Three difficult cases from what are probably hundreds of successful surrogacies indicate it is very unusual that a surrogate would want to change her mind.</p></speech>

A person can go to court to be recognised, along with a partner, as the legal parents of that child.  There is no equivalent provision in the assisted human reproduction Bill we are discussing.  If a child has already been born through surrogacy, there is no equivalent process to go to court and have both intending parents recognised as legal parents.  In my opening submission, I mentioned that second parent adoption, although it is not allowed, could be the only solution.  Otherwise a person could apply for guardianship of the child if that person is not currently recognised as an intended parent.  We do not have provision within the Bill to retrospectively recognise parentage.  We argue that a similar process to that which applies in cases of DAHR should be allowed for cases of surrogacy.  It would create parity in our legislation and recognise the fact that a number of children have been born through surrogacy in the past number of years.  A survey was released last year or the year before indicating that Ireland is currently the second-highest user of surrogacy in the world.  Many children have been born through surrogacy who need their family relationships to be regularised.  One way to do that is to include provisions in this assisted human reproduction Bill allowing for retrospective parentage.</p></speech>

The way same-sex male couples are accessing parental pathways means they primarily use surrogacy or adoption, although adoption is not really open in Ireland currently.  A same-sex couple can apply jointly to be assessed for adoption but there are very few countries open to same-sex couples.  In theory they may be able to access international adoptions but it is not a practical possibility, apart from South Africa.</p> <p>  Donor-assisted human reproduction has advanced even since the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was enacted and we know from our consultations with families that people are accessing services abroad because there is more advanced technology abroad and options for people with fertility issues.  Same-sex couples have fertility issues as well as needing donor assistance.  Our main concern is that while the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 is fantastic for the families it covers, many families have been left behind.  The second pillar in regulating assisted human reproduction must consider such issues and try to address them.  The children exist and they need to have their parents recognised.</p> <p>  Across pages 3 to 6 in the submission, we have covered what we see as a framework to do that.  Basically, this relies on parents being able to establish consent with a donor or have a court process where they can show the child will have his or her right to identity protected.  We see that this should absolutely be enshrined in the law but there should be ways, through regulations and a donor conception register, to have that information recorded.</p></speech>

Some people had a slightly easier time registering their child.</p><p>Same-sex couples cannot be registered with both parents on the birth certificate at present.  That still has not been commenced.  For some couples who went to the Civil Registration Service on Lombard Street to register the birth, it was possible to use a double-barrelled surname but down the country, registrars were not used to that.  Generally, there is a significant lack of information.  Once a same-sex couple engages with any State service, they are meeting a lot of barriers because the civil servants are not equipped or do not have the knowledge to deal with them.  That can be very difficult.  I was speaking to a family the other day.  The parents went in to register their child but could not register both parents, even though they are a married couple.  They were watching an opposite-sex couple who had quite a complex situation, although I cannot remember the details.  The registrar was able to work with the opposite-sex couple and get both parents registered.  Post-marriage equality, same-sex couples do not know a lot of these details, either.  They are going ahead and having children.  Clinics are open to them.  They find all this out retrospectively.  It is a real issue.  The work we are trying to do is to inform people that regulations are not in place yet.  Countrywide, there is not much difference in the experience.</p></speech>

The Law Commission of England and Wales is looking at their regulation.  Currently the UK regulation is based on a delayed or post-birth model but a number of people have found that to be inconsistent with the reality of surrogacy.  They do not feel it is working well.  In a survey published by Surrogacy UK, a number of surrogates responded that they did not believe the current UK model was fit for purpose.  The majority of respondents believed the intended parents should be the legal parents from the moment of birth.  That reflects what we have proposed in our submission, namely, that it should be a pre-conception model.  Sociological and psychological research shows that surrogates generally do not see the child as their own.  They understand that they are providing this great gift for another individual or couple.  They do not bond with the child in the same way that another mother might.  They understand that it is someone else's child and are happy with that arrangement.</p></speech>

We all know aspiring parents, people who wish to have children but cannot, for all the reasons we have gone into before.  Most important is that we are assured as to the legal foundations on which the legislation is to be built, and the extent of the legislation.  Are the witnesses satisfied that we can establish best practice or be in line with best practice elsewhere, and that we can be reasonably assured that the legal challenges will not turn the legislation on its head?</p></speech>

That makes it easier to identify best practice.  We can pick advantageous parts of other states' legislation to create a really solid foundation for our own regulation.  The proposals we have put forward in our submission would create a more coherent structure for surrogacy in Ireland and would better balance the rights of all stakeholders in the process.  It is very important to remember that there are a number of stakeholders involved and all of their rights and interests need to be balanced against one another.  Looking at what has been done in other jurisdictions helps with that and allows us to build coherent legislation.</p></speech>

To what extent, on the basis of court cases already taking place in other jurisdictions, can we have reasonable assurance that we are covered in most eventualities?  A few years ago, we had a couple of high-profile cases.</p><p>That seems to have tapered off recently.  Would the witnesses comment on anonymous donors?  Although we do not propose to go that route it would be no harm to have their advice on the pros and cons, as experienced in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

If, however, we look to other jurisdictions in the context of amending this Bill, we can create a coherent model of surrogacy.  Using the pre-conception approach would enhance the best interests of children, in particular.  I mentioned South Africa where there is a lot of case law which emphasises the benefits of the pre-conception approach, focusing on how the best interests of the child can be prioritised in that way because there is certainty for everyone involved.  When the child is born the parents have full capacity to care for them from that moment.  The case law from that jurisdiction can be very useful in helping us to understand why that is a very good approach to take.</p> <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 makes it very clear that anonymous donations will not be allowed.  Any donor gametes that are used have to be fully identifiable and the same process will be used in cases of surrogacy.  That is really important from a children's rights perspective so that children have access to information about their backgrounds, to vindicate their right to identity.  Having identifiable information is very important from a legal perspective.</p></speech>

Up to very recently, much of the donor sperm came to clinics that had offered only anonymous gametes.  It is a question of legislating for the children who already exist, regardless of whether they fit the parameters we want for the future.  Anonymous donation has to be considered retrospectively but prospectively it is possible to set out clear protections for the child's right to identity.  Not recognising the parents of the child who already exists does not do the child any favours regardless of whether they know the donor or not.  That is a layperson's perspective.</p></speech>

The question arises of whether retrospective application in the law can cover all eventualities.  Do our guests know how many such children live in this jurisdiction, having come here from other jurisdictions?  There are quite a few.</p></speech>

We do not know the figure for donor-conceived children who already exist who would be the product of an anonymous donation.  Research in the UK would say that only 2% of heterosexual couples would tell their children that they are donor-conceived.  We have to deal with the reality that these children are here.  It is good that the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 does provide for anonymous donations.  Maybe that could be replicated, retrospectively.</p></speech>

If, however, amendments were made to that and we were to rethink the model of parentage proposed, to focus more on a pre-conception model, to include provisions to recognise cases of international surrogacy and to include the retrospective provisions to recognise children who have already been born through surrogacy, we can construct a new Bill that would adequately protect the rights of the child, the rights of the surrogate and the rights of the intended parents.</p></speech>

Have they identified a country we could learn lessons from?  In other countries there is legislation but here in Ireland we have to consider the constitutional issues.  Are there any constitutional issues that we need to be concerned about and to flag up at this stage in order that they do not arise in five years' time when someone suddenly takes a constitutional challenge?  It is a very complex legal area because so many different parties are involved.  It is important to get it right.  It is not possible to always get legislation 100% right but let us at least make every effort to do that.</p></speech>

Its model for regulating surrogacy is very good.  I chose to research South Africa because the constitution of that country very clearly and expressly protects children's rights.  The relevant provision is much stronger than our Article 42A and expressly protects the best interests of the child.  They have to be of paramount importance in every matter concerning the child.  As a result of its own constitutional provisions, the surrogacy legislation there has been shaped in a way that really puts the rights of the children in the forefront.  It uses a pre-conception model and the structure of the legislation provides a very good balance between the rights of all stakeholders and in particular secures the rights of children.  That pre-conception approach would be a good blueprint for Ireland to follow.  At the last hearing, the New Hampshire model was mentioned.  It also takes a pre-conception judicial approach.  I am not as familiar with that model but it is along the same lines as the South African one in that it is judicially authorised prior to conception.  Those are very good models to consider.</p> <p>  We need to be cognisant of Article 42A and the rights of children, particularly in the context of ensuring that the rights of all children are respected and that there is no discrimination between children by virtue of the fact that they have been born through donor conception or surrogacy or any other form of conception.  That is a very important point to bear in mind.  Once our legislation is child focused I do not see any potential constitutional issues arising.</p></speech>

Once that has been adhered to, it will be possible to construct a new provision or new legislation that would accommodate international surrogacy and ensure that the way in which parentage is allocated in the other country can then be recognised in Ireland, either before the couple leaves or once they come back to the country.</p></speech>

Bilateral agreements are simply one option.  That would streamline the process.  We could have a bilateral agreement with New Hampshire stating that if any Irish couple was to travel to that jurisdiction to engage in surrogacy, provided all the steps had been followed, we would then recognise the parentage when they returned to Ireland.  It may be possible also to do this without a bilateral agreement and to simply provide that once the couple returns to Ireland, they would be able to apply for a declaration of parentage, again recognising the two intended parents as the legal parents, provided they are able to provide documentation from a clinic stating that identifiable gametes have been used and other criteria that the State is happy with have been adhered to.  It does not necessarily have to be through a bilateral agreement but that might streamline the process and make it a consistent procedure in every case.</p></speech>

What I took from the interaction between the witnesses and Deputy Durkan was that we have to proceed urgently to ensure that we have a framework that is fit for purpose and we never encounter these problems again.  While we might not have the answers in this room today, the failure to retrospectively recognise has led to some of the problems and the legal limbo we see facing LGBT families.  Some broader issues were mentioned.  Will Ms Fagan explain how they intertwine with the Children and Family Relationships Act?</p></speech>

First, where a child is conceived through non-clinical donor assisted human reproduction, procedures should be in place to recognise a second parent as a legal parent.  That is one aspect.  Second, we have spoken about a retrospective application for a declaration of parentage in cases of DAHR under section 20 of the Act.  We believe that should be possible where a known donor was used so that those families are not left behind.  Third, we must ensure that the second intended parent is recognised as a legal parent in cases where she provides an egg to enable the conception of the child.  Reciprocal IVF is a way of conceiving that has emerged relatively recently.  It is where one partner in a female couple donates an egg to the other so that they have a genetic link, which is what we have been calling for.</p> <p>  What we are saying is that an amendment could be made to the assisted human reproduction Bill.  The Children and Family Relationships Act does not allow for recognition because the donor has to be non-identifiable or traceable.  In any case, the wording does not allow for it.  We are suggesting a small amendment to provide for recognition where the donor of the gamete or embryo is the spouse of a partner or cohabitant of the mother.  That would be similar to other jurisdictions that have allowed for that because they understand that reciprocal IVF is a reality for people and it should not bar one or other of female couple from donating if it makes sense to do so.</p> <p>  The Government should also consider the possibility of recognising donor assisted human reproduction conducted abroad after Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act have been commenced.  Similar to what Dr. Bracken spoke about, looking at areas that have good practice where couples will go, it is a very costly procedure.  The technology and services are not as advanced in Ireland so people will continue to access services abroad.  We propose legislating around that.</p></speech>

Why has the State chosen to include those restrictions?  Is it legally possible to do anything other than as provided for in the Bill?</p></speech>

Given that it is very similar to what is currently in place in the UK, we have simply looked across the pond and copied their legislation.  They have a post-birth model in the UK where the surrogate is recognised as the legal mother once the child is born and parentage is transferred later.  As the timelines in the proposed Bill are exactly the same as those in the UK legislation, I believe the provision was copied from the UK.  That is not an adequate approach because, as we said, it means that at birth the child will not have a legal relationship with the second intending parent, namely, the parent who is not genetically related to the child.  That leaves the second parent in a vulnerable position as it means that in the first few weeks of the child's life, people are going to court to establish a parentage as opposed to simply caring for their child as they should be able to do.</p> <p>  We recommend a pre-conception approach.  This is where a person goes to court prior to the conception of the child and securing a court order authorising surrogacy.  This would ensure the different criteria have been met and allocate parentage at that stage.  This approach allows for certainty and means that as soon as the child is born, both intended parents are recognised as legal parents.  The surrogate mother is not recognised as a legal parent and there is no need to go back to court after the birth of the child to establish who the parents are.</p></speech>

What happens in such cases?</p></speech>

Looking at UK case law, if the issue was to go to court, the best interests of the child would be paramount.  I should say again that if we look at the UK approach, it is a post-birth model, meaning that at birth the surrogate is recognised as the legal mother.  In the very few cases where there has been a dispute and the case has gone to court, it does not necessarily mean the surrogate is allowed to keep the child or that care of the child will not still be transferred.  In at least two of the three cases I am aware of where an issue such as this has arisen, care of the child was still transferred to the intended parents.  The UK operates a very strict model whereby parentage cannot be transferred without the surrogate's consent.  She has remained as the legal mother but the courts have recognised that it is not in the best interests of the child for her to keep the child and so the care of the child has been transferred.  In some jurisdictions there is a court process to address that, while in others no such process is in place.  It is all based on pre-conception intent.  It would be a question for the Legislature as to whether it wanted to have, as discussed earlier, that kind of emergency provision for a surrogate who changes her mind.</p><p>On reflection, that might go against the ethos of our proposed legislation in terms of it being a pre-conception approach, because one of the advantages of a pre-conception approach is the certainty that attaches to it for all of the parties involved.  If there was an opportunity for a surrogate to bring a case after the birth of the child, one is negating that element of certainty, but I suppose that would be a question for the Legislature to determine whether it wanted to have a court provision afterwards.</p></speech>

I fully accept that it is most unlikely that this would happen but nobody wants to discuss legislation that will not work.  We want to try to get it right if we can.  Dr. Bracken referred to the emergency provision for a surrogate who may change her mind.  Presumably, that would involve a legal case.  We could talk about models of best practice and where some country is getting it right.  It would be a good idea if we could look at that.  However unlikely it is, it may be necessary to legislate for it because there are people - I am not one of them but that makes no difference - who believe that this is a very important matter and we need to provide for it in legislation.  Are there models of best practice in this area?  I do not like to hear it being called an emergency provision because that sounds like everyone would just jump into a car and go to the High Court.  Is there anywhere we could look at where such a measure has been included and has worked?</p></speech>

In a situation where a woman provides her own eggs to enable the conception, she has the right to change her mind or to petition a court within 60 days of the birth of the child.  In the current legislation we do not propose to allow for that type of surrogacy, where the surrogate is also the genetic mother.  In the South African legislation, the woman can petition the court.  Having that petition available but also having a timeline on it allows for the certainty I was talking about and ensures the intended parents are not worried that the application would be made further down the line.  It also ensures the child is fully legally integrated into his or her family.  That would be one example.</p></speech>

I am just wondering whether we should incorporate some form of counselling, as it would give the best chance of never having to use such an emergency provision.  However, one has to balance that with the fact that most people do not think about it.  Perhaps they should but it is a simple fact that very often they do not.  If we put the two together, that would probably seriously minimise the risk of the emergency provision being used, while ensuring that all parties are well aware of the emergency provision.  That would avoid a scenario where somebody could get to day 61 of the pregnancy and say she was not aware of it.  There may be a role for counselling, although my initial reaction is that it is not necessarily a brilliant idea.  It would be useful, however, to extend the legislation to encompass that scenario because counselling would make a little more sense in that context.</p></speech>

I am joined by my officials Mr. Jimmy Martin, assistant secretary, Ms Yvonne White, Mr. Brian Merriman, Mr. William O'Dwyer, Ms Regina Terry and Ms Eileen Devoy.</p> <p>  The Government remains firmly of the view that the best and only way to ensure an orderly UK withdrawal from the EU is to ratify the withdrawal agreement.  Having said that and in view of the ongoing uncertainty in the UK, I and my Department have been intensively advancing preparations and planning for every scenario, but particularly for a no-deal or worst case scenario.  If the UK becomes a third country on 29 March next, without having ratified the withdrawal agreement with the EU, then a very wide range of EU rules relating to justice and security will no longer apply to or in the UK.  On the other hand, should the withdrawal agreement be ratified before 29 March, many of the preparations and contingency measures that I am about to detail will not be required, at least in the short term.  The purpose of the legislation before the House is to offset some of the damage which may arise if the UK departs without a deal being in place.  While there are a number of Brexit implications for the justice sector, key risks have been identified in two areas, namely, extradition and immigration.  These two areas require primary legislation to be in place and are set out in Parts 13 and 14 of the Bill.</p> <p>  Turning to Part 13 in the first instance, the Bill provides for two amendments to the Extradition Act 1965.  One of the key issues identified by the Department of Justice and Equality is to ensure that effective extradition arrangements are maintained between Ireland and the UK.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit the provisions of the European arrest warrant would no longer apply to the UK and at 11 p.m. on 29 March persons detained on foot of European arrest warrants would be released.  It is critical, therefore, that extradition provisions are in place immediately following the UK's exit from the EU.  The optimal solution identified by my Department is to apply the 1957 European Convention on Extradition, to which both Ireland and the UK are party, to extradition arrangements between Ireland and the UK.  The provisions of the convention are given effect by Part II of the Extradition Act 1965.</p> <p>  While the extradition procedure under the convention is not as effective or as efficient as that of the European arrest warrant, in the event of a no-deal Brexit it would provide a workable solution.  The intention would then be to legislate for and move to an extradition arrangement with the UK similar to that which obtains in the European arrest warrant.  However, the 1965 Act does not permit extradition of own nationals "unless the relevant extradition provisions otherwise provide" and transmission of extradition requests is via the diplomatic channel and in hard copy.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that clear provision should be made in section 14 of the 1965 Act providing that the ban on extradition of own citizens should not apply in reciprocal circumstances where requesting states also extradite own citizens.</p> <p>  The amendment to section 14 in respect of Irish citizens acknowledges the need to amend that Act to ensure that the current European arrest warrant arrangement relating to extradition of own citizens continues and that, in applying the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on Extradition, extradition of an Irish citizen will be permitted on the basis of reciprocity, where the law of the requesting country does not prohibit the surrender of its citizens.  In this regard it should be noted that the United Kingdom has already indicated that it intends to continue to extradite its citizens post Brexit.</p><p>The second amendment relates to section 23 regarding requests for extradition.  In this regard, the Act is being amended to alleviate the burdensome extradition procedure with receipt of requests to the Minister for Justice and Equality via the diplomatic channel in hard copy.  The amendment to section 23 provides for direct transmission of extradition requests to the Minister for Justice and Equality rather than via the diplomatic channel and for the transmission of such requests by modern means of communication - that is, by electronic means or otherwise.  The amendment gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade an order-making power, following consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality, to provide for requests for extradition to be made directly to the Minister for Justice and Equality where this has been arranged with a country by direct agreement.<br/><br/>I now turn to Part 14 of the Bill, which contains a number of amendments to the Immigration Acts.  The amendments in section 88 and 89 of the Bill are for the purposes of correcting a lacuna in the provisions relating to non-<i>refoulement</i>in our law.  I should point out that <i>refoulement</i>considerations were in fact being undertaken at all times.  This provision provides legal certainty in this area.  The amendment is required as failure to introduce this amendment would expose us to the risk that removal would be unsuccessful and thus undermine arrangements to operate a Dublin regulation-style arrangement if needed.<br/><br/>Section 90 of the Bill amends the Immigration Act 2004 to provide a legal basis for fingerprinting Irish visa and transit visa applicants.  The taking and sharing of biometrics is key to the operation of the British Irish visa scheme, which enables a short-stay visa issued by Ireland in respect of certain countries - currently, China and India - to be used to also travel to the UK without the need for a separate visa.  This requires biometric data to be captured and checked against both Irish and UK systems.  The continuance of this scheme is considered very important to both the tourism and business sectors.<br/><br/>In addition to the above amendments, some pieces of secondary legislation are required to be in place by 29 March 2019.  These will cover issues such as facilitating the recognition of UK solicitors' qualifications in the State and, in the context of asylum claims, designating the UK as a safe third country.  There are other important issues that my Department continues to address and to prepare for.  However, I believe the two I have covered today are the most pressing.

The engagement is useful in the context of what will dominate these Houses for the next couple of weeks.  I have a few questions about what is and is not in the Bill.  I will start with what is in the Bill.  The Minister spoke about non-<i>refoulement</i>.  In respect of section 88 and the proposal to insert new section 3B into the Immigration Act 1999, it appears to clarify that these provisions will apply to the period commencing on 31 December 2016.  My understanding is that this area seeks to clarify an area that was struck down by the High Court in 2018 in S.G. (Albania) v. The Minister for Justice and Equality.  I am trying to understand the timeframe and how, if the case that saw the previous section struck down or rendered inoperable happened in 2018, we can confidently say that this section applies to the period between December 2016 and this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022700002#E00300"><p>Part 14 of the Bill deals with the amendments to the Immigration Acts.  In effect, that deals with a lacuna in the provisions relating to non-<i>refoulement</i>.  The important aspect here is that sections 88 and 89 amend not only the Immigration Act 1999 but the Immigration Act 2003.  That will have the effect of confirming that in considering the removal or deportation of a person from this State, immigration officers will, in line with international obligations, have the power to undertake the <i>refoulement</i>consideration.  Section 88 also includes a provision confirming that where in making an order of deportation since 31 December 2016, consideration was given to non-<i>refoulement</i>and the practice will continue.  What we are doing in the amendment is providing a legislative basis to the consideration of <i>refoulement</i>matters.  This is in line with section 50 of the International Protection Act 2015 for all non-nationals being removed from the State.  The amendment will have the effect of restoring references to non-<i>refoulement</i>in the Immigration Acts.  It has remained both the policy and the practice to apply <i>refoulement</i>principles to all removals from the State.  That should cover the point raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

I have not read the full judgment but my understanding is that the 2018 judgment found a difficulty with Ireland's processes regarding non-<i>refoulement</i>considerations.  I find it hard to understand how this legislation is saying that we are satisfied that non-<i>refoulement</i>considerations were undertaken and that deportations from December 2016 until the court case are considered valid even though the court decision had not been handed down.  Is it the case that in practice, even if there was no legislative basis for it subsequently, non-<i>refoulement</i>considerations were given and that, therefore, even though the legislative basis did not exist, procedurally, all the people who received deportation orders did in fact get this consideration and that, therefore, they are covered and the deportations were valid?  Am I understanding this correctly?</p></speech>

(Albania) v. The Minister for Justice and Equality.  When the International Protection Act was implemented in 2015, it repealed the Refugee Act 1996, which, in section 5, had a provision on<i>refoulement</i>that applied not only to protection applications but also to all removals from the State regardless of whether or not they were protection-related.  When the International Protection Act 2015 was implemented, it repealed the 1996 Act and inadvertently disapplied non-<i>refoulement</i>considerations to non-protection applicant removals, for example, deportation orders or general immigration cases.</p><p>It only came to light in the High Court case but the practice was always that non-<i>refoulement</i>considerations were considered in every removal case from State.  Here, we are restoring the position where there is a legal basis to the non-<i>refoulement</i>consideration for non-protection related cases which are dealt with under the Immigration Act 1999 and the Immigration Act 2003.  Section 3B gives a retrospective legal basis to deportations that would have taken place from 31 December until the Bill is enacted.  However, it is only where the non-<i>refoulement</i>consideration has taken place.  If a deportation order is the subject of court proceedings, for instance, that retrospective provision does not impact on it.</p></speech>

A significant and influential element in the Conservative Party has expressed a desire to renounce the ECHR.  Is the position of the Minister and the Department that this legislation will require review and potentially revision if the UK does so?</p></speech>

We must ensure that arrangements are such that any adverse consequences would be mitigated.

Any new legislation will be reviewed against the background of any developments in the UK.</p></speech>

Is this a common feature of visa applications?  Everyone wants this programme to continue if it is of value to the Irish economy and the individuals involved.  However, is the provision on fingerprinting strictly necessary?  I would question, if these were European countries, that the taking of fingerprints in this manner would be compliant with GDPR.  As these are not European citizens, GDPR may not apply to them.</p></speech>

There is a requirement that the biometric data be captured and checked against both the Irish and UK systems.  I believe it is very important that that be continued.  We must acknowledge that we are not members of the Schengen Agreement although we are engaged in Schengen information systems.  It is important that the concerns on the matter of sharing the fingerprint data with the UK does provide an element of legal certainty and it is important, therefore, that that continues.  It will be in compliance with human rights legislation.</p> <p>  To answer the earlier question, the British have already indicated that they will continue to operate within the European Convention on Human Rights after Brexit.</p></speech>

On the process behind the preparation of this legislation, did the Minister engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Director of Public Protections and the PSNI, to ask what they felt were the outstanding requirements in the legislation?  Did any of those three agencies, or any other relevant justice agency, ask for anything that the Minister was not in a position to accommodate in this legislation?  Is this being dealt with by other means?</p></speech>

With particular reference to the preparation of this legislation, there was specific contact with those agencies and with the Home Office and appropriate UK offices in order to ensure that we were in a position to formulate a schedule of laws and amendments and a regime that would mitigate against any adverse consequences.  We should remember that all this is against the background of a contingency to prepare for a worst-case scenario.</p></speech>

Did the Minister have to respond that any of these were not possible or that they were possible, but not through this Bill, that they would be done elsewhere.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.329" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jimmy Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022700002#F01200"><p>It was a very intensive process.  First, we went through every single EU instrument in the area of justice and home affairs - there were 700 different instruments - to see how they would be affected.  There was a series of meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Courts Service, the Prison Service and the Probation Service to see how they would be affected.  Separately, we were in contact with the European Commission for its recommendations on issues that needed to be addressed.  We have also been in contact with the Home Office on the issues it felt needed to be addressed.</p> <p>  What is in the legislation is matters that require primary legislation.  There are several areas that do not require primary legislation.  One of the biggest asks of the Garda related to its communications and data exchange with the PSNI.  It exchanges about 60,000 to 70,000 pieces of information annually with UK law enforcement agencies, and the PSNI in particular.  One of the effects of Brexit will be that the UK will become a third country for the purposes of data protection.  There was great concern that we dealt with the data protection implications for information exchange.  In consultation with those services and the Office of the Attorney General, we examined how this might be done in the context of the law enforcement directive on data protection.</p><p>We have consulted on the issue with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Attorney General's office, the Director of Public Prosecutions and other services in this area.  It can be done within the context of the EU instruments.  It does not require primary legislation.  The list of things that must be done in light of the many areas affected is long and it could take us the whole day to get through them all.  We have tried to focus on the areas most substantively and instantaneously affected, such as extradition, the common travel area and data exchange for the purposes of police-to-police activity and for the purposes of running the common travel area.  Within all of these areas, we have taken into account all of the services involved.  The UK and the PSNI have set out what they regard as their priorities and we are able to match them.  The Commission has also set out what areas member states should focus on as a priority for contingency preparedness.  All of the work involves all of these areas coming together.  Having gone through the exercise, there are only two areas that require primary legislation.</p><p> I should say there are certain things we cannot do.  For example, the big ask of the UK in the police co-operation area was continued access to the Europol information system and the Schengen information system but as they are European IT systems, it is a matter for Europe to make that decision.  There are areas that are outside of our competence.  Within our competence, two areas are being addressed in the context of this legislation but secondary legislation and administrative arrangements will have to be made to cover all other areas.</p></speech>

I am sure it was an arduous task.  It would be helpful if, subsequent to this meeting, the officials could provide the committee with a summary of the required changes of secondary legislation and the implications of same.  I am particularly interested in knowing if co-operation in the area of bail North-South and east-west will continue and whether there are any significant changes required in that regard.</p></speech>

The following is a passage from the opening statement of Mr. Brian Gormally of the Committee on the Administration of Justice on the citizenship rights of people in the North.  While this matter has been discussed to a significant extent politically, legally there is still very little certainty around it.  Mr. Gormally stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The citizenship issue is an example of how basic assumptions of the Good Friday Agreement have been undermined.  It recognises the birthright of the people of Northern Ireland to hold Irish or British citizenship on the basis of equality.  The basic breach of this principle of equality by Brexit would be that Irish citizens would remain EU citizens whereas British citizens would not.  It amounts to a new focus of division between the two main communities.  It has also become clear that Brexit could make the status of Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland constitutionally and practically insecure.  If Brexit goes ahead, Irish citizens will be EU citizens living in a non-member state.  What rights do they have to live, work, access health and social services and fully participate in social and political life in the state where they were born?  There are several possible answers to that question.  The first possibility is that the Home Office will regard Irish citizens as really British since UK nationality law decrees that most of those born in the UK have British citizenship.  The second possibility is that the common travel area will sort all this out but, as the Human Rights Commission has suggested, common travel area rights are built on sand.  The third possibility is that under the withdrawal agreement, EU citizens living in the UK can retain many of their current rights by applying for settled status.  [I understand there was a fee attached to that at one stage.]<br /><br />None of these options is appealing as they all involve the implication that those who choose Irish identity are in some way second-class citizens.  Their rights as full participants in Northern Ireland life would depend on either a denial of their Irish nationality, as yet unknown bilateral agreements between the UK and Ireland about the common travel area or asking the Home Office to graciously allow them to leave to live in the land of their birth. </blockquote> <p>There are significant and weighty questions arising therefrom which we discussed at length on the day with Mr. Gormally, Mr. Harvey and several other witnesses.  Prior to the referendum on Brexit, there was not much dispute in regard to these areas but following Brexit these areas of dispute are likely to increase significantly.  Given the gravity of the implications of these changes and the need for legislative clarity here and in the UK to resolve this matter, why have we not sought to affirm the rights of Irish citizens living in the North post Brexit, particularly a hard Brexit, in this legislation?</p></speech>

The British and Irish Governments have confirmed that neither Irish citizens in the UK nor British citizens in Ireland will be required to take any action to protect their status or rights associated with the current common travel regime.  The issue the Deputy refers to relates to the de Souza case and citizenship rights.  This is an issue that was the subject matter of discussions between myself and the British Home Secretary in recent times.  The British Government is currently considering whether it will proceed by way of legislative provision to clarify matters following that judgment.  I am happy to keep the committee informed of the developments.  There is no certainty around it as yet but all of the arrangements that exist under the common travel arrangements will continue.  This includes the guarantees under the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

I have run out of time but I am sure some of my colleagues will follow up on this issue.</p><p>It is not just British legislation that is needed.  All the academics say this jurisdiction needs legislation to address this issue.</p></speech>

One of the great successes of EU membership has been the European arrest warrant, EAW.  One of the negative consequences of Brexit will be that we will not have an EAW system in place between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I note that the Minister said it is intended to operate the Council of Europe convention on extradition from 1957, which is a good idea.  Obviously that is dependent on reciprocity between this country and the United Kingdom.  We are in the process of introducing legislation that permits extradition of citizens.  Has the United Kingdom enacted similar legislation permitting it?  Does the Minister think it will be in place by 29 March?  I do not mind who wanted it.</p></speech>

Under the EAW system, obviously the courts are involved here.  If an Irish citizen is to be extradited to the UK after Brexit, or <i>vice versa</i>, to what extent will the Irish courts be involved in that?  Will they have any involvement or will it be a diplomatic process?</p></speech>

Again these issues have been discussed with the British Home Office.  We have identified a number of issues.  It is important to acknowledge that immediately after the withdrawal of the UK at 11 p.m. Irish time on 29 March, the UK will then submit requests under the extradition convention of 1957.

One relates to family law.  At present, obviously, there is recognition of United Kingdom divorces.  After 29 March what will be the status of recognition of divorces in the UK and, indeed, child abduction cases involving Ireland and the UK?  At present I believe it is dealt with by regulation No. 2201/2003.  Do we have concerns as to how that will develop?  I asked a parliamentary question on that and got an answer on it, but-----</p></speech>

With those taken together we are satisfied that these conventions will apply a framework that can be regarded as satisfactory in the circumstances.  That will be the basis of continued co-operation in that area.</p> <p>  On the matter of the recognition of divorces, members will be aware that the recognition in Ireland of divorces in the UK is governed by the EU.  If that EU regulation fails to apply, we will then fall back on the older Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986.  In the forthcoming referendum on divorce, it is proposed to amend Article 41.3.3&deg; dealing with the recognition of foreign divorces.  If the people give their assent to that change, I will update the recognition of foreign divorces.  That would also encompass any negative impact that the withdrawal of the UK from the EU might have.  Members will be aware of the uncertainty in some recognitions around the issue of domicile as against residence.  Later in the year we will have the opportunity to update our laws if we get the approval of the people in that regard.</p></speech>

I have to concede that in a no-deal, crash-out scenario, there will be a number of potential problems and the entire regime might be regarded as less than satisfactory.  The object of the exercise on the part of Government is to ensure our contingencies are in place, in so far as they can be.  Ultimately, the certainty will perhaps only be evident when agreement is reached between the EU and the UK in respect of the future relationship arrangements.  While the EU has been the negotiating party, there were certain areas of our relationship with the UK that we needed to discuss and we were discussing.  Arising out of these discussions, we have set forward the proposals in the legislation.  Nonetheless, there have been and will continue to be instances where we have to fall back on older legislation that is less modern and potentially more challenging.  What we are putting forward in the Bill deals with the urgent and important areas which are likely to prove immediately challenging.  As time passes, we will continue our discussions under the umbrella of the EU.  Our objectives and those of the UK are broadly similar, namely, ensuring the protection of our people and ensuring the legal framework that existed between our two countries across a range of issues, both criminal and civil, will continue, notwithstanding the potential withdrawal of the UK from any of the EU instruments which have proved very beneficial in terms of our relationship.</p></speech>

Let us say someone applied for asylum in the North and that person would have a separate process that would be subject to a new arrangement in the UK context.  Obviously, we will have the maintenance of the free travel area so what will the bilateral arrangement be in that context between the UK and Ireland?  Will there be an homogenous data-sharing process?  What will be the bilateral relationship?  How does the EU feel about a bilateral relationship superseding the integrity of its legal framework under its treaty law?  How will that be dealt with without a deal?  Obviously, a deal is the optimum scenario but how happy is the EU to allow a serious of bilateral arrangements to exist separate from treaty law?  As we know, it is very reluctant to allow countries to operate outside of that basis.  Can the Minister give other examples, perhaps from the eastern Europe, where separate legal frameworks have been allowed to develop separate to the treaty framework?</p></speech>

There are certain areas, however, which underline a unique relationship between the UK and Ireland, and, for example, the fact neither country is in Schengen resulted in a situation where bilateral arrangements were optimum.  It is similar with regard to the workings of the common travel area and arrangements, where both the UK and Ireland joined the EU with the common travel framework in situ, and that continued.  Again, it is important to stress that no matter what the nature of the deal is, the common travel area and arrangements will continue, and this is the desire of the UK Government and the Irish Government, and, indeed, the EU.  I acknowledge that there will be circumstances and instances where we will have to further our bilateral arrangements and enter into agreements with the UK, but this will be done in the context of Ireland remaining a member of the EU and under the umbrella of the EU.</p></speech>

The thing that comes to my mind the whole time is the Good Friday Agreement.  Since it came into operation, the peace this island has enjoyed has been unprecedented.  Coming from the Border town of Dundalk, I, more than most, know the problems people had during the Troubles and I think it fantastic that this has happened.</p> <p>  The Chief Constable of the PSNI, George Hamilton, realises that there will be repercussions regardless of whether there is a Brexit deal and he has asked the UK Government for an additional 400 police officers to help man the Border.  As the Minister knows, we are talking about a distance of some 310 miles and, at present, Northern Ireland has roughly 6,700 police officers and 79 police stations.  What are the Minister's plans for 29 March?  The PSNI is looking for extra police officers.  The Minister cannot just click his fingers and get an extra 400 or 500 garda&iacute; and deploy them to the Border.  What are his plans for 29 March in the context of covering the Border area?</p></speech>

It is engaged in ongoing discussions with my Department.  We meet with the Garda Commissioner on a regular basis and we did so specifically to discuss the issue of contingency planning for Brexit.  However, notwithstanding that, we are not engaged in the making of arrangements for what has been described as a hard border.  As Members will be aware from their discussions with him, the Garda Commissioner is solely responsible for the allocation of Garda resources.</p><p>He has indicated that he intends this year to recruit a further 600 trainees.  The manner in which they are dispersed or allocated to stations is something he keeps under periodic review.  I stress that there is no planning on the part of the Government for the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.  That said, Deputy Fitzpatrick, in particular, will be familiar with the Border area and Border policing.  In any frontier or where a border between jurisdictions exists, a unique need for vigilance will arise having regard to the smuggling of property or people and the organised crime for which borders tend to hold an allure.  The Garda Commissioner and his management team are very aware of that.</p></speech>

I have seen at first hand what happens in the Border area.  I have seen at first hand garda&iacute; pulling traffic from the main motorway to side roads.  I commend the Government on the reopening of Templemore, which was a fantastic thing to do.  However, I remain concerned because it is only in the last number of years that Garda numbers have started to rise again.  The last thing I want to see is garda&iacute; being pulled from all corners of the country to come up and man the Border.  People are worried.  One cannot just click a finger.  I acknowledge that the Minister said 600 trainee garda&iacute; are going through Templemore at the moment but 29 March is fast approaching.  I speak to many garda&iacute; in my area and they tell me there is talk now of garda&iacute; being pulled from every unit and grouping nationally.  People want to know what is happening.  Should we not have a strategy or plan?  Customs posts are being opened at airports and ports.  I saw on television last night the huts being set up at Dublin Port.  No one wants to see a backstop or to see the Border come back.  I live close to the Border and have family and relations in the North and it is the last thing I want to see.  We have had a fantastic 20 years and want that to continue.  However, there is a great deal of fear that we are going to start going around the country to take garda&iacute; from different units.  I am sure the Minister and the Garda Commissioner have regular discussions on this and I understand the Chief Constable in Northern Ireland is in constant talks with the UK.  Do we have 200, 300 or 400 surplus garda&iacute; who will man the Border?</p></speech>

For example, in the Deputy's own area, the Garda's northern division has a strength of 1,406 garda&iacute;, which is an increase of 9% since 31 December 2015.  This year, the Garda Commissioner is ensuring there is recruitment of civilian staff to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to facilitate the release of 500 trained garda&iacute; from administrative to front-line duties.  Members will agree that availability and visibility are the hallmarks of good policing and it is important that garda&iacute; are freed to do the type of work for which they  are best trained.  In the event of a crash-out Brexit or no deal and if such a scenario gives rise to additional requirements in Border areas, I have no doubt that further resources can be provided through normal deployment.  The Garda Commissioner and his management team are fully aware of that.  These requirements are kept under ongoing review at all times.</p></speech>

In fairness, the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, came to this committee two weeks ago and told us about his time in the PSNI and his relationship with MI5 and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He said it was a great relationship.  It is important that we keep that going.  I asked the Commissioner about a local murder, that of Tom Oliver.

I am saying to him that we all agree with the basic premise of what the Deputy suggests regarding the maintenance of relationships.  He addressed the matter to the Garda Commissioner only a couple of weeks ago and I have asked him to explain the relevance of it in his address of it now to the Minister in the context of this particular issue, namely the miscellaneous provisions legislation before us.

I feel as though I am not getting a fair crack of the whip.  When I tried to ask the Garda Commissioner questions, the Chairman intervened.  He was wrong to intervene.  I am asking the Minister a few questions about the relationship between the PSNI and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and what will happen after 29 March.  There is something seriously wrong.

I was delighted to see the Deputy Chief Constable of the PSNI come down and made a contribution.  At the time, information was passed over to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When the PSNI and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work so closely together, it is important that something be done with any information that is obtained.  In fairness, the Garda Commissioner informed me at our previous meeting that the information he gave to the Government at the time cannot really be carried forward because of his new role as Garda Commissioner.  I want to make sure today that whatever information is passed between the PSNI and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is acted upon.  This is important.  On behalf of Tom Oliver's family, the Government has serious information.  It knows who directed the murder of Tom Oliver.  What will happen going forward from today?</p></speech>

The Garda Commissioner and Chief Constable of the PSNI, who share responsibility for co-operation among the police services on the island, have repeatedly emphasised the importance of this relationship.  There are a number of formal structures involved, including the joint agency task force.  It is important that the cross-Border relationship between our respective security services continue.  I am confident that it will do so through the sharing of information.  With regard to daily contact, which amounted to almost 70,000 items of information shared last year, it is also important that this continues.</p> <p>  I want to inform the committee of an issue that might not be widely known about.  It concerns one of the changes that may well be necessary in respect of eligibility for membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Currently, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regulations provide that UK nationals are eligible to become members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Garda reservists but this is on the basis of the UK being an EU member state.  It is important that we continue to ensure that UK nationals continue to be eligible for membership of the Garda in the event of Brexit proceeding.  That will involve an amendment to current regulations that will specifically include nationals of the United Kingdom.  It is important that this be made at an early stage.  It is one of the many changes we intend to make to facilitate persons from the United Kingdom who wish to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

Given the Minister's personal engagement on and interest in this issue, I wish to note the significant judgment handed down by the Supreme Court in London in the Pat Finucane case.  I am sure it is a judgment the Minister, his officials and Government colleagues will want to study so I do not expect him to comment on it at all.  I just wish to note its significance.</p> <p>  Let me return to a point raised by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  The Minister cited the De Souza case.  One of the major concerns expressed in a recent presentation to this committee by legal and human rights organisations on the impact of Brexit related to the difference between citizenship rights and residency rights.  Concerns were also raised about the common travel area rights being built on sand.  I am glad that the Minister has discussed the issues with the British Home Secretary but, given the live nature of the pursuit of Emma De Souza through the courts, that does not necessarily fill us with confidence.  Legislative action which realises fully the objectives of the Good Friday Agreement has to be taken by the British Government.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and the contributors stated previously, we must also see legislative action taken in this jurisdiction that fully realises the citizenship rights aspect of the Good Friday Agreement.  I understand that, on behalf of the committee, the Chairman is compiling a report on the contributions and presentations we have received.  I am sure the Minister will be given a copy.  Could he expand on what measures can be taken?  I appreciate there is a tight timeframe and that we are in uncertain waters but, in the context of a timeframe that has only been shortened as a result of the Brexit deadline, we have to get to the point where we are legislating adequately for people's rights in the context and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, regardless of whether there is a Brexit.  Sin an m&eacute;id.</p></speech>

These are issues of great importance.</p> <p>  As I note from reading the transcript of the committee's engagements, we are talking about fundamental rights.</p><p>My Department and I acknowledge that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has primary responsibility for these issues.  Of course, I would be happy to further engage with the T&aacute;naiste in that regard.  It is important to recognise that, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement, the European Convention on Human Rights will remain much incorporated in law in Northern Ireland.  The UK Government has confirmed its membership of the convention will continue.  That should be acknowledged along with the importance of the common travel area arrangements.  We need to be clear that those arrangements will be maintained in all circumstances.  We are discussing the worst case scenario - a no-deal or crash-out Brexit - but it is important to recognise that the full gamut of common travel area practices allowing Irish and British citizens to access a range of similar rights in both jurisdictions will continue.  I am keen to assure the committee that that will be the case.  There are arrangements of a bilateral nature that we need to ensure will be in place, hence the importance of the legislation before us.  On the longer-term issue, I would be very happy to further engage with the T&aacute;naiste and the committee.  These are areas of fundamental rights pertaining to the ongoing relationship North, South, east and west and of which we must be mindful.  The exercise referred to was most useful.</p></speech>

It concerns a small but vulnerable group of people, the non-EEA family members of UK citizens, of whom there are currently approximately 5,000 in Ireland.  They are here under their EU treaty rights.  What will happen to them after the UK leaves?  Will they still be entitled to be resident here?  Will they have an entitlement to a new visa?</p></speech>

The matter is currently under consideration.  However, in line with what is happening across member states, a general generous approach will be taken.  On 29 March, those people will have status and will not become illegal in the country or anything of the sort.  Arrangements will be put in place and will probably involve their being transferred onto a domestic arrangement.  The intention is to recognise the fact that they have been resident here and that they would be facilitated under some kind of domestic arrangement given the change in circumstances in terms of their not exercising EU treaty rights.</p></speech>

These are contingency plans put in place by me and my Government colleagues.  I acknowledge that there are challenges and I believe it is important that we continue to engage in order to ensure that we at all times mitigate the adverse consequences of Brexit in all of its forms.  From our perspective, the withdrawal agreement appears to offer the best planning in respect of contingencies.  Anything less than that will mean a no-deal situation which, as we have discussed for the past hour or more, will be challenging and problematic.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I wish to assure the committee that our objective is the protection of our citizens.  We will ensure their safety by means of a legal framework that will mitigate against negative consequences, of which there will be some.</p></speech>

The minutes of the meetings of 6 and 14 February have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  I turn now to correspondence.  On No. 2019/401, it is proposed to note this correspondence and to forward it to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  On Nos. 2019/402A and 2019/402B, it is proposed to note this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Is it agreed to note No. 2019/403?  Agreed.</p><p>It is proposed to note the concerns raised in No. 2019/403 and forward it to the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Griffin, for his observations.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It is proposed to consider Nos. 2019/404A and 2019/404B as part of the committee's work programme.  The clerk has brought the following to my attention.  The correspondence concerns the reappointment of Maurice O'Gorman to the board of Galway Harbour Company for a two-year period.  He was before the committee last April.  If members feel we need to bring him in again, that is no problem.  Alternatively, we could consent to him continuing in office for the two years.  I am in the hands of the committee entirely.  The correspondence consists of an email from Mary Daly in the office of the Minister, Deputy Ross, dated 11 February stating that the Minister has consented to the reappointment of Maurice O'Gorman for a two-year period.  Mr. O'Gorman came here last April.  There is no problem bringing him in again.  It is just that it would be to ask the same questions he was asked the last time.</p></speech>

Previously, when we sought to have the Minister attend and there was a clash in his diary, he would say that he would be available on such a day.  This is the first time he has not indicated an alternative date.  He did not actually say there was a clash in the diary, he referred to the pressure of work and his busy schedule.  I would place a bet that if one went to the Members' bar at 11 a.m., the Minister would be there having his elvenses.  He has deferred the matter to another organisation this morning and he has not offered an alternative date.  That is out of sync with what, in fairness, he normally does.  We have asked him to attend to discuss issues before.  When he has not been able to come on the proposed date, he has always offered an alternative.</p></speech>

The clerk has explained that our last meeting was a private meeting and there was no public part of that meeting.  It is a decision of this committee that all correspondence must be dealt with in public.  This is the first opportunity we have had to discuss this formally as a committee.  The consensus is that it will issue today and that the clerk will make direct contact with his private secretary and he will inform us of the outcome of that immediately.</p></speech>

That is agreed.</p> <p>  On No. 2019/407, it is proposed to note this correspondence because they will appear before the committee this morning.

We should invite not just senior Coast Guard representatives, but also staff and volunteers, including the volunteers who have raised grave concerns with this latest directive.

On 2019/410A and 2019/410B, it is proposed to note this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.   On 2019/411, it is proposed to note this correspondence and forward it to the National Transport Authority, NTA, for comment.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  On 2019/412A and 2019/412B, it is proposed to note this correspondence.  That relates to the issue that arose earlier on the Football Association of Ireland.  We have the names of the people who can take that other issue.  Rea Walshe proposed that John Delaney, CEO; Fran Gavin, director of competitions; Rea Walshe, corporate affairs and licensing director; Karen Campion, director of business partnerships and strategy; and Ruud Dokter, high performance director, would come to our meeting on 10 April.  Senator O'Mahony asked about the financial director.</p></speech>

We are aware of the complaints regarding a lack of public transport services in rural areas.  We present proposals for a service that can be offered within the framework of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.  The Act and its regulations already provide for local area hackneys, but after five years there are only 13 of these nationally.  The Act also provides for a community transport service operated by volunteers, which, understandably, has not provided a solution for rural areas.</p> <p>  The key features of our proposals are that the service would operate only from the area surrounding a village to the village and then back home, a maximum distance each way of, for example, 15 km.  The area surrounding the village would be defined by regulation as being a maximum of, for example, 1,000 persons.  Applicants to become village transport drivers would be examined only on the regulations related to that service, thus facilitating ease of driver entry.  Return journeys from the village would be subsidised.  Passengers would be required to share the journeys with others, as do bus passengers.  Unlike hackneys, the vehicles would have a roof sign noting the name of the village followed by the word "transport".  The vehicle would be capable of carrying seven or eight passengers.  In common with other small public service vehicles such as hackneys and taxis, drivers would be vetted and licensed by the Garda and self-employed.  The vehicles would be subject to NCTs and National Transport Authority rules on age and suitability.  They would be wheelchair accessible.</p> <p>  The beneficiaries of the village transport service would be those who wish to visit or shop in their village, including elderly persons who may no longer be able to drive, persons with reduced mobility, persons with low incomes who do not own a car and those who wish to drink alcohol and comply with the drink driving laws and thus require transport to get from home to village and back again.  Village services including small shops and pubs would also benefit from the service.</p> <p>  A subsidy will be required to make it attractive for drivers to offer the service and passengers to use it.  Without a subsidy, there would be insufficient passengers to make the service viable.  Almost all other passenger transport is subsidised.  The level of subsidy needed per journey could be determined by a consultancy study.  The service could use licensed publicans, for example, to supply subsidy vouchers to persons living outside the village to return to home.  With the involvement of self-employed drivers and village publicans, the booking of journeys could be done informally.  An app that could accept bookings could have a role to play but the nature of the service would not make an app essential as we are aware that some of those for whom the service is intended do not use smartphones.  Of course, passengers would not be required to drink or eat in a pub or purchase other goods or services in the village to benefit from the service.</p> <p>  TDORA is an associate member of the International Road Transport Union, IRU, and participates in the work of the IRU taxi group.  Through our membership of the IRU, we are aware of the EU HiReach programme to provide &ldquo;innovative mobility solutions to cope with transport poverty&rdquo; throughout Europe.  Solutions are actively being explored in areas of Luxembourg, Germany, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Romania.  There is a HiReach workshop in Brussels on 27 and 28 March to consider the results of the work that has been done so far.  We believe that our proposals to the committee are innovative and can provide a solution to the transport poverty being experienced in Irish rural areas.  They provide for a local informal and adaptable service that would serve the people throughout the country who wish to get to and from their local village.</p><p>We commend our proposals to the committee.</p></speech>

I represent the National Private Hire and Taxi Association, the biggest representative group in Ireland for taxi drivers.  We evolved from the Private Hire Association prior to the landmark case Humphrey <i>v</i>. Minister for Environment and Local Government, Dundalk Urban District Council and Dublin Corporation, when our president, Christopher Humphrey, took on the Government and won a case on behalf of our members.  Virtually overnight the number of taxis grew by about 500%.<br/><br/>We agree that the rural communities of Ireland need support and imaginative ideas to help them, including broadband, health, crime prevention and, particularly, transport services.  We suggest, however, that the answer is not an &quot;Uber-style&quot; transport service.  This would be detrimental and dangerous to both rural communities and taxi drivers.  What does Uber-style mean?  It seems to us that it stands for no rules, no standards and no responsibility.  At present we have standards for anyone who wishes to operate as a driver of a small public service vehicle, SPSV.  First, one must have an SPSV licence.  Second, one must have an SPSV-licensed vehicle.  It is as simple as that.  To meet these requirements, one must pass an area knowledge test, be deemed a fit and proper person to hold an SPSV licence by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have adequate insurance.<br/><br/>Now we have vested interest groups suggesting we dumb down the taxi industry and allow anyone to drive for hire to benefit his or her interests.  If drivers are allowed to do so, what does the committee expect will happen?  We predict people coming from the pub will be met with drivers deemed unsuitable by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, cars that are not suitable or roadworthy and situations like, for example, a babysitter taking children out of bed and along for the ride to get an extra few euro.  If the committee allows Uber-style service, it will invite drivers who are so desperate that they will break any rules for profit.  This is already reported as happening worldwide.  We read almost daily about confrontation, assaults, rapes and even murders by so-called Uber drivers, or what we would class as unregulated taxi services, and to think this is the answer to bringing people home from the pub.<br/><br/>Our understanding of rural Ireland is one of communities and neighbourly compassion.  It is people helping one another, and it is to be hoped they will continue to do so.  If Mr. or Mrs. Murphy wants to visit the local surgery or the health service, the HSE will not provide the transport service; neighbours will, and they do so at present.  There will never be a taxi for everyone in the audience, nor an ambulance, a post office, a garda, a bus or a train, whether in rural life or city life.  If one allows Uber-style services into any part of Ireland, they will grow and destroy the livelihoods of the 21,000 taxi families, both urban and rural, relying on the industry to make a living.  We are the men and women who drive people to and from the shops, college, offices, hospitals, workplaces, concerts and sports events.  We are the people who work unsociable hours to bring people home from the pub.  We are the people on the front line facing anti-social behaviour and dealing with people who are drunk or on drugs.  We are the people who provide a safe, professional public transport service.  We are the families relying on our business to survive.  The committee's decisions will affect us and we will remember the decisions and recommendations made by the committee.  The committee could be responsible for destroying our livelihoods if it downgrades our standards.  Please do not.</p></speech>

My name is Gerard Macken, chairperson of the Taxi Alliance of Ireland and member of the National Transport Authority's taxi advisory committee.  In my position I represent urban and rural taxi drivers and small public service vehicle licenceholders from Twenty-six Counties of Ireland.  We are all aware of the issues facing rural communities and the feeling of isolation.  This topic is regularly discussed at the taxi advisory committee meetings.  In fact, I recently arranged a meeting between several rural taxi licenceholders, the NTA and the rural links bus service on this issue.  At the meeting we discussed a subsidy for rural taxi drivers and the possibility of incorporating rural taxis and hackneys into the rural links service.  This alone would facilitate the smaller groups of isolated people in an area when there is no need for a 14 or 18-seater bus.  It is currently a prerequisite for admission to the rural link service to have a 14-seater bus.  This immediately limits the number of applicants joining the system and makes it unviable for journeys with fewer than 14 people.  We have therefore recommended that this condition be changed such that hackneys and taxi drivers become eligible to join.  The NTA and the rural links service are in agreement with us on this.</p> <p>  The application process for rural hackneys is somewhat cumbersome as there are numerous steps in the process which would deter applicants from considering applying.  We have suggested to the NTA that this application process be reviewed, and it has agreed to look into the process.  We would support these changes to the rural hackney process, especially if managed by the NTA as it is the expert in rolling out initiatives such as these.  This would ensure public safety is paramount and enforce rules to eliminate illegal operators across the rural communities.  I thank the committee for listening.</p></speech>

There are no further opening statements, so we will proceed as normal.  To explain to everyone present, the normal process is that we deal with members of the committee first before moving to people who are not members of the committee, and the order is Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, Independents and others.  That is the rotation, so everyone knows where they are.  There is no bar on anyone asking questions or making comments.  I call Senator Feighan.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.523" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019022700002#E00900"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for the time and effort they have put into making the submissions.  The one positive thing that has emanated in recent months from the cut proposals and suggestions of new measures to be introduced is that for the first time in a long time we have rural transport fairly high on the political agenda.  There is now an acknowledgement on the part of Government and indeed of most stakeholders that something needs to be done because this is not fit for purpose.  Does any one of the six gentlemen before us hold one of these 13 hackney licences?  No.  The fact that there are only 13 clearly demonstrates that this is not fit for purpose.  I would be interested to hear about the witnesses' experience.  I imagine that their main overhead is the cost of their insurance.  What is the average cost of the insurance they pay annually?  How has the cost increased in recent years, or has it decreased?  I imagine it has increased.</p> <p>  One thing that has repeatedly been said about Uber is that nearly every Uber driver, if one were to listen to some people, is a rogue driver.  Uber has used technology to connect people who are willing to provide a service with people who need that service.  What we are trying to do - I can only speak for myself - is look at the advancements in technology to provide or connect someone who is willing to provide a service with someone who is in need of that service.  Some of the suggestions the witnesses have made this morning can do that.  The bottom line, however, is that there are many parts of rural Ireland in particular that have no transport whatsoever.</p><p>The Local Link service established on a pilot basis in response to changes in the drink-driving legislation has provided a certain element of service but, given how rural Ireland is settled and populated, it is not able to provide the flexibility needed to go up side roads and byroads.  We need to look at how we can establish a flexible public transport service for rural Ireland.  I am conscious of what people have said.  We cannot dumb down the service or sacrifice standards.  We need to ensure any driver who provides the service is of good character and Garda vetted and that the vehicle being used meets the minimum required standards.  How do we match all of this and ensure we get a service that is fit for purpose?</p><p> I am interested to hear the views of the witnesses on how the subsidy would work.  Quite clearly, the reason taxis do not operate in these villages is there is no money to be made in them.  If there was I would imagine the witnesses or their members would be operating in them.  I am interested to hear how they envisage the subsidy working.</p><p> None of the witnesses holds one of the elusive 13 hackney licences.  Are any of the 13 people members of the witnesses' representative bodies?  Have witnesses spoken to the 13 people?  What is the witnesses' main overhead?  How do they feel the subvention or subsidy could be paid?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.526" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019022700002#F00300"><p>I will share my time with Senator Conway-Walsh.  Similar to what other members have said, we all recognise that rural transport is on its knees.  It has been neglected for decades.  People are finding it increasingly difficult to get from A to B in their communities.  The lack of investment in our public transport system, including in Bus &Eacute;ireann services, has left it even more problematic.</p> <p>  The real worry pertains to sacrificing standards and this is being weighed against the real need to look at other mechanisms to provide transport for people who are basically stranded, it is fair to say, in parts of rural areas.  With regard to Mr. O'Reilly's suggestion, was he speaking about one licence per town or village?  Deputy Troy spoke about the fact that the very rural nature of villages means they are not financially viable for taxis.  In a modestly sized town where people are coming from pubs and clubs, a taxi driver will do the local runs rather than going down byroads and boreens and losing their way.  How would this be financially viable for taxi drivers given the witnesses are speaking about providing seven or eight-seater vehicles and wheelchair accessible vehicles?  Will the drivers have to invest in new vehicles to provide this service?</p> <p>  What exactly is the subsidy?  What are the costings?  The witnesses accept the service is unlikely to be financially viable because if it was, then other taxi drivers would be providing it.  What would be required in the grant or subsidy?  The witnesses must have some idea in their heads.  Will they elaborate on what the grant or subsidy should be to make it financially viable?</p> <p>  How do they propose to monitor the ring-fencing of an area?  A certain number of kilometres between villages was mentioned.  Who would regulate or oversee this?  How would it work?</p> <p>  I accept that of course we must look at alternatives but when people get into a taxi they feel safe because they know there are regulations and standards.  There is also the insurance cost.  There is this security.  How could the service being proposed by the witnesses offer people the same security?</p></speech>

I come from Belmullet, which has no transport.  We speak about transport as if it has become a recent problem but it has been a problem in rural Ireland for many years.  I am glad to be having this discussion.  A few issues are arising, including the issue of displacing existing taxi drivers in an area.  We do not want to have a situation where other people, who have served communities for many years and sometimes over several generations, will be put out of business.</p> <p>  The witnesses are probably not familiar with the Belmullet peninsula but if someone wanted to go from Blacksod to Belmullet the journey would be far more than 15 km.  How would the 15-km limit work in this instance?</p> <p>  This is operating in 13 areas.  Has the effectiveness of the pilot been reviewed and analysed?  While the service would address some of the problems it would not address problems such as trips to hospital.  This is one of the main problems we have in rural Ireland, particularly for people living alone who do not have transport to hospital.  There is also the lack of connectivity between buses and trains.  These pose big problems.  We are here to discuss solutions and I am glad to be having this debate from that point of view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019022700002#F00600"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I have been very interested in this side of rural transport for quite some time, particularly given the road traffic Bill that came before the D&aacute;il.  Deputy Troy said it is very positive that we are now speaking about rural transport.  The mistake was that we should have spoken about it before the Bill went before the D&aacute;il so we would not be fire fighting all the time.  However, the Minister never understood what we explained to him from day one on the floor of the D&aacute;il, that the Bill would cause a crisis in rural Ireland where there were already serious problems.  He did throw a little sprinkle of money at Local Link but it was a cod, unfortunately, and we unravelled it in the D&aacute;il.  Then he threw more money at it.  Again, it was not enough to touch the issue, which was the crisis being created in rural communities.  I know there are shops and a number of other places where people want to go but the issue that hit the headlines was rural people wanting to go for a drink and go home, which they had been doing all their lives, but all of sudden they became criminals.</p> <p>  I have serious issues with the Uber-style transport service being spoken about.</p><p>I give credit where credit is due but my colleague in west Cork, the Minister of State, came up with this idea.  The same Minister was putting it around in the newspapers that I was scaremongering and that there was no problem.  He is now running around frantically trying to come up with a solution to that problem.  He was like the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the rest.  They were all jumping to support the Minister, Deputy Ross's Bill but unfortunately that was a mistake.  I talk to a lot of taxi operators and they have very serious concerns.  I agree with those concerns.  I am open to correction, but I believe they have to replace their vehicles every ten years, which is a very stringent rule.  Most taxi operators want to take on staff but for such staff to obtain a licence they have to go through an extremely rigorous test.  They are asked silly questions that are totally irrelevant to what they have to do.  We need to look at giving taxi operators the freedom to take on more staff.  Surely if somebody has a licence to drive a 16-seat bus that person should be able to drive a taxi automatically.  That could resolve many problems.  At the moment such a person is not allowed, but if he or she was it could resolve a lot of problems and could create openings for taxi operators to employ people.  That is what the operators are telling me in west Cork.  I have to listen to the people on the ground.  </p><p> We should not create another system that could result in an explosion of other problems in the future.  That is what we have been doing on this issue.  We have not been resolving anything; we have been creating more problems.  We are talking about bringing in a new system which will put taxi operators out of business.  People can argue the point that there are not enough taxis, but the operators are saying that licences to drive 16-seat buses should be good enough to allow one to drive a taxi.  That would put a whole load of new drivers on the road straight away who could drive the taxis that are already in existence.  They have all the rules and regulations.  They are bent over backwards with rules and regulations which are costing them an absolute fortune and a system which I cannot understand is being brought in.</p><p> If Johnny is sitting by the fireside at home and Paddy six or seven miles down the road wants a spin to the post office - we always mention the pub, it could be the pub - he will leave his fireplace, take Paddy to the town, go home and leave Paddy there for an hour or two and then come back and collect him again.  I presume it will be a fiver a whip or something like that.  How is Johnny going to do that?  He will have to be Garda vetted and I presume he will have to have some special type of insurance.  Will ordinary car insurance do?  Will he get a once-off grant?  That would sort the issue for this year but in three or four years' time we will find that Johnny will not get out of his chair any more because it does not pay him to do so.  Uber might work in cities.  It has worked in the States - I have spoken to people who use it - but these places are highly populated.  We hear about apps and so on but 90% of the people about whom we are talking only have a house telephone or an ordinary small mobile phone.  Apps do not come into play.  It might work in a city.  The drivers will have special seven-seat, wheelchair accessible vehicles.  Am I right in that?  It is not going to work in rural Ireland.  </p><p> We have existing taxi and hackney operators.  They are paying through the nose.  Perhaps it is these people the NTA should be looking at and making a contribution towards in order to see how they can survive, take on new drivers, and open up their operations more than they are able at the moment.  There might then be an opportunity to see a way forward.  The Uber-style system being touted is a sop to cod the people of rural Ireland but the people of rural Ireland will not be codded because they are fairly cute.  They know what will work and what will not.  Unfortunately, this is not going to work.</p></speech>

We will then go over and back between the members.  The witnesses are very welcome.  They have a vast collective wealth of experience from right across the country.  They provide a very important public service; I acknowledge that.  The absence of the critical mass required to provide services commercially in disparate rural areas means those services are not being provided to individuals.  That is what we are addressing here today.</p> <p>  I would like to make two points.  There is significant funding for rural transport.  It has increased from &euro;10 million in 2015 to &euro;14.3 million in 2018.  Notwithstanding criticism of them, rural transport services carry more than 1.9 million passengers, of whom almost 1 million have free travel passes and 200,000 require assistance or have some significant disability.  The buses travel more than 11.8 million km.  There are more than 900 drivers and 400 private operators.  The core of what Mr. O'Reilly is saying is that we need to support persons who wish to provide this service and to meet a significant portion of their costs where the population base is less than 1,000 and the distances involved are not greater than 15 km, acknowledging the point about Mayo.  I found the point Mr. Macken made about connectivity between the rural link and the taxis and hackneys very interesting.  That is hugely important.  If there is joined-up thinking at that end of delivery, access to taxis can be part of the service.  Many constructive points have been made here.  Senator Feighan has returned.</p></speech>

When one is in a minority Government one has to cover many committees.  In this room we have the solution to the problem facing rural Ireland.  When I was growing up back in the 1980s there were two or three hackney drivers in the town.  They were only used coming from the railway station.  After that they were never used.  People drank and drove.  There were fewer cars.  Coming into the 1990s we all got into using taxis and hackneys.  Many people made a very good living.  People did not mind paying.  People from Boyle would get a bus back and forward to Carrick-on-Shannon.  In the last few years it seems that one cannot get a taxi.  Many of those guys who were making a good living have retired and nobody is taking over.  I am referring to smaller towns of 1,500 to 2,500 people.  The taxis are just not there.  I went to a party in another town two weeks ago.  I had a drink.  I did not want to order a taxi because I knew I would be taking the taxi driver away for an hour on a Saturday night.  He could make a lot more money around the town.  I was conscious of that because there are not enough people covering the area.  We have a problem for the few who are going to the pubs at night.</p> <p>  The Chairman summed it up well.  The rural transport initiative is filling in the gaps, which is welcome.  I know many people are using it to go shopping, to visit hospitals and so on.  There are many towns in which there was never a bus and now there is this initiative.  People are beginning to use it and to use it online.  Deputy Troy mentioned Uber.  I was in London and used an UberPool.  I really think it could be the solution to that problem in rural areas.  We can talk all we want and put whatever funding we want into the issue, but it is a problem.  I understand that Mr. Waldron has interests and he is right to protect them.  If I was in the same business I would do likewise, but it is an issue that one cannot get a taxi in rural towns.  I was absolute fascinated by the UberPool I used in London.  Somebody from Boyle could be going to Roscommon and I might be drinking in the Four Provinces.  On that app I could get somebody to share a ride with me to Tulsk before he or she goes on to Roscommon.  It is a no-brainer for rural Ireland but we have to ensure that the existing licensed taxis and hackneys are not inconvenienced too much.  At the moment, however, there is an issue with taxi availability. I do not know what has happened in the last few years; perhaps there is easier money somewhere else.  Being out driving at 3 a.m., 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. is a tough job.  There are easier things to do.</p><p>I was contacted by two publicans who have seen the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin's rural transport initiative.  They had a car which was bought with donations from the community.  He believes it complements many of these issues.  It is a pilot scheme.  We need to look at all these initiatives outside the box.  We need to look at something different.  I have not asked any questions but this is a significant issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.534" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Myles O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019022700002#H00200"><p>I will ask my colleague, Mr. Kearns, to address the question of insurance shortly.  Deputy Troy made the point that we cannot have a relaxation of standards.  We completely agree with that.  He also asked how the subsidy would work.  That is an important point.  We envisage that the subsidy would be per journey.  One would not pay a lump sum to the driver for the vehicle or for insurance but would subsidise each journey.  The incentive would be for the driver to complete the journey and be paid the subsidy for that journey.  We envisage that it would be the journey home.  The driver would get a voucher from a publican or somebody else in the village and would, at the end of a week or month, present those vouchers to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or the local authority and be paid for the journeys travelled.  The level of subsidy would be whatever is required to make it worthwhile for the driver to offer that service.  That will vary from one area to another but the passenger will only pay a certain amount to get in and out of the village.  If there are not enough passengers, the service will not operate.  Solving the problem of rural isolation and facilitating people getting into and out of the villages will take whatever subsidy is needed.  We envisage that any user of the service would pay for the drive into the village but the return home would be largely met by a subsidy voucher.</p> <p>  Deputy Munster asked a number of questions about who would regulate this.  This would be part of the National Transport Authority, NTA, regulations.  For example, under the Taxi Regulation Act, as well as taxis there are local area hackneys and limousines.  This would be an additional class of village transport service.  We have pointed out that local area hackneys have not been successful because it is too restrictive in many ways and perhaps what we are proposing would replace that service but would be quite different from how local area hackneys operate.</p> <p>  We see this as complementary to the Local Link service.  The main purpose of Local Link is to connect villages to other villages and to connect people living in villages to national transport links, trains, buses and so on.  Our objective here is simply to get people from the areas surrounding the village into the village and back home.</p> <p>  These vehicles and drivers would be quite different from ordinary hackneys, which can travel anywhere in Ireland, and from taxis that can do many things that our proposal for village transport could not do.  It was rightly pointed out that the regulations and examinations that apply to a driver becoming a taxi driver or hackney driver are very difficult to pass.  Although there have been some changes in the last year or so, they are still very difficult to pass.  If the driver's only role is within the village and surrounding areas, the type of examinations needed would be quite different.  They do not need to know the area of the whole county or about taxis, just their own area.  It would be much easier to recruit drivers than it is at present.</p> <p>  On the question of vehicles, there is undoubtedly an argument for a smaller vehicle than the eight or nine seat vehicle we have suggested.  If it is to provide a proper transport service, especially getting people out of pubs and to their homes in the evening, capacity is needed.  We believe that the proposal for an eight or a nine seat vehicle is the correct one but I can understand there would be arguments against that.</p> <p>  We are not seeking in any way to offer an Uber-type service.  This would be regulated by the National Transport Authority.  It would be enforceable by the NTA and the garda&iacute;.  It would not be a question of somebody unregulated driving his or her private car.  However, it would have a restricted but very important role to get people from their homes in rural areas into and back out of the village.  The people going from one village to another could be dealt with by Local Link.  We do not think this would displace taxi drivers.  As has been pointed out, there is a shortage of taxi drivers throughout the country because, for a number of years, the examinations to become a driver were much too difficult and the cost of operating a taxi in a rural area is not economical.  It is not economical for many hackneys to operate either.  This is where a subsidy is required.  I have outlined how the subsidy could work.</p> <p>  With regard to the 15 km, that is an example.  I take the point made about Belmullet.  The hinterland of the village or small town would be the area.  On the question about 1,000 persons, that will vary depending on the area and is simply given as an example.</p> <p>  Trips to hospital could be accommodated by the village transport service taking a person to the village, who is then picked up by the Local Link service and brought to the hospital.</p> <p>  The Uber-type service would not provide a solution for many reasons, not just lack of regulation.  It operates successfully in urban areas.  It would not be able to deal with the situation in rural areas.</p> <p>  I think I have answered most of the questions.  I do not know if there are any others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.535" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vinny Kearns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019022700002#H00300"><p>I will address a few matters.  I live in rural Ireland, in a village called Ballinellard in County Wexford, 25 km from Wexford town.  I am 3.3 km from my local village.  We have a service there which is very limited and really only operates at weekends.</p><p>The route is serviced by 12, 14 and 16-seater buses.  As mentioned by Mr. O'Reilly, this service will be viable on the basis of capacity.  Getting people home from the local pubs on Friday and Saturday nights is not an issue because there is not a huge population in my local town.  One of the main issues for new entrants is the cost of insurance.  For example, for a person aged 50 who may have driven a private car for 30 years, who is accident free, who has a full no claims bonus and who passes the PSV test to become a taxi driver, the minimum charge among the main insurance companies is &euro;6,600 per annum.  If that driver was unfortunate enough to have an accident, he or she would have to produce three letters of refusal to force an underwriter to give a quote.  In that regard, I have seen quotes of &euro;16,000 and &euro;17,000.  In the case of a driver who has been driving a taxi in Dublin for 20 years and has a full no claims bonus, the cheapest insurance available is &euro;1,800 or &euro;1,900.  Insurance is a substantial cost.  It is a complex issue.  We appear to be moving closer to a solution but I do not think our proposal will resolve all of the issues.  A working group should be established to examine best practice in other European jurisdictions.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  There are solutions out there.  For example, integrated transport services, public and private, could be used to facilitate this service.</p><p> The issues of viability and subsidies were mentioned.  Mr. O'Reilly has already addressed the issue of subsidies.  The service will not operate if it is not viable.  In the current economy we have close to full employment and so people are exiting rather than entering the taxi business.  The average age of a taxi driver is 55 plus, which is not good for any workforce.  We would welcome new entrants in order that we might increase our fleet and provide higher service levels across all taxi, hackney and chauffeur operations.  In my area, the average fare is &euro;5.  Locals will not pay any more than that.  The cost of a taxi for the same journey would be approximately &euro;15.  Private local services need to be subsidised to make them attractive to the user otherwise they will not be viable.</p><p> On monitoring, the NTA has a good enforcement team and the Garda have specialist units that are very well versed on PSV regulation so I think there is adequate resources to deal with that issue.  In the context of Belmullet, the radius could be expanded for areas that need greater service provision.  Deputy Michael Collins referred to recruitment and the retention of existing drivers.  It is a big challenge for us.  We have to be careful of the level of displacement that could be created by this service.  The type of service we are proposing is restrictive in that it is addresses a specific need, which is transport to local villages and back.  Drivers will not transport people to hospital appointments and wait around for two hours to bring them home.  If they did, this would deprive other people of a service.  I hope I have covered all of the questions.</p></speech>

There has been no recent investment in the industry, other than for wheelchair-accessible vehicles to meet the needs of people with disabilities.  Taxi drivers meet all the costs of running their vehicles and their businesses.  What we are discussing here today is a proposal to subsidise people's travel costs.  Why is no consideration given to subsidising taxi drivers for the provision of their services, including this service?  The taxi industry is a professional business.</p> <p>  In the context of technology and Uber, taxi drivers use technology every day, including credit card machines, booking apps and so on.  We have no problem doing that.  What we do not want is people who are not licensed doing what we do.  We want the same standards for everybody.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.540" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard Macken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019022700002#J00500"><p>It was stated that there has been a fall-off of business in the taxi industry.  Last year, 669 people availed of the wheelchair-accessible vehicle grant and, thus, 669 new vehicles were introduced into the system.  There has been an increase in the industry through the initiatives of the NTA and the taxi advisory committee.</p> <p>  The decline in the taxi industry in rural areas dates back to the smoking ban, which stopped people going to pubs.  With the introduction of the new driving laws, there is renewed emphasis on transport to and from rural pubs.  As stated earlier, there is an agreement with Local Link and the NTA to subsidise transport for people isolated in rural areas.  The current system in terms of the rural hackney will not change but the number of steps in the licensing process will be simplified.  These services will operate in rural areas but they will also cater for people in isolated areas.  There is no need to invent a new service.  There is already a system in place that works.</p> <p>  Smaller vehicles are far more accessible for those with disabilities and frail elderly people.  All types of vehicles, and not only wheelchair-accessible vehicles which are expensive to operate, need to be taken into account in terms of service provision.  At its most recent meeting with the taxi advisory council, the NTA committed to examine all of these issues.  There is no point legislating for something new.  As stated, there is already in place a service that can be modified in order bring the new service into existence.</p> <p>  In regard to the subsidy, currently Local Link is subsidised for journeys in respect of which services which have to wait for a person or persons in a particular area for a couple of hours.  There is nothing to stop a taxi providing a similar service late at night to and from a pub.  The system does not require too much tweaking in this regard.  I come from a rural area.  Owing to a lack of broadband, I cannot access an app.  Similarly, many vulnerable people living in rural isolated areas will not have WiFi.  In the context of the statement that we need to share, the taxi industry tried that at Christmas and, as my colleague will testify, when it came to the end of the journey and who was paying the fare, we were referees more of the time than we were taxi drivers.</p><p>It was quashed because of our safety.  It is fine sailing through-----</p></speech>

I cannot see any reason to extend Uber further when there is already an agreement for Irish Rural Link services.  I suggest that every taxi and hackney driver should be linked into the National Transport Authority.  There is a safety aspect which is not advertised enough, namely, the driver check app.  Each taxi driver who provides services in these areas can be contacted through the National Transport Authority.  If a tender needs to be issued, it can be issued to 26,000 drivers.</p></speech>

He favours the retention of local area hackneys.  After five years, there are only 13 of those nationally.  That approach has not worked and needs to be replaced.  What we propose would not require new legislation.  It would require new regulation by the National Transport Authority, which was empowered to bring in new regulations to deal with this matter.  An important point has been made about the lack of Wi-Fi and mobile phone connections in rural areas.  To be practical, sharing of vehicles will be required in rural areas if we are to provide any kind of reasonable service.</p></speech>

There is the well managed taxi industry.  Many of us own taxi companies.  It is our full-time profession and we manage it well.  We have many contracts, including Government, Health Service Executive and corporate contracts, for example, with hotels.  Imagine modern Ireland without a proper taxi service.  People wonder what we do.  We deliver packages.  I am a Corkman working in Cork city.  For those who know the South Mall, we do an amount of work up and down there, and we serve all the hotels, including the new hotels opening in Cork.  The service is well managed.</p> <p>  We then have the rural side, which we are talking about today and which does not appear to be as well managed.  If one goes down the app route, there will be no management whatever.  The driver will be at home and may decide to work for an hour and will log on to see if any work is available.  A managed company does not have that problem because it rosters drivers and organises.  It knows what bookings are coming up and what flights are coming in and it picks up people.  We need to make the licence for rural areas a valuable licence, which people want.  We must not flood the place with licences because drivers will not make money and they need to make money to get him, as was stated, to leave the fireside on a wet night when "Coronation Street" is on television.  The driver has a schedule.  A cute, smart operator will develop a schedule and Mrs. Murphy at the end of the road will know that every Tuesday, between 7 p.m. and 7.30 p.m., Johnny will be working.  She will then make the call and visit her sick sister a couple of miles down the road or go to the community centre for a game of cards.  I will also mention that there is a pint involved.  We will try not to start with that, but that is what one needs.  If there is a schedule, the system will work but the driver needs to be rewarded.</p></speech>

The licence should be up for renewal every year to keep the driver keen.  If a driver comes before us seeking a licence renewal, we will want to see the log book and may have complaints from the public to consider also.  We might even find that the demand was such as to merit the awarding of a second licence for the same area.  It has to be managed and the driver needs to be able to make a living.</p></speech>

However, he or she is designated to the area.  If a person wants to be collected anywhere else, the driver can collect there but he or she must go back to his or her existing area.  That is what the current legislation provides.  The problem is solved by extending the existing rural hackney licence to make it more viable.</p></speech>

It is just over two years since our good friend, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, commenced his legislative programme in the Department.  Many of us here were aware of the damage he was going to impose on rural Ireland and even on the periphery of the bigger towns.  We have evidence of that.  Since Christmas, rural Ireland has been in lockdown.  It is a fact and we have not even come into the Lenten period.  One can imagine what pubs in rural Ireland will be like next week when no one will be out in the villages and towns.  I welcome TDORA to the committee.  I hope it is representative of all taxi bodies nationally.  I ask the witnesses to clarify that whether they are from Kerry, Donegal or north Cork, every taxi body is represented.  No one wants to see the taxi business undermined when livelihoods are at stake but there is an issue here.  I am glad taxi drivers acknowledge that there is a problem in rural transport and access for people in rural communities to their nearest villages and towns.  While I accept the proposals in principle and welcome them, it is a pity they did not emerge previously.  The committee and some Members in the D&aacute;il and Seanad have tried to impress on the Minister the need for alternative proposals.  It is ironic today that the NTA has acknowledged through Ms Anne Graham that it is prepared to make subsidies available to individual drivers of minibuses, wheelchair accessible vehicles and cars.  Why did it take over two years?  The Department could have been in discussions with Transport for Ireland.</p> <p>  Taxi drivers in my area have approached me with their concerns on their existing costs of operation.  TDORA's proposals, however, will limit their access to 15 km.  I have no problem with that given that 15 km is the average distance from towns with public services.  However, I ask about eligibility.  Even now, taxi drivers ask me why drivers have to know the maps of Ireland.  When they are living in Mitchelstown or Glanmire, why should they have to know about access to Bundoran or the Inishowen Peninsula?  Something needs to be done about that.  It is one of the reasons access is being restricted to applicants.  I came across the case of a man with a decent business in north Cork.  Having a number of vehicles means a phenomenal capital overhead.  While his vehicles have passed the appropriate NCT or departmental test without a problem, the NTA might put a car off the road over a few scratches in respect of the suitability test.  How will we make vehicles available in rural Ireland if the NTA puts such obstructions in the way?  I ask the witnesses to cover that.  Obviously, they will have to deliberate with the NTA.</p> <p>  The witnesses said, in fairness, that drivers preferred to cover the intensive areas where the short runs are and the quick buck is available as opposed to taking a person on a long run.  Obviously, the latter takes a vehicle out of circulation for a long time.  Would the witnesses be prepared to allow this service to operate on a 24-7 basis?  The tender is restricted to the afternoon and closing time but there is a suggestion around night clubs.  The inability of taxi operators to get people off the streets can lead to anti-social behaviour.  That is one of the reasons there is anti-social behaviour outside some night clubs.  Teenagers and adults cannot be got out of the way as quickly as possible.  Could this service be incorporated to facilitate night clubs in Youghal or Mallow?  It causes anti-social behaviour when there is a build-up of young people outside night clubs while waiting for transport home.  There are only so many taxis.  Would the witnesses' proposal cover this also?</p> <p>  While I have to welcome the proposals, I hope the horse has not bolted.  The NTA is attending today and I will ask it why it took it a year and a half to wake up to the issue.  The Minister still has not woken up to the fact that there is a problem and that mental health issues are arising behind the doors of houses in the countryside.  People do not see other people as often as they used to.  They used to go down to their local, have a few words and get home safely.  While I welcome the proposals, I am concerned that too many restrictions may be put in place and that delivery may take too long.</p></speech>

It is no wonder that there is outrage and uproar around rural Ireland.  Local and European elections are coming and candidates are getting it in the neck.  That is why Ministers are proposing something to deflect from the real issues and problems people in rural Ireland have faced since the introduction of the Minister's Bill, whether it is the young fellow who cannot drive on his own on a provisional licence or those facing the morning checkpoints initiated across all county boundaries and Garda divisions.</p><p>Whatever type of service is put in place, it will not deal with the issues that people are facing the following morning when they cannot go to work.  The social fabric of rural Ireland has been blown to smithereens in one swipe.

That is the only issue we have been debating up to now and it is the only issue I am going to allow to be debated here.

What is being proposed here is absolutely ridiculous.  What is being proposed is some additional type of hackney service.  There is some ridiculous idea that there will be boundaries and these new vehicles will only operate within a certain boundary.  Who is going to be policing these boundaries?  If someone wants to go to the doctor or somewhere else altogether, all he or she has to do is go into a pub, go to the toilet and maybe get a glass of water from the poor publican, and he or she can call on this magnificent service to pick him or her up and take him or her home.  I have a hackney licence and my father before me had it for 60 years.  There are awful strict conditions to it.  We are told we can only have a car that is nine years old.  I am being advised that there are cars 15 years old being used in this.  Who are they going to affect only the poor fella who is regulated and has to jump through so many hoops?  If he does not jump through them, the PSV inspector will nail him full stop and he will not be able to carry on.  Ministers are suggesting this ridiculous idea to take the pressure off them because they are going around to the doors at present and they only got to know about it since Christmas.</p></speech>

The village transport would also be regulated by the NTA.  The question of the wheelchair accessible vehicle, WAV, requirement is a requirement of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a requirement of this committee.  It is stated in a recent report on disability that all public transport vehicles should be wheelchair accessible.  We made the proposal in order to comply with the present policy.  We agree completely with Deputy O'Keeffe about some of the questions that are asked for those wishing to become drivers.  The tests to become a hackney or taxi driver require far too much study and are completely unnecessary.  With the village transport scheme, we are proposing a very easy test that would only require two or three days' preparation, to know the local area and to know the regulations related to that service only.  On the questions of cars of 14 years, it would not seem unreasonable that the cars should comply with the same rules as taxis and others and be nine years old at a maximum.</p></speech>

I will hear the Deputy in a second.  The population will be under 1,000 and the distance proposed would not be greater than 15 km but, because of other questions, it is recognised that there would be longer journeys in some counties.  It is not competing with anybody.  There is no service at the moment and the people cannot get out.</p></speech>

At present, there is a rural hackney service that the legislation is framed around.  The criteria were far more difficult than deemed necessary.  These lads have local knowledge.  The test for them is not as extreme as the rest.  This service exists but has not worked.  What has been proposed is tweaks to this existing service in totally isolated areas where this service could be provided.</p></speech>

On the issue of standards, if it is safe for one, it is safe for the other and if it is unsafe for one, it is unsafe for the other.  That is a basic rule.</p> <p>  Uber is a different matter.  It is more an urban than a rural phenomenon.  It is up to the enforcement authorities to deal with anybody who is operating illegally.  I certainly have never made a case for any service that does not comply with standards.  The characterisation of the issue does not reflect the rural area in which I live.  Some people here would consider it to be a very rural area.  We do not think it is isolated and the issue is not quite as simple as it is being made out to be.  There are plenty of taxi or hackney licences all over rural Ireland, including in these so-called isolated areas.  Like good fishermen, however, drivers frequent the pools with plenty of fish.  I know taxi or hackney drivers who will drive 30 miles to Galway city or Castlebar and fish from those pools.  Why would they not rather than hanging around their own localities?</p> <p>  One of the first things our guests need to get out of their heads is idea that if a taxi driver's home is in a particular area, this automatically means that there will be a service available in the area.  That is not the case.  I recall one night being at a meeting on the edge of Galway city, which is not big, and some people were complaining that the location was too far out of town and that it was an awful long way to travel.  We were nearly falling off our chairs laughing.  I had travelled 35 miles to get there and would have to travel 35 miles to get home.  In my area, we think that a location 10 miles away is next door.</p> <p>  I do not know if our guests check the mental condition of the people who get into their cars.  This is about loneliness or whatever.  I live in rural Ireland.  I guarantee that I am not lonely.  My neighbours are not any more lonely than the people in the cities but we need access to public service vehicles.  I own a car.  There are two cars in my home.  There are only two of us in it.  We have to have two cars but if we want to go out for a night and have a meal and have something to drink, very modestly, we have no way to get home.  On the idea of the distance affecting older people exclusively, the big market is ordinary people doing ordinary things.  Urban and rural living are not so different.  We need to get away from bland characterisations.</p> <p>  I am familiar with Dublin.  I am from here and I grew up here.  If I want to get from A to B, I have three choices - the train, the bus and a hackney or a taxi.  There are no bus or train services in my area at home.  The problem arises when I want to use a taxi to go 5 or 10 miles.  It might not be to the next village, I might go to the one beyond that but I think I should have that choice.  I would have it in Dublin.</p> <p>  We have buried the Uber point and that relating to standards.  My view was that Local Link would identify the areas that cannot be sure to have a service at given times.  That would vary from time to time as the market went up or down.  It could offer a contract to people who were qualified to provide a service on a contract basis, the person would have to be available within the hours in the area and if, through illness or whatever, he or she was not going to be available, he or she would ring in and Local Link would contact someone else.  There would be a system whereby on a Friday night there would be two hackneys available from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. in area A.  They would operate within a certain radius, depending on the area, for example, Belmullet is very different from the area in which I live.  No two areas are the same.  In return, the driver would get a fixed payment, the equivalent, for example, of paying the insurance.  It would be like getting a contract for a private company but in this case it would tie the driver down at the fixed times but the rest of the time, when the driver was not on contract, the taxi could go anywhere because the driver has a licence.  The rural hackney licence is a cod.  There are 11 in the country so we can rub that off the slate.</p> <p>  Some parts of rural Ireland are quite well populated but do not have guaranteed services.  The people want to know that they can pick up the phone and look for the hackney and that in ten or 15 minutes there will be somebody at the door, as is the case in Dublin.  That is all we are looking for.  It is mind-bogglingly simple.  The market does that in the urban areas.  To make sure that happens we need a contract to make sure the person is there and to get the contract it is necessary to give them a little bit of dosh.</p> <p>  Let us look at the figures.  In that context, &euro;60 million goes to Dublin Bus and &euro;50 million to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The taxis are not getting the subsidy in urban transport but the buses are.</p></speech>

That is amazing because &euro;3 million gets about the same amount as &euro;1 million in and around Dublin.  My proposal is very simple and does not upset any of the questioned routes.</p> <p>  There were 15,000 ordinary taxis and 1,471 wheelchair-accessible vehicles in 2017.  That is a ratio of approximately 10:1.  Of course, there should be some wheelchair-accessible taxis but not every vehicle needs to be wheelchair-accessible any more than every vehicle in the city is wheelchair-accessible.  At the taxi rank near here some vehicles are wheelchair-accessible and some are not.</p></speech>

It would be up to me, as the contracting authority, to ensure I have enough wheelchair-accessible vehicles in the area in the short term but not exclude the other big pool of drivers who already exist.  That is all I am saying.  This would provide the exact same balance as in city and urban areas.  Under my plan, when the rest of the country gets to 100% so will rural areas.  It would be the exact same except in this case the contracting authority would have to make sure every area had a more than adequate wheelchair-accessible service.</p> <p>  On the Chairman's point, it is fair to state that in most cases what Rural Link does is focused at a certain cohort in the community.  It is not focused on people who want to go out for dinner or to the pub at night.</p></speech>

For a bus service, everyone will have to go to the pub at 7 p.m. and leave at 11 p.m. because that is when the bus will run.  What happens if a couple wants an early dinner sitting and to be home at 10 p.m. because they are paying for a babysitter and do not want to be hanging around all night but somebody else wants a late sitting in a restaurant at 8.30 p.m. or 9 p.m. and stay until midnight?  In the city, what people do is that within a quarter of an hour of leaving they phone a taxi.  We need this type of reality and on-call service.  My point is that it would be up to the contracting authority to ensure that wheelchair-accessible vehicles would be in adequate supply to meet all reasonable needs.  In the meantime, we must recognise the fact that if we are to allow existing hackneys and taxis into the game, it would be inhibiting to require 100% wheelchair accessibility in every vehicle in rural Ireland with only 10% wheelchair accessibility in urban Ireland.  This is the point I am making.  All I want to do is replicate-----</p></speech>

He is quite right that most of the existing vehicles are not wheelchair-accessible and on the basis of his approach we would start off by using existing vehicles and I see nothing wrong with that.  What we have proposed is an additional service to the Local Link service that would be very much based in the village.  It would be adaptable and the drivers would have every incentive to work whatever hours it took to get people in and out of the village.  Rather than somebody in Dublin figuring out schedules or routes,  this would be done by local drivers, perhaps in consultation with the publicans or others to come up with a plan to serve the local area.</p> <p>  If Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v had had an opportunity to read our proposal, he would have seen it is not exclusively based on helping out older people.  It would certainly service people who want to go to a restaurant or a pub.  We see Local Link as connecting to the service in the village, picking people up from the one village to go to other villages or for hospital appointments.  The service we propose would simply operate to and from the surrounding area in and out of the village.</p> <p>  In so far as new vehicles would be involved, under the NTA's existing rules they would have to be wheelchair-accessible.  There is an issue about wheelchair-accessible vehicles.  We have asked for a full review of the requirement with a study by the ESRI.  There is an argument to suggest that there should be specialised wheelchair-accessible services rather than requiring all vehicles to be wheelchair-accessible.  As of now, the rules are that all new public transport vehicles must be wheelchair accessible, which is why it is in our proposal.</p></speech>

We did a report on this, which we published last week.  We addressed it in the D&aacute;il.  People with a disability have an absolute right to insist the taxi or public service vehicle that comes for them can carry them and meet their needs.  I know Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is not suggesting otherwise but a core part of our democratic transport system is that everybody gets a service.</p></speech>

The one thing that keeps taxi drivers away from rural areas is the money.  People need to make a day's pay, they cannot work for nothing.  If a subsidy is to be given out, the first people it should go to is taxi drivers.  At present, we are restricted to charging a metered fare.  We cannot charge any more than what is on the meter.  Perhaps if Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v wanted to go out for a meal, he might want to pay &euro;10 more than the normal taxi fare and he might think this would be worthwhile.  However, a taxi driver cannot charge that amount at present.</p></speech>

I understand that the committee wishes me address the topic of rural taxis.  To assist me in dealing with members' subsequent questions I am joined by Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO, and Ms Margaret Malone, rural transport manager with the authority.<br/><br/>Before dealing with the specific areas of focus, I would like to give the committee an overview of developments in the Local Link rural transport programme.  The objective of the rural transport programme is to provide a good quality nationwide community based public transport system in rural Ireland which responds to local needs.<br/><br/>Key features of the rural transport programme include: completing 2 million passenger journeys in 2018, with 1 million of those journeys provided for free travel passengers; over 400 private operators providing the services using the services of almost 900 drivers; the programme funding the provision of once-off trips for individuals and community-voluntary groups to help address the lack of transport as a factor in social exclusion; and Local Link services being a mixture of regular rural bus services and demand responsive, door-to-door services operating in very remote rural areas.  These services are broken down as follows: 63 rural regular services and 1,350 demand responsive services operating nationally; 80% of all rural transport services are accessible broken down as follows: regular services - 85% of fleet in use is accessible.  This is a combination of low floor entry vehicles and vehicles with wheelchair lifts; the demand responsive services - 65% of the fleet in use is accessible, comprised mainly of vehicles with wheelchair lifts; and the NTA has improved the information on the Local Link website, <i>www.locallink.ie</i>, which has seen traffic to the website more than tripling in 2018.<br/><br/>Over the past three years, the authority has supported the expansion of rural transport services to include regular commuter bus services.  Operating at least five times per day over a five, six and seven days per week schedule, these services are specifically designed to ensure connectivity with other public transport services.  This connectivity facilitates passengers to make onward journeys typically to access education, employment, health, recreational and other opportunities.<br/><br/><b></b>With regard to recent initiatives in rural transport, the authority recently produced its Strategic Plan for Rural Transport 2018-2022, which sets out nine key objectives for delivery upon over the life time of the plan.  The key priorities of the programme continue to include addressing rural social exclusion and the integration of rural transport services with other public transport services.<br/><br/>The authority is currently implementing one of the listed actions in the strategy under Objective Area 8 - Encouraging Innovation in Rural Transport Service Provision, that is, the provision of evening and night services to address unmet transport needs in rural areas.<br/><br/>Following a funding call in February 2018, a total of 65 new evening-night time services were subsequently approved for funding and the majority commenced operating in July 2018.  Key characteristics of these new services include: 23 of these services are extensions to existing regular public transport services; 42 of these services are demand responsive services; services will be provided nationally across 26 counties; and the services will run on average from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m., typically on Friday and Saturday evenings.<br/><br/>The initial six-month pilot was extended by a further three months as it was felt that they needed sufficient time to be established and for the community to trust that the service was reliable.  While take-up levels were slow initially across all the new services, patronage began to increase in the lead-up to Christmas and in many cases has been retained in the past few months.  A small number of non-performing services were withdrawn at the end of December 2018.  The initial review of the services at the end of December is published on the Local Link website.  It was felt that most of the services end too early in the evening and an extension of time should be considered should these services continue.<br/><br/>On the co-ordination of services, in exercising its functions the authority seeks to achieve the provision of an integrated public transport system of services and networks for all users.  Wherever appropriate, we seek to integrate and co-ordinate services to provide for seamless travel options where change of bus and-or mode is required.  This includes the operation of rural transport services, Local Link, which can facilitate connecting to mainline inter-urban services, irrespective of the provider of those services.  In fact, the NTA is the only body that can bring modes and operators together in an integrated service pattern that provides the best service for rural communities.<br/><br/>However, the NTA recognises that public bus transport cannot meet the demands for travel for many people in rural Ireland, either because it is not available at all or it is not available at the time needed.  Taxis and hackneys play an important role in meeting the travel demand when public transport is not available.  However, it is recognised that there are gaps in the provision of taxis and hackneys in many rural communities.<br/><br/>The taxi regulation review report, published by the Government in January 2012, recommended the introduction of a local area hackney licence to address transport deficits that would not otherwise be addressed in certain rural areas.  Regulations permitting the issue of such licences were introduced with effect from December 2013 to enable a part-time hackney service to be provided in generally rural areas which are likely to be too small to support a full-time taxi or hackney operation, and which are too far from adjacent centres to be serviced by taxis or hackneys from those adjacent centres.<br/><br/>However, there is a very low take up of local area hackneys due primarily to the cost of insurance.  To carry passengers, the standard insurance has to be changed to allow carriage of passengers for hire or reward.  This can increase the cost of the insurance up to &euro;8,000 per year, making it uneconomic to provide such a service.  Accordingly, it is clear that the current local area hackney model needs to change in order to address this significant cost barrier to the provision of needed services.<br/><br/>In response to this the NTA proposes the following: simplify the administration involved in the local area hackney application process; pilot a small number of hackney services that will receive grant aid in areas that have no hackney or taxi service operating currently; and pilot a small number of community transport services that will receive grant aid in areas that have no hackney or taxi service currently operating.</p><p>No new legislation is required.  The current Taxi Regulation Act 2013 would not require to be amended.  The pilots will enable the NTA to test this operational model before making it available county-wide and it would also allow us to better estimate the cost of delivering this type of grant aid.  It also has to be carefully managed so that it does not undermine existing licensed taxi and hackney operators in rural areas.</p><p> The work the NTA is doing in expanding rural public transport services and this new proposal to expand local area hackney and community transport services will go a long way in meeting the travel demand in isolated rural communities.</p></speech>

I am concerned that of the 1.9 million passengers, almost 1 million were those using free travel, that is, older people or people with a different entitlement to free travel, including people with disabilities.  The figure for those requiring assistance is 200,000.  It seems as though the NTA is meeting a great need, which I acknowledge.  It is of great importance to people who would not otherwise have the capacity to meet their own transport needs.  I also welcome the recognition of gaps in service.  In principle, the NTA is looking for a private sector and community solution.</p> <p>  One community solution which has been mentioned to me is in Louth, Meath and Fingal where a local service operates.  A driver is registered, has Garda clearance and provides his or her own vehicle.  He or she would not actually be paid but would be known to the people in the area.  One will know the person, can telephone him or her and organise transport.  If there is payment it is in lieu of something.  That is one issue on which we will invite them before the committee to discuss.  The problem our earlier witnesses raised was that the cost of insurance, even for a driver with 30 years of accident-free driving, could be &euro;6,000 or &euro;8,000.  I presume that the grant aid to which Ms Graham referred would be at that level of commitment, where there is no service at all.  Could she expand on what the NTA would do?  Would it basically pay the insurance where there is no service?</p></speech>

It recognises that insurance is the barrier to many of these services operating, whether that be on a community basis or local area hackney system.  That is the purpose of the grant aid.</p></speech>

That is the requirement on both the community-type service and the local area hackney service.

As Ms Graham said, we would look for a record of the bookings people took and see that they are genuinely providing the services in that area.  Otherwise it makes no sense to pay the grant.  If they are providing the service, the grant is paid to them.</p></speech>

We will not make it very onerous which goes against the idea of what we are trying to do but there must be a balance between some evidence that the service has been provided and the granting of the payment.</p></speech>

I will summarise the proposal for Deputy Troy who asked the question and has just joined us.  Where there is a gap, and there is no existing service, it is proposed that there be a community and private initiative where it would pay the insurance costs on a monthly basis to the service provider, so long as they met certain requirements, and that it will be done in the 17 Local Link areas.</p></speech>

I welcome the presence of the NTA representatives today.  I acknowledge that they have come proposing solutions which is not always the case when groups come before the committee.</p> <p>  The critical matter here is the timeframe for implementation and whether the scheme will be backed up with adequate resources.  Last August-September, in reaction to the drink driving legislation, the night time Local Link services were established.  They were to be established for six months as a pilot, which has been extended for three months.  Has there been an analysis of how the operations have worked?  Anecdotally, having spoken to colleagues and some of the transport co-ordinating units themselves, they have worked well in some areas and in others there has been very low demand.  I hope that the proposal here will not replace those services as they were not simply about bringing people out socially but they also helped bring those who work in towns late at night back to their villages and provided links to other transport services.  They are not merely to bring people to and from the pub.  We need to acknowledge that Local Link has worked in some areas.  </p> <p>  I understand that all the transport co-ordination units have been put out to tender and they await information as to whether they have been successful.  The current contract under which they operate expires on 31 March.  The new operations would have to be in for 1 April.  It is almost 1 March but people are still not aware whether they have been successful.  In the context of continuing the Local Link service, is the NTA confident that the tenders will be awarded and there will be no disruption in service?  If some providers lose their bid, it would be very onerous to establish a new service will have to be established before 1 April.  </p> <p>  I now turn to the proposals before us today.  A situation where there are only 13 hackney licences available nationally is not fit for purpose.</p><p>It is not working.  The NTA is talking about simplifying the administration involved in the application process.  Can the witnesses specify how it will simplify the process?  Can they confirm the timeframe in respect of when the pilot will be up and running and how many resources have been allocated to the pilot system?  </p><p> We heard a number of contributions this morning from taxi representatives, who are in the Public Gallery.  Two major issues are the average age of taxis and recruitment of taxis drivers.  Is the NTA confident that this will not prove to be challenge and that it will be able to get somebody to provide and run this pilot service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.702" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019022700002#S00200"><p>It is obvious that some parts of rural areas are not served by the rural transport programme.  Can the witnesses from the NTA tell us the areas that have a functioning rural transport programme and the areas that do not?  I submitted a question about it some time ago and was told that the NTA was unable to collate that information.  I am quite sure that was an error.  I am sure that as the governing body, the NTA would have all that information and would be able to furnish us with it.  If the witnesses from the NTA do not have it with them today, would they agree to furnish us with it?</p> <p>  In the strategic plan, the NTA mentioned increasing services yet it has reduced the number of Local Link offices from 35 to 17.  How could that be a good idea given that the NTA said the services should be locally managed and that it would be a demand-responsive service?  How could that be a good idea when many areas do not have any public transport at all?  The strategic plan always stated that it was about demand-responsive services.  It seems that since the NTA has taken over, it is moving more towards scheduled services so that would conflict with demand-responsive services.  I am worried that the rural transport programme is plugging gaps that should be filled by Bus &Eacute;ireann services.  Could the witnesses from the NTA give us figures about how many new Bus &Eacute;ireann services have been launched in the past year and whether or not they were new routes or involved increased frequency on existing routes?  </p> <p>  Among the key findings of the NTA's first review was that some services ended too early in the evening so some of them were deemed to be non-performing.  Given that this was the NTA's first review, has it extended those services to see whether there was an uptake or the number of people using them increased or did it put them down as non-performing services and leave it at that?  </p> <p>  I asked for some figures in a parliamentary question last November.  Wait for it - I got the response from the NTA yesterday.  We are talking about November, December, January and February - four months.  One could not make it up.  The figures were quite shocking.  I had requested information about the additional funding allocated in budget 2019 for each of the CI&Eacute; companies and Go-Ahead.  It transpired that current expenditure is down at a time when rural transport is on its knees.  The NTA's capital expenditure took a massive cut.  In 2018, it was &euro;9.2 million but it is down to &euro;2.9 million.  That is very serious.  At a time when we should be focusing on increasing our public transport services, it turns out that budgets are being reduced.  As we all know, Bus &Eacute;ireann is the main provider so I cannot see how the NTA could explain that.  </p> <p>  I asked also about funding allocated to Go-Ahead, which was awarded contracts to operate the subsidised bus services.  The NTA spoke about reasons of commercial sensitivity but Go-Ahead's only competition is Bus &Eacute;ireann and it is public money.  There are serious questions to be answered in this regard.  This is taxpayers' money that the NTA is using to subsidise a private company whose only competitor is our national bus service, Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We know how much money Bus &Eacute;ireann receives.  In fact, we know the NTA is reducing Bus &Eacute;ireann's budget but the NTA will not tell us what it is giving to subsidise Go-Ahead.  This is very serious stuff.  It is unbelievable.  </p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses from the NTA.  More importantly, I acknowledge that there is a crisis in rural Ireland regarding access for people living there.</p><p>I would like to ask Ms Anne Graham why the National Transport Authority, NTA, only hears alarm bells ringing now.  When we were going through the amendments to the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2018, these issues were highlighted by many of my colleagues.  We got no reaction from the authorities.  Now, when the horse has bolted and the damage is done, we seem to be seeking a resolution.  Some initiatives have been put in place, which I welcome.  However, I have to ask why it is only now that the alarm bells are ringing in the NTA offices.  The pilot scheme for a night-time rural bus link is nearing its completion at the end of March.  It links up a few areas.  Many areas are being considered for it.  As the witnesses know, buses run on a timeframe.  Rural Ireland can run on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis.  Not everyone lives on the main artery roads or regional roads.  People live on byroads or on the sides of hills.  That is why I would welcome any proposal, such as a hackney service.  Uber was suggested by one of our Ministers in the last few weeks.  Anything that helps to get people from A to B at unsocial hours, for want of a better word, would help.  <br/><br/>We also have an issue in the mornings after people have been socialising.  Could this service be utilised in the morning too, by people who have short journeys to work, perhaps in the nearest town, but are afraid to drive?</p></speech>

At this stage no-one knows what the limits are.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.728" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019022700002#T00400"><p>I thank the National Transport Authority for the presentations to us.  The Local Link service is second to none as a daytime service.  It is absolutely meticulous, and it is a model that should be looked at in rolling out any future transport service.  I am not just talking about west Cork or County Cork, but Local Link throughout the country.  The people on the board represent a geographic spread, so they understand what is needed in each area and thankfully they ensure that everyone is catered for.  There are very few people throughout the country who have any issues with Local Link as a daytime service.  The only worries we have are the contracts that are being awarded at the moment.  That decision is very important, as Deputy Troy said.  It is awaited by these groups so they can continue the roll-out of the good work they do.</p> <p>  I do not have much faith in the new service.  If I am proven wrong I will be quite happy to accept that.  I said earlier today that the horse has bolted.  We should have been sitting here two years ago, before the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, introduced the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2018.  That would have been very helpful.  We would at least have been able to try to counteract the very significant damage that has been done to rural Ireland.  In my own area, several pubs and businesses have closed in the last few months thanks to this Act.  The witnesses have said it could take months for this to get off the ground.  The reason I cannot see it working is that a whole load of regulations are to be attached to this service.  The NTA will give operators some grant aid.  We are talking about a seven-seat or eight-seat vehicle.  It will have to be wheelchair accessible.  The providers will obviously have to be Garda vetted.  There will have to be insurance.  That is a significant issue for any operator trying to run a business.  The NTA will pay the operator monthly payments.  First he or she has to buy the vehicle, then he or she has to insure it.  The operator will by then have spent a lot of money.</p></speech>

That is what they are saying.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.730" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019022700002#T00600"><p>We need to tease all these aspects out.  It is very hard to see a person getting a vehicle for &euro;10,000 and insurance for &euro;6,000, &euro;7,000 or &euro;8,000.  We are talking about costs close to &euro;20,000 before the operator turns the key in the ignition.  Then he or she will have to roll out the service for &euro;5 per person.  In a rural community he or she might do one run in a night, or three runs on some nights.</p> <p>  The point I am trying to make is that we have a system in place already.  There are problems with it.  There is no point in saying that there are not.  The best way forward is for the NTA to sit down with the Local Link managers and the heads of taxi and hackney services and try to come up with a solution.  They will certainly do that, because the Local Link providers have worked side-by-side with hackney operators and never displaced them.  They have worked with them successfully.  We are now going to throw another service, which will not be as regular, into the fray.  Will operators have to have their vehicles tested in the same way as the hackney taxis?  I presume they will if they are to carry passengers.</p> <p>  A lot of questions need to be addressed.  We are not looking at the bigger issue here.  Many hackney and taxi service operators tell me they would be quite happy to have their cars running by night but they cannot get employees because of what is involved in getting a licence.  Let us say the operator is based in Skibbereen.  One of the first questions a candidate will be asked is where the Garda station in Mitchelstown is.  In the name of God, that is irrelevant.  It is total madness to bring up a question like that.  A driver's satnav will take him or her there if needed.  If the firm is based in Skibbereen, the driver will not be going to Mitchelstown Garda station very often in his or her career, maybe once every 20 or 25 years.  He or she may feel differently because of that kind of questioning.  </p> <p>  There are also situations where operators are trying to get their vehicles on the road, but they feel the powers that be are against them doing that.  Obviously there must be serious regulation in place because these vehicles are carrying people for payment.  However, the authorities seem to want to find a problem, instead of working with operators to find solutions.  People complain that hackney and taxi drivers charge too much.  They are excessively regulated.</p> <p>  With all this grant aid, perhaps the NTA can sit around the table with the Local Link operators and create a solution.  Local voluntary community groups want to help with a solution.  This is a major crisis in every town and village.  Adding another service just complicates matters.  I mean no disrespect, but one service out of 17 was introduced in Cork.   That is a drop in the ocean.  At least 30 or 40 services are needed to somewhat counteract the crisis caused by Ross's Act.</p></speech>

I will not use the name.  I do not want to be negative.  The witnesses have run Local Link and they know it must be rolled out meticulously.  Nothing can be taken away from that.  The NTA has gone down another route now.  I am convinced that Local Link should be very much involved in this.  The existing taxi and hackney operators, who are struggling to survive in rural communities, are willing to work with this.  They should be around the table.  Perhaps some of this grant aid should be going towards them.</p></speech>

Is that correct?  Its representatives are not talking about existing issues separate from what the NTA is proposing.  This proposal is for areas where there are no services, no taxis, no hackneys, nothing.  That is what we are talking about.</p></speech>

As they know, I am concerned about a whole lot of rural issues.  I have sent some emails and I hope I will get an answer to them soon.  I will focus on the issues for discussion today.  I will start with the first point.  As I have pointed out time and again, when it comes to vehicle subsidies rural Ireland is totally discriminated against, counting per head of population.</p><p>The amount of money spent on urban and public buses and vehicles is much higher than in rural areas.  I am not begrudging of that and it is very handy when one is in the city.  One can get buses, trains and there are all sorts of ways of getting around.  It is about levelling up the playing pitch, and it is up it must come.  Nothing should be taken from the cities but we need to spend money.  Why should everything in rural Ireland be done for free?  I do not agree with the notion of it being a free or voluntary community effort.  As with everyone else who provides a service, the providers should be able to earn a living from it.  If we looked at the addresses of hackney and taxi owners around the country, we might be quite surprised at how many of them are in rural areas with no service.  The reason is they tend to migrate to the cities on busy nights.  This is not just a problem in isolated rural areas with no service.  This is a problem of people not being sure on any given night or day that the service will be available when they want it.  Currently, the hackney operators are free to go wherever they get fares.</p><p> We need a comprehensive solution of contracted services to ensure every part of island has contracted services available by public service vehicle at all reasonable hours.  It is not a big ask where a population is not sparse.  I look at this proposal and there is one service in County Galway, so thanks for that.</p></speech>

I have fair justification in that respect.  That is just one scheduling of a bus after 6 p.m. and we have not got it after all that time.  It is a fair summation.  We can come back in the autumn to see who is right but I do not foresee this new service being up and running before September.  When it is up and running, it will go for six months and then there will be a review.  I have seen the way everything works in this country.  For a year or two, we will be as badly off as we are now except for the lucky dip of 34 small communities around the country.</p> <p>  It is a pervasive fact that one cannot be guaranteed a public service vehicle in rural Ireland when it is required.  As close as six or seven miles away from Galway there could be plenty of hackney and taxi drivers but they all go to the city to work, so people cannot be sure of a service.  This is the usual thing in rural Ireland, sop in &aacute;it na scuaibe; it means a straw instead of a brush, and we know how much a sop would do to sweep the floor.</p></speech>

We all know the value of Local Link and the services it has provided for many years.  We appreciate it very much where it has done much for elderly people in rural places.  We are talking about a separate matter altogether, though, which is what has transpired since the enactment of this very draconian Bill put in place late last year, particularly its effect on rural Ireland.  The Government promised some time early last year that it would introduce services to counteract these effects.  A kind of pilot scheme was proposed in Kerry.  There was much ado and a big hullabaloo about eight services to be provided in Kerry, with one of those services taking people from Cloghane to Brandon once per month.  It was a publicity exercise to deal with a massive problem.  The people out there cannot be fooled any longer.</p></speech>

At the request of the Minister and his junior Minister, who were under pressure, as well as Deputy Heydon and others, there was a big story that a pilot scheme would be provided.  The truth will always come out about what we got in Kerry.  We got eight extra services, and one of them is once per month.  Nobody can deny that here, there or anywhere.</p> <p>  It is hard to follow everything but it has been mentioned that insurance will be subsidised for some of those who will provide a service.  There will be uproar among the hackneys and taxis already paying massive insurance.  If we are to be realistic, we must talk to those people and subsidise those who are already trying to provide a service.  The witnesses argue this is for an area with no service but there is a hackney service in towns and parishes all over Ireland.  Somebody or perhaps many people would have a hackney service.  It would not be financially viable to operate during the week and at the weekend they might go to a busy town to get a bit of work.  Rural Ireland would still be left behind.</p></speech>

Rural Ireland is different from Dublin and many other places, including Cork city.  In the mornings we do not have Luas, DART or bus services to transport us to work.  There are many people who are isolated at the moment.  They cannot even go to pubs anymore because many have closed already.  People cannot have a social drink at home tonight in rural Ireland, because if they are going to work tomorrow morning, they will be held up at various places.  The living daylights are frightened out of people.  What service are we going to provide for them?  Has anyone spoken about providing a service to help people to get to work?  People will manage to go to the pub sometimes, with great difficulty, but the morning after, after they have done everything right the night before, they are still being held up at the crossroads.  Who gave the order that morning checks were to be carried out?  It is a fact that people in rural Ireland are frightened.  They are like rabbits in a hole, afraid to come out in case the fox or the dog might catch them.  They are terrorised in their homes.  They cannot have a social drink, as they could before.  I knew this would happen before it happened, because I meet people on a 24 hour basis seven days a week.  This has manifested itself in the constituencies of Deputies from other parties, including the main Government party.  It is clear that this is a big issue in rural Ireland.  How are we going to deal with the people who are affected by these morning checks?  Is there any proposal to provide a transport service for them?  Has any direction been given in that regard?  Perhaps it is not part of the discussion we are having today, but what is going to happen to provisional drivers who cannot get to work or college and whose parents cannot be with them?  They are waiting between 20 and 25 weeks for a test.  Is there any mention of a transport service for those people?</p></speech>

We would like to have the scheme up and running this summer if possible.  We have just completed a tender process, and the transport co-ordination units, TCUs, will be informed whether they have been successful this week.  The decision on these tenders was taken at our board meeting last week, so the successful bidders should know by the end of this week.  The idea is that we will keep the services.  There should be no interruption to any services if any changes are made to the delivery of Local Link office services.  It should not impact on public transport services.</p> <p>  In terms of resources, no additional human resources are being allocated.  We will ensure that there are enough financial resources to carry out the pilot this year.  We do not know exactly what that will entail, but we will set aside sufficient funding from our budgets to carry out the pilot.  There will be one pilot project of each type of service in every county.  </p> <p>  The analysis of the pilot evening service is up on our website, which covers the period to the end of December.  We will have to do that work again.</p></speech>

Anecdotally, we are hearing the same things that have been expressed here today.  The evening services are working extremely well in some cases but in other cases patronage is low.  To be fair to the process, getting any public transport service off the ground, building trust in it and finding passenger confidence in it can take a period of time.  We are expecting to see an increase in usage on many of those pilot routes between December and March of this year.  As soon as those results are in we will make them available to everyone, which will dictate where we go with the evening services, subject to funding.</p></speech>

In conjunction with the taxi advisory committee, which is a consultative group for the taxi industry and includes consumer groups and various other parties, we devised a system whereby we required local authorities to endorse the application and confirm there was not a significant number of other taxis or hackneys operating in the area.  We also required sign-off from local groups, be they local business groups or registered charities.  Those steps were in place previously.  We believe we should simplify those and remove most of those burdens in order to make the process simpler.  We will dial back those two steps as far as possible to make the application process as simple as possible.</p></speech>

That work was done more than four years ago.  It was part of re-examining the delivery of rural transport services.  A decision was taken at the time to reduce the number of offices.  The delivery of services locally has not been diminished by that.  In fact, the service is certainly improving in many of the areas.

Those services have stayed in place and, in fact, been increased.  Some 80% of the public transport services through the rural transport programme are demand-responsive services.  It is still a very significant part of delivery by the Local Link offices.  Reducing the number of offices did not reduce the transport services.  We only reduced the number of administrative offices managing those services.  This did not have an impact on public transport service delivery.</p> <p>  On the question on the number of new Bus &Eacute;ireann services launched in rural areas, I would have to come back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

He asked why we see the alarm bells only now.  In fairness to us, we have recognised for a long time that the local area hackney service system is not working.  This is largely down to insurance and a small bit down to the administration side.  Nine months ago, we brought a proposal to our taxi advisory committee, about which I spoke, and it has been under discussion since then.  It is not that we are just waking up now; we are conscious that this needed correcting and we are trying to achieve broad agreement as to what to propose.</p></speech>

We were dealing directly with the taxi advisory committee.  We brought a proposal to it and it has been under discussion for a considerable number of months.  We have now got it to the stage at which we are proposing what we have here.</p> <p>  Deputy Collins mentioned a number of matters.  Let me explain how the local area hackney service is intended to work.  It is intended to be regulation-light.  A large seven or eight-seater vehicle is not required, nor is a wheelchair-accessible vehicle.  One is not required to pass the standard driver test that all other taxi and hackney drivers must pass.  It is intended to fill a gap where it is uncommercial to provide a normal service.  The key rule is that the vehicle must be under ten years of age and have an NCT certificate.  Everything else is relatively light around that.</p> <p>  With regard to discussing how the service should operate with taxis and hackneys, a taxi advisory committee has been put in place under legislation.  It includes representatives from the taxi groups and hackney groups across Ireland.  Members will have heard from some of them this morning.  We tease out with the groups the appropriate measure to put in place.  The Deputy is correct that one local area hackney in Cork is a bit of a drop in the ocean for Cork, but it is only a pilot scheme.  The intention is that if it functions properly and we sort out any kinks that arise &mdash; inevitably, there will be kinks &mdash; it can be put in place in the other areas that genuinely need the service.  I believe I have addressed the Deputy's key points.</p></speech>

They will be crucial to the delivery of the service.  They would be very much involved, particularly in identifying the areas we pilot first.  We would not be in a position to proceed unless they were involved.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said rural Ireland is totally discriminated against.  We have had this argument at this committee before.  We obviously do not agree.  We try to provide services, both urban and rural, to the extent that we can, with the budgets we have available.  We try not to discriminate between one area and another.  We just try to provide a service that meets local demand, knowing that there are gaps and that there are limits to what we can provide based on our budgets.</p> <p>  We are committed to trying the service out, piloting it and determining the pitfalls, if any.  It is also a question of being able to identify the cost of delivering the service nationwide.  Currently, we do not have the funding to deliver it on that level.  I believe that answers Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's questions.</p> <p>  On Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's questions, Local Link offices are going to be very much involved.  We rely on their local knowledge to assist us in putting the pilot in place.</p> <p>  Mr. Creegan shall respond to Senator Humphreys's questions.</p></speech>

We are not in the business of waiting for ages to know how a pilot functions.  We will know very quickly whether we have issues to resolve.

I am concerned, however, that the delegates have not yet identified a specific budget for the pilot.  They have only said they are going to set aside the necessary resources.  They do not know specifically how much grant aid they are going to give to the community operator and how much will go towards the insurance of the particular operators.  If there are 34 operators - 17 community and 17 commercial - are 34 insurance premiums going to be paid?  Are 34 different types of subvention going to be paid?  Based on this, the pilot scheme could cost &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000.  These are quick figures based on some of the figures that have been bandied about.  Will the resources have to come from the 2019 allocation and thus be diverted from somewhere else?  That would be a worry because, to be fair, the delegates are operating quite efficiently on a tight budget already.  The delegates expressed a desire, which I will not question, to get the service up and running in a timely fashion.  They also have many other projects that they are trying to get off the ground or with which they are involved, including BusConnects and metro north.  Do they have the capacity?  Has the authority received additional human resources in recent years to implement all the schemes it is trying to implement?</p><p>Before I make my final point, I wish to raise an issue we have experienced many times.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v gave an example of it.  It took 12 months for an additional Bus &Eacute;ireann route on the 115 service to be approved in Mullingar from the time the initial application was made by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  There is therefore a legitimate concern about the ability to roll this out in a timely and efficient manner.  There are concerns that the NTA has not quantified the budget <i>per se</i>and that the funding will have to be taken from what is already allocated.  As previous speakers have said, it has the capacity to work.  I acknowledge that, and there is flexibility there.  However, my transport co-ordination unit spans Longford and Westmeath, two large counties in which there are many rural settlements and villages.  What the NTA is saying today is that only two of those areas will be piloted, and at best-----</p></speech>

That is what a pilot means.  At best, if it is up and running by September and if the NTA decides to run the same pilot it ran on the Local Link night-time service for nine months, that will bring it into the following April or May, after which the NTA will perhaps seek additional resources to roll it out further.  There are communities in rural Ireland that will not see anything for the best part of two years.  I just want to be honest about this.  This would be a big worry.  I do not wish to rubbish what Ms Graham is suggesting as she is making comprehensive suggestions, but in terms of supporting rural Ireland, the lead-in time of between 20 and 24 months will result in much greater damage than has already been done.</p></speech>

Obviously, we have additional demands for which we will seek additional human resources as we roll out further projects to deliver better services and infrastructure across Ireland.  We acknowledge that trying to get changes and approving changes for Bus &Eacute;ireann services takes too long and we do not want to stand over this.  We prefer and want to improve the turnaround in getting a service up and running once it is approved because 12 months, as Deputy Troy said, is not good enough.  We will work with Bus &Eacute;ireann to improve that turnaround in order that it is as quick as possible because it is impacting on service delivery to the public.</p> <p>  I will not put a figure on the budget.  All I will say is that the Deputy did his quantification there.  We will have to see what the insurance costs will be and whether they will differ across different parts of the country.  They will probably not differ but we will be resourcing this from our existing budget.  There is no additional allocation and while we will obviously seek an additional allocation for this, there are obviously demands on the Government's budget.</p></speech>

Anybody who has a disability should have the right to wheelchair accessible transport.  I welcome what is being done.  If there is any issue about funding, the committee would be very happy to support calls for funding through the Minister.  Equality of access is critically important.  I thank the witnesses for attending.</p></speech>
