I invite Deputy Cassells to contribute</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2019022700002#C00200"><p>We dealt with a similar petition once before and the matter has come before us again.  I have had the pleasure to meet the group on a number of occasions.  There are a number of things at issue, the first of which is the abolition of the old borough council in Drogheda.  Drogheda is an historical town with a proud tradition and the removal of statutory powers from the borough council was abhorrent, as it was in the case of my town of Navan.  The removal of borough council status resulted in the removal of the managerial structure, which meant that there were no specific engineering staff for Drogheda, as well as no specfic budgetary policy.  That was the wrong decision for a town the size of Drogheda.</p> <p>  The second issue is that a significant part of Drogheda sprawls into County Meath.  Drogheda is the base for commercial activity and educational purposes for people living in parts of County Meath within the boundaries of Meath County Council.  </p> <p>  The petition is specific in seeking city status for Drogheda.</p><p>On the interim measures, I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, has come forward with proposals, not just for this part of Meath and Louth, in terms of Drogheda, but other areas where there is urban sprawl from a main town into an adjoining county.  That was pulled from the legislation that we dealt with just after Christmas, in respect of creating urban area committees.  There is huge potential for us, as legislators, to consider that option in order that we can get cohesive planning because bad planning has happened in the past by just natural sprawl.  We must ensure that citizens who live in these areas of sprawl get the services that they require, which should be the focus of everything that drives us, regardless of whether one lives on the Meath or Louth side, the Kilkenny or Waterford side or the Roscommon or Westmeath side, in deference to my colleague seated beside me, Deputy Eugene Murphy.  We must look after these citizens and ensure they get a good deal for the town in which they live.   </p><p> In respect of the campaign here, I note the presence of my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd.  He is an advocate for the town of Drogheda and a former member of the local council.  I also note that the town is naturally growing.  In terms of its status, I have an issue, which I have conveyed to the committee and publically as well, with statistics being used in the composition of the overall figures that would take in not just part of the coastal area of Meath but the wider hinterland of Meath into Duleek and so forth.  I have a problem with the practice that I have articulated.  There is a way forward for the people of Drogheda, as a proud town, to obtain what they want but I reiterate, as a representative of the county of Meath, that parts of Meath cannot be annexed in order to achieve that goal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2019022700002#D00200"><p>City status is an important issue for everybody in County Louth, particularly in Drogheda, and, indeed, in east Meath.  The area has grown phenomenally in Drogheda, east Meath and south Louth.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has released figures that show the town of Drogheda has a population in excess of 40,000.  On the north side of Drogheda there is planning permission for over 5,000 homes and on the south side of Drogheda, there is huge development both in County Meath and in Drogheda itself.  I think a critical mass will be reached by the next census.  The CSO has told me that the population of the town will exceed 50,000 within the next five years or so.</p> <p>  I believe that the petition should be left open.  Also, the correspondence received from the Department does not address the issue of city status at all, which is one good reason to keep the petition open.  There is an even better reason for doing so.  The people of the Drogheda area have no control over their destiny, they have no local council and all of the administration is based in Dundalk.  This is a town that is bigger than the administrative counties of Longford or Leitrim.  It is unacceptable that Drogheda would not be designated a city and have its own city manager. </p> <p>  Galway was deemed a city when its population reached 38,000.  What happened then was that the county manager of Galway became the city manager for Galway city and the county manager for Galway county.  That person held both positions until retirement, after which the jobs were advertised separately.  As part of the process, the present county manager should be made a county manger of the city of Drogheda and when she ceases to hold that office, a county manager for the city of Drogheda should be appointed.  In that way the budgets would be merged and there would be a complete regulation of how budgets are managed, who gets what and who contributes to what.</p> <p>  In east Meath there are huge planning issues and a huge controversy about developments, which are the subject of serious complaints and high-level investigations into planning irregularities.  There was one plan for the whole area that was produced by Meath County Council and Louth County Council but it was overturned by a former municipal council area in east Meath, which led to a huge and disgraceful controversy.  To avoid all of that I ask that we seek further clarification, contact the Central Statistics Office and examine the process.  This is the first time that I have attended this committee and I am not an official member of the committee.  However, I call on the committee to examine the process by which an area gets city status, and I mean discover the nuts and bolts of what one must do in terms of administrative joining up together.</p> <p>  One cannot hold back the town of Drogheda and it is going to be a city.  It is the biggest town in Ireland outside of the main cities.  I ask the committee to keep this issue alive, hold further debates and seek more facts.  We must control our destiny.  A local bid committee is trying to raise funding to improve the town and have additionality from the business community.  The committee is very anxious that that would happen.  Drogheda wants to improve and grow, the recognition of which would be to make Drogheda a city.  Making it a city is only a word.  Drogheda must have a city manager and the accompanying administrative powers and infrastructure. </p></speech>

We must have regard to the response that we received from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government through its assistant secretary general.  Once one reads the document, one realises that it does not address the issue of city status, which is the subject of the petition that we are dealing with today.  On that basis, there is a proposal here to acknowledge the fact that Deputy Cassells has addressed his concerns about the population of 6,500 that would come from the Meath side and the issues addressed by Deputy O'Dowd in respect of the CSO projections about reaching city status within five years or thereabouts.</p></speech>

I respectfully suggest that they would be dealt with within the relevant line Department or line committees that deal with the environment and housing as that is the most appropriate way to do so.</p></speech>

I support the fact that the provision of statistics by the CSO will be informative for Drogheda and many other areas.  I agree with the Chairman that the response, while informative and addressed some of the issues at play, did not address the issue of city status.  It would be important for the status to be addressed as well.</p> <p>  As I stated in my speech, I fully support the reinstatement of the entire administrative structure.  Indeed, I have a Bill that has reached Committee Stage that seeks to achieve that aim not just for Drogheda but for every major town in this country.  By way of full disclosure, I was born in Drogheda and, unfortunately, I have County Louth stamped on my passport instead of County Meath.  </p></speech>

We will hear a presentation from LGBT Ireland.  We invited representatives of the Iona Institute to this meeting but since the institute had made a presentation via Dr. Joanna Rose at our meeting on 19 December last, it did not propose to add to its testimony.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome from LGBT Ireland, Dr. Lydia Bracken, legal adviser, and Ms Paul Fagan, chief executive.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the joint committee.  If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses that any opening statements they make to the committee may be published on its website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Ms Fagan to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Paula Fagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019022700002#L00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting LGBT Ireland to attend the meeting today.  I am joined by our legal adviser, Dr. Lydia Bracken, who authored our recent submission, and we will split our opening statement time between us.  Our aim today is to give the committee an understanding of the specific challenges facing same-sex parents and their children in the absence of a clear legislative framework in Ireland relating to donor assisted human reproduction and surrogacy.</p> <p>  By way of introduction, I should explain that LGBT Ireland is a national charitable organisation which provides support and advocacy services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and their family members.  We provide this through a confidential help line service as well as face-to-face supports through our peer support groups.  The issues raised through our front-line services inform our advocacy work.  In 2017, calls and emails requesting information on parenting rights were the most frequent advocacy inquiries to our organisation.  This led us to hold a series of public meetings and events in Dublin, Cork and Galway in 2018, where we met with hundreds of families and same-sex couples planning parenthood.  It is their experiences that inform our submission and input to the committee today.</p> <p>  The proposals we put forward are based on protecting the best interests of the child and are informed by reference to the rights of the child under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 42A of the Constitution.  It is argued that the best interests of the child are met through laws that recognise the reality of life for the child and that ensure the child can be fully cared for by the adults whom he or she regards as parents.  For children raised in families headed by same-sex parents, this means that they should have the opportunity of acquiring a legal relationship with both intended parents and those parents should have all the legal tools necessary to care for their children.</p> <p>  The reality for children being raised by same-sex parents in Ireland today is that they have no way of establishing a legal parental relationship to both parents who care for them.  This disproportionately affects donor conceived children with same-sex parents as their relationship to both parents is often questioned, causing considerable stress and uncertainty for these families.  This is particularly so where medical consent is required or when obtaining legal documents such as passports but it also arises in everyday situations, for example, providing consent for school trips.  Several families we spoke to have children with serious health conditions that require ongoing medical attention, and for these parents the stresses caused by the lack of legal rights put an additional strain on them.</p> <p>  While we acknowledge this is complex legislation and support the thorough examination of all issues involved, we ask that the committee progress its deliberations urgently.  This is a time sensitive issue, and families and couples planning parenthood cannot wait indefinitely.  The lack of clear regulations leaves couples making decisions about donor assisted human reproduction pathways based on what they think and guess the legislation will be, which may have far-reaching implications for their future family life.  As each day passes the number of families living in legal limbo is increasing and this will continue until legislation in this area is fully commenced and widely communicated.  It is imperative that the proposed legislation includes retrospective provisions to cover families that already exist.</p> <p>  I will hand over now to Dr. Bracken to continue our submission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019022700002#L00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting us to attend today's hearing.</p> <p>  Our submission concentrates on the proposed regulation of surrogacy as set out in the Bill, with a particular focus on how the proposed regulation would affect male couples who have already become parents through surrogacy and those who may seek to do so in the future.  In our view, the proposed regulation of surrogacy as set out in the Bill would not adequately protect the best interests of children born through surrogacy, so amendments are required.  A major issue in the proposed regulation is that there is no provision in the Bill to recognise children who have already been born through surrogacy.  For male couples, this means there is no facility to retrospectively recognise both men as joint legal parents of their child.  The only option is for the couple to apply for second parent adoption, which we do not believe to be an adequate solution.  By contrast, where a child has been born through donor assisted human reproduction, DAHR, once Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 are commenced, the intended parents will be able to retrospectively apply to be jointly registered as legal parents.  A similar process should be put in place for surrogacy.</p> <p>  International surrogacy is currently excluded from the Bill, meaning that the legislation will only apply to domestic arrangements.  This is problematic because the exclusion of international surrogacy from the Bill will not prevent couples from accessing services abroad.  It simply creates significant difficulties for the family when they return to Ireland with their child.  The child has no control over the circumstances of conception and so should not be disadvantaged by virtue of the fact that he or she was conceived through surrogacy abroad.  We argue that it is in the best interests of the child for his or her relationship with the intended parents to be legally recognised in Ireland following the international surrogacy arrangement.</p> <p>  We also believe that the model of parentage that is proposed in the Bill, whereby the surrogate is recognised as the legal mother at birth and parentage is later transferred to the intended parents by way of a parental order, is inappropriate.  A major difficulty that arises with this delayed or post-birth model of parentage is that, at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth, the non-genetic father is not recognised as a legal parent and cannot be recognised until the time that the parental order is granted.  The application for the parental order cannot be made earlier than six weeks and not more than six months after the child's birth.  This approach leaves the child in a vulnerable position as he or she is cared for from birth by the intended parents, one of whom will not have any legal parental responsibility or decision making powers for at least six weeks.  Instead, the surrogate, as the legal mother, retains decision making responsibility for the child until the time the parental order is granted.</p> <p>  We argue that a pre-conception model of parentage would better protect the rights of all stakeholders in the surrogacy process.  Pre-conception court orders would provide approval of the surrogacy arrangement and determine the parentage of the child before conception takes place.  This would ensure that both of the intended parents have full legal powers to care for the child and ensure that the child is legally integrated into his or her family from the moment of birth.</p> <p>  Certain additional issues relating to assisted human reproduction are of particular concern to LGBT Ireland members, such as non-clinical DAHR procedures and international DAHR.  While we acknowledge that these issues are not addressed in the Bill and are, perhaps, outside of the scope of today's hearing, we believe that they are in need of attention.  The Bill could be used as a way to amend the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 to ensure that it accommodates the widest range of families possible.  These areas, and our recommendations for reform, are discussed in detail in our submission and we are happy to speak to them today should any member wish to do so.</p></speech>

We had more matters than usual to deal with this morning and I thank them for their patience.  I have some questions initially and we might have the opportunity of another round of questions later because this is a matter we must tease out.  The submission refers to issues around a second parent adoption.  Dr. Bracken said: "The only option is for the couple to apply for second parent adoption, which we do not believe to be an adequate solution."  Perhaps she will outline the difficulties with it, apart from the obvious two levels of parent which is not going to work.</p><p>What specific difficulties do the witnesses foresee?  Some people would consider second parent adoption to be a workable solution, while recognising that it is not ideal.  However, I believe this will create more problems than it fixes.  The witnesses might outline their views on that. </p></speech>

There is a two year waiting period before second parent adoption becomes an option in the first instance.  Where the waiting period has not been met and the spouse or cohabiting partner has been caring for the child for less than two years - for example, where the child is under the age of two - a full joint adoption will be required.  In a full joint adoption, the birth parent has to give up his or her existing legal rights and jointly adopt with his or her partner or spouse.  That changes the child's status in terms of the biological parent and is an unnecessarily complicated situation.  This is the main legal reason that second parent adoption is not a viable solution to be used in cases of donor assisted human reproduction, DAHR, or surrogacy.</p></speech>

It is waiting for this legislation to come into effect, so that option is not currently available to people.  As Ms Bracken outlined, we do not consider it appropriate, particularly from a child's point of view.  Children understand adoption.  They know people in their classrooms at school who are adopted or others in their families.  They understand on an emotional level what that means.  It is a very different situation where the parents intended to have the child and have always been there for them.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Fagan for outlining that because, while it may seem on the surface that this approach ticks all the boxes, I believe it will create more problems, including difficulties for the child.  We must focus on that.  It might save us an enormous amount of work if we look at other jurisdictions where such a provision has been implemented correctly.  Do the witnesses know of countries which have done this?  Perhaps we can copy their homework.</p></speech>

That type of approach is used in a number of jurisdictions around the world.  New Hampshire was mentioned as a model of very good practice at the previous hearing.  My academic research has looked at the South African model.  Both models are very appropriate.  They are both based on pre-conception court orders, where one goes to court before the child has been conceived.  Within that court process one gains authorisation to engage in the surrogacy, and parentage is allocated at the outset.  This provides certainty at the beginning as to who the parents are once the child is born.  It means that once the baby is born, the focus can be on caring for the newborn and going to court again to fix legal parentage issues is not necessary.  Those two jurisdictions are very good models of surrogacy, and perhaps provide appropriate blueprints which Ireland might look to when regulating this area.</p></speech>

People are potentially facing legal battles at a time of their lives when they are up in the middle of the night.  The last thing that one wants to do in such circumstances is dig out one's work clothes and make one's way to court.</p> <p>  An issue that was discussed here on a previous occasion, and which is being discussed in other fora, is surrogacy.  Very valid issues have been raised about the potential coercion of women, particularly vulnerable women or those from a disadvantaged background.  Will the witnesses speak about the potential protections for women that we, as legislators, can put in place?  Nobody in this room or outside it wants to be responsible for a situation where we assent to the coercion of vulnerable women outside or within this State.  How can we legally provide those protections?  Nobody wants that to be an unintended consequence.</p></speech>

To do both it is important that we focus on an altruistic model of surrogacy.  Rather than engaging in a commercial surrogacy regime, which poses the risk of offering financial incentives for people to act as a surrogate and skewing any informed consent provided, a focus on an altruistic model would ensure that people are not being distracted by other financial issues going into the arrangement from the outset.  In addition, it is important that surrogates are provided with appropriate counselling in advance in order that they understand their role and to ensure they are not being coerced into it.  They should also be provided with independent legal advice to ensure they have made an informed choice to become a surrogate and understand the legal and social implications of their role as a surrogate.  By putting those safeguards in place, we can protect women who act as surrogates and the children, as well as intending parents.  Those safeguards can be legislated for.</p></speech>

Are there any concerns about a lack of rights for the surrogate in terms of the parental switch?  We have just had a big referendum on bodily autonomy for women.  If I understand the proposal correctly, at some point before birth, whether during the pregnancy or before it, a court order will be made to the effect that from the moment of birth the two parents, neither of whom is bearing the child, are the legal parents of the child.  The corollary is that the woman giving birth loses any of those rights ahead of time.  Are there any issues of bodily autonomy for the woman bearing the child during the pregnancy?  Might a woman give birth and then want to change her mind in terms of giving up the child?  How are those two issues being considered in terms of court orders being in place ahead of birth?</p></speech>

If any issue arises during the pregnancy, it is for the surrogate to determine.  She retains her bodily integrity in that way.</p> <p>  I will preface my comments on a surrogate wanting to change her mind by stating that I am a legal academic as opposed to someone with specialist knowledge in sociology or psychology, but the research that I have read shows that such cases are highly unusual.  At the previous committee hearing on this issue, a figure of 4% was mentioned.  I am not sure of the origins of that figure, but from my research, in the United Kingdom there have been three reported cases in the past 20 or 30 years of a surrogate refusing to hand over the child.</p><p>That case has gone to court.  Of course, there may be other cases or issues that do not make it to court or problems arising.  Three difficult cases from what are probably hundreds of successful surrogacies indicate it is very unusual that a surrogate would want to change her mind.</p></speech>

There is a very small chance of somebody changing her mind but it must be included in the legislation.  However, there could be a case where a court application could be made but to be determined based on the best interests of the child.  That needs to be our paramount focus in any legislation.  The court would then determine what is best for this child in such a case.</p></speech>

A person can go to court to be recognised, along with a partner, as the legal parents of that child.  There is no equivalent provision in the assisted human reproduction Bill we are discussing.  If a child has already been born through surrogacy, there is no equivalent process to go to court and have both intending parents recognised as legal parents.  In my opening submission, I mentioned that second parent adoption, although it is not allowed, could be the only solution.  Otherwise a person could apply for guardianship of the child if that person is not currently recognised as an intended parent.  We do not have provision within the Bill to retrospectively recognise parentage.  We argue that a similar process to that which applies in cases of DAHR should be allowed for cases of surrogacy.  It would create parity in our legislation and recognise the fact that a number of children have been born through surrogacy in the past number of years.  A survey was released last year or the year before indicating that Ireland is currently the second-highest user of surrogacy in the world.  Many children have been born through surrogacy who need their family relationships to be regularised.  One way to do that is to include provisions in this assisted human reproduction Bill allowing for retrospective parentage.</p></speech>

The way same-sex male couples are accessing parental pathways means they primarily use surrogacy or adoption, although adoption is not really open in Ireland currently.  A same-sex couple can apply jointly to be assessed for adoption but there are very few countries open to same-sex couples.  In theory they may be able to access international adoptions but it is not a practical possibility, apart from South Africa.</p> <p>  Donor-assisted human reproduction has advanced even since the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was enacted and we know from our consultations with families that people are accessing services abroad because there is more advanced technology abroad and options for people with fertility issues.  Same-sex couples have fertility issues as well as needing donor assistance.  Our main concern is that while the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 is fantastic for the families it covers, many families have been left behind.  The second pillar in regulating assisted human reproduction must consider such issues and try to address them.  The children exist and they need to have their parents recognised.</p> <p>  Across pages 3 to 6 in the submission, we have covered what we see as a framework to do that.  Basically, this relies on parents being able to establish consent with a donor or have a court process where they can show the child will have his or her right to identity protected.  We see that this should absolutely be enshrined in the law but there should be ways, through regulations and a donor conception register, to have that information recorded.</p></speech>

Some people had a slightly easier time registering their child.</p><p>Same-sex couples cannot be registered with both parents on the birth certificate at present.  That still has not been commenced.  For some couples who went to the Civil Registration Service on Lombard Street to register the birth, it was possible to use a double-barrelled surname but down the country, registrars were not used to that.  Generally, there is a significant lack of information.  Once a same-sex couple engages with any State service, they are meeting a lot of barriers because the civil servants are not equipped or do not have the knowledge to deal with them.  That can be very difficult.  I was speaking to a family the other day.  The parents went in to register their child but could not register both parents, even though they are a married couple.  They were watching an opposite-sex couple who had quite a complex situation, although I cannot remember the details.  The registrar was able to work with the opposite-sex couple and get both parents registered.  Post-marriage equality, same-sex couples do not know a lot of these details, either.  They are going ahead and having children.  Clinics are open to them.  They find all this out retrospectively.  It is a real issue.  The work we are trying to do is to inform people that regulations are not in place yet.  Countrywide, there is not much difference in the experience.</p></speech>

The Law Commission of England and Wales is looking at their regulation.  Currently the UK regulation is based on a delayed or post-birth model but a number of people have found that to be inconsistent with the reality of surrogacy.  They do not feel it is working well.  In a survey published by Surrogacy UK, a number of surrogates responded that they did not believe the current UK model was fit for purpose.  The majority of respondents believed the intended parents should be the legal parents from the moment of birth.  That reflects what we have proposed in our submission, namely, that it should be a pre-conception model.  Sociological and psychological research shows that surrogates generally do not see the child as their own.  They understand that they are providing this great gift for another individual or couple.  They do not bond with the child in the same way that another mother might.  They understand that it is someone else's child and are happy with that arrangement.</p></speech>

The proposals we have put forward in our submission would create a more coherent structure for surrogacy in Ireland and would better balance the rights of all stakeholders in the process.  It is very important to remember that there are a number of stakeholders involved and all of their rights and interests need to be balanced against one another.  Looking at what has been done in other jurisdictions helps with that and allows us to build coherent legislation.</p></speech>

To what extent, on the basis of court cases already taking place in other jurisdictions, can we have reasonable assurance that we are covered in most eventualities?  A few years ago, we had a couple of high-profile cases.</p><p>That seems to have tapered off recently.  Would the witnesses comment on anonymous donors?  Although we do not propose to go that route it would be no harm to have their advice on the pros and cons, as experienced in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

If, however, we look to other jurisdictions in the context of amending this Bill, we can create a coherent model of surrogacy.  Using the pre-conception approach would enhance the best interests of children, in particular.  I mentioned South Africa where there is a lot of case law which emphasises the benefits of the pre-conception approach, focusing on how the best interests of the child can be prioritised in that way because there is certainty for everyone involved.  When the child is born the parents have full capacity to care for them from that moment.  The case law from that jurisdiction can be very useful in helping us to understand why that is a very good approach to take.</p> <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 makes it very clear that anonymous donations will not be allowed.  Any donor gametes that are used have to be fully identifiable and the same process will be used in cases of surrogacy.  That is really important from a children's rights perspective so that children have access to information about their backgrounds, to vindicate their right to identity.  Having identifiable information is very important from a legal perspective.</p></speech>

Up to very recently, much of the donor sperm came to clinics that had offered only anonymous gametes.  It is a question of legislating for the children who already exist, regardless of whether they fit the parameters we want for the future.  Anonymous donation has to be considered retrospectively but prospectively it is possible to set out clear protections for the child's right to identity.  Not recognising the parents of the child who already exists does not do the child any favours regardless of whether they know the donor or not.  That is a layperson's perspective.</p></speech>

We do not know the figure for donor-conceived children who already exist who would be the product of an anonymous donation.  Research in the UK would say that only 2% of heterosexual couples would tell their children that they are donor-conceived.  We have to deal with the reality that these children are here.  It is good that the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 does provide for anonymous donations.  Maybe that could be replicated, retrospectively.</p></speech>

If, however, amendments were made to that and we were to rethink the model of parentage proposed, to focus more on a pre-conception model, to include provisions to recognise cases of international surrogacy and to include the retrospective provisions to recognise children who have already been born through surrogacy, we can construct a new Bill that would adequately protect the rights of the child, the rights of the surrogate and the rights of the intended parents.</p></speech>

Have they identified a country we could learn lessons from?  In other countries there is legislation but here in Ireland we have to consider the constitutional issues.  Are there any constitutional issues that we need to be concerned about and to flag up at this stage in order that they do not arise in five years' time when someone suddenly takes a constitutional challenge?  It is a very complex legal area because so many different parties are involved.  It is important to get it right.  It is not possible to always get legislation 100% right but let us at least make every effort to do that.</p></speech>

Its model for regulating surrogacy is very good.  I chose to research South Africa because the constitution of that country very clearly and expressly protects children's rights.  The relevant provision is much stronger than our Article 42A and expressly protects the best interests of the child.  They have to be of paramount importance in every matter concerning the child.  As a result of its own constitutional provisions, the surrogacy legislation there has been shaped in a way that really puts the rights of the children in the forefront.  It uses a pre-conception model and the structure of the legislation provides a very good balance between the rights of all stakeholders and in particular secures the rights of children.  That pre-conception approach would be a good blueprint for Ireland to follow.  At the last hearing, the New Hampshire model was mentioned.  It also takes a pre-conception judicial approach.  I am not as familiar with that model but it is along the same lines as the South African one in that it is judicially authorised prior to conception.  Those are very good models to consider.</p> <p>  We need to be cognisant of Article 42A and the rights of children, particularly in the context of ensuring that the rights of all children are respected and that there is no discrimination between children by virtue of the fact that they have been born through donor conception or surrogacy or any other form of conception.  That is a very important point to bear in mind.  Once our legislation is child focused I do not see any potential constitutional issues arising.</p></speech>

We propose that it should be recognised.  However, for it to operate, whatever country the couple is travelling to would need to have a bilateral agreement with Ireland or there would need to be equivalence between its laws and the law here to ensure the identifiable gametes are used and other stipulations are met.  Once that has been adhered to, it will be possible to construct a new provision or new legislation that would accommodate international surrogacy and ensure that the way in which parentage is allocated in the other country can then be recognised in Ireland, either before the couple leaves or once they come back to the country.</p></speech>

Bilateral agreements are simply one option.  That would streamline the process.  We could have a bilateral agreement with New Hampshire stating that if any Irish couple was to travel to that jurisdiction to engage in surrogacy, provided all the steps had been followed, we would then recognise the parentage when they returned to Ireland.  It may be possible also to do this without a bilateral agreement and to simply provide that once the couple returns to Ireland, they would be able to apply for a declaration of parentage, again recognising the two intended parents as the legal parents, provided they are able to provide documentation from a clinic stating that identifiable gametes have been used and other criteria that the State is happy with have been adhered to.  It does not necessarily have to be through a bilateral agreement but that might streamline the process and make it a consistent procedure in every case.</p></speech>

What I took from the interaction between the witnesses and Deputy Durkan was that we have to proceed urgently to ensure that we have a framework that is fit for purpose and we never encounter these problems again.  While we might not have the answers in this room today, the failure to retrospectively recognise has led to some of the problems and the legal limbo we see facing LGBT families.  Some broader issues were mentioned.  Will Ms Fagan explain how they intertwine with the Children and Family Relationships Act?</p></speech>

First, where a child is conceived through non-clinical donor assisted human reproduction, procedures should be in place to recognise a second parent as a legal parent.  That is one aspect.  Second, we have spoken about a retrospective application for a declaration of parentage in cases of DAHR under section 20 of the Act.  We believe that should be possible where a known donor was used so that those families are not left behind.  Third, we must ensure that the second intended parent is recognised as a legal parent in cases where she provides an egg to enable the conception of the child.  Reciprocal IVF is a way of conceiving that has emerged relatively recently.  It is where one partner in a female couple donates an egg to the other so that they have a genetic link, which is what we have been calling for.</p> <p>  What we are saying is that an amendment could be made to the assisted human reproduction Bill.  The Children and Family Relationships Act does not allow for recognition because the donor has to be non-identifiable or traceable.  In any case, the wording does not allow for it.  We are suggesting a small amendment to provide for recognition where the donor of the gamete or embryo is the spouse of a partner or cohabitant of the mother.  That would be similar to other jurisdictions that have allowed for that because they understand that reciprocal IVF is a reality for people and it should not bar one or other of female couple from donating if it makes sense to do so.</p> <p>  The Government should also consider the possibility of recognising donor assisted human reproduction conducted abroad after Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act have been commenced.  Similar to what Dr. Bracken spoke about, looking at areas that have good practice where couples will go, it is a very costly procedure.  The technology and services are not as advanced in Ireland so people will continue to access services abroad.  We propose legislating around that.</p></speech>

Why has the State chosen to include those restrictions?  Is it legally possible to do anything other than as provided for in the Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019022700002#Q01000"><p>That approach was chosen.  Given that it is very similar to what is currently in place in the UK, we have simply looked across the pond and copied their legislation.  They have a post-birth model in the UK where the surrogate is recognised as the legal mother once the child is born and parentage is transferred later.  As the timelines in the proposed Bill are exactly the same as those in the UK legislation, I believe the provision was copied from the UK.  That is not an adequate approach because, as we said, it means that at birth the child will not have a legal relationship with the second intending parent, namely, the parent who is not genetically related to the child.  That leaves the second parent in a vulnerable position as it means that in the first few weeks of the child's life, people are going to court to establish a parentage as opposed to simply caring for their child as they should be able to do.</p> <p>  We recommend a pre-conception approach.  This is where a person goes to court prior to the conception of the child and securing a court order authorising surrogacy.  This would ensure the different criteria have been met and allocate parentage at that stage.  This approach allows for certainty and means that as soon as the child is born, both intended parents are recognised as legal parents.  The surrogate mother is not recognised as a legal parent and there is no need to go back to court after the birth of the child to establish who the parents are.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.132" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019022700002#Q01400"><p>It is very unusual that a surrogate would change her mind.  Looking at UK case law, if the issue was to go to court, the best interests of the child would be paramount.  I should say again that if we look at the UK approach, it is a post-birth model, meaning that at birth the surrogate is recognised as the legal mother.  In the very few cases where there has been a dispute and the case has gone to court, it does not necessarily mean the surrogate is allowed to keep the child or that care of the child will not still be transferred.  In at least two of the three cases I am aware of where an issue such as this has arisen, care of the child was still transferred to the intended parents.  The UK operates a very strict model whereby parentage cannot be transferred without the surrogate's consent.  She has remained as the legal mother but the courts have recognised that it is not in the best interests of the child for her to keep the child and so the care of the child has been transferred.  In some jurisdictions there is a court process to address that, while in others no such process is in place.  It is all based on pre-conception intent.  It would be a question for the Legislature as to whether it wanted to have, as discussed earlier, that kind of emergency provision for a surrogate who changes her mind.</p><p>On reflection, that might go against the ethos of our proposed legislation in terms of it being a pre-conception approach, because one of the advantages of a pre-conception approach is the certainty that attaches to it for all of the parties involved.  If there was an opportunity for a surrogate to bring a case after the birth of the child, one is negating that element of certainty, but I suppose that would be a question for the Legislature to determine whether it wanted to have a court provision afterwards.</p></speech>

I fully accept that it is most unlikely that this would happen but nobody wants to discuss legislation that will not work.  We want to try to get it right if we can.  Dr. Bracken referred to the emergency provision for a surrogate who may change her mind.  Presumably, that would involve a legal case.  We could talk about models of best practice and where some country is getting it right.  It would be a good idea if we could look at that.  However unlikely it is, it may be necessary to legislate for it because there are people - I am not one of them but that makes no difference - who believe that this is a very important matter and we need to provide for it in legislation.  Are there models of best practice in this area?  I do not like to hear it being called an emergency provision because that sounds like everyone would just jump into a car and go to the High Court.  Is there anywhere we could look at where such a measure has been included and has worked?</p></speech>

In a situation where a woman provides her own eggs to enable the conception, she has the right to change her mind or to petition a court within 60 days of the birth of the child.  In the current legislation we do not propose to allow for that type of surrogacy, where the surrogate is also the genetic mother.  In the South African legislation, the woman can petition the court.  Having that petition available but also having a timeline on it allows for the certainty I was talking about and ensures the intended parents are not worried that the application would be made further down the line.  It also ensures the child is fully legally integrated into his or her family.  That would be one example.</p></speech>

I am just wondering whether we should incorporate some form of counselling, as it would give the best chance of never having to use such an emergency provision.  However, one has to balance that with the fact that most people do not think about it.  Perhaps they should but it is a simple fact that very often they do not.  If we put the two together, that would probably seriously minimise the risk of the emergency provision being used, while ensuring that all parties are well aware of the emergency provision.  That would avoid a scenario where somebody could get to day 61 of the pregnancy and say she was not aware of it.  There may be a role for counselling, although my initial reaction is that it is not necessarily a brilliant idea.  It would be useful, however, to extend the legislation to encompass that scenario because counselling would make a little more sense in that context.</p></speech>

I am joined by my officials Mr. Jimmy Martin, assistant secretary, Ms Yvonne White, Mr. Brian Merriman, Mr. William O'Dwyer, Ms Regina Terry and Ms Eileen Devoy.</p> <p>  The Government remains firmly of the view that the best and only way to ensure an orderly UK withdrawal from the EU is to ratify the withdrawal agreement.  Having said that and in view of the ongoing uncertainty in the UK, I and my Department have been intensively advancing preparations and planning for every scenario, but particularly for a no-deal or worst case scenario.  If the UK becomes a third country on 29 March next, without having ratified the withdrawal agreement with the EU, then a very wide range of EU rules relating to justice and security will no longer apply to or in the UK.  On the other hand, should the withdrawal agreement be ratified before 29 March, many of the preparations and contingency measures that I am about to detail will not be required, at least in the short term.  The purpose of the legislation before the House is to offset some of the damage which may arise if the UK departs without a deal being in place.  While there are a number of Brexit implications for the justice sector, key risks have been identified in two areas, namely, extradition and immigration.  These two areas require primary legislation to be in place and are set out in Parts 13 and 14 of the Bill.</p> <p>  Turning to Part 13 in the first instance, the Bill provides for two amendments to the Extradition Act 1965.  One of the key issues identified by the Department of Justice and Equality is to ensure that effective extradition arrangements are maintained between Ireland and the UK.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit the provisions of the European arrest warrant would no longer apply to the UK and at 11 p.m. on 29 March persons detained on foot of European arrest warrants would be released.  It is critical, therefore, that extradition provisions are in place immediately following the UK's exit from the EU.  The optimal solution identified by my Department is to apply the 1957 European Convention on Extradition, to which both Ireland and the UK are party, to extradition arrangements between Ireland and the UK.  The provisions of the convention are given effect by Part II of the Extradition Act 1965.</p> <p>  While the extradition procedure under the convention is not as effective or as efficient as that of the European arrest warrant, in the event of a no-deal Brexit it would provide a workable solution.  The intention would then be to legislate for and move to an extradition arrangement with the UK similar to that which obtains in the European arrest warrant.  However, the 1965 Act does not permit extradition of own nationals "unless the relevant extradition provisions otherwise provide" and transmission of extradition requests is via the diplomatic channel and in hard copy.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that clear provision should be made in section 14 of the 1965 Act providing that the ban on extradition of own citizens should not apply in reciprocal circumstances where requesting states also extradite own citizens.</p> <p>  The amendment to section 14 in respect of Irish citizens acknowledges the need to amend that Act to ensure that the current European arrest warrant arrangement relating to extradition of own citizens continues and that, in applying the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on Extradition, extradition of an Irish citizen will be permitted on the basis of reciprocity, where the law of the requesting country does not prohibit the surrender of its citizens.  In this regard it should be noted that the United Kingdom has already indicated that it intends to continue to extradite its citizens post Brexit.</p><p>The second amendment relates to section 23 regarding requests for extradition.  In this regard, the Act is being amended to alleviate the burdensome extradition procedure with receipt of requests to the Minister for Justice and Equality via the diplomatic channel in hard copy.  The amendment to section 23 provides for direct transmission of extradition requests to the Minister for Justice and Equality rather than via the diplomatic channel and for the transmission of such requests by modern means of communication - that is, by electronic means or otherwise.  The amendment gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade an order-making power, following consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality, to provide for requests for extradition to be made directly to the Minister for Justice and Equality where this has been arranged with a country by direct agreement.<br/><br/>I now turn to Part 14 of the Bill, which contains a number of amendments to the Immigration Acts.  The amendments in section 88 and 89 of the Bill are for the purposes of correcting a lacuna in the provisions relating to non-<i>refoulement</i>in our law.  I should point out that <i>refoulement</i>considerations were in fact being undertaken at all times.  This provision provides legal certainty in this area.  The amendment is required as failure to introduce this amendment would expose us to the risk that removal would be unsuccessful and thus undermine arrangements to operate a Dublin regulation-style arrangement if needed.<br/><br/>Section 90 of the Bill amends the Immigration Act 2004 to provide a legal basis for fingerprinting Irish visa and transit visa applicants.  The taking and sharing of biometrics is key to the operation of the British Irish visa scheme, which enables a short-stay visa issued by Ireland in respect of certain countries - currently, China and India - to be used to also travel to the UK without the need for a separate visa.  This requires biometric data to be captured and checked against both Irish and UK systems.  The continuance of this scheme is considered very important to both the tourism and business sectors.<br/><br/>In addition to the above amendments, some pieces of secondary legislation are required to be in place by 29 March 2019.  These will cover issues such as facilitating the recognition of UK solicitors' qualifications in the State and, in the context of asylum claims, designating the UK as a safe third country.  There are other important issues that my Department continues to address and to prepare for.  However, I believe the two I have covered today are the most pressing.  I thank members for their attention and I am happy to respond to any questions, observations or submissions they may have.</p></speech>

The engagement is useful in the context of what will dominate these Houses for the next couple of weeks.  I have a few questions about what is and is not in the Bill.  I will start with what is in the Bill.  The Minister spoke about non-<i>refoulement</i>.  In respect of section 88 and the proposal to insert new section 3B into the Immigration Act 1999, it appears to clarify that these provisions will apply to the period commencing on 31 December 2016.  My understanding is that this area seeks to clarify an area that was struck down by the High Court in 2018 in S.G. (Albania) v. The Minister for Justice and Equality.  I am trying to understand the timeframe and how, if the case that saw the previous section struck down or rendered inoperable happened in 2018, we can confidently say that this section applies to the period between December 2016 and this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-27a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022700002#E00300"><p>Part 14 of the Bill deals with the amendments to the Immigration Acts.  In effect, that deals with a lacuna in the provisions relating to non-<i>refoulement</i>.  The important aspect here is that sections 88 and 89 amend not only the Immigration Act 1999 but the Immigration Act 2003.  That will have the effect of confirming that in considering the removal or deportation of a person from this State, immigration officers will, in line with international obligations, have the power to undertake the <i>refoulement</i>consideration.  Section 88 also includes a provision confirming that where in making an order of deportation since 31 December 2016, consideration was given to non-<i>refoulement</i>and the practice will continue.  What we are doing in the amendment is providing a legislative basis to the consideration of <i>refoulement</i>matters.  This is in line with section 50 of the International Protection Act 2015 for all non-nationals being removed from the State.  The amendment will have the effect of restoring references to non-<i>refoulement</i>in the Immigration Acts.  It has remained both the policy and the practice to apply <i>refoulement</i>principles to all removals from the State.  That should cover the point raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

I have not read the full judgment but my understanding is that the 2018 judgment found a difficulty with Ireland's processes regarding non-<i>refoulement</i>considerations.  I find it hard to understand how this legislation is saying that we are satisfied that non-<i>refoulement</i>considerations were undertaken and that deportations from December 2016 until the court case are considered valid even though the court decision had not been handed down.  Is it the case that in practice, even if there was no legislative basis for it subsequently, non-<i>refoulement</i>considerations were given and that, therefore, even though the legislative basis did not exist, procedurally, all the people who received deportation orders did in fact get this consideration and that, therefore, they are covered and the deportations were valid?  Am I understanding this correctly?</p></speech>

(Albania) v. The Minister for Justice and Equality.  When the International Protection Act was implemented in 2015, it repealed the Refugee Act 1996, which, in section 5, had a provision on<i>refoulement</i>that applied not only to protection applications but also to all removals from the State regardless of whether or not they were protection-related.  When the International Protection Act 2015 was implemented, it repealed the 1996 Act and inadvertently disapplied non-<i>refoulement</i>considerations to non-protection applicant removals, for example, deportation orders or general immigration cases.</p><p>It only came to light in the High Court case but the practice was always that non-<i>refoulement</i>considerations were considered in every removal case from State.  Here, we are restoring the position where there is a legal basis to the non-<i>refoulement</i>consideration for non-protection related cases which are dealt with under the Immigration Act 1999 and the Immigration Act 2003.  Section 3B gives a retrospective legal basis to deportations that would have taken place from 31 December until the Bill is enacted.  However, it is only where the non-<i>refoulement</i>consideration has taken place.  If a deportation order is the subject of court proceedings, for instance, that retrospective provision does not impact on it.</p></speech>

A significant and influential element in the Conservative Party has expressed a desire to renounce the ECHR.  Is the position of the Minister and the Department that this legislation will require review and potentially revision if the UK does so?</p></speech>

We must ensure that arrangements are such that any adverse consequences would be mitigated.

Section 90 on the taking of fingerprints was not in the heads of Bill.  From what the Minister outlined, I understand that it applies to only one or two countries, India and China.</p></speech>

Is this a common feature of visa applications?  Everyone wants this programme to continue if it is of value to the Irish economy and the individuals involved.  However, is the provision on fingerprinting strictly necessary?  I would question, if these were European countries, that the taking of fingerprints in this manner would be compliant with GDPR.  As these are not European citizens, GDPR may not apply to them.</p></speech>

There is a requirement that the biometric data be captured and checked against both the Irish and UK systems.  I believe it is very important that that be continued.  We must acknowledge that we are not members of the Schengen Agreement although we are engaged in Schengen information systems.  It is important that the concerns on the matter of sharing the fingerprint data with the UK does provide an element of legal certainty and it is important, therefore, that that continues.  It will be in compliance with human rights legislation.</p> <p>  To answer the earlier question, the British have already indicated that they will continue to operate within the European Convention on Human Rights after Brexit.</p></speech>

On the process behind the preparation of this legislation, did the Minister engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Director of Public Protections and the PSNI, to ask what they felt were the outstanding requirements in the legislation?  Did any of those three agencies, or any other relevant justice agency, ask for anything that the Minister was not in a position to accommodate in this legislation?  Is this being dealt with by other means?</p></speech>

With particular reference to the preparation of this legislation, there was specific contact with those agencies and with the Home Office and appropriate UK offices in order to ensure that we were in a position to formulate a schedule of laws and amendments and a regime that would mitigate against any adverse consequences.  We should remember that all this is against the background of a contingency to prepare for a worst-case scenario.</p></speech>

First, we went through every single EU instrument in the area of justice and home affairs - there were 700 different instruments - to see how they would be affected.  There was a series of meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Courts Service, the Prison Service and the Probation Service to see how they would be affected.  Separately, we were in contact with the European Commission for its recommendations on issues that needed to be addressed.  We have also been in contact with the Home Office on the issues it felt needed to be addressed.</p> <p>  What is in the legislation is matters that require primary legislation.  There are several areas that do not require primary legislation.  One of the biggest asks of the Garda related to its communications and data exchange with the PSNI.  It exchanges about 60,000 to 70,000 pieces of information annually with UK law enforcement agencies, and the PSNI in particular.  One of the effects of Brexit will be that the UK will become a third country for the purposes of data protection.  There was great concern that we dealt with the data protection implications for information exchange.  In consultation with those services and the Office of the Attorney General, we examined how this might be done in the context of the law enforcement directive on data protection.</p><p>We have consulted on the issue with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Attorney General's office, the Director of Public Prosecutions and other services in this area.  It can be done within the context of the EU instruments.  It does not require primary legislation.  The list of things that must be done in light of the many areas affected is long and it could take us the whole day to get through them all.  We have tried to focus on the areas most substantively and instantaneously affected, such as extradition, the common travel area and data exchange for the purposes of police-to-police activity and for the purposes of running the common travel area.  Within all of these areas, we have taken into account all of the services involved.  The UK and the PSNI have set out what they regard as their priorities and we are able to match them.  The Commission has also set out what areas member states should focus on as a priority for contingency preparedness.  All of the work involves all of these areas coming together.  Having gone through the exercise, there are only two areas that require primary legislation.</p><p> I should say there are certain things we cannot do.  For example, the big ask of the UK in the police co-operation area was continued access to the Europol information system and the Schengen information system but as they are European IT systems, it is a matter for Europe to make that decision.  There are areas that are outside of our competence.  Within our competence, two areas are being addressed in the context of this legislation but secondary legislation and administrative arrangements will have to be made to cover all other areas.</p></speech>

The following is a passage from the opening statement of Mr. Brian Gormally of the Committee on the Administration of Justice on the citizenship rights of people in the North.  While this matter has been discussed to a significant extent politically, legally there is still very little certainty around it.  Mr. Gormally stated:</p><blockquote>The citizenship issue is an example of how basic assumptions of the Good Friday Agreement have been undermined.  It recognises the birthright of the people of Northern Ireland to hold Irish or British citizenship on the basis of equality.  The basic breach of this principle of equality by Brexit would be that Irish citizens would remain EU citizens whereas British citizens would not.  It amounts to a new focus of division between the two main communities.  It has also become clear that Brexit could make the status of Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland constitutionally and practically insecure.  If Brexit goes ahead, Irish citizens will be EU citizens living in a non-member state.  What rights do they have to live, work, access health and social services and fully participate in social and political life in the state where they were born?  There are several possible answers to that question.  The first possibility is that the Home Office will regard Irish citizens as really British since UK nationality law decrees that most of those born in the UK have British citizenship.  The second possibility is that the common travel area will sort all this out but, as the Human Rights Commission has suggested, common travel area rights are built on sand.  The third possibility is that under the withdrawal agreement, EU citizens living in the UK can retain many of their current rights by applying for settled status.  [I understand there was a fee attached to that at one stage.]<br /><br />None of these options is appealing as they all involve the implication that those who choose Irish identity are in some way second-class citizens.  Their rights as full participants in Northern Ireland life would depend on either a denial of their Irish nationality, as yet unknown bilateral agreements between the UK and Ireland about the common travel area or asking the Home Office to graciously allow them to leave to live in the land of their birth.</blockquote> <p>There are significant and weighty questions arising therefrom which we discussed at length on the day with Mr. Gormally, Mr. Harvey and several other witnesses.  Prior to the referendum on Brexit, there was not much dispute in regard to these areas but following Brexit these areas of dispute are likely to increase significantly.  Given the gravity of the implications of these changes and the need for legislative clarity here and in the UK to resolve this matter, why have we not sought to affirm the rights of Irish citizens living in the North post Brexit, particularly a hard Brexit, in this legislation?</p></speech>

The British and Irish Governments have confirmed that neither Irish citizens in the UK nor British citizens in Ireland will be required to take any action to protect their status or rights associated with the current common travel regime.  The issue the Deputy refers to relates to the de Souza case and citizenship rights.  This is an issue that was the subject matter of discussions between myself and the British Home Secretary in recent times.  The British Government is currently considering whether it will proceed by way of legislative provision to clarify matters following that judgment.  I am happy to keep the committee informed of the developments.  There is no certainty around it as yet but all of the arrangements that exist under the common travel arrangements will continue.  This includes the guarantees under the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

I have run out of time but I am sure some of my colleagues will follow up on this issue.</p><p>It is not just British legislation that is needed.  All the academics say this jurisdiction needs legislation to address this issue.</p></speech>

One of the great successes of EU membership has been the European arrest warrant, EAW.  One of the negative consequences of Brexit will be that we will not have an EAW system in place between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I note that the Minister said it is intended to operate the Council of Europe convention on extradition from 1957, which is a good idea.  Obviously that is dependent on reciprocity between this country and the United Kingdom.  We are in the process of introducing legislation that permits extradition of citizens.  Has the United Kingdom enacted similar legislation permitting it?  Does the Minister think it will be in place by 29 March?  I do not mind who wanted it.</p></speech>

Under the EAW system, obviously the courts are involved here.

Will they have any involvement or will it be a diplomatic process?</p></speech>

Again these issues have been discussed with the British Home Office.  We have identified a number of issues.  It is important to acknowledge that immediately after the withdrawal of the UK at 11 p.m. Irish time on 29 March, the UK will then submit requests under the extradition convention of 1957.  That will involve a court process.</p></speech>

With those taken together we are satisfied that these conventions will apply a framework that can be regarded as satisfactory in the circumstances.  That will be the basis of continued co-operation in that area.</p> <p>  On the matter of the recognition of divorces, members will be aware that the recognition in Ireland of divorces in the UK is governed by the EU.  If that EU regulation fails to apply, we will then fall back on the older Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986.  In the forthcoming referendum on divorce, it is proposed to amend Article 41.3.3&deg; dealing with the recognition of foreign divorces.  If the people give their assent to that change, I will update the recognition of foreign divorces.  That would also encompass any negative impact that the withdrawal of the UK from the EU might have.  Members will be aware of the uncertainty in some recognitions around the issue of domicile as against residence.  Later in the year we will have the opportunity to update our laws if we get the approval of the people in that regard.</p></speech>

I have to concede that in a no-deal, crash-out scenario, there will be a number of potential problems and the entire regime might be regarded as less than satisfactory.  The object of the exercise on the part of Government is to ensure our contingencies are in place, in so far as they can be.  Ultimately, the certainty will perhaps only be evident when agreement is reached between the EU and the UK in respect of the future relationship arrangements.  While the EU has been the negotiating party, there were certain areas of our relationship with the UK that we needed to discuss and we were discussing.  Arising out of these discussions, we have set forward the proposals in the legislation.  Nonetheless, there have been and will continue to be instances where we have to fall back on older legislation that is less modern and potentially more challenging.  What we are putting forward in the Bill deals with the urgent and important areas which are likely to prove immediately challenging.  As time passes, we will continue our discussions under the umbrella of the EU.  Our objectives and those of the UK are broadly similar, namely, ensuring the protection of our people and ensuring the legal framework that existed between our two countries across a range of issues, both criminal and civil, will continue, notwithstanding the potential withdrawal of the UK from any of the EU instruments which have proved very beneficial in terms of our relationship.</p></speech>

Let us say someone applied for asylum in the North and that person would have a separate process that would be subject to a new arrangement in the UK context.  Obviously, we will have the maintenance of the free travel area so what will the bilateral arrangement be in that context between the UK and Ireland?  Will there be an homogenous data-sharing process?  What will be the bilateral relationship?  How does the EU feel about a bilateral relationship superseding the integrity of its legal framework under its treaty law?  How will that be dealt with without a deal?  Obviously, a deal is the optimum scenario but how happy is the EU to allow a serious of bilateral arrangements to exist separate from treaty law?  As we know, it is very reluctant to allow countries to operate outside of that basis.  Can the Minister give other examples, perhaps from the eastern Europe, where separate legal frameworks have been allowed to develop separate to the treaty framework?</p></speech>

There are certain areas, however, which underline a unique relationship between the UK and Ireland, and, for example, the fact neither country is in Schengen resulted in a situation where bilateral arrangements were optimum.  It is similar with regard to the workings of the common travel area and arrangements, where both the UK and Ireland joined the EU with the common travel framework in situ, and that continued.  Again, it is important to stress that no matter what the nature of the deal is, the common travel area and arrangements will continue, and this is the desire of the UK Government and the Irish Government, and, indeed, the EU.  I acknowledge that there will be circumstances and instances where we will have to further our bilateral arrangements and enter into agreements with the UK, but this will be done in the context of Ireland remaining a member of the EU and under the umbrella of the EU.</p></speech>

It could well transpire that, in the course of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, a similar type of arrangement will be adopted.

It is important that we would continue, in so far as is possible and practicable, under the current regime.</p></speech>

The thing that comes to my mind the whole time is the Good Friday Agreement.  Since it came into operation, the peace this island has enjoyed as been unprecedented.  Coming from the Border town of Dundalk, I, more than most, know the problems people had during the Troubles and I think it fantastic that this has happened.</p> <p>  The Chief Constable of the PSNI, George Hamilton, realises that there will be repercussions regardless of whether there is a Brexit deal and he has asked the UK Government for an additional 400 police officers to help man the Border.  As the Minister knows, we are talking about a distance of some 310 miles and, at present, Northern Ireland has roughly 6,700 police officers and 79 police stations.  What are the Minister's plans for 29 March?  The PSNI is looking for extra police officers.  The Minister cannot just click his fingers and get an extra 400 or 500 garda&iacute; and deploy them to the Border.  What are his plans for 29 March in the context of covering the Border area?</p></speech>

It is engaged in ongoing discussions with my Department.  We meet with the Garda Commissioner on a regular basis and we did so specifically to discuss the issue of contingency planning for Brexit.  However, notwithstanding that, we are not engaged in the making of arrangements for what has been described as a hard border.  As Members will be aware from their discussions with him, the Garda Commissioner is solely responsible for the allocation of Garda resources.</p><p>He has indicated that he intends this year to recruit a further 600 trainees.  The manner in which they are dispersed or allocated to stations is something he keeps under periodic review.  I stress that there is no planning on the part of the Government for the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.  That said, Deputy Fitzpatrick, in particular, will be familiar with the Border area and Border policing.  In any frontier or where a border between jurisdictions exists, a unique need for vigilance will arise having regard to the smuggling of property or people and the organised crime for which borders tend to hold an allure.  The Garda Commissioner and his management team are very aware of that.</p></speech>

I have seen at first hand what happens in the Border area.  I have seen at first hand garda&iacute; pulling traffic from the main motorway to side roads.  I commend the Government on the reopening of Templemore, which was a fantastic thing to do.  However, I remain concerned because it is only in the last number of years that Garda numbers have started to rise again.  The last thing I want to see is garda&iacute; being pulled from all corners of the country to come up and man the Border.  People are worried.  One cannot just click a finger.  I acknowledge that the Minister said 600 trainee garda&iacute; are going through Templemore at the moment but 29 March is fast approaching.  I speak to many garda&iacute; in my area and they tell me there is talk now of garda&iacute; being pulled from every unit and grouping nationally.  People want to know what is happening.  Should we not have a strategy or plan?  Customs posts are being opened at airports and ports.  I saw on television last night the huts being set up at Dublin Port.  No one wants to see a backstop or to see the Border come back.  I live close to the Border and have family and relations in the North and it is the last thing I want to see.  We have had a fantastic 20 years and want that to continue.  However, there is a great deal of fear that we are going to start going around the country to take garda&iacute; from different units.  I am sure the Minister and the Garda Commissioner have regular discussions on this and I understand the Chief Constable in Northern Ireland is in constant talks with the UK.  Do we have 200, 300 or 400 surplus garda&iacute; who will man the Border?</p></speech>

For example, in the Deputy's own area, the Garda's northern division has a strength of 1,406 garda&iacute;, which is an increase of 9% since 31 December 2015.  This year, the Garda Commissioner is ensuring there is recruitment of civilian staff to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to facilitate the release of 500 trained garda&iacute; from administrative to front-line duties.  Members will agree that availability and visibility are the hallmarks of good policing and it is important that garda&iacute; are freed to do the type of work for which they  are best trained.  In the event of a crash-out Brexit or no deal and if such a scenario gives rise to additional requirements in Border areas, I have no doubt that further resources can be provided through normal deployment.  The Garda Commissioner and his management team are fully aware of that.  These requirements are kept under ongoing review at all times.</p></speech>

I am sure their representatives meet on a regular basis.  In fairness, the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, came to this committee two weeks ago and told us about his time in the PSNI and his relationship with MI5 and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He said it was a great relationship.  It is important that we keep that going.  I asked the Commissioner about a local murder, that of Tom Oliver.  In October 2012, the Commissioner came before the Smithwick tribunal and gave evidence that he knew the person responsible for ordering the murder of Tom Oliver.

When the PSNI and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work so closely together, it is important that something be done with any information that is obtained.  In fairness, the Garda Commissioner informed me at our previous meeting that the information he gave to the Government at the time cannot really be carried forward because of his new role as Garda Commissioner.  I want to make sure today that whatever information is passed between the PSNI and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is acted upon.  This is important.

The Garda Commissioner and Chief Constable of the PSNI, who share responsibility for co-operation among the police services on the island, have repeatedly emphasised the importance of this relationship.  There are a number of formal structures involved, including the joint agency task force.  It is important that the cross-Border relationship between our respective security services continue.  I am confident that it will do so through the sharing of information.  With regard to daily contact, which amounted to almost 70,000 items of information shared last year, it is also important that this continues.</p> <p>  I want to inform the committee of an issue that might not be widely known about.  It concerns one of the changes that may well be necessary in respect of eligibility for membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Currently, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regulations provide that UK nationals are eligible to become members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Garda reservists but this is on the basis of the UK being an EU member state.  It is important that we continue to ensure that UK nationals continue to be eligible for membership of the Garda in the event of Brexit proceeding.  That will involve an amendment to current regulations that will specifically include nationals of the United Kingdom.  It is important that this be made at an early stage.  It is one of the many changes we intend to make to facilitate persons from the United Kingdom who wish to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

Given the Minister's personal engagement on and interest in this issue, I wish to note the significant judgment handed down by the Supreme Court in London in the Pat Finucane case.  I am sure it is a judgment the Minister, his officials and Government colleagues will want to study so I do not expect him to comment on it at all.  I just wish to note its significance.</p> <p>  Let me return to a point raised by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  The Minister cited the De Souza case.  One of the major concerns expressed in a recent presentation to this committee by legal and human rights organisations on the impact of Brexit related to the difference between citizenship rights and residency rights.  Concerns were also raised about the common travel area rights being built on sand.  I am glad that the Minister has discussed the issues with the British Home Secretary but, given the live nature of the pursuit of Emma De Souza through the courts, that does not necessarily fill us with confidence.  Legislative action which realises fully the objectives of the Good Friday Agreement has to be taken by the British Government.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and the contributors stated previously, we must also see legislative action taken in this jurisdiction that fully realises the citizenship rights aspect of the Good Friday Agreement.  I understand that, on behalf of the committee, the Chairman is compiling a report on the contributions and presentations we have received.  I am sure the Minister will be given a copy.  Could he expand on what measures can be taken?  I appreciate there is a tight timeframe and that we are in uncertain waters but, in the context of a timeframe that has only been shortened as a result of the Brexit deadline, we have to get to the point where we are legislating adequately for people's rights in the context and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, regardless of whether there is a Brexit.  Sin an m&eacute;id.</p></speech>

These are issues of great importance.</p> <p>  As I note from reading the transcript of the committee's engagements, we are talking about fundamental rights.</p><p>My Department and I acknowledge that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has primary responsibility for these issues.  Of course, I would be happy to further engage with the T&aacute;naiste in that regard.  It is important to recognise that, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement, the European Convention on Human Rights will remain much incorporated in law in Northern Ireland.  The UK Government has confirmed its membership of the convention will continue.  That should be acknowledged along with the importance of the common travel area arrangements.  We need to be clear that those arrangements will be maintained in all circumstances.  We are discussing the worst case scenario - a no-deal or crash-out Brexit - but it is important to recognise that the full gamut of common travel area practices allowing Irish and British citizens to access a range of similar rights in both jurisdictions will continue.  I am keen to assure the committee that that will be the case.  There are arrangements of a bilateral nature that we need to ensure will be in place, hence the importance of the legislation before us.  On the longer-term issue, I would be very happy to further engage with the T&aacute;naiste and the committee.  These are areas of fundamental rights pertaining to the ongoing relationship North, South, east and west and of which we must be mindful.  The exercise referred to was most useful.</p></speech>

It concerns a small but vulnerable group of people, the non-EEA family members of UK citizens, of whom there are currently approximately 5,000 in Ireland.  They are here under their EU treaty rights.  What will happen to them after the UK leaves?  Will they still be entitled to be resident here?  Will they have an entitlement to a new visa?</p></speech>

The matter is currently under consideration.  However, in line with what is happening across member states, a general generous approach will be taken.  On 29 March, those people will have status and will not become illegal in the country or anything of the sort.  Arrangements will be put in place and will probably involve their being transferred onto a domestic arrangement.  The intention is to recognise the fact that they have been resident here and that they would be facilitated under some kind of domestic arrangement given the change in circumstances in terms of their not exercising EU treaty rights.</p></speech>

These are contingency plans put in place by me and my Government colleagues.  I acknowledge that there are challenges and I believe it is important that we continue to engage in order to ensure that we at all times mitigate the adverse consequences of Brexit in all of its forms.  From our perspective, the withdrawal agreement appears to offer the best planning in respect of contingencies.  Anything less than that will mean a no-deal situation which, as we have discussed for the past hour or more, will be challenging and problematic.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I wish to assure the committee that our objective is the protection of our citizens.  We will ensure their safety by means of a legal framework that will mitigate against negative consequences, of which there will be some.</p></speech>
