The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  I ask members and all in attendance to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19, particularly with the figures increasing in the past week or so.  I ask for their full co-operation in that regard.</p> <p>  Members participating remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  The public business before us this morning is comprised of the minutes, accounts and financial statements, correspondence, work programme and any other business.  I propose we go briefly into private session before resuming in public session to consider those items of business.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p></speech>

Do any members wish to raise an issue regarding the minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's website.</p> <p>  The second item is accounts and financial statements.  We have a fairly short list in front of us today.  Four financial statements and accounts were laid before the D&aacute;il between 18 and 29 October 2021.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address these before opening the floor to members.</p></speech>

These are the Health and Safety Authority financial statements for 2020, which received a clear audit opinion; the Pobal financial statements for 2020, for which there is a clear audit opinion; the Commission for Regulation of Utilities financial statements for 2020, for which there is a clear audit opinion; and the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces financial statements for 2020, for which there is a clear audit opinion.  The only matter I would draw the committee's attention to is that there appears to be have a delay in the laying of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities financial statements.  I signed off on those on 21 May.  They have just been presented now so the committee may want to follow up in line with its policy to get an explanation for why there was such a delay.</p></speech>

My memory would probably go back at least ten or 12 years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021110400002#B00600"><p>Given that, I suggest that we add the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces to the work programme for the new year.</p></speech>

I do not know if any members of the committee have knowledge of that but my recollection is that this was created in the fairly recent past.  However, we can add it to the list.  Can we agree to note the accounts and statements?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021110400002#B00800"><p>I am looking at the financial statements.  The Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 was probably what established the office so it has been around for 17 years.</p></speech>

I thought it was a more recent creation.  Can we note the accounts and statements?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of the minutes.  Regarding the delay involving the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, I would ask the clerk to send correspondence to it regarding that delay.  The financial statements were certified on 21 May but were not laid before the House until 18 October.</p> <p>  Seven items of correspondence were flagged for today.  No. 828B is correspondence from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, HSE, dated 18 October 2021, providing information requested by the committee relating to compliance with procurement guidelines in respect of section 38 hospitals.  Is it agreed to request an information note from the HSE setting out the latest information regarding the compliance of section 38 hospitals with procurement guidelines?  Section 38 hospitals are the Mater, St. Vincent's and Tallaght Hospital.  Is it agreed to note and publish this item?  Agreed.  This has been flagged by Deputy Carthy.  Members will note that there is a pie chart on page 4 of the document showing that 85.96% of procurement information requested by the HSE was not supplied by section 38 hospitals and only 14.04% was supplied.  This related to &euro;131 million of expenditure.  Does Mr. McCarthy wish to comment on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021110400002#B01000"><p>The first thing to note is that there are more than three section 38 hospitals.  I think the number is 39.  The reference to the three hospitals may be because the original correspondence from Beaumont referred to those three hospitals.  It was making a specific point regarding that but there are more such hospitals than just the three.  The information is useful.  It describes what the system is but it does not give a significant amount of information about compliance.  Certainly that graphic is concerning.  That there would be non-response to the HSE from these hospitals is concerning.  One would expect the HSE to chase up on that and ensure it gets the explanations and information it needs or seeks to oversee compliance with procurement rules.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021110400002#B01100"><p>We need to address this when the HSE appears before us because those section 38 hospitals receive in excess of &euro;4 billion.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is correct about the number of such hospitals.  I just mentioned three specific ones.  Information on procurement not being supplied by those section 38 institutions is very concerning.  When the HSE appears before us, we need to address how progress can be made on this because substantial public expenditure is involved and taxpayers' money is going out.  The HSE, which is the funding body, the Department and this committee need to know that proper procurement practices are being followed.</p><p>The fact that such sparse information is coming back is of huge concern.  If Members have any more queries, they can raise them with me after the meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021110400002#C00200"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021110400002#C00300"><p>No. 830 is correspondence from Ms Mary Lawlor, senior communications and public affairs manager with the National Asset Management Agency, dated 18 October.  It is information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with NAMA on 30 September 2021.  NAMA states:</p> <blockquote> 	Approximately 2,450 units were deemed unsuitable or were not required by local authorities at the time.  Such units were then offered to the open market for sale by the debtor/receiver.<br /><br />Another 2,000 units subsequently became unavailable; as part of a live portfolio, they were sold or let, on the open market, by the NAMA debtor/receiver in order to repay debt.<br /><br />Where demand was confirmed and the unit remained vacant and available, NAMA endeavoured to facilitate delivery of the units for social housing and provided funding for any required remediation works.  As at end-August 2021, NAMA had delivered 2,629 units for social housing from its secured portfolio. </blockquote> <p>It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Carthy wished to raise this issue.  I do not know if he has joined us but the information is there from Ms Lawlor of NAMA.  There are two charts on the back of the correspondence that show the amount of housing offered and the amount of housing taken up.  Members can see the information for themselves.  Does any Member wish to comment?  No.</p><p>I propose that we take Nos. 841 and 845 together as they concern RT&Eacute;.  I will summarise each of them.  No. 841 is correspondence from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General, Department of Social Protection, dated 22 October, in which he provides information requested by the committee on the examinations by the Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s treatment of certain individuals as contractors who should have been treated as employees.  In terms of Revenue&rsquo;s collection of PRSI from RT&Eacute;, the Secretary General notes that Revenue&rsquo;s organisational tax audit of RT&Eacute; incorporated PRSI between 2015 and 2018.  The Secretary General states that it is not possible to say at this point what level of PRSI liability, if any, will arise from the Department&rsquo;s own investigation.  It includes over 500 contractors and will start from their original dates of engagement with RT&Eacute;.  The Secretary General states that the process can be complex and demanding and says:</p> <blockquote> 	RTE is fully engaged in this process and is cooperating fully with the Department as are the contractors with whom the Department has engaged.  Given the number of individual contractors involved and the duration of contracts to be considered, this investigation will take some time to complete. </blockquote> <p>No. 845 is correspondence from Ms Vivienne Flood, head of public affairs, RT&Eacute;, dated 21 October, in which she provides information requested by the committee on the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s audit report and defamation settlements.  In terms of the audit report, RT&Eacute; states that it cannot supply a breakdown of the contractors concerned due to personal data considerations relating to the GDPR.  However, RT&Eacute; do confirm that the contractors cover a broad range of roles and pay scales.  From our previous item of correspondence we know that this involves some 500 contractors.</p><p>As regards the committee&rsquo;s request for a copy of the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s audit report, RT&Eacute; states that to the best of its knowledge no formal report was prepared.  RT&Eacute; does provide the letter of confirmation from Revenue on its audit, which confirms that Revenue accepted over &euro;1.2 million from RT&Eacute; in respect of Revenue&rsquo;s conclusion that some individuals treated as contractors should have been treated as employees.</p><p>In the context of defamation settlements, RT&Eacute; states that the total amount paid for media settlements for the period 2010 to date is more than &euro;10.4 million.  This amount does not take into account refunds from RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s insurers.</p><p>No. 851B is correspondence from Ms Dee Forbes, the head of RT&Eacute;.  She declined our invitation to attend today on the basis that she is unavailable.  As Members are aware, RT&Eacute; has indicated that it can come before the committee in early January, which is the next slot available.  Is it agreed that we proceed with our engagement with RT&Eacute; on that date?  Agreed.</p><p>We will have representatives from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, which is RT&Eacute; is subject to, before us later this month.  That Department provides funding to RT&Eacute; and ensures that it has a clear line of accountability.  In the first instance, I ask that Members raise any governance or control issues with the public funding provided to RT&Eacute; and we can follow up on any such matters in January.</p><p>I propose that we note and publish the two items regarding Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Deputies Carthy and Catherine Murphy have flagged these items.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021110400002#C00400"><p>And me, Chair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021110400002#C00500"><p>I wish to refer to the Department's letter.  Even though I know that the Department can only supply an indicative timeline, I would like to know the following.  Is the investigation going to be completed within a specific timeframe or when does the Department hopes to conclude it?  With any finding, there is the possibility of an appeal.  Therefore, I ask the Department to outlines any appeals mechanism so that we know where we are and can timetable meetings accordingly.  It would be useful to have such information before the January meeting.</p> <p>  RT&Eacute; has cited the GDPR.  We do not seek specific details on individuals and, therefore, I see no reason we could not have a general response even if it is categorised by the class of employees.  For example, people who are now employees but were formerly self-employed.  I suggest that we ask RT&Eacute; for general information as opposed to specific information on individuals.</p> <p>  Did I hear the Chairman say that no audit report was issued but that one has now been concluded according to the letter from Revenue?  If there is a report, it would great if we could have it in redacted form.  I understand now that there was an audit but no audit report.  What did Revenue do?  Did it write to RT&Eacute; stating that the station owed &euro;1.2 million without qualifying how the sum was arrived at?  That seems a little bit strange.</p> <p>  If there is no report then there must be correspondence from Revenue to RT&Eacute; and that is what we probably mean.  It may not be described as a report but it is still correspondence.  I urge people to not start playing with words in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021110400002#C00700"><p>Yes, the correspondence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021110400002#D00100"><p>Okay.  We will come back to that in a moment.  I call Deputy Munster.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021110400002#D00200"><p>Nos. 841 and 845 raise more questions than answers.  As we said, Revenue has said its audit is complete and RT&Eacute; has said there is no report and it is unable to furnish the committee with a copy because of that, but as other speakers have said, there must be some paper trail there.  It might be no harm to write to Revenue just to ask it about the paper trail, correspondence or whatever and whether, if RT&Eacute; was to request same, it would be furnished with it.  Then at least RT&Eacute; would have the details and would have to, I imagine, furnish us with that.</p> <p>  The other point was the Department of Social Protection has said the amount was under &euro;1 million and RT&Eacute; has said it cannot provide a breakdown because of GDPR, but can we write to RT&Eacute; asking it about the difference in figures between Revenue and the Department?  I think it said the Department used a figure of &euro;953,000 and Revenue had said over &euro;1.2 million.  Could we also ask it for a breakdown in relation to this?  We are not asking for individuals to be identified but how many individuals were involved.  We are talking about &euro;1 million.  How many were paid above brackets of, say, &euro;20,000, &euro;50,000 and &euro;100,000?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021110400002#D00300"><p>The letter referred to came from Revenue to RT&Eacute; and I understand that came in correspondence from RT&Eacute;.  Do any other members wish to come in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021110400002#D00400"><p>I concur with what others have said.  Essentially, in respect of the Revenue audit, are we saying this is the only correspondence that was issued between the parties, namely, Revenue and RT&Eacute;?  The item from Revenue to RT&Eacute; says:</p> <blockquote> 	I wish to advise you that RTE&rsquo;s offer of &euro;1,223,252 in respect of the conclusion that some individuals treated as contractors should have been treated as employees, has been accepted by the Revenue Commissioners. </blockquote> <p>It is hard to believe that is the only page available in respect of that finding.  I think we should, as Deputy Catherine Murphy suggested, ask for a detailed provision of all correspondence.  Of course if individuals are named or if there is personal information, that can be redacted.  The committee will accept that.  Likewise, I support Deputy Munster on the request for a breakdown of the RT&Eacute; personnel involved in the Revenue settlement.  There is a little bit of playing with words here on RT&Eacute;'s part.  It has taken this as a suggestion we are requesting personal information relating to individuals whereas the debate we had makes it clear we are looking for the numbers within each of the bands, as Deputy Munster said.  That, therefore, is absolutely appropriate and it would help this committee in its deliberations so we should follow up on it.</p><p>I put on record my disappointment RT&Eacute; is not here today.  To suggest it did not have enough notice - it would be a worrying precedent if RT&Eacute; was to contact any of us for an interview on a given matter and we were to tell it we would come back to it in two and a half months.  That is essentially what it has told the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not think that is good enough and I wanted to put that on the record.</p></speech>

I will let Mr. McCarthy in in a moment but on this GDPR issue, to my mind RT&Eacute; is free to supply the information without naming the individuals.  If you just ask for general information you are liable to get very little but we should look for firm information without naming the individuals involved and that should get RT&Eacute; over that hurdle.</p></speech>

In this case, there was a comprehensive piece of work undertaken by Eversheds on behalf of RT&Eacute;.  As I understand it from the correspondence, that would have been submitted to the Revenue Commissioners so, if you like, the factual base for the settlement would have been provided in that report and so Revenue would not then need to produce its own report on the matter.  However, I expect there would be some kind of correspondence where they write to RT&Eacute; and say they do or do not accept what it has presented and why and what they think the figure is.  Revenue will not release a document themselves in relation to that.  If anybody is to release this it must come from RT&Eacute;.  That is just a background and context for that correspondence.</p></speech>

I mention also the letter from the Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection, Mr. John McKeon, on 22 October.  In the middle of it he says:</p> <blockquote> 	I also understand that, separately, the Revenue Commissioners conducted an organisational tax audit of RTE (which incorporated PRSI between 2015 and 2018) resulting in approximately &euro;953,000 being collected in respect of PRSI. </blockquote> <p>I am wondering are there any figures since 2018 we could follow up on with the Department.  We could ask the Secretary General for any information there may be on 2019 or indeed 2020, if that is agreed by the committee.  I take that as agreed.</p></speech>

Thus, the figure here is effectively an arrears figure and from then on the employees would have been treated as employees and proper PRSI and so on would be paid in line with all other taxes.  There would be no further liability to make payments.</p></speech>

As I recall, some 78 workers were found not to be employed properly as employees but as contractors, through the Eversheds process.  There was some information in the media it related to 12 workers at the time.  We should ask Revenue how many workers the settlement of &euro;1.223 million actually related to.  We should seek information on how many out of the 78 that related to.</p></speech>

The Eversheds report went back two years.  The issue we have been constantly raising is the demands to be treated as employed rather than self-employed actually go back way longer than that.  Not only is that the case but if contributions had been paid for people for those preceding years then they would have, for example, different pension entitlements.  It is that particular component we have been following up on.  Does it go beyond the Eversheds report or is it confined to the two years that report looked at?  There could be additional revenue liabilities, be that tax or PRSI, but there is also an issue with entitlements arising out of that.</p><p>Am I missing something?  That was one of the key issues we were following up on.</p></speech>

We will note and publish the correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 842 is correspondence from Ms Kerstin Mey, president, University of Limerick, UL, dated 21 October 2021, responding to the committee&rsquo;s requests for a copy of the KPMG review regarding the acquisition of the property - known as the former Dunnes Stores site in Limerick, which we discussed with Ms Mey in June - and providing a further breakdown of entertainment expenditure relating to a ceremony for the award of an honorary doctorate in New York.  This matter was raised by Deputy Carthy.  Ms Mey states that the KPMG report has not yet been finalised.  A draft has been circulated to those involved and they have requested more time to consider it, which has been granted.  UL states: &ldquo;Once the University has received and considered the Report, it can be shared with the Committee subject to any legal restrictions and required redactions.&rdquo;  As regards the entertainment expenditure relating to a ceremony for the award of an honorary doctorate in New York, total costs, including travel and accommodation, are just short of &euro;37,000.  UL states that the expenditure relates to three events, including an event at Carnegie Hall to announce scholarships, which UL states is worth in the region of &euro;30,000 to it annually.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Carthy raised this item.  Is he okay with that for now?</p></speech>

In reply to a recent D&aacute;il question, the Minister indicated that his Department was withholding some funding from UL because of a number of outstanding issues.  It might be worthwhile if we wrote to the Secretary General of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to request information as to the nature of the issues the Department wants resolved and how much money is being withheld.  As I recall, there was a reply to a question a couple of weeks ago on the floor of the D&aacute;il and the gist of what the Minister said was that some funding was being withheld.  We will seek clarification on that, if that is agreed.  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 846 is correspondence on a recurring theme.  It comes from Mr. Maurice Buckley, cathaoirleach of the Office of Public Works, and is dated 26 October 2021.  It is a response to our request for up-to-date information regarding vacant Garda properties, as well as an update on negotiations regarding the Miesian Plaza lease.  We also requested confirmation of the timing of the provision of quarterly updates to the committee, given that we requested quarterly updates in our report on our most recent engagement with the OPW.  The OPW states that at the end of September 37 former Garda were under consideration for disposal, alternative State use or community use.</p> <p>  In regard to an update on negotiations on Miesian Plaza, further meetings have taken place but there is nothing of substance to report.  The OPW confirms that updates will follow within a week of the beginning of each quarter, starting in January 2021.  It is proposed that we note and publish this item.  Deputies Carthy and Catherine Murphy flagged this item.  I call Deputy Carthy.</p></speech>

It is bizarre that this is still going on.  The OPW, on behalf of the taxpayer, is overpaying substantially for property and it appears that this process has gone on far too long.  We have been told that the OPW will update us by 12 January of next year.  In my view, it should have this matter resolved by then, pure and simple.  I do not know if the Chair can give us a timeline as to when the OPW officials are next in with us or whether we have it on the schedule as yet.</p></speech>

Consideration is being given to transferring nine of them to local authorities and some are being progressed as 20-year leases to local authorities or communities.  A further four are being considered for community groups.  It is good to see those being progressed at least.  I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

At this stage, we have met them that often, they are our new best friends.  There has been nothing but meetings, but there has been little outcome from those.  It is clear that we are not going to let this go.  It will be an issue we will want to deal with when they come before us in the new year.  We will want an update at that stage, if the matter has not already been concluded.  It has gone on for far too long.</p> <p>  In the context of the Garda stations, I had a look at those before.  Some of the stations were disposed of for very little money - a number in quite rural areas - and some looked as if they could be repurposed.  Are the terms of the lease sufficiently attractive to encourage those who take up leases, including local authorities, to invest in refurbishment?  Every one of these stations would require some degree of refurbishment in order to be repurposed.  I hope there is no impediment to their use.  It is good to see these buildings being used for community purposes, if that can be done and if there is an appropriate use for them.</p> <p>  One matter I would like us to look at when the officials come before us is the cost-effectiveness appraisal carried out by the OPW.  I have to say that one of the items raised a very serious flag with me and it looked to me that it was pretty much in the same family as Miesian Plaza, and that is the new headquarters for the Data Protection Commissioner.  I can send the Chair a note on that.  I think it is on page 88 but, in any event, I will send the note on and it can be circulated.  There appeared to be some significant issues in regard to the location that was selected and whether alternative properties were looked at.  I want to raise that very specifically with them when they come in.  I will send the Chair a note on it because we cannot keep on repeating the same mistakes.  While there are issues that they work on and they do very good work, the whole area of property is one we have looked at before in regard to whether or not we get best value for money.</p></speech>

A contract is a contract, and the mismeasurement on day one is, I presume, was stitched into that contract.  It is a matter of appealing to the goodwill of the landlord, and I wish them luck in that regard.  The meetings and exchanges between the senior officials in the OPW and the landlord do not at this point seem to be making progress or providing any good news in terms of a remedy in respect of the mismeasurement relating to Miesian Plaza.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  As I recall, given I think this arose at a previous meeting, there was not a break clause in the contract.  Twenty or 25 years is the length of time.  We will follow up on that.</p> <p>  We move now to category C, correspondence relating to private individuals and other correspondence.  No. 858 is from the clerk of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, dated 1 November 2021.  It encloses a confidential draft report of the examination of the processes and procedures for the determination and review of senior executives' remuneration in the public service.  This arises from an agreement between us and the joint committee to investigate the matter.  Members of this committee attended hearings held on the matter.  In accordance with that agreement between the joint committee and this committee, we have the opportunity to forward reviews on the draft to the joint committee.  As it is a draft report, we will note the correspondence and consider it further in private session.</p> <p>  I cannot allow discussion on it at this point.  I have read the information in the draft report.  Suffice it to say at this point, it is comprehensive.  It is summarised at the start and there are a number of recommendations.  The work done by the finance committee and the four members of this committee who were involved is covered comprehensively by the 14 recommendations.  If any members wish to make a suggestion on it, they might send it to the clerk of the committee.</p></speech>

Members might peruse the recommendations and make any suggestions they have.</p> <p>  There is one item of correspondence that was not flagged and arose at an earlier meeting.  It is something I raised with the secretariat.  I wished to get an update.  Members will recall the issue of Perrigo and its settlement with Revenue for &euro;297 million.  There was a tax liability of &euro;1.64 billion.  It ended up with a write-down of approximately 84%, which was the issue other members and I were concerned about.  Correspondence may have been received in recent days but this is before us today.  I ask the secretariat to see whether we have received further correspondence or replies on this from Revenue and the Tax Appeals Commission, which we wrote to at the time.  If nothing is received by the end of this week, the secretariat might follow up with the Tax Appeals Commission and Revenue seeking an explanation as to why there was an 84% write-down in respect of the &euro;1.64 billion Perrigo was liable for.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next matter is the work programme.  At our meeting of 21 October, we agreed our work programme to the end of the year.  It was mentioned earlier that RT&Eacute; was unable to attend today's meeting.  As all our meeting slots until the end of the year have been confirmed, the clerk has advised that RT&Eacute; has indicated its availability to reschedule the meeting to 20 January, the next available slot we have.  Is it agreed the committee will proceed with that meeting?  Agreed.</p> <p>  In respect of our speaking slots, as there are no public engagements, is it agreed that the rotation for today's meeting will be extended to next week, to be fair to members who were selected to be first?  Agreed.  On 11 November, the Department of Transport will appear before the committee; on 18 November, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; on 25 November, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media; on 2 December, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners; on 9 December, the Department of Social Protection, at which members will have an opportunity to raise some of the issues raised today; and on 16 December, the Department of Health.  If there are matters members want raised with any of those Departments or bodies, they might flag them with the secretariat.</p> <p>  We have a busy agenda next week with the Department of Transport.  The issues relate to the 2020 appropriation account for Vote 31, transport; the motor tax account; from the 2020 report on the accounts of the public services, chapter 5, expenditure and night-vision technology and training for search and rescue; the recently published Comptroller and Auditor General's special report 113, in respect of the procurement of vehicles for the Irish Coast Guard; and our request for information regarding expenditure on the following projects, which is due by tomorrow, namely, MetroLink, the DART extension and underground, BusConnects and the all-Ireland strategic rail review.  At our last meeting, we agreed to revisit the work programme for the year later this month.  There were two suggestions today, which will be added to the end of the work programme.</p> <p>  That concludes our consideration of the work programme.  I propose we will go into private session before adjourning until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11 November 2021, when we will engage with the Department of Transport.</p></speech>

It includes matters such as the nature and extent of ecological surveys conducted for the area of the DMAP, including the skies above the area of the proposed DMAP, as well as in the sea and on the sea floor.  The skies above are included because marine activity can have an impact on birds and other wildlife, so there need to be ecological surveys of activity that would happen in a DMAP area that could impact on birds.  The list includes also requirements for when the surveys would be conducted and over what period, as well as details on what major ecological data deficiencies and gaps have been identified and how, when and by whom these are proposed to be dealt with.  Further requirements relate to information such as associated costs and issues such as the proximity of the proposed DMAP to other DMAPs, an issue we touched on previously, and its nature and objective.</p><p>Amendment No. 106 will expand the consultation requirements for proposed DMAPs to include prescribed bodies, the Minister with responsibility for natural heritage and the public.  I think this is quite a good amendment and I hope the Minister of State will not have any issues with it.</p><p>The Bill, at section 21(5), requires the competent authority only to publish its proposal on its website.  Amendment No. 107 will require the publication of the decision by the Minister to allow the draft DMAP to be prepared on the basis of the proposal.  This is important for transparency.  Without the amendment, the initial steps in the DMAP process could be advanced with little public awareness.  The amendment is important, therefore, to ensure public awareness of the initial process regarding DMAPs.</p></speech>

However, it is not really a plan.  It is not ecosystem-based and it does not guarantee that the load the sea can take in terms of development is fully considered in the round on an ecosystem basis and, therefore, there is the potential to massively overload the marine environment with inappropriate developments because it is not really specified.  It is about general objectives.  Our concern is that the DMAPs arising from that must ensure that the gaps we believe exist in the national marine planning framework are plugged properly.  It is not even clear to us that the DMAPs must be fully compliant with the marine spatial planning directive and various EU directives.  Could the Minister of State tell us where in the Bill can we find the requirement to be fully in compliance with the marine spatial planning directive and other directives specifically in terms of DMAPs?  Given our concerns in this regard, this is an attempt to ensure that all the necessary study and public consultation are done and all the concerns for environmental sensitivities are fully explored and we have the necessary consultation around heritage with the Minister and consult the public fully regarding the development of any DMAP because we see the DMAPs as plugging the gap for the lack of detail in the national marine planning framework.</p></speech>

There are so many things in this Bill that we all want to support and ensure happen but we want to ensure public consultation and that the Oireachtas has oversight regardless of whether it involves the ecosystems, heritage, who is responsible and when the work will be done.  If accepted, these amendments will do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110400002#B00300"><p>Before dealing with this grouping, it might be helpful to the members to explain a little further how sections 21 - proposals for DMAPs - and section - 22 draft DMAPs, etc., - are intended to operate.  I must initially advise the members of a referencing error in section 23 - public participation on DMAPs.  Section 23(1) provides that the competent authority (D) shall publish its public participation statement after complying with section 22 - preparing a draft DMAP.  It is intended instead that the statement is to published as soon as possible after the DMAP proposal has been approved.  I apologise for any confusion this may have caused and we intend to correct the error on Report Stage.</p> <p>  A competent authority (D) will submit a DMAP proposal to the competent authority (M), which will review the proposal to ensure compliance with this part and the MSP directive.  The proposal will also include a draft public participation statement.  As soon as possible after approval, the proposal and statement are to be published.  This serves as the starting point of the DMAP development process.  Through the participation processes, it is anticipated that the DMAP will evolve from the proposal as new information, issues and considerations are raised.  This was certainly our experience in the first national marine planning framework resulting in a far better outcome than strict adherence to early thinking.  </p> <p>  At the proposal stage, it is very much a case of known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns.  If we waited until all data gaps were identified and filled, a DMAP would never progress beyond proposal stage.  It is through the DMAP development process that much of the detail such as data gaps and location-specific issues will emerge and be considered to determine the appropriate outcome to be expressed in the DMAP.  This is why participation has been so key to maritime spatial planning to date and will continue to be under this legislation.  This will also be a new process for everyone - officials, the public, stakeholders and industry.  As our collective experience in making DMAPs grows, that learning can be applied to future DMAPs though section 21(4).</p> <p>  I now turn to the amendments under consideration.  Amendment No. 105 proposes a number of additional matters to be specified in a DMAP proposal.  A number of these are already provided for generally by the initiated text or are details to be examined or emerge from the DMAP development process itself.  Subsections (h) and (i) are duplicative to a certain extent.  DMAPs when made will form part of the national marine planning framework and are to be considered in the preparation of the DMAP under section 22(1)(c).  Subsection (i) is unclear in both language and intent.  It is presumed that this is intended to detail the interaction of existing and future proposed usages.  This is appropriate to examine explore during DMAP development - not the proposal, which, as mentioned, above is only the starting point.  Subsection (j) is already covered broadly in the evidence base under section 21(1)(f).  Subsections (k) and (l) are matters to be explored in depth during the development process.  Subsection (m) is not an operable provision.  It presupposes inadequacies in the national marine planning framework and deals with other subjective matters impossible for a competent authority (D) to undertake in the context of DMAP development.  It also would in effect turn the oversight structures of the regime on their head.  Examination of what the national marine planning framework can do better next time is a matter for the review of the framework itself.  Subsection (n) is already covered under section 21(2)(a) in the objectives of the national marine planning framework that the DMAP is seeking to achieve or support.  Subsection (o) is already covered as part of the DMAP development considerations under section 22(1)(c).  Subsection (p) is not operable as marine protected areas do not yet have a legal existence.  It should be noted that the specific environmental circumstances of a DMAP area will have to be, as a matter of necessity, considered and explored in the context of existing and proposed usages in order to specify the environmental mitigation and beneficial measures to be specified in the DMAP under section 22(2)(h).</p> <p>  Regarding subsection (q), the meaning of the term "pursuit" is not clear but it is presumed to mean lobbying of the kind discussed at earlier sessions.  Amendment of the lobbying and access to information on the environment-freedom of information legislation is the appropriate vehicle for such changes.</p><p>One can of course see why this amendment cannot be accepted.  However, it does not appear that there is too much distance between the existing text and the intention and purpose of the proposed amendment.  What is mainly at issue is how explicitly these matters are stated and where in the overall process they occur.  I think everyone will agree that the vital point is that these elements are undertaken, where appropriate, and not precisely where they happen.  It is anticipated that DMAPs may take many forms and serve many purposes, and not only direct marine analogues of terrestrial plans or for industrial sector plans.  For example, it has it has mooted that it may be possible to prepare a DMAP in respect of sea grass meadows.  The possibilities for DMAPs are almost endless, as long as they serve to deliver the objectives of the national marine planning framework.  The legislation was crafted with this variety in mind.  Drilling too far down into specifics for the proposed requirement provisions endangers that flexibility and will present some of the best uses of what we believe is the most powerful marine spatial planning tool in this Bill.</p><p> Amendment No. 106 proposes to require consultation on a given proposal prior to finalisation.  In spirt and in principle, this is right and proper and I fully agree.  Recall, however, that the proposal is just the starting point for DMAP development.  The consultation on the proposal and the development of the DMAP are one and the same process, given the intended participatory and evolutionary nature of the development process.  It is about as comprehensive a consultation process as possible.</p><p> We are innovating here, moving away from a static set piece formal consultation process only model into a participatory emergent model where the outcomes arise from the process.  This we strongly believe reflects both the fundamental spirit, wording and intent of the maritime spatial planning, MSP, directive.</p><p> Amendment No. 107 proposes a requirement to publish reasons for approval.  There is only a single reason for approval that will apply to all DMAP proposals and it is set out in section 21(4)(a).  That reason is that the proposal complies with all the requirements of Part 2 and the MSP directive, insofar as they relate to the proposal.  A proposal either meets that standard or it does not.  For the above reasons, I oppose this amendment also.</p></speech>

Related to that is the issue of unknown knowns.  Part of what we are trying to do here in having a good planning process is identifying unknowns that are risks to marine environment and trying to see how they will be addressed in the process.  I have a few concerns.  One of my key concerns is that there is not sufficient provision in the legislation to ensure DMAPs, and the process around them, are being carried out in line with the marine spatial planning directive.  That is a core concern.</p> <p>  I agree with what Deputy Boyd Barrett said.  I have a huge concern that the overall process is an incremental approach to planning and that it is looking at filling in gaps rather than first doing a thorough, plan-led, detailed approach that is incremental and stage-by-stage.  After the last meeting, I thought about the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on the public consultation process.  It is clear the Minister of State and the officials put much work into the public consultation process.  It is important to acknowledge that.  However, the question on public consultation is never about how much work the people working on it put into it.  Neither is it about how good the people leading the public consultation process think it is.  It is about how good the wider public and stakeholders think the consultation process is.  That is not a criticism of anyone.  It is normal in any consultation process that people who have put in all the work feel they have done a thorough consultation process.  It is also normal that the general public and stakeholders might feel that it maybe was not as good, and that there was not enough awareness.  That is a quite a natural gap.</p> <p>  What we are seeking to do through these proposed amendments is to ensure that consultation is as strong and robust as possible, from the point of view of stakeholders and the general public, as opposed to people who are burdened with all the work in running the public consultation process.  It is important to acknowledge that no matter how much work is put in, and how thorough a public consultation process is, it may not meet expectations of the public.  However, the key point is that consultation is strong enough to elicit the key information from stakeholders and from communities and that it is elicited at an early stage in the process.  The more that is brought out at an early stage in the process, then more complex issues and a larger number of issues can be resolved at an earlier stage.</p> <p>  The issue here is around the gaps in the process around DMAPs.  We have identified weaknesses in the process as presented in the Bill.  We are seeking to strengthen it through these proposed amendments to make it a more robust process.  A more robust, clearer, stronger process is in the interests of everyone, as well as the marine environment.  A more robust process will work for all stakeholders.  One of the issues to date is that there has been a lack of a robust planning process.  That is causing issues for people who are seeking to develop renewable wind energy, as well as everybody else.</p></speech>

I suggest that we also address amendment No. 108 now because it is related to this grouping.  That will mean that amendments Nos. 105 to 108, inclusive, will be in this grouping.  Amendment No. 108 is on  &ldquo;coexistance&rdquo; and &ldquo;colocation&rdquo;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.89" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110400002#C00400"><p>The Minister of State accepted the last amendment in this vein.  The logic is clear in our seeking to put in "coexistance" instead of "colocation".  The thinking behind this proposed amendment is informed by an ecosystem approach.  Can things survive together in the same area without a significant impact on ecosystems and on biodiversity?  Could a particular type of development in a particular area have a negative impact on other things we seek to protect and preserve?  We do not want an imperative in this Bill to colocate, for example, liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals with a marine protected area.  We have to have both.  We want coexistance that guarantees the continuation of vital ecosystems, marine biology, and livelihoods that might be made in that area by particular groups.  That is the logic behind the proposed amendment.  The Government accepted this in a previous amendment.  Maybe the Government can indicate that it is going to do so again.</p> <p>  On the known knowns, the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns, that is vaguely humorous on one level.  However, it is quite serious on another level.  I am still unclear on this, but it seems that anybody, or at least quite a few people, can do a DMAP.  These people might want to do a DMAP for very different reasons.  I am concerned and confused about that.  What is the objective of that particular DMAP?  If, for example, a Department is particularly concerned about developing industrial offshore wind, that would be its objective.  It would want to do a DMAP to facilitate that.  However, that could have significant knock-on impacts for heritage, for protecting fishers&rsquo; livelihoods, for impacts on the local community, for marine biodiversity, and so on.  The lead body would have a particular objective.  In that context, arguably, it might not have a hell of a lot of interest in filling in the gaps on the known unknowns or, even more so, the unknown unknowns that are not set out in the national marine planning framework or that sort of detailed knowledge of a particular marine environment.</p><p>We are trying to get an acknowledgement that those known unknowns, and even more so the unknown unknowns, are often things that are only known by people who really live and operate in the area and thus have knowledge and experience of a particular marine environment, whereas a Department that has the objective to do a particular thing may not know any of that stuff and would have gaps in its knowledge.  Therefore, we want it written into legislation that before we decide that such a body is going to do the DMAP because it has a particular objective, we want to know the following.  First, what is its objective, on which there would be consultation.  It should not just be up to the Minister to say a body can do the DMAP.  Second, we want an acknowledgement, as part of the decision-making process, of what we do not know and have to find out before we make a decision about whether a particular body is competent and whether its objectives are acceptable and appropriate for this particular marine environment.</p></speech>

I accept the principle of this amendment.  My officials will work with the Office of Parliamentary Council to prepare an amendment to this effect for Report Stage.  The Members may consider withdrawing their amendment on the basis of such a commitment.</p> <p>  In connection with the other points that have been made, I with first deal with the marine spatial planning, MSP, directive.  Section 21(4) outlines how the directive must be complied with and section 24 gives oversight of the directive.  In terms of bringing the proposal together, section 21 outlines clearly the conditions required to be assessed and reflects what is contained in the national marine planning framework.  Therefore, it is my view there is robust oversight that will ultimately require Oireachtas approval.</p></speech>

The use of the word &quot;significant&quot; here effectively allows the Minister make classes of amendments under regulations which are considered non-material.  There is an issue in that in the Bill what is non-material or inconsequential is not restricted.  There is not a circumscription on it so there is a particular danger there in the power that it gives to the Minister.  Mitigation measures can be very important, as I am sure everyone here agrees, particularly in trying to avoid any negative and adverse impacts on the integrity of the Natura 2000 sites.  As we know Natura 2000 sites have not been defined to the degree that they should be and there is significant more work that needs to be done there to protect them.  This deletion is significant in trying to improve the protections of ecological sites and also in not to giving the Minister such a<i>carte blanche</i>in deciding that by amendments under regulations, he or she can consider not to deal with issues that need to be addressed.</p></speech>

We think that any amendment to a maritime spatial plan, MSP, or a designated maritime area plan, DMAP, should be subject to the same level of scrutiny and all the sort of requirements that the preparation of an MSP and DMAP would involve.  These are the public consultations and the full compliance with all of the directives and all of the matters that we have discussed, whereas if one has a category of not-significant amendments, these could potentially allow amendments that some might think significant, but can be classed by a Minister as not being significant, and therefore get around the necessary protections and so on, that we are very keen should exist in protecting our marine environment.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 110 proposes to remove the word "significant" from section 28(3)(c) in defining what is a non-material amendment.  This seemingly small change would, in effect, make all amendments material, essentially removing all utility from this section.</p> <p>  This section is intended to be a practical measure to correct minor errors and to introduce trivial tweaks without having to rerun the entire process. I understand that there are concerns that this section might be used to sneak through major changes to DMAPs and MSPs but that is simply not the case and cannot happen.  Sufficient protection has been built into the principles and policies set out in sections 28(3)(a), (b) and (c) and for those reasons, we oppose the amendment.</p></speech>

The issue I have here is that that is not laid out in the legislation.  However, the fact that the Minister of State has said that and has put it on the record makes it clear that it should not be used for anything beyond minor errors or trivial tweaks.</p> <p>  I have a further question for the Minister of State.  He has said that DMAPs are required to comply with the marine spatial planning directive which, of course, they are.  On marine spatial plans in this legislation, section 17(1) specifies a number of the articles of the marine spatial planning directive and there is no such wording on DMAPs.  Why are we not doing the same in respect of DMAPs in the legislation that we are doing for marine spatial plans?</p></speech>

That Chapter obliges a public body to adopt such measures that are necessary to secure the objectives of the national marine planning framework, with directions under section 30 issued where the body does not do so.</p><p>Amendment No. 112 is a technical amendment to enable the introduction of a new fair process procedure in a new section 31.  Amendment No. 113 provides that section 30 directions can apply to more than one public body and that such directions are published online.</p><p>Amendment No. 114 introduces a new fair procedure provision to issue a draft direction under section 30 to the body concerned and allow an opportunity to the body to clarify matters or put in place measures that would make the direction unnecessary.  It would not be appropriate to publish a draft direction as the Minister may not be in possession of the full facts in a particular case and the draft direction may have been issued in error.</p><p>As was much discussed and eventually clarified in the first session, amendment No. 117 provides that the marine planning policy statement is subject to the SEA and AA obligations of section 31.</p><p>Chairman, do you want to move the other amendments before I go ahead?</p></speech>

Those requirements are set out in the transposing legislation.  It is not necessary to restate the detail in this legislation.  In fact, as mentioned earlier, there is a risk of this proposal being considered a partial transposition and therefore legally defective or a risk of divergence or inconsistency between both pieces of legislation.  It is safer and neater for the Statute Book to refer generally to the necessary legislation.  It should be remembered that this is an avoidance-of-doubt provision.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 116 duplicates the effect of amendment No. 117 and is not necessary.  I oppose the amendment.</p></speech>

It is about ensuring we go further than simply not contravening EU law and directives such as the habitats and birds directives.  We should have greater ambition than simply not to contravene.  We should be ensuring our plans and policies are compatible and consistent with these directives and obligations.  That is what amendments Nos. 115 and 116 seek to do.  I do not understand why we are pursuing this approach, which I feel is cutting across a number of issues in this Bill.  It is a minimalist approach.  I do not think seeking that our plans are compatible and consistent is necessarily a best-in-class approach or anything like that.  It is just a fairly basic legislative approach we should be seeking to take, rather than just saying we will not contravene EU law.  I do not think that is too much to look for, expect or ask for.  I appreciate the Minister of State has read out his response to that.</p><p>He may wish to comment further on why he will not take the approach that would ensure the Bill is compatible and consistent with the directive.</p></speech>

Ireland has been caught out significantly for that, with Derrybrien being the obvious example.  Ireland is paying &euro;15,000 a day in fines as a result of that.  I suspect we will find ourselves in serious trouble over the Donegal landslide.  There is a difference between doing our best not to breach a directive and proactively trying to implement it.  Many of these directives are very proactive.  They are trying to achieve positive objectives rather than just limit damage.  We think the wording we have proposed is better in that it states that we wish to pursue proactively the objectives of these directives rather than just limit potential damage.  Damage limitation is not the right basis on which to pursue environmental objectives.</p></speech>

As regards section 30(1)(a), my concern relates to the significant latitude its wording potentially provides.  What are the limitations or what is the circumscription on that?

Trying to set a minimum target of damage limitation or not contravening an EU directive is not the kind of attitude that should be included in the Bill.

I am happy, based on the advice I have received from my officials and the Office of the Attorney General, that it complies with both directives referenced in the earlier sessions.  To transpose a directive word for word does not make for good or more robust legislation.  That is our firm view and we will not be conceding on that point.</p> <p>  To clarify, with regard to directions, as I stated to Deputy Boyd Barrett, we will consider publishing the direction but in terms of consulting regarding when the Minister issues the direction, we will not concede on that point because it is an enforcement mechanism and the Minister needs to have the authority and power to ensure compliance with the legislation and policy.

The reasons are set out in section 30(1).  That is correct.  It is similar to the situation under current planning policy.

Why would we not want the Bill and this section of it to be compatible with the directive rather than simply not contravening it?  That is a significant difference.  It is the nub of the issue here.  From time to time, various Ministers and Government Deputies like to use the phrase "best in class".  I will use Government language.  Simply not contravening the directive is struggling to reach the level of worst in class.  The Bill being compatible with the directive might reach kind of average.  I do not understand why the Minister of State will not accept that wording.</p></speech>

That is a more proactive approach and the Minister of State should consider it.  His point is that the rest of amendment No. 115 is unnecessary and already covered.  I think that is what he is saying and we will consider his comments on that.</p><p>However, the particular phraseology of "does not contravene" is definitely minimalist wording.  I repeat the point made earlier that we have been guilty of a minimalist approach and we have been caught out badly on it.  There has to be a proactive approach to achieving the objectives of directives.  Directives are not just guarding against doing bad stuff; they are also trying to set out to achieve things that we are quite short of achieving in many areas of environmental endeavour.  It is a reasonable consideration to change that wording and I ask the Minister of State to reflect on that aspect of amendment No. 115.</p></speech>

It is the same with &ldquo;full public consultation&rdquo;.  It leaves everything open to legal challenge down the road because there is ambiguity surrounding the language and it is too subjective.  We are trying to put the most robust, technically best legislation together on the best advice.  I cannot concede on that point.  However, I have demonstrated through the committee hearings that where I can yield and where I think it is a valuable contribution, which the majority of contributions are, to be fair to the Opposition, we will work with them.

If it is captured by this, will it be published only at the point of an authorisation at the end of the process?  Is it transparent and publicly accessible in the database only at the very end?  Will people be able to go onto the database to see, for example, that 15 early stage processes are taking place throughout the country?  I totally appreciate that a lobbying register is a separate process.  When people are engaging at the early stages will they be able to find it in the database?  Will it be available to the public?  Is it just at the end of the process that people will be able to find it in the database?  There is a fair difference between these.  Having this information publicly available and searchable at the end of the process is not as useful as being able to search it during the process.</p></speech>

While the process is ongoing will the information be put on the database so people can review what inputs go into it?  With regard to the point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett, any submission that would play a part in decision-making, including lobbying, would need to be included.  I know there is a lobbying section and I am not looking to go into that.  My point is that if the decision-making process is to be open and transparent anything that feeds into it must be included in the database.</p></speech>

Would a database not be a place also where we build up information on matters that could be relevant to any planning application or objective for planning development protection of the marine environment, even in advance of particular consent or particular applications?  This is especially the case if the Minister of State is using the phrase &quot;one-stop-shop&quot;.  Surely this is exactly it.  There is nothing wrong with duplication with the lobbying Act if it is all in one place.  There would be a one-stop-shop where people could go and get all of the information that might be relevant to a particular marine area and live applications, as Deputy Gould said, and not just a list of the consents that have been given.</p></speech>

It is all in one place and that is the lobbying Act.  I can see where the Deputies are coming from with regard to putting lobbying requirements in every piece of legislation.  I have been through the Land Development Agency Act and other legislation.  There is one piece of legislation that governs lobbying and the obligations of entities to comply with it.  What we are doing here is very positive.  Every determination that will lead to these decisions and determinations will be in a publicly available portal, which we aim will be live.  I can understand fair criticism on lobbying and people take a different view.  Our view is that we have overarching legislation that compels entities to conform with it and it is an offence if they do not do so.  In the Bill we are trying to make all of the information available in the most transparent manner we can.  I hope people will welcome it.  This is a positive move.</p></speech>

Such sales might be appropriate in certain very limited circumstances, such as where a proposal intends to reclaim a part of the maritime area and it would subsequently cease physically to be a maritime area.</p><p>I reassure members on a number of matters.  Even if a sale were effected instead of a maritime area of consent, MAC, grant, any development would still be subject to the provisions of the Planning and Development Act.  This is no &quot;end run&quot;.  The land in question, which is currently the foreshore, is vested in the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I do not think the Minister, Deputy McGrath, will mind me saying that along with all of his predecessors he has guarded this ownership jealously and the areas involved generally have been very trivial.  At present, foreshore consents, and MACs if this Bill is enacted, are the best means of ensuring appropriate returns for the State for the use of its property.  I must clarify that the provision to sell already exists under the State Property Act.  All the Bill will change is how such sales might be administered in future.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify what requirements exist under the State Property Act to notify the Minister, the Oireachtas and the public about the sale of public property, in this case marine property.  Look at Coillte's record of disposing of property, one instance of which I stumbled upon in the past week with regard to selling 36 acres of forest in Enniskerry.  There are many more examples and even more egregious examples of Coillte disposing of property.  It seems to be able to do it without any requirement to notify anybody.  The idea we are proposing a mechanism whereby MARA or any other body would be allowed to dispose of public marine property without significant scrutiny, notification to the Oireachtas and public awareness would be extremely worrying as far as I am concerned.</p></speech>

The sale of marine areas which are State-owned could be done by MARA as opposed to the Minister.  Will the Minister of State clarify what areas of the marine and seabed we are talking about?  Would a sale involve the land under the seabed?  Does it include the area above the seabed?  What is included in it?  The territorial seas extend 12 nautical miles from the shore.  What oversight and safeguards would be in place?  On what basis would decisions be made to sell or not sell?</p> <p>  The key difference her is that if a Minister sells public land, there is accountability.  The Minister is politically accountable to the Oireachtas and the public through elections and everything else.  If a body such as MARA sells public land, there is not the same level of accountability.  It is a public body accountable to the Minister but the individuals on the board would not have the same level of accountability to the public or the democratic process as the Minister has.  Having the ability to sell reside with the Minister provides a political and democratic safeguard.  A board is not subject to the same level of direct democratic accountability and scrutiny.  That is a key concern I have.  I ask the Minister of State to address those points specifically around accountability and safeguards.</p></speech>

Local authorities can determine whether they sell publicly-owned land through the democratic process with publicly-elected county councillors.  I seek examples of other public bodies.  We have hospitals and all sorts of entities that own land.  Do others have this power or would it be unique to MARA?</p></speech>

MARA is carrying out the administration of the function.  Existing provisions under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will remain in place and that Department will have the ultimate say on the disposal.  We are not changing that.  We are not giving the power to sell to MARA but the power to administer.  The power to sell and dispose of the asset remains with the State and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are not changing any of those existing functions.  It has happened, I am told, maybe five times in the last decade, in very rare instances.  The State is the 100% interest here and that is critical.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, it is the seabed that is referred to.</p></speech>

That is not how I read the amendment, which provides:</p> <blockquote> 	The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may, with the consent of the Minister and the MARA, delegate to the MARA, subject to the conditions (if any) specified in the delegation, any function of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the State Property Act 1954 to sell or otherwise dispose of any part of the maritime area that is State-owned. </blockquote> <p>That does not in any way limit MARA to purely administrative powers or say that the power remains with the Minister.  The amendment says the two Ministers can agree to delegate all their powers in relation to disposal of State-owned maritime property to MARA and that will not change until the Minister explicitly makes a decision to revoke that delegation of power.  That is extremely worrying and unacceptable.</p><p>In relation to Deputy Higgins's very good question, in what way is MARA accountable?  A local authority is accountable for the disposal of assets.  There are votes of elected representatives and that gives the opportunity to the public to be aware, to consult and so on.  Where is that accountability here?  I do not see it.</p><p>We have not got an answer to the question I asked in my initial contribution.  Could the Minister of State spell out the conditions that surround the decision of the Minister under the State Property Act to dispose of publicly-owned territory, land or property?  From what I can see, whatever conditions exists are wholly inadequate, judging from the experience of Coillte, which seems to be able to dispose of property without anybody knowing.  I found out a week ago it is selling a forest and still have not got an answer from Coillte, the Minister or anybody as to why-----</p></speech>

I have to insist on that point.</p> <p>  What bit of our maritime area, extending to the exclusive economic zone, EEZ, and including the foreshore and so on, is not State-owned?  I would have thought it is all State-owned, unless we have privatised parts of our maritime area and seabed.  I did not think we had but maybe it is already happening.  What part of the maritime area, which is between seven and ten times the size of the land mass of this country, is not State-owned?  Does this relate to every bit of the maritime area?</p></speech>

Is that the entire maritime area?  It seems to me, reading this amendment, that it is fairly black and white that it allows the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, with the consent of the Minister, to delegate to MARA the function of selling or otherwise disposing of any part of the maritime area that is State-owned.</p><p>It does not say the Minister can have the administration of a sale or disposal process carried out by MARA.  This implies fairly clearly that the decision to sell and the entire process around that can be delegated to MARA.  If that is not the Minister of State's intention, this amendment should be withdrawn and a different wording provided specifying how MARA can be involved in the administration of the sale or disposal process.  Otherwise, I very much fear the amendment will open the door to a whole range of things the Minister of State does not envisage, bearing in mind his comments on the amendment.</p><p> I have huge concerns in this regard.  If marine areas are sold off and are then subject to private interests, that potentially compromises the designation of an area as a marine protected area because the private interest can say it bought it for a specific amount with the expectation there would not be various restrictions put on its activity and so forth.  It potentially compromises our ability to designate Natura 2000 sites that have not yet been properly designated as such.  It really allows for a huge amount of discretion in these matters.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could clarify that point.</p></speech>

The provision relates to an administrative function MARA will be undertaking.  To be absolutely clear, ownership is retained by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, we will look, in section 38, at the potential for setting an additional administrative function to strengthen that aspect.  We can commit to doing that if members are agreed that I will come back with it on Report Stage.  I hear their concerns in this regard.  While I consider the safeguards sufficient, we can have a look at strengthening the provision to state specifically that MARA is just the administrator, not the decision maker.  That function is retained by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on behalf of the State.  However, I will look at the wording with members' comments in mind.</p></speech>

However, to me, there are few things more important than clarifying this point.  I would also like him to answer some of our other questions on this point, as much as he can do in this meeting.  Notwithstanding his generous willingness to consider our concerns, I could not support this amendment or this section in any shape or form until our concerns are clarified.  Amendment No. 123 includes the word "sell".  I take the point about what the Minister can do and so on.  Will the Minister of State clarify what area he is talking about in reference to this amendment?  Will he explain what is referred to by "any part of the maritime area that is State-owned"?</p></speech>

It is welcome that a representative of the CCMA will be on the board.  That is a good idea.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 130 is very good.  We probably all have, at various stages, experiences with boards that sometimes do not have the required expertise.  I understand the Minister not wanting to be overly prescriptive but some formula of words should be put into this legislation - it would not have to be the exact wording in this amendment - to ensure we have expertise on the board in marine biodiversity, environmental protection and European environmental law.  We can get that expertise on the board without it being set out as per the wording in this amendment, but it gives a certain level of strength to what we are looking for in the people who are appointed to the board.  We are making sure that some of those appointments, specifically, cover that.  It will only strengthen the board by having that provision.  It also means people on the board are not entirely reliant on the briefings and information they are getting.  There will be people with sufficient skills and knowledge to be able to interrogate strongly that information.  I welcome what the Minister has to say on that point.</p></speech>

While I understand the Minister of State may not be able to, or believes he cannot, specify all the details about who might be on the board, he will understand that our major concern is that State actors have certain objectives.  That is not to in any way impugn the representatives of Departments, but civil society representatives and experts need to be hardwired into this process and the establishment of a potentially powerful body, which will deal with a huge area of our marine territory.  We need people who are really expert.  Departmental officials may or may not be expert, but we need people we know are expert and we need some representatives of the stakeholders we know will be affected by this.  We know the fishing industry is going to be affected.  This is critical.  I hope the Minister of State will indicate that he accepts our general proposition, or the proposition behind these amendments, and that he will consider wording in the legislation that would, without being absolutely prescriptive, give us assurances that civil society representatives, expert voices and key stakeholders will be included on the board.</p></speech>

The intention behind them is to be positive and constructive.  They propose to bring in people with skills and knowledge who would be independent and add to the board.  There should also be a representative from the fishing industry because people in that industry have the most practical and hands-on knowledge.  We are looking for people from environmental NGOs and university departments with expertise in marine biodiversity, environmental protection and European environmental law.  These are all people who would come to the table with something to bring in a positive and constructive manner.  I ask the Minister of State to consider amendments Nos. 130 and 131 because we believe they would make positive and constructive changes to the Bill.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 130 proposes to require that six particular persons representing very specific, but important, interests in the maritime area be appointed to the board of the MARA.  On Second Stage, we were accused of creating a board that is not balanced.  We are seeking to address this in amendment No. 129.  In my view, this proposal would result in a similar imbalance.  That is not to say that the particular experts listed will not be important in the proper functioning of MARA; they will, but there are other ways to ensure that the relevant expertise is deployed in the correct manner within the organisation.  We must make a distinction between day-to-day operations and board oversight.</p> <p>  First, through my own amendment, such persons can already be appointed to the board.  However, we must be mindful of what the board of a State agency needs to do as set out in section 45 and a suitable balance of people needs to be appointed to it.</p> <p>  Second, in section 51, I have made provision for the board to establish specialist committees to provide it with the appropriate advice in areas including, but not limited to, those set out in this amendment.  This, I am sure the members will agree, will provide a useful tool in the proper functioning of the organisation as a whole and will allow MARA to engage with the sectoral specialists set out in the amendment.</p> <p>  Third, MARA will, of course, be required to either directly employ the relevant specialist expertise to operate various functions set out in section 41 or engage with other public bodies with the relevant expertise to do so under the provisions set out in section 63.</p> <p>  As always, I fully appreciate the intention behind the amendment but it would be contrary to the spirit of my amendment if I were to create a similar imbalance to the board in the manner set out.  I must oppose the amendment, but I will offer the members the opportunity, if they so wish, to withdraw it in favour of my amendment No. 129.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 131 requires there to be a representative of the fishing industry, which makes a valuable contribution, on the board.  While I appreciate the sentiment, the wording of this text is imprecise and open to challenge.  It does not prescribe what part of the industry should be represented on MARA and could be subject to the accusation of excluding other sectors of the industry or, indeed, other industries operating in the maritime area.</p> <p>  There is sufficient scope in amendment No. 129 to facilitate the wish to have representation from this sector on the board.  That said, all members of the board must have sufficient expertise and experience relating to MARA functions and corporate governance generally.</p></speech>

He believes that provides balance.  Can the Minister of State explain how it assist in balancing the board?  He stated that my party's amendment will create an opposite imbalance.  He may call me old-fashioned if he wants, but I would sooner have an imbalance based on expertise, law and knowledge.  That is why I believe that amendment No. 130, and, specifically, amendment No. 131, which refers to a representative of the fishing industry, are vital if we are to have a board that will be balanced.</p> <p>  The Minister of State made the point about having special committees set up to feed information, data and suggestions to the committee, but I ask myself then if the experts will be one step away from the decision-making process in that regard when they should be in the room making the decisions.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the word "spirit".  It is an important word.  This is important stuff.  This board needs to have the right configuration.  That is a vital aspect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.453" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110400002#P00500"><p>Except for the fact that I am radically opposed to the use of clich&eacute;s, I would say we need to be the best in the class here.  In all seriousness, could the Minister of State explain why the term "if any" is used in his amendment and in the Bill in terms of the appointment of other persons for the board?  For example, if the membership of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, did not include doctors and scientists, but was only guaranteed to include departmental officials, we would be a little worried about the protection of public health.  This is the protection of marine health, which, by the way, is public health as well.  It is the sustainability of human existence, etc.  It is fairly important.</p> <p>  On the idea that it would not be absolutely hard-wired into the board membership to have people who are expert in marine biology, I take the Chair's point.  We would have to think about how you would do it, but it is a fair point that there would be somebody who has real knowledge of working on the sea, such as a fisher and not merely someone claiming to represent fishers.  I refer to the appointment of persons who really have that expert knowledge and that we are certain, not if they might be there if somebody such as the Minister may decide they will be there.  It is that they will be there.  They are guaranteed to be there and that knowledge and expertise will be brought to bear on the composition of the board.</p> <p>  I do not understand the Minister of State's fear of imbalance.  I do not see what the fear is in that regard.  I do not get it.  Could the Minister of State elaborate on that point?  How could it be anything other than a positive contribution to the composition of the board to have the experts from university in those key areas and experts in the EU law?  An important component of Deputies Gould and &Oacute; Broin's proposal here is that we have somebody who really knows back-to-front EU law, knows the directives back to front, and is sure that decisions being made by the board are compliant and, indeed, even better, consistent and compatible with the objectives of the directives in a proactive way.</p></speech>

In order to operate well, function well, be able to sometimes give a different view and, if necessary, call an issue out, boards need to have a degree of independence as well as expertise.  Amendment No. 129 is a marginal improvement on what is contained in the Bill whereby it is stated that several of the members of the board would be officers of Departments, etc.  Effectively, this amendment leaves us with a board including the chair, who, of course, could potentially be a Department official, two officers of Departments and one person from the CCMA.  I mean no disrespect to the CCMA, which has huge expertise, but it will not rock the boat either.  Officers of Departments will not rock the boat.  If necessary, they are constrained.  Then it is up to six, if any.  We do know that there will be six.  We do not know, of that six, four or however many are appointed, if there will be independent.  If there is to be expertise, they could be officers and officials from Departments as well.  The entire board could, with the exception of the CCMA representative, be made up of officials from Departments.  That will not provide the balance and independence that is needed.</p> <p>  I accept that those involved will bring with them a level of expertise but there will be expertise and skills missing from the board on that basis.  Given that the original composition of the board that was suggested was specifying that several of the members of the board would be coming from Departments and agencies, it is not unreasonable to think that a good many of the additional six will come via that route also.</p><p>That is the key here.  I agree with the comments of the other Deputies on having experts from fishing communities.  You cannot get more expertise than you will get from fishing communities, marine biodiversity experts and environmental experts.  This expertise is key.  I am not hung up on the wording but it is a question of having the principles included.  If setting up bodies in other areas, we would not dream of not having experts and key stakeholders represented.  Coastal local authorities are stakeholders, as reflected in the requirement to have a CCMA representative.  This is positive but the CCMA is but one of several stakeholders.  The CCMA representative is the only member outside the Departments whose expertise will definitely be reflected on the board.  My concern is about the independence of the board.</p></speech>

It has an advisory role, and the Government makes the decisions.  It is the same with regard to the board structure.  The board is not adjudicating on consents.  The board is a corporate governance structure; it is an oversight mechanism.  The chief executive and the chief executive's team have the expertise in respect of development consents, and adjudication is their job.  It is to misunderstand the corporate structure to suggest the board will be making the decisions.  NPHET is a good example in this regard.  We will have the expertise, through the chief executive and chief executive's team, to adjudicate on applications.  However, the board provides the oversight, holding the chief executive to account in the governance structure.  In response to the Second Stage debate, we increased the scope in this regard, which will provide greater independence.</p> <p>  On foot of issues raised in the Second Stage debate, I instructed my officials to review the Part 3 legal text, as initiated.  This will help to ensure best practice in corporate governance is reflected in the Bill.  I may introduce amendments on Report Stage further to the conclusion of the review.  The review is well advanced but specific elements need to be considered in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  As such, I am not in a position to detail what the changes are at this stage.  I will endeavour to provide further information at the earliest opportunity.  On that basis, I will not be moving amendment No. 133 later.</p></speech>

We should think of it in terms of a local authority and the development management process.  The county manager and planners adjudicate on the applications but the board that holds them to account does not.  The board would be the equivalent of the members of a local authority.  There has to be expertise in respect of adjudicating on the applications.  The board, as a corporate structure, holds the chief executive to account.  If the Deputy is referring to the model of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it involves a different mechanism.  I am referring to a corporate structure.  The board holds the chief executive to account, but the chief executive and his team have the expertise to adjudicate on the applications.</p></speech>

However, the broad thrust of what I am saying is that we would not like to think that people whose responsibility is to protect the marine environment do not have, as a matter of course, expertise in the marine environment, marine biology and EU law, including EU directives.  We are in uncharted territory.  We made many mistakes in respect of planning on land over the years.  It has taken a long time to address this and there is still a long way to go to get it right.  Let us get on the right foot with this extremely important legislation and this undertaking whose aim is to plan for, develop and protect our marine environment.  The thrust of these excellent amendments is to ensure that people who really know their stuff and are to some degree independent of the Department will be included.  It is not an unfair comment or a criticism of departmental officials to say they are constrained.  They have certain objectives for their Departments and so on.  Having people who are independent and who have expertise is critical.  I do not understand why the Minister of State would object to this.  He has not really commented on the use of the phrase &ldquo;if any&rdquo; in his amendment.</p> <p>  In addition to departmental officials and county or city managers, there could potentially be no members with the sort of expertise or knowledge that our amendments are seeking to capture.  Our proposal is fair and reasonable and I do not see the argument for imbalance or anything of that kind.  This is a positive addition to the composition of the board.</p></speech>

As Deputy Boyd Barrett has said, it is not a criticism of officials from Departments to say they are heavily constrained.  They do not have the independence of someone with expertise in the marine environment and biodiversity, or someone with academic expertise in this area.  By their nature, departmental officials are constrained and cannot necessarily call it as they see it and as they want to see it.  In any event, considering their roles elsewhere, they may be involved in this process if they are bringing their expertise with them.  We are not necessarily allowing for sufficient expertise and independence in the legislation.  Exactly as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, the legislation allows for a board with two officers from the Departments and one chair.  There may be no one else on it at all if the Bill is passed based on the Minister of State's amendment.</p><p>It is potentially a board of three, with one chair and two Department officials.  Why would we produce legislation that allows for a board with that composition and lack of wider expertise?  I do not understand that.</p></speech>

Three out of ten are from a Civil Service background.  We have taken on board Members' views on that from the Second Stage debate.  That is fair and reasonable.  The board, as composed, will be best practice.  It will, without doubt, have the expertise to deal with the issues of oversight.</p></speech>

The text as initiated might have been misconstrued so as to mean that the MARA governance board is a case level decision-making structure in the model of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That is not the case, this board is a governance board.</p><p>Amendment No. 136 is a technical drafting amendment which broadens the potential scope of the work of the sub-committees to all of MARA's functions, including the engagement of specific sectoral expertise and advice on specific functions.  The text as initiated was unintentionally limited to the functions of the board and, as mentioned earlier, our ambitions are far greater.</p></speech>

Do the members wish to comment?  I call Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-04a.499" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110400002#S01300"><p>I would certainly have to absorb fully what is being said regarding the functions of the board and consider that.  I hear what the Minister and the officials are saying, but I am not sure what I think of it, to be honest, so I reserve the right to submit amendments on Report Stage on this aspect.  I was chatting informally with the officials outside and they were saying that they would dig out some material to give us comparisons regarding how other agencies might work.  I would appreciate that.</p> <p>  However, if we were to use an analogy, which I think the Minister of State used a little while ago, of the planning department in a local authority making decisions about planning applications, that is correct and the elected representatives are not involved in the process.  The elected representatives, however, have the opportunity - I think monthly - to bring forward observations on any application and through that process to feed the views of the public and stakeholders into deliberations that the planning department might be having regarding granting consent for a particular development proposal.</p> <p>  I am not saying that is a perfect analogy either.  I am just pointing out that there is at least in that instance a mechanism in place for some input into and oversight of the deliberations on the granting of consent in particular cases.  Perhaps the Minister of State might like to clarify this point, but as the legislation stands, it seems that consent will be granted for applications by the full-time MARA team.  I would certainly have to think about that aspect and what is important in this regard when issuing consent for applications, because my gut feeling tells me that we still need to be guaranteed that we will have the sort of expertise and a degree of independence inherent in the making of those types of decisions.  The Minister of State is saying that the board does not make decisions, but the team does.  The question is how we can ensure that there is that degree of independence and the possibility for people to just be a bit contrarian.</p></speech>

I refer to those who are trained to do so.  I am not aware that members of local authorities make observations on routine planning applications that go before the local authorities.</p></speech>

Taking the board of the EPA as an example, where the CEO and the team grant licences, board oversight is very different in respect of getting to the stage of adjudication where the expertise is required to make determinations and to make those decisions.  There must, however, be a clear line of sight between those people and the board which sits on top as part of the governance structure, looks down and ensures that the body is meeting its objectives and ambitions and that there is proper oversight.  As I said in respect of the corporate governance structure, we are working to reflect in that context many of the issues that were raised during the debate on Second Stage.</p></speech>

It will not.  This is the key point.  The board is a structure to hold the entity to account and to ensure that the CEO is undertaking his duties properly, etc.  Regarding consent for individual applications, however, the board has no role in that context.  That is the clear point that we need to make.</p></speech>
