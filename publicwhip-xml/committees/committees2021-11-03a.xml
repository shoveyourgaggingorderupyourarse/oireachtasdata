    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#B00200"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman, the Chairman, Deputy Cahill, and members of the committee for inviting me this evening to speak on the important topic of farm safety.  I am joined this evening by officials from my Department, Mr. Michael Moloney, senior inspector and head of crop policy, evaluation and certification division with responsibility for farm safety, and Dr. Robert Leonard, agricultural inspector on farm safety.</p><p>Farm safety is an important area in the programme for Government and this was evidenced by my appointment as the first ever Minister of State with specific responsibility for it.  I am determined to use this role to drive a change in culture on our farms, one that puts safety first in everything that we do.  The day-to-day responsibility for safety on farms falls to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  While the HSA has primary responsibility, my Department and I are fully supportive of its work and assist in the promotion of safe farming practices.  I have introduced initiatives of our own to complement the work of the HSA, which I will detail further shortly.</p><p>Between 2016 and 2020 there were 100 fatal incidents on Irish farms.  This is a stark reminder of the dangers on farms.  Of these 46 involved a farm vehicle, seven involved machinery and 20 involved livestock.  The age profile of those involved in farm incidents is also a serious concern, with the old and the very young accounting for 65% of fatal incidents on farms.</p><p>Of 54 workplace deaths in Ireland in 2020, 20 were on farms, which is hugely disproportionate to the share of the workforce of our country, with just 7.1% of people employed in the sector in 2019.  Unfortunately, to date this year there have been seven fatal incidents on farms.  Every death is one too many.  Behind each of these numbers is a family, a farm and a local community that has suffered an irreversible loss.</p><p>I understand the committee has invited Embrace FARM to attend and discuss farm safety with it later this evening.  I fully endorse the valuable work and support that the organisation provides to farm families at a very difficult time in their lives.  I attended the annual ecumenical service hosted by Embrace FARM earlier this year.  It was a sobering experience to meet with farm families and members of that organisation and to hear their personal experiences.</p><p>It is important that we continue to drive efforts to put farm health, safety and well-being at the centre of all we do.  It is only through continuous attention to the risks that are present on farms that the rate of fatal and serious incidents will be reduced in a sustained manner.</p><p>I have been involved in supporting a range of initiatives in the areas of farm safety, health and well-being to help drive this cultural change.  I launched a dedicated European Innovation Partnership, EIP, call for farm safety projects in December 2020, with an initial closing date for projects of 29 January 2021.  The EIP ran in a two-stage process, with my Department receiving 30 project proposals in the first stage.  Of these, 12 projects went through to the second stage.  At the end of the second stage eight projects with a total value of &euro;1.8 million were approved and are proceeding to implementation.  Such was the level of interest that we increased the funding from &euro;1 million to &euro;1.8 million to ensure all successful projects could be funded.</p><p>These projects cover not just farm safety, but also farmer health and well-being and vulnerable people on farms.  The projects address a broad range of issues in relation to farm health, safety and well-being, including supports for people who have been affected by serious and fatal farm incidents.  They are generating ideas from the ground up.  As we are all aware, there are many people in our communities doing great work in this area.  These projects are a chance to scale up that work.  We can roll out the most successful projects across a wider area, using what we learned initially.</p><p>At the beginning of October this year, I launched an accelerated capital allowance scheme for farmers wishing to modify farm vehicles or farm equipment for an operator with a disability.  The scheme also covers certain qualifying farm safety equipment to help prevent farm accidents.  The scheme is being operated in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners and will help enable farmers who have suffered life changing injuries to continue farming.  I am determined that while we work to make our farms safer places, these farmers are not left behind.  The scheme has an annual budget of &euro;5 million, excluding VAT.</p><p>Further to this, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and the HSE, co-funded the On Fe<font color="#202124">&iacute;</font>rm Ground programme, which I launched with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, last year.  This project is providing training for agricultural advisers to engage with and signpost farmers to supports in relation to health and well-being.  The training of farm advisers began last month and is ongoing.  It is important that advisers are alert to the warning signs that farmers may be facing difficulties and know how to advise farmers on where they can get help.  Our farm advisers do tremendous work.  They are in a very important position in a farmer's life.  They are often those who have the most regular contact with farmers and they are trusted by them too, so it is key they know how to support farmers when they are displaying signs of distress.</p><p>In relation to on farm infrastructure my Department&rsquo;s targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS II, has more than 50 dedicated farm safety investments, in addition to all of the animal housing and other machinery that provide significant safety benefits.  As part of the TAMS II, it is a requirement that all applicants complete a half day farm safety training course before submitting a claim.  This has resulted in more than 19,000 farmers undertaking the required farm safety training.</p><p>Additionally, my Department is an active member of the farm safety partnership advisory committee, FSPAC.  This committee is a sub-committee of the board of the Health and Safety Authority, and is chaired by a board member of the HSA.  Currently, that chair is Mr. Ciaran Roche.  It brings together all those who work in the area of farm safety to ensure all our efforts are joined up.  The committee has five working groups focusing on different priority areas around farm health, safety and well-being.  Officials from my Department sit on each working group.</p><p>My Department, in conjunction with the HSA, ran a combined television and radio campaign on farm safety in 2020 and 2021.  The campaign focused on reminding farmers not to be complacent around machinery.  Further to this, my Department is rolling out farm safety training to both farmers, as part of the agri-environmental and farm safety training package announced in budget 2021, and to farm advisers as part of their continuing professional development, CPD, training. </p><p>A farm safety leaflet is included with the annual basic payment scheme application packs, distributed annually to more than 130,000 farmers.  All of these various means of reaching farmers, whether it be leaflets, training or media campaigns, help to keep our safety first message front and centre.  We are using every available means to reach as many farmers as possible.</p><p>In budget 2022 a dedicated allocation of &euro;2 million has been provided for farm safety.  This will allow us to continue our work on farm safety, health and well-being.  It is the first time the Department has ever had a dedicated budget for farm safety and it will be an important tool.</p><p>My Department is also continuing to develop the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and I am working to ensure farm safety has a central role in that when it begins in 2023.</p><p>I am determined to reduce the rate of serious and fatal incidents in the agricultural sector.  I am open to looking at all options that may assist in encouraging farmers, and all those living and working in agriculture, to work in a safe manner and to manage the risks that are present in agriculture.  Just because there are risks, it does not mean that farms should be dangerous places to work.</p><p>I thank you, Vice Chairman, and your colleagues for your invitation today.  I look forward to answering any questions or any points that members may wish to raise.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for that comprehensive opening statement.  There is significant interest among members.  We already have seven if not eight members indicating.  I call on Senator Paul Daly.</p></speech>

He has to go to the Seanad.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#C00300"><p>I appreciate that.  I thank the Chair and Senator Daly.  I have to go to the Seanad for Private Members' business.  I welcome the Minister of State.  He comes from my neck of the woods, Narraghmore in County Kildare, so I know of his reputation and commitment to agriculture, particularly young farmers coming into the sector.  He has always been proactive there.  He is highly placed and liked in the sector, which is an important facet coming into any Ministry.  I like the fact he has focused on farm safety as part of his responsibility and his Ministry.</p> <p>  What is a farm accident?  It is worth stopping and thinking about that.  A farm accident is an unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly and unintentionally.  It typically results in damage; in many cases there is loss of life and injury.  We have to look at it in that context.  Too many accidents lead to blame games.  I know family members who have been involved in serious farm accidents involving chainsaws, ploughs and stuff.  We need to be conscious that no one sets out to have a farm accident.  They happen unintentionally and result in great injury and distress to family and the community.</p> <p>  Given the complexities of farming today, the Minister of State and members will appreciate that a farmer effectively has to be an accountant, to be a safety officer, to be computer literate and to deal with piecemeal schemes like BEAM and knowledge transfer partnerships, etc.  There are enormous pressures on farmers in terms of finance and delivering on their farms and making them successful.  That feeds into a sense of anxiety and speed and a need to get things done.  That is not to make an excuse but it is part of the context around some accidents that happen on farms.  There are all different ages and groups.  Recently we had a major incident in Cavan which I will not go into but it was traumatic for the family involved.</p> <p>  I will take up the question of the green certificate.  I have spoken to people who have completed the green cert.  I am shocked and, in some cases, I do not believe they have even been on a farm.  That is a strange thing to say.  We need to look at the training modules for green certs and at who is monitoring the modules.  Are they up to scratch and up to standard?  Are they what they say on the tin?  Many people seek and need a green cert for various reasons but I think we should look at it again.  I would like to see a greater emphasis on the green cert and on monitoring, training and practical learning on farms.  That includes agricultural colleges but not everyone who does green certs is in an agricultural college or has that opportunity.  That is the key message I would like to leave with the Minister of State.  </p> <p>  I acknowledge the enormous of Embrace FARM, particularly Councillor Gabe Cronnelly from Galway, who has done enormous work and has been in touch with the Minister of State office in relation to that.  Their work is important because where life is lost there is sadness.  There are many things that go and they stay on the farm.  They do not disappear.  I acknowledge the enormous work and support they provide.  I also acknowledge the enormous financial commitments in this budget for farm safety, which the Minister of State is responsible for.  I wish him well and I wish Embrace well in challenging and always difficult times around accidents that no one sets out to have.  I thank the Minister of State for coming and am sorry I have to leave.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#C00400"><p>I thank the Senator for his comments.  He is right.  The point that struck me from what he said was that no one expects a farm safety incident to happen to them.  I tend to refer to incidents rather than accidents because they are unintentional but, many times when you engage with families after a  tragic incident, they admit there was an element to it that was probably preventable, if an action had been taken.  Not always, but sometimes that is the case and that regret is there afterwards.  Members know the phrase about when you put on your boots in the morning, you never know who will take them off that night.  I continuously implore farmers to be acutely aware of the risks on their farm and, when hazards are identified, to address them and not put those jobs on the long finger.  No family who suffers a loss or serious injury to a loved one on a farm ever expected it to happen to them.  The Senator's point on that is very valid.</p> <p>  His points in relation to pressure on farmers are also valid.  There are many contributing pressures in the normal exercise of farming activity, for example at harvest time, with the weather, with income, to get the work done and so on.  Often that leads to farmers working long hours under pressure and, in certain instances, mistakes or things that were not intended happen.  We have to be mindful of those pressures, identify the risk in those areas and see where farmers can identify and mitigate those risks.</p> <p>  The Senator made a point about the green cert.  It was a broader point, really, but I am aware, having attended Kildalton agricultural college as an active farmer 22 years ago, that I learned a lot about farm safety there, including the right way to apply a three-point linkage, safety measures around PTO shafts, agitating slurry and all the rest.  I do not consider myself old but I am in my 40s and it is over 20 years since I was there.  That is a challenge for us.  For some farmers, it is a long time since we got farm safety training.  That is why the training in the likes of TAMS is important.  Every time an arm of the State or somebody like the advisers from On Feirm Ground has a connection and interaction with a farmer, we must not miss that opportunity to reinforce the points around farm safety and farmer mental health and well-being.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#C00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Mr. Moloney and Mr. Leonard.  I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak on a topic that is close to my heart and in which I have invested much time and done much work.  I have a Farm Safety Agency Bill in the system in the Seanad.  I thank the Minister of State for his engagement on that and I look forward to continuing our engagements on it.  Who knows where it may go?  The goalposts have moved and that is why I welcome that the Minister of State is in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with responsibility for farm safety.</p> <p>  The Bill's inception was when I was elected in 2016 and appointed to the agriculture committee because I had a keen interest in farm safety.  When we were asked for contributions towards the work programme, I suggested farm safety and was told we could not discuss it at that committee.  It would need to be the committee for trade, enterprise and innovation because the HSA is under that Department.   The wheel has gone round and I warmly welcome the fact the Minister of State has responsibility and a budget of &euro;2 million.  Hopefully, that will increase.</p> <p>  People have a habit of circling the wagons when change is proposed.  I am complimentary of everyone involved in farm safety.  I could not stress that enough then and again now.  That includes people in both Departments and the HSA.  There are people in the private sector the Minister of State is aware of, such as Alma Jordan in AgriKids.  We have mentioned Embrace FARM who we meet later.  I mention two gentlemen in particular, Peter Gohery and Vincent Nally.  All the farm representative bodies on the farm safety partnership advisory committee are playing a major role.  The Minister of State highlighted in his submission the documentation that goes out with the single farm payment applications.  Then there is Teagasc, through the knowledge transfer schemes or whatever.  However, every life and limb is equally important irrespective of whose it is, and people are still falling through the net.  That is my big fear and worry.  How can we get to those people?</p><p>Those who fall through the net can include those who are not members of a farmers' representative organisation and those who are not Teagasc clients, in addition to those who have not gone to agriculture college or obtained a green certificate.  If we reach 99 out of 100, there could still be one in 100 who could have an accident.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?</p><p> What communication, if any, has the Minister of State had with the private sector?  I am thinking of insurance companies, in particular.  Could there be a partnership with insurance companies on the promotion and advancement of farm safety?</p><p> The Minister of State is 90% of the way on awareness.  I welcome the radio and television campaigns that were run last year and again this year.</p><p> On the Saturday before I was introducing the Bill in the Seanad, I was farming.  I was doing a bit of tractor work and working with cattle.  I do not know how it entered my head but I said I had better not get a black eye, scrape my hand or bruise a nail as it would not look good standing up in the Seanad on the following Tuesday to introduce a farm safety Bill.  Because I was so aware and conscious of safety on the day, I saw so many pitfalls and so much potential for an accident.  I was probably being over the top but it opened my eyes.  It was all just about awareness.  On any other day, I would have done what I had to do and gone home, but on the day in question I was being more careful and aware.  It opened my eyes to so many little pitfalls and dangers associated with tasks we take for granted and of which we are not conscious in our daily work.</p><p> As Senator Boyhan said, farmers are working against the elements.  In a bad year, there may be just one window of opportunity.  Many safety concerns go out the window if there are only two days in which to get the silage made and it is expected to rain again at the end of the week.  Farmers are dealing with animals, chemicals and heavy machinery.  There are many dangers around the farm.</p><p> Most farms are family owned and there are children and elderly people on them.  There is much more danger in the farm workplace than in any other conventional workplace.  We have to be cognisant of that.  Will the Minister of State comment on my couple of questions?  I seriously worry about the people who are slipping through the cracks.  There are two Departments involved in addition to so many other organisations, which are all doing a brilliant job, but there are those who are slipping through the net.  How can we get to everybody through awareness-raising and training?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#D00200"><p>I acknowledge the Senator's passion for farm safety and the engagement I have had with him on his proposed Bill.  I acknowledge the meetings we have had on farm safety.  It is a topic very close to his heart.</p><p>There is no single action that can solve the problem.  If it were easily solved, the unacceptably high rate of fatalities on Irish farms would have been addressed long before now.  It is therefore a matter of a series of measures.  I hope we never miss an opportunity where there is a connection to a farmer, whether it is through my Department, an agency or an individual, even individuals in private industry, such as vets or those who deliver the meal in the lorry.  We must never miss the opportunity to engage with the farmer and highlight where there have been incidents.</p><p>The Senator said many people have done a lot of work.  He mentioned Ms Alma Jordan, Mr. Peter Gohery and Mr. Vincent Nally.  I have met them individually at various events.  Ms Jordan, with AgriKids and AgriAware, ran a good pilot initiative in schools last year.  It was a good example of what should be done.  When I was a young lad many years ago, I pleaded with my uncle to allow me to get up on a load of bales when travelling along the road.  Now, through educational programmes in schools, children are going to their fathers or uncles to call out unsafe farm practices.  The day the Senator was very aware of the potential for an incident was the day he was considering farm safety more closely.  If we can get children to think more about farm safety, just as they think more about the environment through the Green-Schools environmental programme in schools, it will empower them to raise the issue of safety at the kitchen table and around the farmyard.  I have four young kids at home.  They point to something dangerous in the yard and ask why it is not being fixed.  Schools present a huge opportunity for us.  We should never miss any opportunity.  There is not one action that can resolve the problem but it is about making sure every interaction is meaningful and highlights the challenges.</p><p>One component of the approach is identifying the risks.  When at a workplace every day, and it is where you live, you become blind to the hazards.  The first step is to identify the hazards and the genuine risks associated with farm activity, including in the yard.  The next step is to take action to make things safer.  It is a question of figuring out what needs to be done in this regard, whether it is through investment or taking action.  Awareness of the hazard is key.</p><p>On the Senator's points on the HSA, I work closely with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, who has responsibility for the authority.  My officials work very closely with the officials in his Department.  The reforms brought about under the chairmanship of Mr. Ciaran Roche and the work on upgrading structures have made the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee, FSPAC, a subcommittee of the HSA, very fit for purpose in the modern era.  As part of the work in this regard, five working groups were set up.  They cover b<font color="#2F2F2F">ehaviour, education and training; health and vulnerable persons; tractors and high-risk machinery; livestock handling; and buildings and working at height.  Each subgroup has clear actions related to the five specific areas of risk and is tasked with identifying actions that need to be taken from a policy perspective to address associated challenges.  There is a genuine focus on that.  I am very proud that Dr. Robert Leonard from my Department is vice chairman of the FSPAC and that my Department is represented on each of the working groups.  There is good cohesion between the two Departments.  I am happier now regarding the gap the Senator talked about but there are always people to reach out to.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  From a policy perspective, I do not believe there is an issue now but there is one regarding individuals.  The Senator asked about how to reach everyone.  The reform of the CAP is a great opportunity.  I want to see farm safety at the heart of everything we do regarding CAP, wherever possible, and everywhere we have a role.  Ultimately, we need farm safety to be the first thought every day.  When we were working with Mr. Tom Arnold on drawing up the agrifood strategy for the period to 2030, I was determined to make farmer health and well-being a central part of it.  Previously, we probably had documents that had referred to ramping up the value of production but that did not refer to the cost to the farmer.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  That leads me to the Senator's point on private sector involvement.  There is a lot we can do through leveraging, not just in respect of insurance companies, which obviously have skin in the game in working with us to reduce and prevent the number of farm safety incidents and make farming safer, but also in respect of co-operatives.  Ultimately, the farmer's farm is his or her greatest asset.  From a business perspective, the farmer is integral to a co-operative in that he or she delivers the produce the latter puts on sale.  All of the relevant bodies have strong corporate responsibility, and we could work with them.  That is where I see a role for the &euro;2 million I have secured this time.  It is not the only fund available &ndash; we also have funding under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, and other schemes &ndash; but there is now a dedicated fund.  I envisage the &euro;2 million being used solely to give to projects in the area of farm safety.  I envisage having the ability to leverage it, working with the private sector, to deliver even more money where projects are good and worth supporting.  It may be a matter of considering innovative ways of communicating because this is key all the time.  Communications are always changing.  Historically, we had newspaper, television and radio advertisements but we can look to other areas.  That is something I am working on.  The private sector could also play a role in that regard.</font></p></speech>

According to <i>www.gov.ie</i>, farming is one of the most dangerous occupations in the country, with roughly 21 dying every year.</p><p>My background is in farming and I have been in and out of farms for over 40 years and I have seen the dangers involved during those years.  There are approximately 2,500 serious injuries annually.  I also agree with what the Minister of State said about many injuries and fatalities resulting from the pressure that farmers are under and the effects of long days, especially when cutting silage and in similar periods.  Even on small farms, there are always jobs to be done and jobs waiting to be done.  Farmers with low incomes, like suckler farmers, do all those jobs themselves.  Their incomes do not allow them to hire people to do some of the work for them.  While the extra &euro;2 million is welcome, I also agree that it will not be enough.  At least it can be spent, though, and I hope it will be spent wisely.  </p><p> Turning to my questions, does the Minister of State think that low-income farms account for many instances of accidents and injuries?  The Minister of State also said that the Health and Safety Authority has the day-to-day responsibility in this area.  Does he perceive the Department playing a more involved role in the future?  The witnesses from Embrace FARM, who will be in with us later, have highlighted the impact of fatalities and serious injuries on the families of the people involved in such accidents.  The opening statement submitted by the group states that "Legislators need to put the farmers first, not just the product they are producing".  Does the Minister of State believe that the way those operating in the agricultural industry are being treated, in respect of the demands handed down to them, is right?  Does he think that enough attention has been paid to the pressure these farmers are under to comply with the various demands being made on them?  </p></speech>

I am a suckler farmer based in south Kildare, with a mixed enterprise involving tillage, and I am acutely aware of what the Deputy has outlined.  On hoping that the &euro;2 million will be enough, to be honest this is not all about money.  Much of what is involved is a change of culture and ensuring that all of us in the farming set-up, including farmers' partners, their parents and their children, are aware of the roles we have to play in identifying hazards and unsafe practices.  That is an important aspect.</p> <p>  Turning to whether low income on farms is a factor in this regard, there are many contributing elements in this area.  When I look at what is being done in respect of sustainability and to incorporate farmers in that endeavour through Food Vision 2030, the health and well-being of farmers is a central part of that process.  In addition, the food systems approach we are taking in Food Vision 2030 makes the sustainability of farmers' income as important as the sustainability of the environment and the rural communities in which they live.  That is the trick, and the key aspect here.  The crucial element of new market development is to ensure that we increase the value that farmers get for their products.  </p> <p>  Farmers are sometimes perhaps taking on jobs that should be done by two people and doing them on their own.  That is a challenge for us, especially when we look at the statistics regarding the age profile of the farmers in this area.  None of these points are excuses, though.  Where factors contribute to farm accidents and fatalities, we must try to identify and mitigate them.  However, we also need farmers to recognise where there are potential hazards in the activities they are undertaking.  I refer in particular to the need to recognise that if a job requires two people that it is then necessary to wait until another person is available to help, instead of farmers perhaps opting to take on such a task alone and thereby taking a real risk.  </p></speech>

This is one of the unique areas where there is political unanimity and every success on the Minister of State's part will be one we will all celebrate because it will result in lives being saved.  Therefore, we wish him well in his endeavours.  I also welcome a dedicated budget line being allocated to farm safety for the first time.  Has the Minister of State received commitments that this &euro;2 million budget line will consist of entirely new funding and that it will not be replacing funds for other farm safety measures included in previous budget lines?  Does the Minister of State have a sense of how much of that &euro;2 million will be direct expenditure by the Department or how much will be allocated in grants to organisations?</p></speech>

I agree, and I acknowledge the cross-party consensus on farm safety.  We all want to see success in this area and it is one of those issues where political differences remain outside the door because we are all in the same boat.  We all know of families in our constituencies that have been impacted by farm safety incidents.  I assure the Deputy that this allocation of &euro;2 million is new funding.  It is dedicated and ring-fenced, as I said previously.  It is not the only money that we spend in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this area, but I was seeking a fund which would have some discretionary aspects to allow for the possibility, if we come across initiatives - I have seen examples during the last year - that are worthwhile and effective and that we would like to support, of being able to support the farming community to undertake such endeavours on a larger scale.  This is the opportunity we have now with this funding.</p> <p>  Equally, people might come to us with more ideas for support if they are aware that such a fund exists for possible initiatives.  We must of course have due oversight of how this money is spent and ensure that there are proper checks and balances because this is taxpayers' funding.  It is new money, though, and how it can be spent is a blank canvas.  I will add as well that when I talk about farm safety that I am also incorporating farmers' well-being and mental health.  Those aspects are inextricably linked with farm safety.  I feel strongly that these elements are also an important part of this initiative and I am open to hearing ideas in that regard, including from members of the committee if they see opportunities, ideas or initiatives that they feel should be supported.  We can look at and analyse those possibilities to explore how the provision of funding might help to get them off the ground or to support existing small-scale endeavours in scaling up.  </p></speech>

He should perhaps talk to some of his colleagues in government about making representations on his behalf in respect of the national broadband plan.  His Internet connection was fairly weak in parts, but I think I got most of it.</p> <p>  There seems to have been a considerable reduction in the number of farm safety inspections.  Returning to the point made by Senator Paul Daly, there is a difficulty here in respect of the cross-over of Departments and their responsibilities.  Those inspections have decreased year on year since 2018, by more than 10% in 2019 and by 50% in 2020, we might say understandably due to the impact of Covid-19.  However, it appears that the number of inspections has again reduced this year compared to 2020.  Is that something on which the Minister of State has engaged with the HSA?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#E00600"><p>I apologise for the poor connection.  It is not 100% but we cannot blame it on the Irish national broadband plan.  I am in Glasgow at the COP26 meeting and our Scottish broadband could do with being a little bit better.  I was determined to participate in the committee today and when the invitation came in I asked the Chair if he could change the timing.  I embraced that change so that I could contribute and play my role here as part of this discussion.</p> <p>  Regarding farm inspections, the impact of Covid-19 is still with us.  It is not all about inspections, and picking up on the point made by Deputy Martin Browne earlier, the HSA is the statutory body with statutory responsibility for ensuring safety in the workplace.  That includes all workplaces in the country.  Regarding determining how that work is carried out, and in the same way that there is a cross-party consensus, there is also a cross-departmental consensus in this area.  We all want to change the culture in respect of farm safety and for our farmers to be safer, but achieving that is not all about inspections.  I say that because some people would argue that the stress of inspections themselves cause challenges.  There is not one contributing factor alone, whether that is big or small farms.  Various elements are involved.</p><p>That change of culture involves heightening awareness of how things can be done in a safer way.  Much of that preventative work relates to promotion   From my perspective in the Department, my role is to work closely with the HSA and every other Department, including the Department of Transport on road safety issues, and to be that voice, but also to be a promotional voice in terms of engaging with farmers, calling out some unsafe practices and pushing for changes in that culture.</p></speech>

I note there has been movement in that regard in recent years with the development of a farmers' charter.  Is the Minister of State satisfied in the first instance that the charter is being upheld by inspectors within his Department?  Are there areas in which that can be strengthened to ensure the experience of farmers who are engaging with the Department is positive?  Obviously, inspections take place for a reason, that is, to ensure that rules are being adhered to and best practices are in place, but all members have had experiences relayed to us of farmers who had what can only be described as negative experiences and interactions.  They felt the purpose of the inspection was to catch them out rather than to ensure they were implementing best practice.  Does the Minister of State see scope for improvement in that regard?</p></speech>

My experience is that the charter is fully upheld.  If there are incidents where farmers believe that has not been the case, I ask them to come forward and let us know.  The charter was drawn up in consultation with the farming organisations and representative bodies, which is key.  It is a collaborative document, rather than one drawn up and dictated by the Department.  It is a working document that involved all the key stakeholders coming together.  It is very much a living document.  I am always open to consideration of further measures but I have not received feedback from farmers that it is not playing an important role.</p></speech>

According to the strategic CAP plan announced last week, it appears that funding for TAMS under the next round of CAP will be reduced year on year for the next five years, when compared with the previous five years.  Is the Minister of State concerned about that?  Does he envisage new capital funding outside the TAMS process that could be available for schemes specifically relating to farm safety in the lifetime of the next CAP, or even separate to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#F00500"><p>As regards TAMS, there is a significant number of measures that have a farm safety element and are funded through TAMS.  Obviously, farm safety will be an integral part of the new TAMS but it is not the only mechanism through which we can support farmers with investment.  I refer to the accelerated capital allowance scheme.  It is a proposal we got through in the Finance Act last year and has been live since 1 January 2021.  There were several issues relating to the rules in the context of finance.  I recently launched the application process of the scheme in the third quarter of this year, but farmers can backdate investments they have made in the 14 key areas, such as farm safety measures, to seek to recoup that money over two years rather than over eight years as is the case for the normal process.  That accelerated capital allowance is another example of what we are providing for farmers.  I hope that, in time, if farmers use it and there is a good take-up of it, that it can be increased.  The total expenditure under the seven measures of TAMS, including transitional expenditure, has reached in excess of &euro;312 million, with &euro;47.7 million paid to date in 2021.  I have a long list of TAMS safety equipment that is available to farmers.  Farm safety will be definitely an integral part of the new TAMS.</p></speech>

In its statement, Embrace FARM refers to some of the experiences of people in that position.  That struck me because it is an angle that may not have been considered in detail.  The statement refers to how people in such situations may have missed out on schemes or incurred penalties for not completing forms.  I know this might be a new area, but it appears there might be scope for the Department to offer a support programme whereby an official of the Department would engage with such families to provide practical supports and, perhaps, step-by-step assistance with the various schemes that applied on the farm and how they can be rolled over, as well as possibly ensuring flexibility would be shown by the Department.  Is the Minister of State open to considering that type of initiative and engaging with Embrace FARM and the committee to see if we can develop such a programme?</p></speech>

It has raised these issues previously with my Department and that actually brought about a change whereby we put in place a dedicated point of contact within the Department for such families to deal with.  There is nothing much more upsetting for a family member, such as the wife of a deceased farmer, than to have to explain every time he or she phones the Department with a query regarding a farm payment, a herd number or something else that the person whose name is on the herd number is no longer with us as a result of a farm safety incident.  My officials are always readily available.  We use the likes of the ploughing championships and the roadshows where schemes are launched as examples of this.  One of the proposals put forward by Embrace FARM and taken up by the Department is that one member of staff in the Department is assigned to a family in this situation.  That staff member deals with every query from the family so that they do not have to tell the story again and again.  These are practical measures that are really important, but I am open to any further suggestions.  Obviously, my focus is predominantly on preventing incidents from happening, but we must be mindful that they continue to happen and, where they do, my Department wishes to be sensitive and to work with the grieving families in dealing with all the practicalities in the aftermath of such an incident.  I think we are doing that better now than we did initially.  In recent years, those changes have made a good difference.  I am always open to considering new proposals into the future.</p></speech>

It is good to hear of the various initiatives the Minister of State outlined.  I have a few questions and will throw out a few ideas to see what the Minister of State thinks of them.

There are other reasons too.  Is there anything being considered on the agricultural side, whether it is special adaptation of a tractor, for example?  Would it be possible to give VAT or some part of the funding back to help farmers if they basically need to get back farming.  I welcome what the Minister of State said about the quad earlier.</p> <p>  Bar the grace of God I could be one of the people I will speak of next.  Many times when a cow calves people take a risk that they should not.  Will anything be formulated by the Minister of State or his Department for a competition of ideas for equipment to use in circumstances?  I have a vision in my head of a pen where a cow would calve with a gate at either hand and it could split open on the bottom so a farmer could get to put iodine on a calf or whatever.  Is the Department considering anything to incentivise people to formulate ideas in a competition?  If it saved one life, it would be great.</p></speech>

With the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, every investment in a farm has a farm safety element to it because we are upgrading facilities and the conditions in which farmers work.  It is making farms much safer.  We have not signed off the decision for the new TAMS yet.  Measures are being reviewed and new options are being considered internally.  That is for the new TAMS process.</p><p>The Deputy mentioned about trying to keep safe when trying to look after a calf and I am in the same boat.  Such a process is covered with the likes of the replacement of slats, calving gates, barriers, dehorning crates and handling units for cattle and sheep, including head scoops.  It also takes in the upgrading of existing sheds with blinds and roller doors because sometimes a dark corner in a shed is a risk as well.  The <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>ran a competition to what the Deputy described and I am always open to ideas.  Farmers have a lived experience and the type of knowledge that is very important for us.  I have always been struck by that.  I am always open to generating new ideas.</p><p>The Deputy mentioned an adaptation element for farmers and we do not talk so much, necessarily, about life-changing injuries.  The headline-grabbing figures are fatalities because of their impactful nature but there are many farmers who suffered a life-changing injury.  I was acutely aware of that when I drew up a list for accelerated capital allowances that we had approved.  The capital allowance for farm safety and disability adaptation equipment relates to 14 measures and where farmers invest in them they can get 50% offset against tax over two years in an accelerated allowance.  Some of the measures look to address hazardous activity through investment in equipment.  An example might be an anti-backing gate where a cow going into a crush cannot get back, which is a very important preventive measure.  Another example would be hydraulic linkage arms for tractors and jacking systems and a lifter for big bags of a half a tonne or more, with or without the integral bag-cutting system.  There are also allowances for chemical storage cabinets and other preventive measures.</p><p>Half of the measures in that accelerated capital allowance are adaptive measures.  They include the quick hitch mechanism for rear and front three-point linkage to enable the hitching of implements without having to descend from a tractor.  We have farmers who have, unfortunately, lost limbs because of a farm safety incident.  For income and mental health reasons, when these farmers recover from their injuries they need to go back to work but it can be prohibitively expensive to adapt machinery and tractors in some of those ways.  I was very conscious of that in formulating the accelerated capital allowance.  Modified controls can enable full hand operation of a full vehicle when somebody has lost a foot or a leg.  There could be a wheelchair docking system or the provision of a lift, hoist or an integrated ramp to the farm vehicle, including modified entry where required, and wheelchair restraints.  These are all really important additional steps that can provide easier access in farm vehicles.</p><p>I encourage everybody on the committee to be familiar with the accelerated capital allowance and let constituents know about it.  When farmers apply for these measures, it strengthens my case next year to make a list of 14 measures even longer.  We should ensure it is fully subscribed because there is &euro;5 million per year set aside for this.  We all need to work together to make farmers aware of the supports that exist for them in that regard.</p></speech>

Many of the other committee members have covered the questions I would have asked but that is fine.  I respect what the Minister of State has said about farmers needing to understand that when there is a two-person job, they should wait and try to get somebody to help.  It is not easy for many farmers, who may be under fierce pressure.  We are calendar farming now and, unfortunately, this puts farmers into a corner and they must work at certain times, with the weather and a deadline on their back.  Much of the time they can be on their own.  They might suffer rural isolation as well, leading to many difficulties.  There was mention of seven fatalities and that is seven too many.  I respect that figure.  Farmers are under much pressure too.</p> <p>  Senator Boylan mentioned the green certificate earlier.  I was speaking to the father of a young man doing his green certificate who told me about the pressure being put on young people today.  Perhaps it is an area the Minister of State might look into.  He said there is a bit of funding under health and well-being provisions.  Any of us who did a farming course know that people have to work as well, up to 35 hours per week.  The gentleman I spoke to said his son was milking approximately 170 cows for a farmer and getting &euro;122 per week.  He is getting &euro;3.48 per hour washing yards, spreading slurry, milking in the morning and evening.  That young fellow must buy tyres and diesel for the car.  He must live as well.  It is a lot of pressure for young person and we can only imagine it.  I would appreciate if that could be looked at.</p> <p>  If there is funding available, perhaps young farmers trying to start in life and get trained would not be asked to work for &euro;3.48 per hour.  These are decent and hard-working young lads and they deserve a little more respect.  It is a failing of the systems in our country.  If we pressurise them at that point in life, how will we improve their lot as time goes on?  The Minister of State might look into it at some stage, although he has the very important brief of farm safety.  We all know that and we are all on the one side on this matter.  I thank the Minister of State.</p></speech>

Young people are under immense pressure for &euro;3.48 per hour, or that is what it works out at for this gentleman.  It is the same in many cases, milking 170 cows morning and evening, as well as all the work that goes with it, including slurry spreading.  He works so many weeks at 35 hours per week.  That brings savage pressure on young fellows.  It is unfair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#G00900"><p>Absolutely.  The idea of work experience is the young farmer gains that knowledge.  I know I did when I did my green cert over 20 years ago.  It is about working on a different host farm and people learn more on another farm than they might at home working for parents, etc.  It is a very valuable part of the green cert.  I would not want to see a position where somebody takes advantage of a young farmer when it comes to the number of hours he or she is expected to work.  Work experience has a role to play and it is valuable.  There must be safeguards around the process.  The Deputy might give me the details of the specific case and I can look into it.  Farmers must be approved as well to take on those positions and with that comes a responsibility to ensure all the jobs being done have a learning element.</p><p>There is very much a learning element to it.  One can also talk about the type of work one is asking them to do.  There must be a learning element to all the work that has been done there.</p><p> Outside of that, I would say to young farmers that in our support for young farmers and to encourage the transition, there are challenges, especially with farm safety and the older age of our farmers.  There are so many farmers over the age of 65 and into their 70s farming and this is highlighted in the figures for farm fatalities where so many of incidents involved those who are in their 70s.  It is very important to encourage intergenerational change, whether it is through partnership or through intergenerational change.  We have made changes in recent years around long-term leasing and the 60% TAMS grant to encourage that generational change.  These are all measures to support young farmers and to encourage them not only to take over the enterprise but also to invest and make farms safer and more efficient in how they do that as well.</p></speech>

Will the Minister of State elaborate on how CAP reform is going to play a part in farm safety and whether he believes that the new CAP talks and the new funding will play a vital role in ensuring that farm safety will be part of that?  Will the Minister of State also elaborate on the well-being of farmers and how they actually operate?  Unfortunately, a lot of farmers work by themselves.  It is a very lonely occupation in so many ways.  They must deal with succession planning and financial planning also.  Will the Minister of State speak on the well-being of farmers on the farm?  I spoke with a farmer during the week and he told me that he would meet the artificial insemination, AI, man and the bulk tank truck driver and these would be his interactions during the week.  There is an issue around how farmers can communicate, can meet and can be involved in the system.  Their mental well-being in particular may be an issue that we must focus on.  Will the Minister of State comment on those two issues?</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned they are the same and one cannot look at them in isolation.  I definitely share the concerns. Farmers work in isolation anyway.  It is the nature of the job and it then makes it harder when the pressure is on.  We are all aware of the impact that Covid has had on farmers.  Across all sectors of society it has affected people who live alone or in more isolation but I have particular concern for farmers who work alone and live alone and particularly during the Covid restrictions.  Their social outlet was to go to mart and maybe go for a pint at the weekend or to go to a sporting match or maybe to a religious service at the weekend.  All of those four things were taken away during the lockdown.  The pressures of farming and the ongoing work of farming did not go away.  The release valve of talking to other neighbours and to share their experiences and to realise that they were not the only ones who are feeling the pressure, was taken away from them little bit.  I am acutely aware that.  This is why the On Feirm Ground project is so important.  The farm adviser is very trusted.  They are in the yard and they have that opportunity to lean over the gate and have that chat with the farmer at the end, and to identify if a farmer is in distress.  The adviser is also in a position to be able to signpost supports where he or she thinks they are needed.  I spoke about the innovation partnership models we have introduced.  A number of the approved European Innovation Projects, EIPs, will address issues the committee has raised such as farm succession and health and well-being.  These include the An Meitheal Feirme Project and Eco-T, which is a collaborative response to farmer mental health and suicide.  The mid-Leinster farming and well-being project will carry that out.  The farm family continuing professional development working group has also secured funding under the EIP.  It is very striking that of the successful applications coming through the EIP model, many of them incorporated the farmer mental health and well-being piece as an integral part of addressing other safety hazards on the farm.  They are inextricably linked, as the committee has also highlighted.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for inviting us to be here this evening.</p> <p>This evening's topic for discussion in the committee is farm safety and I will begin by telling members about how and why Embrace FARM was founded, and this involves telling our story.</p> <p>  I am from west Limerick.  I come from a large family of eight children and grew up in a small house with my siblings, parents and my father's brother and sister.  It was a typical Irish extended farm family.  Ten years ago, I met and married a pedigree Holstein dairy farmer.  As farms do not move, I now find myself living in lovely Laois.  As newlyweds we were in our own little happy bubble, we were renovating the old farmhouse and I found myself pregnant with our first child very quickly.  We were happy out on our journey and welcoming the start of our own little family.  Our daughter, Julie was born, and life could not have been any better at that stage.  We were navigating our way through having a newborn child, but all was good.  I arrived home from hospital on a Sunday, it was Father's Day and Brian&rsquo;s birthday.  Two days later, that happy little bubble was shattered into smithereens on our family farm.  Brian&rsquo;s dad Liam, a champion ploughman and community activist, was involved in an accident on our farm.  He was rushed to hospital and placed on life support.  Those machines were switched off three days later.  That began our journey into trauma and grief.</p> <p>  For me personally, to have no control over that journey was something I found very difficult because my everyday life was now consumed by my husband's grief and his family's grief.  Brian wanted to be strong, to be the fixer in the family and to take on his father&rsquo;s role, but he was obviously hurting and in shock.  He blamed himself for what had happened on our farm, as he was not with his father at the time of the accident.  "If only..." and "Why didn&rsquo;t I..." and "Why didn't he..." were a common theme and a common conversation in those days.  We coasted along, keeping our heads above water emotionally, trying to deal with something neither of us had ever been through before.</p><p>It was a true test in the early days of our marriage.</p><p> Our neighbours and extended family were the best to help, particularly as they are in all farming communities.  They milked our cows and did bits around the farm, but eventually they had to go back to their own lives.  Approximately 18 months later, we started to look for outside support that was specific to farming, but there was none to be found.  After many conversations, we decided to set up our own charity, Embrace FARM, which provides a support network to those affected by farm accidents and supports both the bereaved families and survivors of farm accidents.</p><p> The HSA can provide statistics on how many people die each year on our farms and give the breakdown on the cause of death.  Embrace FARM talks about the people behind those statistics.  We put a person to each one of those numbers and speak about the true toll of the devastation caused.  These farmers are more than just a number; they each leave a legacy behind them, none more so than to their families.</p><p> I would like to tell the committee about some of the people we encounter in Embrace FARM.  We meet women, at all stages of their lives, widowed and left behind to pick up the pieces, both emotionally and practically.  They face legal and financial difficulties.  There may be no will in place and they may not have access to the farm business bank account.  They face succession issues.  What does a young widow do with the farm?  Older widows may have an adult child to take over, but a younger widow with young children faces the dilemma of what to do: whether to farm it, lease it or sell it.   Should she hold onto it for her children?  Will they want to farm it in ten or 15 years' time?  There are so many questions to answer, but her husband is no longer there to help her figure it out.</p><p> On the issue of farm enterprise regulations or schemes, some widows are very familiar with the workings of daily farm life, but others are not.  How do they begin to navigate the myriad of paperwork in respect of meeting deadlines for schemes, regulations to be adhered to and decisions to be made?  One lady told us of how she used to see what the neighbour was at.  For example, if she saw that he was spreading slurry on a particular day, she knew she needed to get that done.  Another lady told us how she was fined by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for missing a deadline on a scheme that she did not even know she had to apply for.  Today, we were contacted by a widow who is looking for prayers and good wishes because she is facing a farm inspection.</p><p> These women are faced with their children's grief.  A mother's primary concern will be for her children and how they are coping.  The trauma a child goes through in witnessing their father or sibling being killed on the family farm is something that requires specialised help to get through.  In some instances, there is further family breakdown.  There are opinions on what a widow should do with the farm.  Her parents in-law will not be happy with her decisions and grandchildren face a further loss of contact with their grandparents because families fall out.  We have seen instances of injunctions being taken out against parents-in-law.  Thankfully, that is rare, but it does happen.</p><p> We encounter parents who have lost their children in traumatic circumstances.  Not always, but usually, it is the dad who is operating the machinery when such accidents happen.  I doubt that any of the members here today can even contemplate what the farmer goes through every day following such an incident.  One dad told us of presenting at the emergency department with chest pains.  After many tests had come back clear, it was obvious to all that the dad had a broken heart following the loss of his son.  The guilt and sense of responsibility that these dads have are no match for any amount of judgment they may face.  It is their life sentence.</p><p> We encounter adults who mourn the death of their father, the loss of their mentor and the person they worked with each day.  They try to take on their father's role within the family.  Sometimes it is welcomed by the other family members, and other times it is not.  Even if it is welcomed, it brings an added pressure.  Even if there is a will in place, there may be division in the family, as some may not be happy with the contents.  All of this is stress and pressure that is added to a person's grief, while they continue to farm, meet deadlines and rush against the weather.</p><p> We encounter men, and sometimes women, who have to adapt to living each day with a life-altering disability following an accident.  They need the strength to battle through the health system to have their voices heard.  Many are farmers who have lost a limb or sometimes, two limbs.  There is very little in the way of helping the farmer to adapt to the situation they find themselves in to be able to continue to farm.  Prostheses need to be changed regularly and there is a very outdated system in respect of how often a farmer can do that through the public health system.  The prosthetic is needed to enable the farmer to live as normal a life as possible and to carry on working their farm to the best of their ability.  When that is not in place, frequently, the farmer has to give up the enterprise they are involved in, often since childhood.  Addiction, depression and suicide ideation are common among survivors of farm accidents.  Living with daily pain does take its toll.  Can you imagine what phantom pain must feel like, when your brain thinks the limb is there when its not?  Farmers believe themselves to be custodians of the land, who pass it from one generation to the next.  For them to not be generation that can hand it on better than they got it, takes it toll on them.  A farmer who survives a life-altering farm accident feels obligated to put on a brave face, just because they survived.  The trauma of the accident, immediate recovery and rehabilitation not only affects the survivor, but also their spouse, children and extended family.  Everyone has to adapt to a new way of living.</p><p> Embrace FARM supports all of these people who unexpectedly find themselves on a journey of loss and trauma.  To help the well-being of our farm families, Embrace FARM has built a community of support in response to their needs.  Embrace FARM creates a space for people to connect and share their story with people who truly understand the devastating impact a farm tragedy has.  We currently support about 300 farm families in our peer-to-peer support network.</p><p> Embrace FARM has recently been successful in being awarded European innovation partnership, EIP, funding to enable us to put in place a structure of one-on-one support for farm families impacted by tragedies on our farms.  This will expand our services to include other types of sudden trauma, like suspected suicide on farms, and will enable us to support more farm families.  This funding is for one year and will enable us to get the work off the ground.  We extend our thanks to Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and the officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for this initiative.</p><p> As a point of note, I would like to mention that Embrace FARM is a registered charity in full compliance.  For the second time we have been shortlisted for the Good Governance Awards in the charity sector.  We pride ourselves in the correct running of our charity to the best of our knowledge.  Our annual remembrance service has been adopted by the group in Northern Ireland, which hosted its first service of remembrance on the 24 October.  The Farming Community Network in the UK will host its first service of remembrance on 7 November.  Up until now, Ireland was the only country to formally acknowledge the death of farmers in a national remembrance service.  It has done so since 2014.  Approximately 600 people attended the service this year, and during Covid times, in the region of 45,000 viewed it online.  The service is also broadcast on RT&Eacute;.</p><p> While Embrace FARM's focus is on picking up the pieces after tragedy happens on our farms rather than on farm safety preventative measures, we can talk about the impact of farm tragedies on our farms.  All of the health and safety experts that we have spoken with over the years tell us there is no one silver bullet to fix farm safety.  In recent years, I have noticed how the fixes are all shifting onto the behaviour of farmers.  I am no health and safety expert, but I feel this is a bit unfair.  While the farmers must take responsibility for their actions on the farm, they are not the entire agriculture sector, but one part of it.  There are people in these Houses and in Brussels who make legislation, officials in the Departments who enact that legislation and wider groups of processors,organisations, private companies and media outlets, among many others, who are also involved in the agriculture sector.  Their behaviour and our behaviour need to change.</p><p> If there is to be a cultural change in agriculture around the behaviours of farmers when it comes to farm safety, then that behaviour needs to change in the entire sector. Legislators must put the farmer first, not just the product they are producing.  Without the farmer, there is no product.</p><p>We are all able to sit here today because a farmer has provided food to sustain us.  Officials and processors, when doing their inspections, need to look further than just the farm gate and the operation of the enterprise.  What about the farmer's well-being?  The media need to stop printing images that condone unsafe practices.  These are just a few things.</p><p> All of us in the agriculture sector need to change our behaviour, not just farmers.  The farmer is just one person.  We, the agriculture sector, need to help farmers, not just shift the blame of farm safety to them without looking at ourselves as well.  Farmers are a resilient people and want to do their best for their land and animals.  I know in my home, as it is in many farmhouses, the animal and the human are treated as being as important as each other.  Even today, farmers face having changing regulations and climate action demands forced upon them.  Farmers want to do their best, with the help of others in the sector, but they do not want to be the only ones making sacrifices and changes.</p><p> I ask members to take a minute to remember a farmer in their localities.  I have no doubt each member will be able to recall someone who has lost his or her life tragically on a farm, whether through a farm accident, suicide or even a sudden medical event.  I would like members to think about that person and now the person's family who are left behind to pick up the pieces.  What happened to that farm family and the farm?  Sometimes bad things happen after a sudden and traumatic death on a farm.  These are usually driven by grief and trauma that is not being dealt with.  It can take many forms, including anger, resentment, isolation, depression, substance abuse, family breakdown and suicide.  It does not always end like this, of course, but for some farm families it does, and this is where Embrace FARM would like to help our farm families before things get very bad.</p><p> With me today are Mr. Brian Rohan, a dairy farmer from County Laois who is also co-founder and chairperson of our board of directors, and Ms Catherine Collins, our development manager.  I thank members for their time.  We welcome any questions they may have.</p></speech>

It was as heart-rending an opening statement as I have ever heard in this committee room.  Unfortunately, we have all walked into sitting rooms and living rooms after a tragic accident on a farm.  Ms Rohan's portrayal of the devastation that it causes is all too accurate.  We have also seen incidents where farmers have been badly hurt or injured and the devastation that it causes, as well as the significant financial hardship it can put on the family farm structure.  Farms usually only have one breadwinner.  If an accident happens, there are many different complications and permutations.  I compliment the witnesses on the group that they have set up and for the help which is given to the families concerned.  Having somebody to talk to can be very important.</p> <p>  I genuinely compliment the witnesses on their opening statement.  It was comprehensive and genuine.  Unfortunately, we all know too many horror stories.  I had a farm accident when I was a young man.  Thankfully, I have recovered reasonably well from it.  I cannot say that I have not lived a full life.  At the time, it put substantial financial pressure on our household.  I was 22 years old when it happened and my father was sick at the time, in the first stages of a long, painful illness.  That created significant pressure and worry for my parents.  I was in and out of hospital for three years.  Thankfully, I got back on my feet, and was one of the lucky ones, since I did not experience a real long-term impact.  Many people's lives have been devastated.  I compliment the witnesses on their opening statement and the work they are doing for families that so badly need somewhere to turn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.49" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#K00300"><p>I concur with every word the Chairman has just said.  I thank Ms Rohan for that opening statement.  I read it earlier today.  It was a rare moment where my breath caught.  Ms Rohan's delivery was even more forceful.  Her message has been heard loud and clear.  I was especially struck when she invited us all to remember people who have lost their lives.  All of us who are engaged on an ongoing basis with the agriculture sector could probably think of multiple people.  I express my condolences to the family of Tommy Feeney from my constituency, who was killed recently.  I did not know him but I know his death has had a substantial impact on his wife, their two young girls and the wider community.  I was talking to farmers dozens of miles away who were struck by just how quickly these things can happen.</p> <p>  There is a particular challenge for us because, as has been said, people who are often derisorily described as part-time farmers are usually full-time farmers with another full-time job.  That means, especially at this time of the year, that they are engaged in the most dangerous industry in the country, often in the dark, either early in the morning or late at night.  That creates significant challenges because, as Senator Daly said, it involves dealing with big, potentially dangerous animals, chemicals and powerful machinery weighing several tonnes, while working alone, which would not be permitted in any other sector, yet tens of thousands of people are doing it.</p> <p>  We need to take heed of Ms Rohan's final message that this cannot be left to people who have another full-time job because they cannot derive a sustainable income from their land.  As part of their role on the farm, as well as being the person who is dealing with the machinery and animals, a farmer is also expected to be an accountant, a bookkeeper, solicitor and legal expert and an expert on EU regulations and domestic legislation, as well as holding together a family, which can be stressful in the modern era.  Farmers cannot be held solely responsible for adopting and implementing a farm safety policy.  There need to be additional supports.</p> <p>  We previously discussed with the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, how the Government and Department clearly have a role that they need to take up.  There also has to be a role for the others along the market chain who are making money off an individual's work.  There is a role for processors, retailers, factories, supermarkets and all of us in society to recognise that we have a challenge.</p> <p>  I do not know if the witnesses heard our interaction with the Minister of State.  My specific question is about the issue of succession and the challenge it presents.  We asked whether the Department could do more to provide supports to families in that situation.  Ms Rohan's statement referred to a young wife who may not be from a farming background and is left with the burden of the farm and the challenges of knowing when the deadline for a scheme is.  We suggested that the Department establish a section to support families and take them step by step through all the processes.  The Minister of State indicated that a point person had been appointed.  I gather from the witnesses' statement that this is not sufficient.  I welcome any thoughts about how that could be improved.</p> <p>  Many good organisations support bereaved families.</p><p>I commend our guests on turning their family tragedy into a positive piece of action that has benefited hundreds of other families.  What needs to be done to support families who are in that position on farms and in terms of the wider supports that could be provided?</p><p> I apologise that I have to attend another meeting at 7.30 p.m., but I look forward to listening to the witnesses' responses until then.</p></speech>

However, when it comes to women who are not familiar with the daily working of the farm, they do not know how it works with the Department.  They do not know one scheme from another.  As they are in grief and shock and are traumatised, some can tend to be distrustful of their circle and are not sure where to turn or to whom to turn.  While the Department may have that one person, what the person is talking about makes no sense to the women, so it is not as straightforward as them just ringing up and getting an answer.  Brian might wish to speak on that.  He has quite a few stories about many of these women.</p></speech>

Dad died in 2012 and the single farm payment was introduced in that year, but in the following year we had to transfer the farm into my name and so forth.  My adviser applied for the basic payment that time in joint names because Dad and I were in joint partnership.  It was applied for in the names of Liam Rohan, deceased, and Brian Rohan.  About a month later, a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine official called out to me and said it was time I put the herd number in my name.  He asked me to sign the paperwork with him and I signed it.  In June of that year, another official from the Department rang me and said I had applied for the basic payment scheme in a partnership with one person who is deceased.  I said that was what my adviser did.  Then he said that a month later I changed the name into my own name.  I said that a departmental official came out and told me I needed to sign the paper.  I said that I tend to do what I am told by departmental officials so as not to get in trouble.  He said I should not have done that.  I asked how would I know and asked him what the problem was.  He said: "It means I have more paperwork to do".  I said I was sorry that my father being killed in a farm accident caused him more paperwork.</p> <p>  That led to an ongoing battle.  The official was to send out forms but they did not arrive.  There were forms to be signed.  He said that if I just had the cop on to fill up an ERAD 2 form, put the details on it and send it back, he would look after it and that would have been done.  However, he was fairly ignorant about it.  I had to make a call to a friend of mine in the Department and he said I needed to talk to a certain man.  I rang him and he told me he would bring the form home with him that night and give it to me to fill it up.  He rang me the next day to tell me it was resolved.  I am used to dealing with the Department and perhaps meeting somebody who is not as efficient as somebody else.  I thought about a widow who knows nothing about farming getting that type of answer from a guy on the telephone.  She is bad enough as she is with her grief without having to deal with that type of hardship.</p> <p>  When it came to basic payment time the following October, I was seeking my 70% like everybody else.  It did not come.  We had to change bank accounts.  Every week that I rang I was told I was cleared for payment, but when Tuesday came there was no payment.  The following Tuesday there was no payment and I rang again.  I have a fair amount of patience, but it was beginning to run out.  Eventually, on the Saturday before Christmas that year I finally got my payment.  I was told to ring Cavan because the Department did not have my bank details, but I had rung the Department a month previously and was told it had the bank details.  Eventually, I got my 70% on the Saturday before Christmas.  The disadvantaged area payment had not come in and I had to start the process again in January.  It was February in the following year before I got my payment.  I felt I had enough to do to run the farm from day to day and to deal with everything else without having to chase up what is my money.</p></speech>

In fairness, he was trying to come for about a month, so we picked that Monday.  He arrived and the job was done and dusted in about two hours.  It was to make sure that the food I am producing is quality assured.  On the Tuesday, I had an unannounced health and safety inspection.  The guy arrived and I told him I had no objection to the inspection but asked if there was any chance it could be done on the following day.  The cattle were out and we were stripping the silage pit for the first time.  I told him we were trying to get the cattle in, that I wanted to get the pit stripped and get them in.  I asked him if he could come back the following day or the next day.  "No", he said, "it has to be done today and will only take an hour".  We downed tools and two and a half hours later he was in and out and then gone.  We had to leave the cattle out for another day.  We got them in on the following day and at 2.15 p.m., when we were having a cup of tea after dinner, the telephone rang.  It was an official from the Department to tell me that he was there for a full cross-compliance inspection.  He had been there two years previously for another full cross-compliance inspection.  I passed both times, by the way.  Messing with him, I told him politely to eff off, but I went down the yard and met him.  We started it at 2.30 p.m. and he was there until 6.30 p.m.  He was back the next day from 11 a.m. until 4 p.m.  That was four days of my week gone.  I just had to drop tools.</p> <p>  That type of pressure should not be put on any farmer.  It was a very busy time of the year.  We had to do it and we have no choice but to do it.  I spoke to somebody in the HSA.  We are friendly with one of the senior inspectors and he sits on our board.  I told him I had the inspection and asked if, after a fatal farm accident, there was not a signpost put up that there has been a fatal accident on the farm.  He said, "I am surprised you had it, but I am not surprised you passed it".  That is how he put it.  He knows me and he knows the farm.  The boardroom for Embrace FARM was our kitchen table until the Covid pandemic.  Now, like everybody else, we are on Zoom.</p> <p>  Those types of pressures, added to perhaps taking bad prices, being hit with bad weather and the like can really get to farmers.  The departmental official who was doing the inspection told me that he often calls to farmers and said that he would know by them when they open their doors that they are not in a good place mentally.  However, he said that inspectors are told to go in unannounced and carry out the inspection.  In one particular case, he said, "I walked away from him and told him I would call back another day", and he went away.  The farmer was on his mind.  The farmer was lucky he had that inspector because I met another unhelpful inspector at another time and I would not like him calling into anybody who was in a bad mental state because he would not do any good for him.</p></speech>

Mr. Rohan said he has patience.  By God, he had some patience putting up with that type of carry-on and when there is pure stupidity like that.  I congratulate Embrace FARM and say &quot;Well done&quot; for the services being provided.  As Ms Rohan said in her statement, behind every one of those accidents there is a family, not a number.  I lost my nephew to a silly farm accident a long time ago.  It is not a number, but someone who has left behind a father, mother or family.  I am in awe of the services the organisation is providing for families.  I can imagine that in my situation, and everybody else here is in the same boat, if these types of services had been available it would have made a massive difference to families over the years.</p><p>The opening statement said that legislators need to put the farmers first, not just the product they are producing.  To be honest, in my time on this committee it appears that with the requirements and regulations that are imposed on farmers, both domestically and by the European Union, alongside the need to be profitable or to break even, at least, our farmers' well-being is being pretty much overlooked.  What can we do?  Do the witnesses have suggestions for what we can do, as legislators, to address this?  In particular, when regulations are passed for farmers and new demands are made, for example, in the case of slurry and soiled water storage, should the regulations be accompanied either by a health and safety message or assistance for farmers?  On the same theme, there is new machinery coming on line all the time and demands are being made of farmers when it comes to the machinery they should use.  Is training in the correct use of that machinery ever an issue?  Could more be done either by the Department or the manufacturers?  I would like to hear the witnesses' opinion on that.</p><p>On the mental health aspect, I recently read a report in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>on mental health and how the ripple effect of changes to the agricultural policy and the restructuring of farming have an impact on the mental health of farmers.</p><p>Is this something our guests have seen or become aware of?  Is attention being paid to it, given the changes the farming community faces?  Do our guests have any suggestions about how to address that need?</p></speech>

Nevertheless, legislation and regulations have their part to play and they are there for a reason.  When legislators are producing legislation, focusing on the product is only one aspect.  Farmers' well-being has to be side by side with that, not at the bottom of the pile.  The Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, has committed that in the new Food Vision 2030 policy, the farmer will be up there, although I am not sure about that.  Similarly, the Health and Safety Authority and its officials want farmers to be safe.   They do not want them injuring themselves or dying.</p> <p>  Even so, when these people are front-facing with farmers, there is a way to deal with and interact with people.  It might be a suggestion for the Department to have a psychotherapist or psychologist on its payroll to help with training of officials and so on.  There are no official figures from the CSO on farmer suicide in Ireland that we can get our hands on.  Apparently, our country is too small and it is too easy to identify people.  Based on the figures from the UK, however, we estimate approximately one farmer per week takes his or her own life.  That is an estimate but-----</p></speech>

The CSO argues the country is too small and the people can be identified.  The estimate nonetheless is that one farmer takes his or her own life every week.  Ms Collins might wish to comment on legislation, regulations and mental health.</p></speech>

We should imagine them producing the product productively and economically for the country and ask who that affects throughout the supply chain.  That needs to be examined as a whole rather than just in respect of the individual farmer.</p> <p>  Mental health campaigns happen specifically in the summertime, at the height of the farming season.  Peter Hynes has started the new Ag Mental Health Week in Cork, which will focus on the autumn.  There is also the time of year from January to May when it is considered as well.  The Department should get behind that a little more, flag it and offer more supports, and have more discussion of mental health.  That is the problem.  People do not want to talk about it and the stigma is still there, especially in rural Ireland.  From our perspective, we have found that suicide ideation goes hand in hand with grief and loss.  There are mothers who just do not want to continue and who exist just because of their children.  There are farmers who have had limbs amputated and have had the same circumstances leading to the addiction issues Ms Rohan mentioned earlier.</p> <p>  Retraining and redirection could be better examined.  I can think of one person who has tried several roads he would like to go down but, because he is in his 60s, he is coming up against so many issues and he cannot continue farming.  In theory, he should be able to continue farming for at least another five years, until the statutory retirement age.  Small matters such as that could be adjusted and made more accessible to help with people's mental health and well-being.  That is part of the process of recovery, especially for the survivor of a farm accident.</p></speech>

The Health and Safety Authority has indicated that, in many cases, the farmer's wife is sent to complete the course and tick that box because the farmer is too busy to spend the half day doing the training, although I completed the half-day training myself because I wanted to see what goes on at these training courses.  The Health and Safety Authority has trained people in State bodies to conduct these training courses but what I witnessed that day was horrendous.  We were shown a picture of a tractor that had been overturned, with blood on the yard, and the man asked what we thought of it.  He said an 80-year-old man with a tractor had lifted the loader too high, gone down a rough lane, turned over and was killed.  We were told also about a farmer who had brought his five-year-old son onto the yard and asked whether it would be okay for him to be left loose on the yard while the father was feeding the cattle.</p> <p>  I lost my own dad.  Thankfully for me, he did not die at home and got to the hospital, but there are many families where the father was driving a tractor that drove over his son, or where a son was with the father who was attacked by a cow.  There has to be a better way to do this training than by showing these pictures.  Survivors or people who have lost somebody and gone through an accident can deliver the training much better than some of these training professionals.  We have to think of the people who have been affected.  No questions were asked about whether anybody in attendance had lost anybody in a farm accident or had suffered a farm accident.  It was just a matter of doing the two or three hours' training that day and some of the stuff was horrendous.</p></speech>

Their opening statement was fantastic and set a tone for the debate, which is one we need to have more often.  I acknowledge their presence and welcome them.</p> <p>  I made a couple of notes while they were speaking.  I asked myself what would happen if I died tomorrow morning.  How would my wife, Catherine, survive?  I was thinking about how the bank account and the co-operative are both in my name and asking how that would work.  Is my will up to date?  I was thinking of issues all the way down to the coroner's court and the Teagasc adviser.  There are so many to address in regard to how a farmer's family would survive if he or she was no longer at home.  A great deal of communication is required.  My discussion group and others need to be involved in order that we can prepare for what, unfortunately, could happen, although we hope it will not.  That will be an issue for us a society and an industry.</p> <p>  Mr. Rohan spoke about training courses and I have a great story about them.  A colleague of mine in a different industry ran a health and safety training course and was trying to get about 15 lads through it.  They were not engaging, so the man in charge of the course began talking about children, what would happen if they were choking and what way the men would cut their sausages.  The 15 of them perked up straight away and everyone started listening.  When an issue affects people or they think it is logical, they will engage straight away.  This is about engaging and trying to ensure we get out the message that we should not rush, even though that is something we all do.</p> <p>  The issue of how a family will survive after an accident is very important.  We all know somebody, perhaps in our townland or parish, who has, unfortunately, lost a limb.  I have a neighbour in the townland next to me who lost a limb when he was 12 years of age from a PTO shaft.  We have all lost neighbours over recent years and we all know exactly who has been lost and how.  How we deal with that as a society is the big issue.  That debate and trying to get that information out there is the most important matter.</p> <p>  I have spoken previously about young drivers of quads and similar issues that need to be raised.  Is it appropriate that a 16-year-old might drive a charter that can do 60 km/h and carry 25 tonnes behind it?  There is demand for these girls and boys in summertime but there needs to be a debate in society as to when we should say "stop".  That will be a difficult debate because we are working harder to provide for our families but, unfortunately, we are putting ourselves at risk.  The debate on when to say "stop" will be the most important one.</p> <p>  Our guests' services are very important, both for society and for those who are left behind.  They concern a big issue and I compliment them on those services.  A farm fatality is shocking but, in many ways, a farm accident is just as bad.</p><p>It means that people might not have the ability to take full control of the farm in the same way as they did previously.  I have a personal friend who is in that scenario.  As a farmer with a young family, dealing with that, mentally in particular, is a trauma not alone for him but the entire family and, probably, the entire community as well.  There are so many moving parts to this.  The most important part is the participation of services like Embrace FARM.  It gives a focus so that people can talk about it, get involved and acknowledge that there is a problem.  We need to start scenario planning for the "What if?"  That is what I am taking away from this debate.  We need to start that scenario planning because, God forbid, there are an awful lot of things that would need to be tied up if that is not done.  I compliment the witnesses on their work.  What do they think we, as a committee, can do?  Where do we need to go?  </p><p> Several years ago, the Seanad Public Consultation Committee did a report on farm safety and raising awareness around farm safety.  Senator Paul Daly and I, as members of that committee, were very involved in that work.  Do we need to do more?  What are the issues about which we need to raise awareness?  Where do the witnesses think this debate is going to go?  In terms of the mental health issue, as it gets darker earlier in the evening, people have too much time to think.  That is a big issue that we need to start talking about.  Peter Hynes was mentioned, whom I know personally.  He is a very good advocate on this issue.  I often say to him that he does his best to drive me mad about date nights.  He continuously does so every Saturday night.  He is out to show us all up.  We have to have time for ourselves and our families as well.  It is not just all about work.  I thank the witnesses for being here.  This has been one of the most important discussions we have had as a committee.  I acknowledge the wonderful contributions of the organisation.</p></speech>

Following on from his remarks with regard to Mr. Hynes, kindness, acknowledgement and talking are important things.  Farming is a male dominated sector.  They say men do not talk, but I reckon farmers do a lot of chatting.  As I said earlier, I am not a health and safety expert.  In terms of a cultural change around behaviours, there is no point in expecting one part of the sector to do that on its own while everybody else goes about their own business.  It has to start in every part of the sector.  The legislators need to make the farmer as important as the product that is being produced.  There is no product without the farmer.</p> <p>  Senator Lombard spoke about mental health, isolation and so on.  The farmer is all of the time having to fight for his or her spot or place.  We need a lot more joined up thinking in every area rather than just a focus on the product.  We need to focus on the farmer as well, and his or her family.  It has been said many times that agriculture is the backbone of this country.  We need to place the value on the farmer and the family and to respect all of them for what they have done and the legacy that they leave behind.  As I said, we are all here today because farmers produce food for us to eat.  We need to come together and support the farmers to do the work they need to do, without constantly imposing more regulations and legislation on them.  I accept that the latter have to happen, but there is a way to do them.  You cannot just go in and make demands.  You need to talk to people and treat them with respect and kindness.  That will go a long way towards bringing a cultural change.  That is my humble opinion.</p></speech>

We could have a broader corporate social responsibility.  In other words, everybody across the sector would pledge towards the safety, security and responsibility of the sector.  This goes hand-in-hand with what is happening with the climate change responsibility which we all have to adapt to and take on at the moment.  We need an industry-wide message that every aspect of the supply chain for the agriculture sector has to buy into, from the processors to the farm workers and right up to top, inclusive of everybody who is in this room this evening.  That might be one way of addressing it, to begin with.</p></speech>

On the question of what would happen if we were not operational in the morning, we initially set up Embrace FARM to facilitate a remembrance service on the last Sunday of June, which was to be held annually.  That was it.  We had a great PR person behind us.  He got us into the newspapers and on radio and television interviews.  I am not a person who likes public speaking, and never have done, even when I was at school.  My father, Lord have mercy on him, was into public speaking, but I am not.  However, I just had to step up and do it.  We were receiving emails at 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. from widows telling us their life stories.  As stated, in one particular email, which was two or three pages long, a widow set out her life story to us as strangers.  Her partner of many years was killed.  They had two children.  The bank accounts were immediately frozen.  She had a good job, but the farm needed to be looked after.  In fairness, her partner's brothers came on board and supported her 100%.  They also engaged with the co-operative and got it the co-op name changed into her name so that when the corn was cut she would get the money from the corn to give her some sort of income.  It took six years for her to get her bank account opened.  Her partner was a contractor and so there was money owed, but she does not think she got half that money.  The genuine customers paid up for bailing or cutting corn and so on, but an awful lot more walked away.  She then had to hire two solicitors, one to represent her and the other to represent her two children.  One third of the farm was required to be held in trust for the two children until they reached 18 years of age and she got the remaining two thirds, but she did not know if her son would be interested in farming.  At the moment, he wants to be a contractor like his father was.  He is currently 21 years of age and he is starting into the contracting game.</p> <p>  Again, for the past few years it has been all about developing farms and pushing on as the production of milk quotas is gone.  If you walk into the bank and get approval for &euro;500,000 loan you must take out life cover on that loan, which you cancel the following week.  I have said previously at meetings that if you borrow &euro;500,000 you are responsible for it and if you are not here next week the family is responsible for it, but if a person has life insurance the loan is taken care of.  It is one less worry for the family at a time when they are grieving.  That might be something that requires to be changed by the banking sector.  In other words, if a farmer borrows, be it &euro;100,000 or &euro;500,000, life cover must be put in place and cannot be cancelled.  </p></speech>

Like other speakers, in preparation for meetings I read through the submissions in order that I could prepare questions for the witnesses.  However, following on from the submission given today, the questions I had intended to ask have been already answered.  It was one of the best and most moving submissions I have ever heard at this committee.</p> <p>  By way of history, in 1983 I ploughed my first all-Ireland in Waterford in the under 21 section.  I was a young lad, mad to get out the traps.  At the time, John Summers, John Treacy, Martin Kehoe, Willie Ryan and Liam Rohan were the lads we aspired to be.  I might as well be honest; I never made it.  I cannot see it happening when it did not happen before now.  I think it was in 1986 Liam Rohan won the all-Ireland outright.  He won a few stubbles, but having done two together he won outright.  He represented Ireland at world championships on four occasions.  In terms of what the witnesses have done, at the time of his death or before it, representing Ireland was probably the legacy, but I can guarantee them today that if he could come back, they would be the legacy.  Embrace FARM is the legacy.  It would out trump him having represented Ireland.  The work Embrace FARM is doing is fantastic.  He could not but be proud.  That in itself has to be a solace for them, which solace they are now providing for other families.  I cannot compliment them enough.  It must mean so much to families to have available to them a service that was not available to the witnesses.  As mentioned in the submission, when they sought help it was not there but rather than walk away frustrated they set about fixing that for other people.  That is to be highly commended.</p><p>I have some short questions based on a couple of things Ms Rohan has said.  With regard to the European Innovation Partnerships, EIP, funding for one year, what happens next year?  Without going into detail, are there are many other families who are prepared to row in with Embrace FARM?  When something happens to you, people always say it is great to talk to somebody who has been there before.  Ms Rohan has been there and is talking to all of those families.  Are many others prepared to row in, talk to people and help?  Are there many who are willing to club in with Embrace FARM to make it bigger?</p><p> Ms Rohan has said she is not a safety expert.  There is a big issue, which Senator Lombard has mentioned.  When I was young, I started driving a grey Ferguson before moving on to a Massey Ferguson 135 and Massey Ferguson 165.  I had a bit of experience before I got into what you would call a half-decent tractor.  Now young lads are stepping up.  Something has to be done about it, to be honest.  It will not be popular with the 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds who are looking for licences and who think they will be drawing silage next year but something has to be done there.  You have to have a bit of experience before you are put up on a massive machine.  I do not know how to handle that but, as Senator Lombard has said, it is something we definitely need to look into.  </p><p> Earlier, in our meeting with the Minister of State, we mentioned the difficulties some families have had with the Department after a death, accident or tragedy, which the witnesses highlighted in their submission.  I have no doubt he will pursue that matter.  The Minister of State was a bit taken aback when some sections of the Embrace FARM submission were quoted.  I have no doubt but that he will pursue the matter and I will certainly be pursuing him to do so.  It is heart-wrenching.  My own uncle died just a couple of months ago.  It was recorded as a farm accident but it was a heart condition.  He was dead before he crashed the tractor.  I see what is going on in the family and the grief they feel.  They are trying to sort things out.  He was a bachelor.  My mother and his other sister and brothers are looking for things in the house but do not know where anything is.  I know exactly what it is like because I have lived it.  Everybody has, as the Chairman said earlier.  You do not need an unhelpful Department official or a letter saying you are not getting paid because you missed a deadline, which was a week after the family tragedy, on top of that.  There has to be a little bit of leeway within the Department.  We will be pursuing that with the Minister.</p><p> On behalf of everybody, I again thank the witnesses.  They have done a lot for many people.  It is a pleasure to have them here today.</p></speech>

It was addressed at the time, when Deputy Coveney was the Minister in charge.  The examples I gave in my opening statement illustrate the issues we have encountered with families.</p> <p>  With regard to 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds, as a mother, I will ask who wants to see a 16-year-old up on a tractor with a big piece of machinery attached to the back of it?  I do not believe anyone thinks that is right.  God love the 16-year-old or 17-year-old.  I am sure that is where he or she wants to be but there should be adequate precautions and regulations in that area.  Again, it is up to the Department and legislators to address that.  These are the Houses that make that kind of legislation.</p> <p>  With regard to the EIPs, the &euro;300,000 we are about to receive is for one year.  However, I believe that the Minister would say that there will be further road for a number of those projects at the end of those 12 months.  I am not too sure what that means at this point.  We are putting a little bit of that &euro;300,000 in funding aside to look at the sustainability of the project to ensure we can fund it for year 2 and year 3.  It provides one-on-one support for farm families and mentors and helps them through a process of grieving and some practical issues.  There is a fine line as to how much advice we can give when mentoring widows and others as to how to deal with the issues they are facing.  We want to look at that.  We currently provide peer-to-peer support.  Before Covid, we held residential weekends.  We hope to get back to them in the springtime.  We bring a number of families together.  These groups may comprise a number of widows or a number of farm families where children have lost their dad or a sibling.  While Embrace FARM facilitates these meetings of people and families and while a trained psychotherapist is also involved, those families help each other and tell each other their stories.  They become their own support network.  Since the start of the Covid pandemic, most of our stuff has gone online.  We are doing as best as we can online but there is nothing like meeting in person.  We have very active WhatsApp groups involving survivors of farm accidents.  We also have a widows' group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#O00300"><p>I thank Ms Rohan, Mr. Rohan and Ms Collins.  There is no family who has not come near a tragedy in their lives.  As the witnesses were talking earlier, I remembered what happened to my own brother-in-law a long time ago.  He had five young kids and another on the way.  Unfortunately, he fell off a load of straw.  A few things touched me.  Senator Paul Daly brought up a problem with bank accounts and everything being frozen.  Is there any way a charter or guidebook could be developed?  I listened to Mr. Rohan speaking about nearly everyone calling everyone, one day after another.  Could this committee or the Department help Embrace FARM with a charter which would result in a red flag in the event of a tragedy, meaning that there would be no inspection for a year and that all the different people who would give you a headache would not come around while you are in distress and while things are tender?</p> <p>  I remember setting up a turf cutters and contractors group.  There were three or four of us.  There was a lot of pressure on those three or four people.  How are the three witnesses coping?  Do they have support they need to answer every phone call and email and to organise the weekends Ms Rohan talked about and the psychotherapists or psychologists?  What is the structure?  Is there a great burden on a few, as is the case for many different organisations and groups?  If there is not, that is great, but if there is, how do the witnesses envisage that issue being resolved?  No more than with anything people do, you would crack up if there is too much pressure on you constantly over a long time.</p> <p>  With regard to funding, Ms Rohan seems to think there might be more funding streams available next year.  Will she come back to the committee if there is a problem in that regard, because I am sure everyone here will be willing to help?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.74" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Norma Rohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#O00400"><p>With regard to developing a charter or guidelines, working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we welcome working with anyone to make any farm family's life easier in the aftermath.  Our current structure is that we have a voluntary board of directors, of which Brian is the chair.  There are ten directors including people who have been affected personally and people from the agriculture industry who know how to run a business.  The team that works for Embrace FARM comprises Ms Collins and me.  I work part-time for 20 hours a week while Ms Collins works 25 hours a week.  That is it.  With the new funding of &euro;300,000 we are getting from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we will be employing one person full time and another person part time.  Again, that funding is only for 12 months.  I am living on a prayer that there will be a few bob to be got after those 12 months.  I welcome the Deputy's invitation to come back to the committee in 12 months for help in getting a few bob more.  We would gladly take it.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the burden.  There is a great burden on charities to operate with good governance.  When Brian and I first started out, another charity was falling apart due to mismanagement and embezzlement of funds.</p><p>As husband and wife we were determined from day 1 we would do the governance right, and we pride ourselves on that.  However, as any charity will tell you, there is a huge burden on charities to comply with that regulation.  It is the law and we must comply with it.  We do that but it is cumbersome.  The team is myself and Ms Collins.  Between the two of us we are one full-time person.</p></speech>

When does the funding for Embrace FARM start?</p></speech>

We signed the official contract on 23 October so it is for 12 months.</p></speech>

I suggest the committee write to the Minister to see if we can get a long-term pledge that kind of funding would roll over for more than one year.  I appreciate &euro;300,000 is grand for one year but I imagine from all the work our guests have detailed to us, that it will go very quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#P00500"><p>Just to clarify, the funding is to run the programme.  The programme is to expand into different types of sudden death and traumas on farms.  We still have to run our regular services as we are currently doing.  That runs separately from the programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#P00600"><p>I imagine that for the long term, our guests want to know now that projects can continue beyond 23 October next year.  I suggest it would be appropriate that the committee write to processors, the IFA and all those bodies.  The kind of work being done by Embrace FARM is priceless.  The sum involved is a pittance when you consider the anguish and distress families go through, and &euro;300,000 was mentioned.  Not just the Minister and the Department but farming organisations should really get on board and support our guests as well.  I do not know if is appropriate for the committee to get involved.</p></speech>

It is, as I said at the start, a charity doing invaluable work.  It is about more than the fatalities.  Where someone is injured, the problems may not be as bad but there can be huge financial issues for a family when someone gets badly hurt.  At our next private meeting we will put together a note to go to the Minister.</p></speech>

That is providing a residential bereavement weekend once a year for each cohort.  The new programme costs &euro;300,000.  We would welcome any support we can get.</p></speech>

You all took on this work on a voluntary basis.  Unfortunately, it was born out of tragedy you had in your own families on your own farms.  We will try to get this formalised and get it on a formal footing.</p> <p>  What Deputy Martin Browne said about going to the industry and processors would be up to our guests themselves as an organisation.  The work our guests do is invaluable.  Again, I sincerely thank them for coming in this evening.  Often we have confrontation in this room where witnesses are getting cross-examined.  That definitely was not the case this evening.  I thank our guests for taking the time to come in.  If we can be of any help to Embrace going forward, just communicate with us.  As I said, we will sit down at our next meeting and discuss how we can open up negotiations between our guests and the Department to get their funding onto a formal footing.  I most certainly cannot see any member of the committee objecting to that because our guests have seen the sentiment is unanimous around the room.  No-one can help but admire the work our guests have done.  Unfortunately, it spawned out of tragedy but it is to be commended to the highest degree.  As I said, if there are any issues with which our guests want help they should feel free to contact the committee and we will do our best.  I give them a commitment we will contact the Minister as an Oireachtas committee to see how we can formalise funding for the organisation.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Department and the officials there have their own protocols and legislation.  They cannot always cross over the line informally to help families.  If that is something we as a charity within the sector can help with through a discussion with the Department, it is something we can discuss going forward.</p></speech>

On the model Embrace has, our guests are far more knowledgeable than anyone else about what is needed out there.  I do not think the Department or we as a committee are going to prescribe to our guests.  They know exactly what is needed and how to go about it.</p></speech>

I thank members for their good comments.  We were up here in the Seanad a few years ago.  I think Senator Paul Daly was there.  I am not sure if Senator Lombard was there.  Senator Conway proposed a discussion on farm safety.  I do not think much has happened with that proposal since.  I would like to think that moving forward now are getting serious.  We did think when Covid hit that farm accidents and fatalities would rise with children at home from school and perhaps daddy trying to home-school and farm and mammy on the front line and not there.  Thankfully however, numbers have dropped but one is one too many.  We need to look at that going forward.  Again, on behalf of Embrace FARM, I thank the committee for the invitation.</p></speech>

No apologies have been received.  Members in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practice good hand hygiene and leave at least one vacant seat between them and others attending.  They should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  I ask for the full co-operation of members in this regard.  I have been encouraging our members to dial in remotely if possible considering the high Covid numbers at present.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee I welcome from the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, Professor Niamh Moloney, chair, Mr. Colm O'Reardon, secretary, and Ms Sinead Ryan and Mr. Gary Hynds, principal officers of the secretariat.  I thank them all for attending today.  The purpose of today's meeting is to meet the newly formed commission.  The committee would also like to discuss the commission's remit, terms of reference and priorities for the coming year.</p> <p>  Before we begin I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and by statute, by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses today are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  They are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity the witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present in the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and in some cases this year the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, members who attempt to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  With that, we will begin our session.  There is huge interest in the work of the commission and I am sure there will be over the coming years.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance today.  I ask Professor Moloney to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am delighted to have this opportunity to come before the committee.  I thank the committee for the invitation to appear on behalf of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  As per the invitation, my opening remarks will focus on the remit of the commission, its terms of reference and our priorities for the coming year.</p> <p>  The commission was established by Government and commenced its work in June 2021, with the objective, as set out in our terms of reference, to "independently consider how best the taxation and welfare systems can support economic activity and promote increased employment and prosperity, while ensuring that there are sufficient resources available to meet the costs of public services and supports in the medium and longer term".  The Government has asked us to report by July of next year.  As I will outline in a moment, the terms of reference for the commission are extensive.  While the commission got off to a good start and has held nine meetings so far with our tenth on Friday, we are still in the early stages of our deliberations.  I hope committee members will appreciate that we are a long way from reaching conclusions at this point in time.</p> <p>  The commission&rsquo;s remit covers both taxation and welfare but its outlook is firmly of a medium to long-term nature.  Our role is to stand back from the day-to-day debates on taxation and welfare and look at how well the tax and welfare systems are likely to fit the country&rsquo;s needs over the next ten to 20 years.  In doing so, we have been asked to consider factors such as the impact of the Covid-19 emergency, ageing demographics, digital disruption and automation, and the long-term strategic commitments of Government regarding health, housing and climate.  Members of the commission are drawn from a broad cross-section of relevant backgrounds, including taxation, welfare, economics, law and broader civil society, each bringing a mix of applicable skillsets and backgrounds to the table.  We are undertaking this work as an independent body, unencumbered by political pressures, stepping back and with a long-term perspective.</p> <p>  As well as this overall remit, as committee members will see from our terms of reference, the commission has been asked to look at a number of specific issues.  These include: ensuring there are sufficient resources available to meet the costs of public services into the future; supporting economic activity and income redistribution while promoting increased employment and prosperity; and examining what changes, if any, should be made to the social insurance system.  Also included is examining how welfare policy can work in tandem with the taxation system to support economic activity while continuing to support those most vulnerable in our society in a fair and equitable way.  The terms of reference also include examining how the taxation system can be used to help Ireland move to a low carbon economy, the appropriate role for the taxation and welfare system in achieving housing policy objectives including an examination of the merits of a site value tax.  The commission's terms of reference also include: examining Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness to foreign direct investment; the taxation environment for SMEs and entrepreneurs; the role of taxation and welfare in promoting good public health; the process for reviewing taxation measures and expenditures; and tax administration.  As members know, and as provided for in the terms of reference, we are also being asked to look at some of the revenue-raising proposals as set out in the recent report of the Commission on Pensions.</p> <p>  As committee members can see, this is a challenging agenda but it is an important one.  Our terms of reference reflect the central role that taxation and welfare play in our society.  The taxation and welfare systems make up some of the most significant and regular interactions between individuals and the State and define, in large part, the nature of the relationship between the State and the individual.  The tax and welfare systems are, accordingly, at the crux of the relationship between the State and the individual.  They are part but not the totality of the wider social contract, which is the set of rights and mutual obligations that come with living in Ireland.</p> <p>  Put simply, the taxation system provides the investment we make as individuals and as businesses for the public services we use, from our roads and bridges to our hospitals and schools.  For those of us at working age, our social welfare system serves to temporarily replace income lost to periods of unemployment, injury, disability, sickness or maternity.  Where earnings from employment are insufficient to avoid poverty or social exclusion, our system intervenes to provide a floor below which income will not fall and, of course, the social welfare system provides a core income for those in retirement.  Together, these are the most important instruments that we have to provide a safety net, to provide income redistribution and to pay for the needs of our society.  We have all seen over the course of the pandemic how crucial the tax and welfare systems have been in supporting families and businesses that have been so badly affected by the public health measures that had to be taken.</p> <p>  Our role, as I said, is to take a medium to long-term view.  This is, in essence, a strategic exercise in that we are being asked to stand back and look at systems as they are, the challenges ahead and to consider what changes are needed for the future.</p><p>Not least among these challenges is that of fiscal sustainability.  The primary function of the tax system is to fund Government expenditure at a level determined by the democratic system.  While the fiscal position will improve as the Covid-19 pandemic subsides, the public finances will face significant structural challenges in the medium to long term.  Of these, costs associated with demographic change are the most certain, with an ageing population putting pressure on pension and health costs.  While there are currently four working age people to support every person above 65, in 2050 the equivalent ratio will be 2:1.  This will place significant pressure on the public finances, even if just to provide the existing level of services.  Costs associated with the climate and digital transitions will also need to be funded.  It is vital therefore, that we think strategically now about the changes that might be needed to the tax and welfare systems in the future so that we can rise to these challenges and begin to prepare.<br/><br/>Each of the elements of the terms of reference represents an important issue which must be borne in mind when thinking about how the tax and welfare systems should be structured into the future.  What is crucially important, however, is that we think about these systems as systems.  How well do these systems as a whole hang together and meet the needs of our country?  The commission will examine each of these items in turn but that holistic viewpoint is also central to our work.<br/><br/>I mention our public consultation.  This engagement, which I value greatly, is particularly timely as the commission launched its public consultation entitled Your Vision, Our Future on 20 October.  This public consultation differs in a number of important ways from previous such exercises.  It is hosted on <i>cotw.citizenspace.com</i>, which is an online platform used by hundreds of government bodies worldwide.  This is a truly accessible, sophisticated and in-depth public consultation which complies with the web content accessibility guidelines.  In order to ensure we cast our net widely we have advertised on print, social and outdoor advertising platforms, ensuring that as many people as possible have an opportunity to make a submission.  Since the launch of the consultation we have already received 24 submissions.  This level of interest, even at this early stage of our work, is most heartening, as is the invitation to attend the committee to discuss this important undertaking.  Following the public consultation, the commission plans to undertake further stakeholder engagement events early next year to further explore themes and matters arising.  All of us have a stake in the taxation and welfare systems.  The committee members, as public representatives have unique insights into the views of the people they represent.  I greatly value the opportunity to meet members and I look forward to a fruitful and positive exchange over the course of the session.</p></speech>

It was not by accident that we asked to meet with it at this point because we would like to engage with the commission as much as possible throughout the process.</p></speech>

There is a broad task ahead and I appreciate that a huge volume of work is involved.  I understand that the commission has met up to nine times already and that it is aiming to report in July.  Is Professor Moloney satisfied that the commission is still on target for that July deadline with the volume of work that is ahead?  I mention the submissions the commission is receiving and the public consultation.  The interest groups will find whatever way they can to express their views to the commission whereas Professor Moloney mentioned 24 submissions to the public consultation.  Who is the commission getting the submissions from?  Are they from the general public or from those interest groups?  What level of engagement is the commission expecting to get from the general public?  They are the reason for the commission to be in place so is the commission getting engagement and input from the public?  How long has that engagement been run for up to now?</p> <p>  Professor Moloney referred to rights and obligations that come with living in Ireland.  Is she confining her terms of reference to those who are living here or is she looking beyond to those who might be trading through here or conducting business here?  Those people are also generating income through Ireland.</p> <p>  I mention the commission's outlook for the next ten to 20 years and Professor Moloney refers to demographics and other factors that might have an influence.  Is the commission confining itself to a 26-county republic when it looks to the 20 years ahead or is it looking at possibilities beyond that, including a 32-county republic?  I take the point that the commission is not wearing any political colours but is it looking at the possibilities that are out there?</p></speech>

I appreciate his comments and questions.  I thank the Deputy for acknowledging the scale of the task.  We have big, demanding and challenging terms of reference.  All of us on the commission have a sense of excitement and serious endeavour.  Commissions do not come along too often; we are the fourth that has come about over a long period of time and so we feel a strong sense of moment.  We have had an extraordinary year and a half by any measure in what the nation has been through and the different jobs the tax and welfare systems did in that time.  It is a key moment to have this chance to stand back and take a strategic look at those systems.</p> <p>  We have clear terms of reference, which is always helpful.  We have an overarching objective in what we are doing to ensure the tax and welfare systems effectively promote economic activity, support prosperity and employment and do so in a way that is resilient, stable and sustainable in supporting the public service.  We have a clear framework for that and within that we have the different elements of the terms of reference.  From the outset we have been conscious of this privilege, charge and responsibility.  A lot of thought has gone into work planning and we are clear about what we need to do, by when we need to get there and we are fortunate to have an excellent secretariat that supports us in doing that.  We are meeting every fortnight or so, which is keeping a good sense of momentum for our work going.  I feel a strong sense of confidence that we will deliver and it is my expectation that we will do so.  We want a credible, serious and practical report that we can deliver to the Minister by next July.  It is great to have an opportunity like we have this evening to have a preliminary discussion with the committee about how the terms of reference work.</p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for his interest in our consultation.  We are very excited about this and it is a key part of what we are doing.  As chair of the commission, I feel that tax and welfare are the two critical points that we interact with all of the time as households and businesses and as a society.  These are the two big vectors through which we interact with the State.  It is fundamental that we carry out a serious consultation that reaches beyond the more usual engagements and gets out to speak to people.  The 24 submissions we have received so far are from members of the general public, which is great.  We will keep an eye on this and continue to watch the consultation submissions that come through.</p><p>We will do another round of reminding the public as it goes through.  The consultation process is being promoted on bus shelters, social media and print media.  We want to hear from everybody.  Social welfare and taxation affects us all very heavily.  Of course, there is a role for our major stakeholders, our major constituencies, and they will be feeding into our consultation.  However, we view this consultation as fundamental.  Hence, our online platform is organised to be accessible and easy to navigate for the wider world at large.</p><p> I thank the Deputy for his helpful observations on our wider framework and the areas we might be examining.  We are looking at the tax and welfare systems as they support economic activity, public services and welfare in Ireland.  Tax is an extremely complex matter.  It involves all those international interactions and engagement.  We have seen in recent months just how important that international interaction is.  We are aware of tax as a very dynamic complex system that interacts in many different ways, internationally, domestically and with the EU, across different kinds of tax bases.  That is the great value of a stand-back review.  One can look at the system with all its different interactions internationally, domestically and so on.</p><p> One aspect that is perhaps different for our commission compared to others are issues related to different ways of working.  As a consequence of the pandemic, people are working in all sorts of different ways.  That is a wider frame, which is part of what a commission of our nature would find useful to examine.</p><p> In looking towards the future, it behoves a commission like ours to think around corners as it were, whatever those corners may be, internationally, domestically or regionally.  I do not think any of us could have predicted 20 years ago the major disruption to the nature of work that has occurred.  National tax might have evolved.  We take very seriously an element of foresight to how we think.  The commission at the start of its deliberations was very concerned to equip itself fully to think around corners.  We are very anxious to think consistently and strategically about the future.  For example, how do we think about the future, how do we recognise opportunities and how we recognise threats and challenges and so on?  We are taking a very wide-angle lens when it comes to all the different variables that might shape our tax and welfare systems into the future.  I very much appreciate the Deputy's interest and thank him for his comments, which are helpful to us in thinking about our work.</p></speech>

I am sorry I missed her opening statement, which I read earlier.  Second Stage of the Finance Bill is being dealt with at the same time as this meeting and I am trying to be in a number of locations at the same time.  I welcome Professor Moloney's opening statement and the commission's broad terms of reference, which are broader than those of previous commissions given the issues of welfare that come under its remit which it needs to consider.</p> <p>  I apologise if any of my questions have already been answered.  If so, Professor Moloney can bypass them and I will read the transcript of the proceedings later.  The commission has a wider remit than previous commissions.  How will that remit be dealt with by the commission?  The commission is to report by 1 July next year.  Does it expect to meet that deadline?  I am sure Professor Moloney will say it does at this stage.  More importantly, will the report be just given to the Minister or will the commission publish it at that stage?  The previous commission's report, which extended to 600 pages and contained much detail and analysis, was quite significant.</p> <p>  I have another question on the public consultation exercise and the user-friendly platform the commission has used, which I have not used but I will have a look at it.  How does Professor Moloney expect the public consultation exercise will shape the priorities of the commission as it carries out its work?  That brings me to my next question on the wide remit of the commission covering areas, such as the climate challenge we face, which were not under consideration when the previous commission reported.  We had a different crisis in terms of housing at that time; there was possibly an oversupply then but now there is a major undersupply.  The commission has to deal with issues in terms of tax expenditure, public health and the social welfare system.  How does Professor Moloney define the priorities in all of that as the commission carries out its work over the coming months?</p></speech>

I am very conscious of how busy their schedule is, particularly this evening.  I thank Deputy Doherty for his questions.  I will reply to them in the order in which he asked them.  Regarding the commission's wide remit, it has very extensive terms of reference.  I am appreciative to the Deputy for noticing that.  When we stand back and think strategically about something as fundamental and significant as the tax and welfare systems and how they interact, we need a big canvas.  We need to be able to stand back and see this as a system and how it all interacts together.  While in some respects, it is very big and almost even somewhat daunting, in other respects it reminds us of the scale of the canvas it operates on and the number of ways in which it interacts back into society.  This is not just tax in terms of a code; it is tax and welfare.  It impacts the environment, health, incentives to work and the smallest of SMEs.  The very scale of it reminds us of just how fundamental this kind of exercise is.  We all welcome it.  We welcome the scale of it and the picture it is requiring us to paint in terms of how the tax and welfare systems work together.</p> <p>  We really feel a sense of responsibility.  It is a big exercise to set up a commission, resource it and have a secretariat.  Governments do not do it very often.  We feel this is a very serious opportunity to stand back.  It is the fourth time there has been this kind of exercise.  We aim to do a serious, strategic, evidenced-based piece of work that lives up to this.  My hope and expectation is that we will report by July.  To do that, we need to be organised, systematic and serious about what we are doing and that is how we are operating.  We have a fantastic commission, comprising 14 members, who bring with them a great deal of experience and expertise and great enthusiasm and energy as well as a terrific secretariat.  We meet roughly every two weeks.  We will have our 10th meeting on Friday and we will try to keep that momentum up.  Our work is focusing us very closely.  I agree with the Deputy that we have a big challenge.  We have a responsibility to make sure we do this as effectively as possible.</p> <p>  The report will go the Minister and then it will be published.  Part of our job as a commission is to think seriously and deeply and come up with practical and useful recommendations, but there is an element in which it is helpful to outline and communicate what tax and welfare do, why the systems are set up the way they are and what shaped them.  It is very important there is publication of a report of this nature.</p> <p>  That brings me to the Deputy&rsquo;s second question on the consultation exercise and the platform we have used.  We view this as very important for a number of reasons.  The last year and a half has shown us the importance of the way we support each other and what we owe each other, and how the tax and welfare systems work together to make that happen.  That has been one of the significant lessons for us during the past year and half.  Even during the past ten years, there has been so much change in our society and economy.</p><p>This is a real moment.  We have a reason, a context and resources, as an independent body, to talk to people.  That is very important because this is a key vector through which individuals interact with tax and welfare, hence the platform.  With regard to the feedback, the commission members and I strongly believe there must be feedback when people take the time to speak to us and work their way through the consultation questions, whether just one - which is absolutely fine - or all of them.  It is iterative.  That will be coming through.  We will look at the reaction we are getting.  It is very important that the consultation reaches as widely as possible.  It is our job, as a commission, to feed that into our deliberations, to get a sense of what is coming through and what people are worried about and to determine how that can shape our work.  We are planning some kind of stakeholder event for early in the new year, perhaps in January or February.  That will be a useful point.  We will be further advanced in our deliberations and the public consultation will be closing in January.  This will be a useful staging point to take stock.  We see it as absolutely fundamental.</p><p> On the width of the remit and how things have changed, Deputy Doherty mentioned the housing crisis, prioritisation and how we frame our work.  I will offer a few reflections on these matters.  It is a good time to stand back and take this strategic long-term view because one thing is absolutely clear, namely, that the constant dynamic challenge faced by tax and welfare systems is enormous and has been over the last ten years.  The Deputy rightly mentioned the housing crisis.  This is a very significant issue.  Going back ten years, we had other crises.  We now have the pandemic.  That is the nature of the modern economy.  It is not static.  There is always something shaping circumstances that we need to react to.  This is a chance to stand back and take a systemic strategic look at the system to ensure it is best equipped for the future.  My academic work is in the area of financial regulation and I often fall into the notion of stress-testing.  Who knows what challenges may arise?  We know what some of them are but we must think about the system to ensure it is best equipped to deal with them.</p><p> With regard to our priorities, we have terms of reference which closely guide what we do.  My overall priority is to ensure we produce a report that is coherent, evidence-based and strategic and which responds to what the Government has asked us to consider.</p></speech>

I wish Professor Moloney really well on her work.  While we may not agree with some of the recommendations and may be delighted with others, the important thing is that we have evidence-based research.  I have a couple of final questions before my time runs out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.106" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#D00300"><p>Deputy Doherty is welcome to come in with a couple of questions but he is well over time so I ask him to keep them short.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#D00400"><p>I will keep them very short.  Is the commission going to look at international experience?  For example, employers' PRSI here is way below what is required.  That brings me to my second question.  The commission has been asked to look at long-term commitments from the Government but governments change.  Some parties want to see a bigger State and greater State involvement while others want to see more of the lifting done by the private sector.  Will the commission look beyond current Government commitments?</p> <p>  My third and final question relates to the expert group on childcare which has been established.  The Department is publishing papers as it goes along.  The final report will consider recommendations and so on but research papers are being published to inform the debate and discussion as we go along.  I looked at the minutes of one of the commission's meetings and they indicated that the commissioning of a number of papers on tax expenditures and tax levers for public health was being considered.  It is really important that those papers be published as the commission goes along with its work.  Obviously, there would still be a final report which would cover the commission's analysis and final recommendations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.108" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Niamh Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#D00500"><p>I will be as quick as I can in responding.  I thank the Deputy for noting the international context.  There is value for this kind of exercise in looking at what other international systems are doing.  I will make a couple of observations in that regard.  The extent to which there are great debates about very similar issues and questions in so many places internationally right now is interesting.  It behoves us to look at these international debates.  We must always be very conscious of context.  Debates, particularly debates on tax and welfare, happen in very distinct local, cultural and institutional contexts.  In drawing and learning from international experience, we have always been very careful about how it is imported and about learning the right kind of lessons.  Considering the international context is the kind of value a commission like this can bring.</p> <p>  The Deputy's second point related to interacting with different governmental perspectives about the role of the State and so on.  Our view is that we are a technocratic commission and that it is our job to stand back, think about the systems and take a ten, 15 or 20-year perspective.  That is our job.  Once we have delivered on that, the political and democratic system steps in.  We hope and aim for our report to be a credible and resilient resource over the long term.  We want it to be something that can be used by the people of Ireland over a good timeframe and a resilient resource for the future.</p> <p>  With regard to the papers, at the moment, we are publishing our minutes because it is very important that the public has a good sense of how we are approaching matters.  Along with our consultation document, we prepared a primer document with data and discussion on different tax bases.  That aimed to support our consultation.  The research papers will feed into our ultimate report in different ways.  The data and so on we will be using will be available in the report in due course.  That will form part of the report in July.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#D00600"><p>I thank Professor Moloney.  I am sorry for hesitating; I was just making sure I was giving her the correct title.  I also thank her team and wish the commission good luck.  It is welcome.  I apologise that I will also have to run over and speak in the debate on the Finance Bill.  It is an interesting contrast in a way because the Finance Bill comprises lots of individual measures relating to different headings such as income tax, USC, corporation tax, property-based taxes and so on.  It comprises lots of individual measures.  It might be argued that there is no strategic debate going on in respect of the Finance Bill and the taxation measures it contains.  That happens to some degree in a budget but in the context of a particular year and particular political pressures.  Some questions never get discussed having stood back from those things, so this is a good initiative.</p> <p>  I would like to quiz Professor Moloney a little bit more about how she sees the commission doing that and the extent to which she thinks it is possible to have evidence-based views when many of the issues are heavily contested, not least by the people they affect.  The submissions of the people are evidence in and of themselves.  With the best will in the world, it strikes me that great numbers of those who are most economically disadvantaged are among those least likely to even know this is happening and will not be terribly well-equipped to engage with it.  Does Professor Moloney accept that is a concern and that it is something we must address?  How do we get the voices of those who are generally not heard on issues like taxation and what taxation should be there for and welfare and what welfare should achieve heard when it will tend to be - for want of a better word - the political nerds and the people who know about these things who make submissions?</p><p>One thing I said about public consultations in a slightly different context is that we should advertise these public consultations.  There should be radio advertisements to the effect that a serious look is being taken at tax and welfare in this country, what they are for, how fair they are and whether members of the public think they are working for them.  We should be advertising those public consultations.  Of course, if we did that, we probably would get many submissions.  There would be many more than a couple of hundred.  Then, there would be even more work on the hands of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  I want to run that by Professor Moloney because there is a danger in any public consultation that the voices that are often not heard will not be heard again, even with the best will in the world.</p><p> Will Professor Moloney quickly state what she sees as the role of the committee in this process?  Is today the day for us to give suggestions as to what we think?  I do not think we have time today.  However, most people in our committee and possibly some other committees would like to have a discussion about the big strategic questions on tax and welfare that need to be addressed, as well as on our views about how they should be addressed.  Professor Moloney might say a word about that.  To give a couple of examples, wealth taxes need to be discussed.  They happen in some places.  They have generally been resisted in this country.  However, there is a real debate about them.  It is a debate that is also relevant to the climate debate at the moment.  To give a big bold statement, unless you deal with the gross and growing inequality in wealth and income across the world, you will not address the climate emergency.  I put it up as bluntly as that.  Not everybody shares that opinion but I am convinced of that.  It is a pretty undisputed fact that the 1%, as they are famously called, although you could call them the 10%, own 50% or 60% of the wealth in this country.  Those figures are generally repeated around the world.  The bottom 50% have 2% or less of the wealth between them.  Unless you address that, I cannot see how you could address the climate emergency.  Will the commission look at that sort of thing?  What are the serious arguments?  Does Professor Moloney feel that at the end of the process, the commission will be able take a position on things like that? </p><p> To give another example, I looked at the Commission on Taxation and Welfare's survey.  The witnesses might respond to my belief that it is a little bit loaded in respect of the local property tax and the site value tax.  First, I still struggle to fully understand what a site value tax is, in comparison with the local property tax.  I imagine that many other people would too.  There are also other options that are not considered in that binary question the commission is asking.  I favour a multiple property tax for the non-principal private residences.  I bet that were people asked whether those with multiple properties should be taxed on their property wealth, as against those who just have the family home, a majority would probably state that would be fairer.  Why is that question not asked?  Should it be asked or will the Commission on Taxation and Welfare ask it?  That is just another example.  There are some things that might not even occur to people unless one puts the facts in front of them.  </p><p> One thing that greatly struck me, when looking at tax in the run-up to the most recent budget, particularly in the aftermath of Covid-19, is that corporate profits went through the roof.  This followed a consistent pattern over recent years, although it seemed to be even be more pronounced during Covid-19.  I believe this year pre-tax corporate profits were &euro;203 billion.  That is approximately 127% more than they were a decade ago.  They pay approximately &euro;11 billion in tax.  All of the workers in this country together earn &euro;127 billion.  This figure is a little bit more than half of what the corporations earned.  However, the workers paid &euro;27 billion in tax.  To me, that is a radical disparity between the corporate sector making huge profits and making much smaller tax contributions relative to its profit income, as against workers who have less income between all of them but who pay a much higher proportion in tax in both absolute and relative terms.  Are those sorts of issues going to be addressed, discussed and put to people?  There are a few questions there.  I can think of a lot more.  </p></speech>

Again, we appreciate the engagement of the committee with us this evening.  I thank the Deputy for his rich observations.  I will take them in order as best I can.</p> <p>  The first point the Deputy mentioned was on evidence base.  To be sure I was clear on this issue, we will be producing papers as we go along and we will publish all of those at the end.  Once our final report is published, we will also publish the different papers that have informed our work.  We are keen to take an evidence-based approach and to show colleagues, as well as to everybody affected, how we went about our decision-making.  </p> <p>  The Deputy makes a good point about consultations.  They are tricky things.  On the one hand, we do them to try to engage as many voices as possible, including small businesses, households and individuals.  We do this to try to capture as diverse a range of opinions as possible.  When one considers that the last time this exercise was done, which was ten or 12 years ago, we did not have these kinds of tools.  It was difficult to get wide-ranging public consultations.  Digitalisation has made all of this so much more possible.  However, I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about how to engage with as wide a group of people as possible.  On a purely functional level, we are using all different kinds of outreach and different kinds of media.  </p> <p>  A point I should mention is that we have all sorts of expertise and experience around the table at the commission.  There is a strong, collective commitment to ensure that systems of tax and welfare are fair and equitable to the most vulnerable in society.  That is expressly called out in our terms of reference.  Additionally, as a group, we are all deeply conscious of the importance of the two systems of tax and welfare and how they interact.  That interaction is particularly important for those who are most vulnerable in our society.  We are hoping to have as broad an outreach as possible.  We as a commission hold that close in our deliberations, as well as in how we approach these different issues.  We are conscious of that.  </p> <p>  Our engagement with the Deputy is hugely valuable, as is this whole exercise this evening.  From my perspective, and I am sure I am speaking on behalf of the commission, this interaction with the committee is extremely valuable.  We would be hugely appreciative if Deputies were available to respond to our consultation and, of course, in respect of any bilateral engagement.  Were Deputies able to write into the commission, we would be delighted to learn from submissions they and their colleagues may make.  We value that greatly.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the scale of the issues, as well as the great debate that is necessary about some of these big questions.  The Deputy mentioned wealth tax and the link between inequality, the just transition and the huge carbon challenge that we are all facing.  He mentioned property tax and site value tax.  In some ways, that shows the scale of what we are dealing with.  On the one hand, there are huge choices about how one designs a tax system.  What bases does one use?  Who is taxed, depending on what those bases are?  The bases could be income, consumption, or different sources of wealth.  Then one devolves right into the seemingly technical but really important questions about how local property tax is designed.  How is something like a site value tax designed?  How is some other tax designed?</p><p>Our job is to stand back and try to make sure the technical design choices fit within a coherent system that supports economic activity, prosperity and employment while also ensuring we are protecting the most vulnerable through the big decisions we make about how the tax and welfare systems work.  These are big debates that are happening internationally.  Even in recent weeks, the Biden Administration had a very big debate on the role of a wealth tax and how it might be designed.  There are big debates in the UK right now.  The UK has a commission on wealth taxation.  There are big debates on the role of public health and taxation.  For our commission, these are big questions but we are in the right place at the right time.  There are very big debates internationally &ndash; generational debates &ndash; on what we owe one another in society and how we express what we owe one another, whether it is through paying our taxes or supporting those who are vulnerable through a welfare system.  We very much embraced the opportunity to stand back and have a serious debate on the role of the various taxes and how they support welfare and interact and to examine strategically the technical components of the system.  If they are not working together correctly, it feeds back into the overall design of the system.</p><p> We very much welcome the engagement of the Deputy and all his colleagues on the committee.  By way of making a small footnote, we have already found significantly helpful the committee's 2019 report on the review of tax expenditure, for example.  We will very much welcome further engagement by members and thank them in advance for it.</p></speech>

To what extent does the commission envisage itself making recommendations on what should be adopted after it has considered the climate crisis and various taxes, such as wealth tax, property-based taxes and corporate tax, and having examined the evidence and listened to the public?  Does Professor Moloney envisage the commission recommending a wealth tax or saying the corporations are paying too little or too much? I hope the commission will not argue they are paying too much.</p></speech>

We are absolutely in the business of making serious, practical, evidence-based recommendations that we very much hope will stand the test of time and be sustainable over ten, 15 or 20 years.  We absolutely want to make a serious contribution to how public policy works in this country as regards tax and welfare.  Our mission is to produce specific recommendations.  We are aiming to have recommendations that are credible, coherent and evidence based.  We are animated by the sense that we can make a serious contribution and make recommendations for the political process to work with.  We take this with the utmost seriousness.</p></speech>

One of our terms of reference requires us to consider the balance of taxation in respect of earned income, consumption and wealth.  The question of how the various bases work together forms a logical part of any stand-back analysis of a tax system.  One of the points that is important when examining a tax system as a whole concerns all the various sources of income, wealth and consumption.  There are different ways of thinking about taxes on sources of wealth, such as property tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and DIRT.  It is a matter of thinking about the various sources through which tax operates, about whether taxes are operating effectively as possible and about whether the right levers are being pulled in the right place, having learned from international experience.  There are very big debates internationally on all this right now.  We will absolutely be taking seriously the big questions on how tax systems should be designed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#F00600"><p>I thank the professor and all her team.  There are very interesting conversations going on.  I want to concentrate on a few principles.  Professor Moloney talked about social welfare and taxation.  The main challenge I see in our country is ensuring that work pays.  It needs to be the case that people are better off when working so they can pay for whatever is required, be it childcare or otherwise, rather than having circumstances in which the difference between going to work and staying at home and not working is marginal.  Work that pays is a vital cog in the economy.  If we are to have a sustainable economy, we need to make it attractive for people to go to work.  The margins are too thin now.  Increasing pay might be an obvious approach but that decreases our competitiveness.  It is in the area of taxation that we need to consider this.</p> <p>  Let me address the other areas I am concerned about.  We tax people.  We must do the analysis to see whether we are extracting tax from people, businesses and other sources &ndash; it is all coming from people &ndash; in a fair way, and whether we are allocating the revenue, through social payments, in a fair and reasonable way.</p> <p>  One of my bones of contention is business premises having to pay rates regardless of whether they are profitable.  I am not talking about multinational companies but ordinary people in towns and villages.  We have got into circumstances in which local authorities are relying heavily on rates.  They are a tax on business as opposed to a tax on profit or turnover.  They are paid in accordance with the size of one's premises.  It is very much a draconian approach in that when somebody sets up a business, the tax is foisted on that business.  In many cases, businesses say they do not get a return for paying rates.</p> <p>  When taxing people, be they the super wealthy, business people or others, there is always a tipping point beyond which they would be overtaxed.  How can that be managed?  What are the commission's comments on that and my other views?  It is time that a commission examined taxation and social welfare.  We should not be waiting for this; it should be done regularly, such as every five years, to inform politicians and policy on how we perform.</p> <p>  I like Professor Moloney's freshness.  She is clear in her mind on what she is going to be dealing with and recommending.  I like that and compliment her on it.</p></speech>

It is very helpful for me to have this interaction with the Deputy and all his colleagues.  I appreciate it, particularly because I am aware that the committee has a very busy schedule this evening.</p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising a very distinct part of the job of the 2021 Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  A distinctive feature that has not been a feature of other commissions so far is the focus on the interaction between the tax system, incentives that make it worthwhile to work, the welfare system and all the various incentives along that chain.</p><p>Our terms of reference bring us right back to supporting economic activity, and prosperity and employment, while also being very cognisant of those who are most vulnerable in society and taking a fair and equitable approach.  This is something that is novel and we embrace it.  As the Deputy said, it is in that interaction that we are at the crux of the issues of prosperity, economic incentives and supporting people in the best possible way.  It is something we are looking at and taking very seriously.  </p><p> There are many different facets to this, including the points of interaction between when it is worthwhile to work, given the return from work, the different forms of tax charge and the point at which they activate.  These are technical issues but they are very important.  For someone who is going to work and moving from one threshold or rate to another, it is very important we have the mandate to look at that, the impact it has, how those different rates, bands and thresholds all fit together and how they feed back into our terms of reference of supporting our prosperity and the economy.  I very much welcome that part of our terms of reference.  The comments the Deputy made in that regard are very valuable and I thank him for them.</p><p>Regarding the issues of business premises and rates, one of the themes undercutting our terms of reference, alongside the interaction between tax and welfare, is the interaction between much of the tax code and smaller businesses and SMEs because we run the gamut on that.  On tax administration, for example, it is very important for small businesses that the tax system is navigable and not overly complex and that the administration of it works effectively.  Equally, and some of the statistics are very stark for small businesses, 91% of all businesses employ fewer than ten people.  That is the absolute beating heart of our economy so it is very important the tax system is cognisant of that and reflects those sorts of challenges in allowing small businesses to grow in scale and to start.</p><p> A whole ecosystem sits around that, from corporation tax through to income tax, different reliefs and the commercial rates system and how it works.  Again, it is this sense that, for a small business and the system within which it sits, whether it is the tax wedge that applies as it pays its employees, how the commercial rates system works or the administration of the tax system as it engages with it, these are all very important matters for us to look at holistically.  We need to stand back and ensure, especially for smaller businesses and entrepreneurs, that all this is working effectively.  I thank the Deputy for his comments.  They are well noted and will be very helpful for us as we go forward.</p></speech>

We sometimes bring in systems that do not always suit everybody and we need to be able to tailor them.  Even at the moment, I see individuals trying to pay the local property tax and if there is a glitch in the system, they just cannot move with it.</p> <p>  To give an example, we have set up very sophisticated ways of dealing with procurement to try to save money.  Sometimes I believe we have created an industry called procurement without actually saving money.  We have just transferred costs from the base price of the product to the procurement system.  The cost of procurement is such now that smaller companies, if they are to compete, have to have in-house expertise in procurement or they have to buy it in.  That is something that gets lost when we bring in systems.  What is the cost of running these systems within small companies?  It is just another part of it.  I wish the commission well and I look forward to working with it over the coming months.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Moloney and her team for everything they have been doing.  We are very aware that the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from 2030.  Will the commission consider other ways of replacing the inevitable loss of revenue?  What are Professor Moloney's early thoughts on how we would best do this?</p></speech>

I am very conscious that all the Deputies have a very busy evening so I very much appreciate them being with us.  I thank them for that.  The Deputy has asked a very important and interesting question.  Over the past ten years or so, there has been a real concern, globally, not just in Ireland, to address the enormous generational challenge of climate change.  We see it this week with COP26 but there has also been a long slow burn in that our tax system has been adjusting to reflect this and to better nudge our behaviour.  Sustainability issues then arise regarding the revenue streams coming through from certain forms of tax base.  This is called out specifically in our terms of reference.  We are very glad to have that because this is a key issue.  It feeds back into our overall terms of reference, which are ultimately there to make sure the State has sufficient revenue to provide the public services and supports that are fundamental to us as a nation.</p> <p>  On some of the numbers, if the rate of electric car uptake, for example, continues as one hopes, we are looking at a revenue hole in the region of &euro;1.5 billion by 2030.  On the one hand, the incentives are doing a very good job but, on the other hand, they are opening up a sustainability issue.  We are very conscious of that in our terms of reference.  It is too early in our deliberations to say how we might specifically address this, but we have a sense that it is important, ultimately, that public services in this country are funded not just for now but in the context of all the challenges we will face into the future.  We have a sustainability issue as regards certain taxation bases.  Looking into the future, we see the ageing demographic, which is one of the very big issues.  If we operate using our current services in terms of health, pensions and so on, something like &euro;17 billion extra will be needed by 2050.  We are acutely conscious of the sustainability question that arises on revenue.  Our job is to stand back, look at the system as a whole, check it is all working in the best possible way and as effectively as it should be, but to do this with a medium or long-term lens to see what best specific recommendations we can make in this regard.</p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue because it is one that is particular to where we are at this moment in time, having had this period during which we have been adjusting to a new way of using taxes.  It is now very important, as taxes become more effective, to consider how they loop and feed back into the wider sustainability question.</p></speech>

Will our current inflation rate have a bearing on the work the commission does?  If it does, how will it impact on that work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Niamh Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#G00600"><p>This really is one of the questions of the hour.  For the past number of weeks, there has been a debate on inflation, which has been important.  I will again go to the sense that our commission is looking at these questions at this moment in time, because five years ago inflation was not so much of an issue in considering how fiscal sustainability was to be addressed.</p><p>It is a very good reminder, and I thank the Deputy for it, of the scale of the certain and uncertain challenges that lie ahead.  It is very difficult to predict how inflation is going to go.  There are all sorts of different discussions and narratives around that.  It is part of a very dynamic picture that our tax and welfare systems are currently grappling with.  Our job is to factor that in and to be aware of all of the different headwinds that are coming over the medium to long term.  There is a difference between the immediate yearly budgetary cycle and the immediate pressures and the fluctuating odds, which is about five, ten or 15 years out.  The value of one's salary when taken home is fundamental to how tax and welfare works.  That is part of the framework within which we will be operating.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue this evening.</p></speech>

The floor is now open to anybody who would like to come in a second time.  Members can indicate if they wish to speak by raising a hand.  While they are thinking about, I have some questions for Professor Moloney.</p> <p>  My first question is on an issue that has come up previously at this committee and at the Joint Committee on Health.  We have talked a little today about health.  I note in the work of the committee thus far a discussion around the demographics challenge of providing suitable services into the future.  Does the commission have enough access to suitable data in terms of its work?  As a committee, we are aware that sometimes Ireland falls short on the provision of disaggregated data for the purposes of, for example, health service planning.  Has the commission come across that yet?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Niamh Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#H00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for that very good question.  It goes to something we are very conscious of doing, which is having an evidence base.  One of our challenges relates to longitudinal evidence.  We are trying to look out to 2030, 2040, 2050 in order to get a sense of the long-term pressures and so we are looking around corners.  We are benefiting from much of the Government evidence that is out there and we are drawing on international evidence.  For example, one of our terms of reference calls out good public health policy.  While this is an enormous challenge in some respects, particularly as regards poor diet and the challenges that creates, it is an issue that many of the major advanced economies are grappling with and so we are able to access policy debates from across Europe.  There are many debates going on about how different forms of welfare tax support might be structured to respond to public health challenges.  We are very conscious of having a strong evidence base.  We are lucky in that we have a very strong secretariat, that is very effective and nimble.  We would be very grateful for support across the Civil Service and Government for the type of data that would feed our discussions.  We are very thankful for the level of support we have received thus far, but it is something we are very conscious of.  We would be anxious to make sure that when we are making our recommendations we can support why we are going in certain directions.</p></speech>

I am mindful that the commission represents a group of experts in their field.  It no secret that during the negotiations there some issues that the coalition could not reach consensus on, including for the Green Party, a site value tax and a wealth tax.  That is, in part, the reason the commission was established and tasked with discussion of those issues.  In terms of the process, how easy is it for the commission, as experts, to bring forth particular issues?  Are all of the points of debate or the issues with which the commission will be dealing coming from the public consultation, the terms of reference as set out by the Government or is the commission easily able to table issues that it believes are important?</p></speech>

There are a couple of reflections I would make.  We are very conscious of working within our mandate.  It is a privilege to have been set up.  The commission's terms of reference guide its work, which we take with the utmost seriousness.  It is a very wide terms of reference.  That has great strengths in that it allows us, as a commission, to reflect widely and deeply and to challenge each other on how we think about tax and welfare from all of our different perspectives.  We certainly do not see it as limiting us.  It is very helpful in terms of setting our direction and framework and in ensuring we are looking in the right directions and producing something that will be of use to Governments into the future.  It allow us to have very productive and engaged discussions. </p> <p>  I feel very lucky to be working with the group of people who are on the commission.  We meet every two weeks, which is great.  We are working very closely and there is a wide range of expertise and experience around the table.  There is something else as well, namely, a great willingness on the part of everybody to engage regardless of the question.  This is a function of the fact of our terms of reference.  There is very important language therein about a fair and equitable approach, looking after the most vulnerable, supporting SMEs and bringing us back into the big framework about how tax and welfare supports economic activity, funds prosperity and ensures that we can support our public services.  Whatever our experience and background - there is a great deal of experience on the commission from all different areas - there is a common, collective sense that we all have a responsibility and stake as regards those very big issues.  To go to the question, that prompts wide and expansive debates.  We are discussing a very wide range of issues.</p></speech>

We have had a great deal of discussion today about the content of the commission and various types of taxes.  Will the commission also address the timing of taxes, the budgetary cycle and how it interacts with tax and welfare?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Niamh Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#H00800"><p>I thank the Chairman for the question.  Tax and welfare operate at two levels in some respects.  The budgetary cycle, which is an annual cycle, is a really important political process.  It debates and adopts the budget for the year and makes the choices for that year around spending, borrowing and how tax and welfare are going to work.  That is fundamental and critical to ourselves as a nation.  There is also that wider debate and discussion and choice about the bigger system, standing back from the immediate pressures that the Government or Parliament face in any given year and the short-term choices that have to be made about particular issues.  In terms of where we come in, cognisant of the types of issues, pressures, changes and dynamics that are out there, we put all of that into a melting pot and try to come up with menus, recommendations and options that will be resilient in ten, 15 or 20 years and that are there to be used by the political process in accordance with the needs and pressures that arise and the choices that need to be made at any given time.  We are very cognisant of it and we are conscious of what is going on in any particular budgetary cycle, but we come in at that wider point.</p></speech>

I do think that sometimes the budgetary cycle has an impact on the manner in which tax is implemented.  I would like to put that out there.  I am hopeful that in this Government cycle there will be significant progress on issues such as equality budgeting and well-being indicators.</p><p>I am thinking in particular of gender and diversity issues and considering them in terms of the impact tax has on particular groups.  Will that be part of the commission's remit?</p></speech>

In our kind of exercise where you are standing back and looking at the system, that is part of what we are doing.  We are looking at how different constituencies and cohorts are supported and protected by the tax member systems.  Society has evolved, and where we are now in 2021 is somewhat different from where other commissions on tax and welfare would have been over earlier periods.  It is very important for us to have that kind of lens on the society we are in and the society we are becoming, as it changes and as we look at how tax and welfare operate.</p></speech>

I must apologise to them as I was in the Chamber for the past hour and a half, and I have missed the discussion up to now.  I will ask the questions I had prepared but I may be repeating what has been said.  As I do not like people repeating themselves, the witnesses should feel free to say if they have already covered an issue.</p> <p>  One of the issues I am interested in is the analysis of taxation in this State and how the weight of taxation is broken down by taxes falling on labour versus capital.  In the former category, I refer to income tax, universal social charge, USC, etc., and in terms of tax on capital, there is corporation tax, capital gains tax, etc.  Globally, over the past 40 years, taxes on capital have been falling while tax on labour has been rising.  This kind of analysis in an Irish context could be very valuable.  The distribution of taxation is a pull-policy issue.  Legislators having such information would be really helpful in informing the debate.  Is that something the commission is looking at?</p></speech>

I appreciate it very much.  I thank Deputy Farrell for her reflections.  She raises a very important question.  It is exactly the kind of question that a commission like ours is best positioned to look at.  To do that kind of assessment, we need to stand back and take a longitudinal perspective.  We also need to look at other systems.  As Deputy Farrell mentioned, there are big debates around this right now.  In 2021, in terms of where we are right now, if you look around most advanced economies, they are debating how tax systems work and, as Deputy Farrell mentioned, what is the balance between current income and consumption and different sources of capital and wealth.  UCD does a huge amount of work in this area and it is coming out of the other universities also.  There is a very rich source of debate about this.  It is a great debate as to how we organise tax.  This is the kind of thing that it is appropriate for a body like ours to look at, in particular because we are the stand-back for the ten, 15 to 20 years, where the stress-testing body is not working.  Do we need to look here or there?  If we look there, how does that interact with what is sitting over there so the whole system is working sustainably?</p> <p>  Even though we have a broad term of reference, the timing at which we are looking at this is interesting.  We have seen huge debates in the US in the past two weeks.  The Biden Administration is looking at a very distinct form of tax on income levels that were stratospheric.  That is the kind of debate they are having.  It is important to be aware of the debate and why it is happening and what we can learn from it.  It is important that a commission of our nature looks across the different bases of taxation and how effectively they are working together.</p></speech>

I am annoyed that I missed the meeting up to now because it sounds like the committee had a very interesting debate.  I will probably look back on it.  Professor Moloney is correct that it is very interesting to see.  I love to look at how things are developing internationally and how the conversation is going.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett may have already mentioned this, because it is something he raises a lot.  He often says that tax expenditures act like a shadow budget.  It would be interesting to see what we spend every year on tax expenditures versus actual spending.  Will the commission be looking at that kind of analysis as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.142" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Niamh Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#J00700"><p>Absolutely.  Tax expenditures are a really important part of a tax system.  Since we are taking a systemic view, in my head I think of all these clocks that are interacting with each other, in terms of bases and expenditures and so on, and what we end up with as all the clocks are moving together.  Our terms of reference calls this out specifically, that we look at the process around which tax expenditures are reviewed.  This is a very important analysis for us.</p> <p>  It is striking that we have in the region of 180 tax expenditures.  They cost somewhere in the region of &euro;7 billion.  This is a core part of our tax system in the same way that the different bases are a core part of the tax system.  It is important that we stand back and look at the system for doing this, in terms of the data that feed into tax expenditures, the process through which they are reviewed, what objectives they are designed to achieve and what metrics we use to assess those objectives.  These are big questions.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the importance of the committee's work on this.  It is very useful for us to have the committee's 2019 report into the tax expenditure process, which made eight recommendations on how one could think about tax expenditures.  We are very grateful to have that.  This is a really important area.  In some respects, tax expenditures are very technical and specific, but what we need to do is to stand back and look at that as a system and how we can review and test them.  We will be looking at tax expenditures.  We are very grateful for the work done by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in this regard, and we look forward to reflecting on it very seriously.</p></speech>

Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and housekeeping matters.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or to engage otherwise in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks.  It is imperative to comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law that would impact on their evidence.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable.</p> <p>  For anyone watching the meeting, Members of the Oireachtas and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or of joining the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members participating via Teams to indicate and confirm that they are on the Leinster House campus.  If members are attending in the committee room, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are advised of the good practices in terms of using masks and sanitisers.</p> <p>  With the formalities over, I am pleased to invite Ms Boix Alonso to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am very honoured to join the members in this meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, in particular, to speak about this very important subject of cybersecurity.<br/><br/>The Commission President, Dr. von der Leyen expressed it well in her state of the Union address on 15 September when she said that &quot;If everything is connected, everything can be hacked.&quot;  In recent times, unfortunately, we have witnessed the hacking of the Colonial Pipeline in the US, the Solarwinds incident, the ransomware attack on the IT supplier, Kaseya, and, of course, one that the members are all very well aware of, the massive cyberattack on the Irish Health Service Executive precisely at a very bad moment which was in the middle of fighting a worldwide pandemic.  This, unfortunately, according to our figures, will not diminish.  According to the European Union Agency for Cyber Security, ENISA, so-called &quot;supply-chain attacks&quot;, which are very difficult to fight regardless of how many measures you are taking in your own company or administration because they come from someone else in the supply chain, will multiply by four this year and attacks on cloud infrastructure have increased fivefold in one year.  You have seen also the increase of ransomware attacks.  Some studies state that they have increased by 60%.  Others give a higher figure.  This is the reason the <i>status quo</i>is not an option.  Basically, what we have been doing until now is clearly not sufficient because the attacks keep on increasing, and the impact keeps on increasing as well.  Sometimes you would believe there are no limits for the hackers.  They just attack everything.<br/><br/>This is why the Commission, in December of last year, came with a strategy to reinforce what we have now and to make sure that citizens and business are protected, both online and offline.  This strategy, which was adopted by the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy together, was presented at the same time because it is part of the Network and Information Security Directive, a reform of our NIS directive.  The strategy provides, from our point of view, a fresh vision and plan for cybersecurity to deal with the challenges we are facing.  The idea is to build resilience and ensure we can all benefit from digital technologies because digital technologies promise a lot of things.  Of course, if they are not cybersecure, none of the benefits of digital technologies will be available to citizens and businesses.  Building upon what we already have in place, the strategy focuses on three main angles.  The first angle is to build resilience, so-called &quot;technological sovereignty&quot; and leadership.  The second angle is to build operational capacity so that it is not only about making sure we are protected and are resilient, but that we have a capacity to act, whether it is to prevent, to deter or to respond to large-scale cyberattacks, in particular.  Lastly, of course, the international dimension is extremely important and advancing a global and open cyberspace through increased co-operation is also important.<br/><br/>For each of these pillars, there are concrete actions.  I will not go through all of them because there is no time.  As I mentioned already, an important pillar of building resilience is the NIS 2 directive, which is currently being negotiated in the Parliament and the Council of the EU.</p><p>We hope that the trilogues will start as soon as possible.  The main objective was to build on the success of the NIS directive and go beyond that by enlarging the scope in order that more sectors can be covered by or subject to the obligations of this directive, ensuring that the rules are clear and that there are stronger supervision tools.  That is the main objective behind the NIS directive reform.</p><p> I mentioned operational capacity and the need to react together in order to help each other.  The incident that happened in Ireland is a good example of the potential of this operational capacity.  At the time that happened, the co-ordination system at EU level was triggered.  The Irish authorities triggered it.  They sought to receive support from the European computer security incident response team, CSIRT, network of all the member states.  The idea of going beyond being operational was put in the strategy by a proposal to create what we call a joint cyber unit, namely, a hub that would potentially allow all communities, not only civil but international communities and law enforcement communities, to share information and co-ordinate potential collective responses to major crisis and incidents.  That idea is being discussed with the member states.</p><p> Another element of the strategy being pushed by the Commission President is the cyber resilience Act.  In the strategy, we set out the need to have horizontal rules that would set common cybersecurity standards for connected products and services in the Internal Market in order that we ensure cybersecurity by design whenever a product or service is put on the market and that a whole-life cycle of that product or service will be done.  President von der Leyen, in her state of the Union speech, announced a cyber resilience Act, and this will be a follow-up of that announced initiative.</p><p> I will not continue further.  I will stick to the five minutes allocated in order that we can have a debate.  I believe cybersecurity is one of those challenges that is impossible to face alone.  No member state alone can face it.  That is clear by now.  The attacks will increasingly have an impact across borders.  We are here to be in solidarity and to support each other.  I thank Ireland in particular for the constructive and co-operative role it always plays in discussions on cybersecurity.  That is very much appreciated.  We will continue to listen to members' views.  I am happy to answer any questions they may have and to engage in a debate.</p></speech>

I have a certain sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>being back here.  On a personal level, it is nice to be back and in a committee room again.  To introduce why I am here, I sit on one of the 20 committees of the European Parliament, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, ITRE, which deals with cybersecurity.  I want to give members a brief overview of the EU's cybersecurity strategy as well as touch on some other topics that might be relevant.  We have just come to the end of European Cybersecurity Month, the European Union's annual campaign dedicated to promoting cybersecurity among EU citizens and organisations, therefore, it is an appropriate time to be here.<br/><br/>The European Commission published a joint communication on the EU's cybersecurity strategy for the digital decade last December, just under a year ago.  The latter aims to bolster Europe's collective resistance against cyberattacks and threats and ensure citizens and businesses can fully benefit from trustworthy and reliable services and digital tools. The strategy includes a proposal for the revision of the directive on measures for high common levels of cybersecurity across the Union, which is the network and information security directive or NIS 2, and a proposal for a new directive on the resilience of critical entities.<br/><br/>The original directive dating from 2016 has three parts, national capabilities, cross-border collaboration and national supervision of critical sectors.  First, EU member states must have certain national cybersecurity capabilities and they must have a national cybersecurity incident response team and perform cyber exercises, etc.  Second, we need to collaborate across borders.  The strategy provides for that also.  Third, member states have to supervise the cybersecurity of critical market operators in their country such as in transport, water, and health sectors.  Obviously, the focus has been on health, but it must also be on the energy sector, as we saw from the recent incident in the US, and in the finance sector to ensure we have good measures in place.  However, member states were quite slow to fully implement this directive and, therefore, the Commission proposed this new directive, a revision of the directive last year.  That has just come through committee last week and I voted on it.  Therefore, a new directive is in the offing.  The question is: will it change things?<br/><br/>NIS 2 aims to strengthen cybersecurity capabilities and to have better information sharing and co-operation on cybersecurity crisis management at national and EU level.  It provides for an all-hazards framework to support member states to prevent, resist and recover from disruptive attacks wherever their source may be.  My group has strongly pushed for the need to develop those cybersecurity skills we all need, particularly to get better gender representation in the industry.<br/><br/>From January 2019 to April 2020, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity reported approximately a quarter of a million malware infections every day within the Union.  Europol highlighted a notable increase during the pandemic in the number of ransomware attacks on public institutions and large companies.  Europol&rsquo;s Internet organised crime threat unit stated that targeting such institutions allows cybercriminals to increase the ransom amount and has noted a significant increase in attacks on governments such as healthcare and education, energy and transport systems.  EU institutions and bodies as well as member states have been targeted.  We are all aware of the attack six months ago on the HSE but in the same month there were two large-scale cyberattacks against public service organisations in Belgium.  The first concerned Belnet, the network which serves third level institutions and research centres as well as hospitals and federal ministries.  The federal internal affairs department was subjected to a cyberattack of such a scale that it raised suspicions of the involvement of a foreign state.  Given the Vice Chairman's caveats at the start of this meeting, I am reluctant to name names but it is commonly known certain states outside the EU would appear to be the focus for our attention on these attacks.<br/><br/>In March, the European Council adopted a cybersecurity strategy.  It states we need to have a network of security operational centres across the EU to both monitor and anticipate signals of attacks on member states and a common cyber unit to provide clear focus to the crisis management framework at EU level.  It also promotes strong encryption standards while permitting law enforcement and judicial authorities to exercise their powers online and offline to prevent such cyberattacks.<br/><br/>To touch briefly on the new legislation, it insists that member states have national cybersecurity strategies, establish computer security incident response teams and appoint national competent authorities for cybersecurity.</p><p>We need to strengthen the security requirements of member states, address the security of supply chains, streamline reporting and introduce more stringent supervisory measures.  We have an awful lot on paper but really it comes down to the individual member state to implement not only the first directive from five years ago but the new directive when it comes into force.  This is where the critical weakness is.  It is about the implementation of the directives at member state level.</p><p> It is not just about the EU or the member state.  It is also about ourselves.  We need to be cyberaware.  We tell our children not to get into a car with a stranger but all too often we click on the wrong link on our device and that opens up the pathway for a security breach.  We are all guilty of simplifying things.  In a world where half a dozen passwords are often needed in the course of a day we often take shortcuts.  We need to practice better security awareness in our own operations.  We are only as strong as the weakest link.  We need to improve our own security.  We need to do exercises at a member state level in the same way as our Defence Forces do physical exercises to prepare for attacks on us as a member state.  At a cybersecurity level we need to prepare and share information and be ready for the next attack.  It might not be on our health system.  It might be on our energy networks.  We are only as vulnerable as the weakest link and we have to take action to prepare for the next attack.</p></speech>

I hope I have pronounced the name correctly.  I am fairly sure I got Mr. Cuffe's name right.</p> <p>  We all accept the reality of the world we live in and the dangers as regards cybersecurity.  The ransomware attack on the HSE brought it absolutely home to us.  My question breaks into a number parts and, in fairness, the witnesses have dealt with some of them.  I am looking for a greater amount of information.  We all accept it is down to capacity and, of course, we all work better together.  However, it fails miserably if nobody follows through on implementation, particularly as regards where the directives are at this point in time.</p> <p>  There is capacity at State and EU level.  There is international engagement.  We have had enough people and experts throw out commentary on certain states where there may be operations that almost operate on a subcontractor basis.  While they are not necessarily within the employ of the state, they can be brought into action.  We even heard commentary that they were generally given operational rules not to touch anything infrastructural on the east coast of the United States or anything that brings too much heat.  I assume the ransomware attack on the HSE might have been one of those things where they bit off more than they could chew and could be the reason keys were handed over.</p> <p>   We suddenly became aware of the number of companies paying off money, including to avoid reputational damage.  There was a report out a while ago that stated &euro;22,712 was the average payment made.  For small and medium enterprises this is not nothing.  In many cases I do not think people got all of their information back.  I suppose it was a case of mitigating harm from their point of view.</p> <p>  We have the capacity at localised level.  We have had the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, review here.  We were not up to scratch.  We would like to think that in future we will have a greater element of capacity.  This is accepting that it will always come down to the best level of digital hygiene that can be employed, whether at an individual level or a group level.  This is an absolute no-brainer.</p> <p>  What do the witnesses see as regards the joint cyberunit?  What will be its remit?  I have a slight fear.  We all accept the necessity to secure ourselves from cyberattack.  The problem with this is that it has become conflated with general defence, a European army and these wider questions.  This is something that has to be separated.  This is not taking away from the absolute danger.</p> <p>  We have experts in the State who said the NCSC should probably have made greater use of the expertise we have in third level institutions.  People have been running courses on cybersecurity over many years and have much more expertise than an awful lot of others.  My question is on long-term proposals for what the unit will do and how we ensure we have and maintain best practice and capacity at a localised level.  Some experts have spoken about an ability to disrupt.  I will use the term "counterstrike".  This would be in the middle of an attack.</p> <p>  There is also the issue of what we intend to do on an international basis from a legislative point of view or in conversations with certain states and certain players.  We have all heard anecdotal stories on members of certain elements of the US Administration that may have made their voices clear to certain of these players.  This is not something I would anticipate happening at European level.  I apologise for the circular way I have asked these questions.  It is about the unit and state and international capacity.  It is what we do on an international basis.  I would like a bit more detail.  I thank the witnesses for their commentary.</p></speech>

I will begin with the question on whether there is an issue with implementation.  There is an issue with the nature of the NIS directive.  A number of sectors are included and it is up to member states to decide which companies to identify.  We are in the hands of member states.  This is why we decided to propose a revision of the directive.  We were facing situations where some member states, including Ireland, had identified, for example, a huge number of hospitals in the health sector.  Other member states had not identified any.  This was not ideal for merging.  This is what we are now trying to fix with the new NIS directive.  All of the sectors identified will be extended and companies will be covered automatically and, therefore, subject to these obligations.  The nature of the legislative technique will make a difference.  That being said, what is clear and what has to be acknowledged is that we constantly receive input, including in the context of the negotiations, from member states complaining they do not have sufficient resources.  This is not something I can evaluate because I do not have the exact picture.  The solution we propose is to have an overview in the new directive.  It is very valuable to know the amount of money, and let us hope it is only money, that is being lost due to cyberattacks.</p><p>Are we putting the right resources into cybersecurity at all levels?  That may include ourselves in the European Union in that.  This is a very valid idea which probably goes beyond purely implementing legislative acts.</p><p> On ransomware I do not have much to add.  Of course, under the NIS directive if there is an incident there is an obligation to notify if one is covered.  A different thing is the whole debate about communicating payment or non-payment.  Again, that is also a very valid debate.</p><p> The Deputy's main question was about the joint cyber unit.  What is the joint cyber unit?  My first answer is that the joint cyber unit will be what member states decide they want it to be.  The European Commission is perfectly aware that this is a subject where there is a lot of sovereign power of member states, which is why the Commission came with our recommendation on a process to set up the joint cyber unit.  This would then go to the Council to be blessed.  In a way we said this is our proposal and left it up to the member states to decide.</p><p> The idea that we have is basically to set up something that to date has not existed.  There is a gap.  The gap is that right now there are a number of different communities, including the international community with the cyber toolbox, the law enforcement community and the civil community.  Very often large-scale incidents happen together because it is not only a civil attack but a criminal attack.  As the MEP correctly said, very often it comes from third countries so there is an international angle and sometimes a different angle.  What we are missing today is a structure, a network, a one-stop shop, that is, a single point of contact.  It can be defined in many different ways but it is a way to co-ordinate all of these communities when something big happens.  </p><p> What are the advantages of having a joint cyber unit?  Of course, the idea is to have well-defined roles and responsibilities so that if something happens, everybody knows who does what and whom to call.  There would be a crisis response plan to a cybersecurity incident.  There would also be constantly updated information and situational reports because the entire community would have the same information.  The Deputy rightly asked about these cybersecurity rapid-reaction teams that we propose.  The idea is not at all to create an army.  The idea was very much like what we have today in the civil protection mechanism, the civil reaction teams.  For example, during the summer there were fires in many member states and those member states that had capacity available helped member states that were in trouble if they so wished.  The request for help is voluntary.  That is basically what we had in mind and these are the types of ideas that are currently being discussed with member states.  </p></speech>

It seems clear that the weakest link is the implementation of the directive.  I am not familiar with the operation of the computer security incident response team here in Ireland.  I do not know how many people are employed in this area.  However, as a test case it might be useful to quiz those people on the staffing they have and what exercises they perform.  We could even look closer to home to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which has charge of the IT systems in these buildings.  We could use it as a test case for what kind of readiness or exercises are in place.</p> <p>  I am mindful that cybersecurity in Ireland also has a non-EU component.  Our energy grid is managed by EirGrid, which manages the electricity grid in the North of Ireland as well as in the South.  It is important to think about the challenges that emerge from these issues of semi-State agencies having joint jurisdiction over this member state and over part of a foreign state.  That might also be worth dwelling on.  </p> <p>  In Brussels, we are providing the framework for member states to fill with the staffing, finance and oversight that is required.  Perhaps it is a good exercise for the committee to interrogate that in the Irish context to see if we are ready.  </p></speech>

I want to drill down on two areas, one a bit more parochial than the first.  Ms Boix Alonso alluded to the first one, which relates to working with partners throughout the world.  Cybersecurity strategy includes a programme of action in the UN.  What form has that engagement taken?  Where is the discussion at?  What sorts of insights are there for enhanced engagement?</p> <p>  My second issue is a bit more practical and relates to the cyber resilience Act planned for late next year.  I understand the purpose of the legislation is to introduce common cybersecurity standards for connected devices.  How will it address any gaps left by the Council's and Parliament's NIS 2 proposals?  Will it come soon enough to address these gaps?  </p></speech>

A system of peer reviews would help.  I am comfortable with the negotiations with member states, but it is something that would help.<br/><br/>On the United Nations, our colleagues in the European External Action Service are dealing with it.  We are very much engaging with the United Nations.  We consider that this is extremely important.  These things are delicate.  The engagement and co-operation with like-minded countries is always easier and there is a lot of engagement, as the Deputy knows.  Recently the United States in particular regarding ransomware launched a big call to work together and we are basically working with all like-minded countries.  We have a number of cyber dialogues with them.  Of course, it is more delicate with other non-like-minded countries.  <i>Voila</i>.  In particular on the UN convention, we are engaged in the push for norms of behaviour in cyberspace and also on the Budapest Convention where we are quite advanced.  It is going well there.  <br/><br/>On the cyber resilience Act and what would be the complementarity with the NIS directive, basically we are dealing with two different things.  The NIS directive is about the obligations on companies to report, notify and take certain security measures on incidents, and the monitoring and enforcement tools.  We are at the exploratory phase of the cyber resilience Act.</p><p>What we are exploring at this stage is the gap that exists in the current legislative framework in respect of products and services that are put on the market.  Right now, what we have are very scattered sectoral pieces of legislation that deal with specific products and very often deal with security without necessarily having cybersecurity in mind.  We have launched a study that we are closing now that has performed this exercise of identifying the current gaps.  Those gaps are that we do not have anything general that would cover those products and services that are connected and, therefore, as the President of the Commission has stated, are subject to being hacked.  That relates specifically to their cybersecurity.  This is the analysis we are doing now.  We will see whether these Acts should cover more or less than that but, right now, this is the analysis we are doing.</p></speech>

It is good to see Mr. Cuffe back in again.  This is my second day in a row of engaging with him.  Both our guests referred to the level of attacks that are currently being experienced.  Ms Alonso stated that there is an expectation that we will see a fourfold increase in 2021, as reported by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity.  Mr. Cuffe pointed to the highlighting by Europol of a notable increase in attacks on public institutions.  That is quite alarming.  It sounds as though a degree of urgency is required on this matter.  The revised or updated directive is very welcome, but it seems to be more a medium-term plan.  What is being done right now at European Union level to deal with what appear to be attacks that are happening today and will happen tomorrow and the day after that?  What is being done to increase supports for member states and in terms of co-ordination at EU level to deal with these ongoing attacks?  I genuinely was not aware how large-scale the problem was and is, or the rate at which it is increasing.  That is quite alarming.  We certainly need to get that information out to citizens in member states because it will generate broader supports for what our guests are trying to achieve in terms of the directive.</p> <p>  Mr. Cuffe referred to the original directive and what was required of member states.  I am not sure if he has this information to hand.  He referred to the requirement for member states to have certain capabilities at a national level.  I ask our guests to comment on that.  Where is Ireland at in that regard?  How well did we do in transposing the directive and meeting the minimum requirements for member state capabilities under the original directive?  I am trying to figure out what gap we need to close in order to get to where we need to be.  Ms Boix Alonso and Mr. Cuffe both referred to the HSE attack.  It has focused minds here and brought home to every household how important this issue is and how much it impacts on all our daily lives.  It is tangible.  If we can take any positive from what happened, it is that it will allow us to respond better to future attacks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.169" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021110300002#F00300"><p>The dreadful thing about being a Member of the European Parliament is that we pass the directives but we do not receive sufficient feedback on their implementation within member states.  That is certainly the situation in the case of the committees on which I sit.  However, I note that, anecdotally, several State agencies draw attention to the risk of cyberattacks.  Each year, Irish Water drew attention to the critical risks to its infrastructure in delivering drinking water to the public, industrial users and the IT sector.  All it would take is for one or two pumps to be taken over to dramatically damage the resilience of our entities.  There may be a role with regard to quizzing the institutions in Ireland that have responsibility for implementing those directives.</p> <p>  In addition, we are seeing an extraordinary increase in the number of connected devices.  The Internet of things is taking over the world, from washing machines to teddy bears, and we need to educate citizens on good practice in the context of cybersecurity.  As I was leaving Brussels last week, I noticed a big billboard advertising cybersecurity month, but I do not know whether that permeated through to national campaigns or campaigns within organisations such as this one or State bodies.  In a world that is increasingly connected and where, due to the pandemic, many people are working remotely, the IT links we have are crucial to carrying out our daily work, so it is important that the committee ensures the resources are available at a national level to make sure that we are cyber vigilant, that exercises are carried out and that there is in the public domain a report on the main bodies in Ireland and how well they are performing.  Just like the generals fighting the last war, next time it probably will not be the HSE that is under attack, but it could be the energy networks that keep the lights on or the water coming out of taps or the infrastructure that allows us to appear in committee rooms.  There is a need to hold public bodies in particular up to scrutiny.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.170" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorena Boix Alonso" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021110300002#F00400"><p>I agree with the Senator that it is worrying.  I am not going to hide the fact that it is a worrying situation.  A significant number of actions are already being taken under the current legislative framework.  For example, I mentioned what happened in the case of the Irish incident.  We have the sister network of all these entities at national level, which did act in that case.  Whenever there is an incident, the network exchanges information and, if requested, provides support.  We have the cyber crises liaison organisation network, CyCLONe, which is more at a political level or between political and operational levels.  It is already active and compiles reports on incidents so that lessons can be learned.  At the level of the current directive, we have the network and information systems, NIS, co-operation network, through which there are many discussions ongoing to learn from each other and strengthen implementation.</p> <p>  I did not mention it in my opening statement, but there is certainly a need to increase and improve the capabilities at member state level.  Unfortunately, the level of investment in Europe in cybersecurity is not yet comparable with that of certain third countries.  The first calls will be launched next year under a new digital EU programme that is devoting approximately &euro;3 million to support capability.  It is not research; it is really going to the deployment of technologies.  We will launch the first calls next year.  We are doing what we can to help and support member states.  In the context of the resilience fund, we strongly insisted that member states dedicate part of that money to reinforcing capabilities.  Many of them have gone in that direction.  As regards international co-operation, as I mentioned, several dialogues are taking place with third countries and we are co-operating.  A lot is being done now and more will be done in the medium to long term.</p> <p>  As regards the level of implementation by Ireland, as I stated, the current directive has been implemented, but to say whether Ireland has implemented it well or poorly is not so easy because it is very much left in the hands of member states.  That is what we are trying to fix.  I know that when the incident happened, the health authorities were covered and had been identified by Ireland.</p><p>I know that in Ireland a lot of exercises are taking place.  Therefore, I would not say that Ireland is not implementing the strategy well.  As I said before, a particular country can do a lot of exercises.  For example, in hospitals, we do cybersecurity exercises.  However, if the investments are not there and as a result, the capabilities are not there or if the relevant authorities do not take the responsibility, things do not happen.  It is another issue that we are trying to fix in the new directive.  We are trying to ensure that the management of companies and institutions take responsibility for adopting measures.  A country can do a lot of exercises, but when the moment arrives, things do not happen.  That is not for Ireland but generally, certainly, every member state can do much more.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.172" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021110300002#G00200"><p>I welcome the guests to the committee today.  This area is fascinating and is one that needs serious attention and focus, given our recent experience of cyberattacks.  We have seen how it has decimated Ireland and our health service.  There is a fear that it could be replicated very easily in other areas.  I listened with interest to the opening statements and the responses to some good questions.  Certainly, Ireland has a responsibility to develop a cybersecurity strategy alongside all of our EU counterparts, but it is only as good as the resources available to back up that strategy.  Indeed, looking at the capabilities and responsibilities at a national level, I have some concerns around our responsibilities.  I want to hone in on one area in particular, and concerns I have with regard to one of the key pillars in terms of us as a country and a State living up to our responsibilities, namely, the Defence Forces.</p> <p> There are serious difficulties with the recruitment and retention of Defence Forces personnel.  Looking specifically at the Naval Service, there are massive issues there in terms of recruitment and retention of.  I also sit on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and we recently visited the naval base at Haulbowline, County Cork.  We listened to the concerns raised by members in all ranks within the Irish navy in respect of the recruitment and retention of staff and how it is impacting on their role and responsibilities.  Obviously, they are tasked with a number of responsibilities in policing Irish waters, not just in terms of fishing, but also in policing the multitude of transatlantic data cables that pass through Irish waters off the southern coast, serving all of Europe.  I imagine that Ireland must be the first line of defence for those cables that serve not only Europe, but Ireland as well.  We have a domestic responsibility and a European responsibility to police those cables.  </p> <p>  The concern is that currently, out of a fleet of nine ships designated for policing what is a massive maritime area that is ten times the size of the landmass of Ireland, only one is at sea due to a multitude of reasons and ongoing issues within the Naval Service, including the retention of members of the service.  Looking at the fleet of nine ships of which only one is at sea, they have a responsibility to police not just what is at water level, but everything that is above that and, probably more importantly in this case, everything that is below the water level.  We do not have sonar capabilities in our fleet, so we are absolutely blind as to what is going on under the water.  Concerns were highlighted last August when what was described as a foreign spy ship was alleged to be monitoring some of these critical cables off the west coast of Ireland.  All we could do was to monitor that ship; we could not see exactly what it was doing under the water, or whether it was attaching any devices to any of the cables.  I imagine that is quite concerning.  When we talk about capabilities and responsibilities at a national level, do the witnesses view that as a concern?  For me, it is a very serious concern, given that in my mind, we are the first line of defence.  We can talk about all of the other issues further down the line, but if we cannot police at that very basic level, it is of serious concern.</p> <p>  The other issue I wish to raise, which was touched upon quite extensively by Mr. Cuffe, concerns cybersecurity for consumers.  It is a key area of concern.  Mr. Cuffe outlined all of the activity that consumers and children do online etc.  I certainly believe that there needs to be a massive campaign in this area, both nationally and across Europe.  Mr. Cuffe spoke about cybersecurity week at a European level.  I do not think that was picked up here in Ireland.  I imagine that very few people know about that awareness campaign here in Ireland.  I am aware of the Webwise initiative that is rolled out by the Department of Education, which is tasked with giving parents, teachers and children the tools around cybersecurity.  I am not sure how well that initiative is resonating with people.  I am probably showing my age but I refer to the campaigns on road safety and the green cross code.  Perhaps some of the other committee members will be aware of those campaigns.  I am sure some of them will remember the song that went along with the campaign.  The campaigns resonated and stuck with people in respect of safety issues around roads and how to cross roads etc.  There is no campaign that delivers that powerful message not just to young people, but to people right across the board in terms of the security, their responsibilities as consumers and how to use the online world safely.  Serious focus within our own national strategy must be placed on how we are going to get that message across.  Going back to the core point, there needs to be national campaign with the resources behind it to promote it and ensure that when people go online, the message of "security, security, security" is there.  The areas that I wanted to touch upon are the national responsibility of the Irish State, the failures, as I see them, around its primary responsibilities in cybersecurity, and at the other end, the consumers and the need for a comprehensive campaign around cybersecurity.  </p></speech>

Certainly, in my own submission to the Defence Forces public consultation on the future of the Defence Forces, I mentioned cybersecurity and stated that it will be a core competency of the Defence Forces in years to come.  In fairness to Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, the former head of the Defence Forces, he has spoken at length about cybersecurity threats.  The Defence Forces are aware of the issue and I am sure they would like to have more resources to address it.</p> <p>  I am aware of the incidents to which the Deputy referred.  There have been incidents where foreign submarines have been located beside undersea cables with aircraft circling overhead.  It is like something from James Bond movie.  The worry is that foreign powers are stealing data from these cables.  We do not have the capability to have complete oversight, particularly when these cables are in international waters.</p><p>Whatever about international ICT cables, we will be more dependent on energy networks connecting us to other EU member states.  We are already connected to the UK but the Celtic interconnector will connect Ireland to France.  A Norway-UK cable opened within the past month.  This interconnectivity is happening at an increasing rate and it is hugely dependent on ICT to ensure that these entities operate correctly.</p><p> Even closer to home, I remember when a water pipe broke in Dublin and I asked the team repairing it what happened.  They told me somebody clicked the wrong button on a pump and the pressure built up.  We are really dependent on a secure ICT system to deliver the day-to-day services on which we depend.  Every branch of Government must focus on ensuring it is ready for the most severe threats that are out there and that will increase.</p><p> Ms Boix Alonso alluded to the need for umbrella legislation at European level to cover all consumer items that are connected and I see a gap there which may be addressed within the European institutions in future years to ensure that any new device has certain levels of protection that are easy to understand for the consumer and that will stop unwanted intrusions into connected devices elsewhere.</p></speech>

Technically, submarine cables are covered by the NIS directive.  Is it enough?  That is a different question.  I am perfectly aware of the issue and debate around it.  Defence considerations are beyond my remit because I am dealing with civil matters, but our president is very aware of these issues.  She insisted on them in her state of the union speech.  We are very much in contact with our colleagues in the Directorate-General for Defence, Industry and Space, DG DEFIS, dealing with defence, on the need to push a cyber defence strategy.  We are certainly discussing those issues with the colleagues in DG DEFIS because there are clear synergies in these fields.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the issue of skills.  I reassure him that things are being done on the issue of skills on two different fronts.  Two types of skills are needed in the cyber area.  One is the basic cyber skills whereby people know and are aware where attacks could come from or how to identify phishing and things like that.  Those are the basic cyber skills.  There is also the extremely worrying subject of specialist cybersecurity.  We have a huge shortage of those skills, not only in Europe but in the world.  There are not enough specialists.  We need to keep up our knowledge because the nasty guys and girls are becoming extremely sophisticated.  Those are the two types of skills we need to deal with, and the Commission is doing so now, at least from the point of view of funding.  In the digital EU programme that I mentioned before, there is money available for universities and workforces to help in specialisation and providing specialist courses on cybersecurity.  We are acting to try to cope with the gap.  We must also act on basic cyber skills.  As was mentioned before, we had cybersecurity month.  Within the competence and education we have, we try to take action but there is certainly an issue around both basic cyber skills and specialist cyber skills to cope with the level of sophistication we are facing right now.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions, one of which has been addressed by Ms Boix Alonso in her consideration of the skills shortage and how we are going to combat that.  That will be one of the biggest challenges we will face in cybersecurity.  We must find the brightest and the best for our teams both nationally and at a European level.  One of the projects on which we worked together is the EU digital Covid certificate.  It has been a large, collaborative project and more than 800 million people have Covid certificates.  What measures has the EU taken to avoid cybersecurity attacks on the management of that particular system?  Perhaps our guests can reassure us in that regard.  If we cannot get that right, we will not be able to get any other critical infrastructure right, whether that is to do with water, health or finance, including the mooted digital euro project which is due in the next number of years.  The Covid certificate project is a pilot project for the digital sphere and I am wondering what cybersecurity measures have been taken to ensure the system does not get hacked.</p></speech>

I appreciate it because from the technical side, the EU Covid certificate was done by my team.  The beauty of being the director of a directorate that deals with cybersecurity and e-health is that you can put the two teams together.  Privacy was very much taken into account when designing the system.  The fact that the EU Covid certificate is the only certificate today that is available in the world across borders is precisely because it was conceived from the outset to take into account security and data protection.  It was decided together and that is why it has been such a big success.  We did not even wait for the legislative proposal to be on the table, even less to wait for the close of negotiations, to put the system in force.  It was a beautiful joint project.</p> <p>  It was, from the beginning, foreseen with a gateway.  The gateway, which is managed by a contractor, is centralised by the European Commission.  The certificates are done with a digital and electronic signature so that it cannot be faked.  It is not like a PDF, which can be faked from home.  The certificates need a digital signature.  It is done in a way which requires a private key and a public key, to be a bit technical.  If a person does not have both keys, he or she cannot create or read a certificate.  That is the secure way we did it.  I assure the Senator it is working.  She will have seen fake certificates in the press.  There are certificates in the name of Adolf Hitler or Bob l'&Eacute;ponge.  There are all types of unpleasant jokes.  In those cases, it was not a result of a hack or an attack.  Those cases are, unfortunately, because somebody who had the right to validly issue certificates made fake certificates.  It has, fortunately, only happened in a few countries, but it is a criminal act.  It has, in some cases, been a doctor with the power to issue a valid certificate who has issued these fakes.  The system has not been hacked, for the moment.  It is working.  It has been, unfortunately, at member state level where some unpleasant people have abused the system.  We are now working on a centralised system for revoking those certificates.</p><p>What is done in those cases, and what has been done, is revoke the certificates.  We are working to see whether we can make the revocation system even more efficient.  This system aside, we have weekly meetings with the contractors to analyse every possible incident and act accordingly.  I reassure members of that.  Could something worse happen?  I do not know.  I cannot commit to saying it will not but every measure is being taken and, for the moment, it has not been cyberattacked.</p></speech>

As no member is indicating, I will ask a question.  It concerns parliamentarians, democrats and civil society across Europe and the integrity of our democratic system.  We have seen interference and hacking in various elections internationally.  There are a lot of data and we have seen inquiries into the matter in the United States.  There are grave suspicions of interference in referendums in the United Kingdom.  How focused is the European Union at Parliament and Commission level on protecting the integrity of our electoral systems and democracy?  What measures are in play to ensure upcoming elections across the European Union are safe from external or internal interference?</p></speech>

I have done a training exercise for that.  Increasingly, the focus of election monitoring is on the electronic side.  There is monitoring of social media and the integrity of the ballot box.  As some elections move more online than is our experience here, we increasingly need IT skills to understand what is going on and safeguard the process.  It will require a new set of skills for those of us interested in the monitoring process.  I imagine the European Commission is also moving with the times and ensuring its skill set changes on this.  I will leave it up to Ms Boix Alonso to answer on that side of it.</p></speech>

We have, as was mentioned, our CSIRT for the institutions that works on the cybersecurity of EU institutions.  I can give that reassurance.  As was mentioned, we do exercises and a cyber exercise was done in 2019 for the European elections which was a success and went well.  We also have a compendium on election cybersecurity which is a practical tool for national election authorities.  For the European Parliament and national parliaments, we are trying to invite help and support.</p></speech>
