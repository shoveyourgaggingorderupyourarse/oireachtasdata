    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#B00200"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman, the Chairman, Deputy Cahill, and members of the committee for inviting me this evening to speak on the important topic of farm safety.  I am joined this evening by officials from my Department, Mr. Michael Moloney, senior inspector and head of crop policy, evaluation and certification division with responsibility for farm safety, and Dr. Robert Leonard, agricultural inspector on farm safety.</p><p>Farm safety is an important area in the programme for Government and this was evidenced by my appointment as the first ever Minister of State with specific responsibility for it.  I am determined to use this role to drive a change in culture on our farms, one that puts safety first in everything that we do.  The day-to-day responsibility for safety on farms falls to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  While the HSA has primary responsibility, my Department and I are fully supportive of its work and assist in the promotion of safe farming practices.  I have introduced initiatives of our own to complement the work of the HSA, which I will detail further shortly.</p><p>Between 2016 and 2020 there were 100 fatal incidents on Irish farms.  This is a stark reminder of the dangers on farms.  Of these 46 involved a farm vehicle, seven involved machinery and 20 involved livestock.  The age profile of those involved in farm incidents is also a serious concern, with the old and the very young accounting for 65% of fatal incidents on farms.</p><p>Of 54 workplace deaths in Ireland in 2020, 20 were on farms, which is hugely disproportionate to the share of the workforce of our country, with just 7.1% of people employed in the sector in 2019.  Unfortunately, to date this year there have been seven fatal incidents on farms.  Every death is one too many.  Behind each of these numbers is a family, a farm and a local community that has suffered an irreversible loss.</p><p>I understand the committee has invited Embrace FARM to attend and discuss farm safety with it later this evening.  I fully endorse the valuable work and support that the organisation provides to farm families at a very difficult time in their lives.  I attended the annual ecumenical service hosted by Embrace FARM earlier this year.  It was a sobering experience to meet with farm families and members of that organisation and to hear their personal experiences.</p><p>It is important that we continue to drive efforts to put farm health, safety and well-being at the centre of all we do.  It is only through continuous attention to the risks that are present on farms that the rate of fatal and serious incidents will be reduced in a sustained manner.</p><p>I have been involved in supporting a range of initiatives in the areas of farm safety, health and well-being to help drive this cultural change.  I launched a dedicated European Innovation Partnership, EIP, call for farm safety projects in December 2020, with an initial closing date for projects of 29 January 2021.  The EIP ran in a two-stage process, with my Department receiving 30 project proposals in the first stage.  Of these, 12 projects went through to the second stage.  At the end of the second stage eight projects with a total value of &euro;1.8 million were approved and are proceeding to implementation.  Such was the level of interest that we increased the funding from &euro;1 million to &euro;1.8 million to ensure all successful projects could be funded.</p><p>These projects cover not just farm safety, but also farmer health and well-being and vulnerable people on farms.  The projects address a broad range of issues in relation to farm health, safety and well-being, including supports for people who have been affected by serious and fatal farm incidents.  They are generating ideas from the ground up.  As we are all aware, there are many people in our communities doing great work in this area.  These projects are a chance to scale up that work.  We can roll out the most successful projects across a wider area, using what we learned initially.</p><p>At the beginning of October this year, I launched an accelerated capital allowance scheme for farmers wishing to modify farm vehicles or farm equipment for an operator with a disability.  The scheme also covers certain qualifying farm safety equipment to help prevent farm accidents.  The scheme is being operated in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners and will help enable farmers who have suffered life changing injuries to continue farming.  I am determined that while we work to make our farms safer places, these farmers are not left behind.  The scheme has an annual budget of &euro;5 million, excluding VAT.</p><p>Further to this, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and the HSE, co-funded the On Fe<font color="#202124">&iacute;</font>rm Ground programme, which I launched with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, last year.  This project is providing training for agricultural advisers to engage with and signpost farmers to supports in relation to health and well-being.  The training of farm advisers began last month and is ongoing.  It is important that advisers are alert to the warning signs that farmers may be facing difficulties and know how to advise farmers on where they can get help.  Our farm advisers do tremendous work.  They are in a very important position in a farmer's life.  They are often those who have the most regular contact with farmers and they are trusted by them too, so it is key they know how to support farmers when they are displaying signs of distress.</p><p>In relation to on farm infrastructure my Department&rsquo;s targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS II, has more than 50 dedicated farm safety investments, in addition to all of the animal housing and other machinery that provide significant safety benefits.  As part of the TAMS II, it is a requirement that all applicants complete a half day farm safety training course before submitting a claim.  This has resulted in more than 19,000 farmers undertaking the required farm safety training.</p><p>Additionally, my Department is an active member of the farm safety partnership advisory committee, FSPAC.  This committee is a sub-committee of the board of the Health and Safety Authority, and is chaired by a board member of the HSA.  Currently, that chair is Mr. Ciaran Roche.  It brings together all those who work in the area of farm safety to ensure all our efforts are joined up.  The committee has five working groups focusing on different priority areas around farm health, safety and well-being.  Officials from my Department sit on each working group.</p><p>My Department, in conjunction with the HSA, ran a combined television and radio campaign on farm safety in 2020 and 2021.  The campaign focused on reminding farmers not to be complacent around machinery.  Further to this, my Department is rolling out farm safety training to both farmers, as part of the agri-environmental and farm safety training package announced in budget 2021, and to farm advisers as part of their continuing professional development, CPD, training. </p><p>A farm safety leaflet is included with the annual basic payment scheme application packs, distributed annually to more than 130,000 farmers.  All of these various means of reaching farmers, whether it be leaflets, training or media campaigns, help to keep our safety first message front and centre.  We are using every available means to reach as many farmers as possible.</p><p>In budget 2022 a dedicated allocation of &euro;2 million has been provided for farm safety.  This will allow us to continue our work on farm safety, health and well-being.  It is the first time the Department has ever had a dedicated budget for farm safety and it will be an important tool.</p><p>My Department is also continuing to develop the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and I am working to ensure farm safety has a central role in that when it begins in 2023.</p><p>I am determined to reduce the rate of serious and fatal incidents in the agricultural sector.  I am open to looking at all options that may assist in encouraging farmers, and all those living and working in agriculture, to work in a safe manner and to manage the risks that are present in agriculture.  Just because there are risks, it does not mean that farms should be dangerous places to work.</p><p>I thank you, Vice Chairman, and your colleagues for your invitation today.  I look forward to answering any questions or any points that members may wish to raise.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for that comprehensive opening statement.  There is significant interest among members.  We already have seven if not eight members indicating.  I call on Senator Paul Daly.</p></speech>

He has to go to the Seanad.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#C00300"><p>I appreciate that.  I thank the Chair and Senator Daly.  I have to go to the Seanad for Private Members' business.  I welcome the Minister of State.  He comes from my neck of the woods, Narraghmore in County Kildare, so I know of his reputation and commitment to agriculture, particularly young farmers coming into the sector.  He has always been proactive there.  He is highly placed and liked in the sector, which is an important facet coming into any Ministry.  I like the fact he has focused on farm safety as part of his responsibility and his Ministry.</p> <p>  What is a farm accident?  It is worth stopping and thinking about that.  A farm accident is an unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly and unintentionally.  It typically results in damage; in many cases there is loss of life and injury.  We have to look at it in that context.  Too many accidents lead to blame games.  I know family members who have been involved in serious farm accidents involving chainsaws, ploughs and stuff.  We need to be conscious that no one sets out to have a farm accident.  They happen unintentionally and result in great injury and distress to family and the community.</p> <p>  Given the complexities of farming today, the Minister of State and members will appreciate that a farmer effectively has to be an accountant, to be a safety officer, to be computer literate and to deal with piecemeal schemes like BEAM and knowledge transfer partnerships, etc.  There are enormous pressures on farmers in terms of finance and delivering on their farms and making them successful.  That feeds into a sense of anxiety and speed and a need to get things done.  That is not to make an excuse but it is part of the context around some accidents that happen on farms.  There are all different ages and groups.  Recently we had a major incident in Cavan which I will not go into but it was traumatic for the family involved.</p> <p>  I will take up the question of the green certificate.  I have spoken to people who have completed the green cert.  I am shocked and, in some cases, I do not believe they have even been on a farm.  That is a strange thing to say.  We need to look at the training modules for green certs and at who is monitoring the modules.  Are they up to scratch and up to standard?  Are they what they say on the tin?  Many people seek and need a green cert for various reasons but I think we should look at it again.  I would like to see a greater emphasis on the green cert and on monitoring, training and practical learning on farms.  That includes agricultural colleges but not everyone who does green certs is in an agricultural college or has that opportunity.  That is the key message I would like to leave with the Minister of State.  </p> <p>  I acknowledge the enormous of Embrace FARM, particularly Councillor Gabe Cronnelly from Galway, who has done enormous work and has been in touch with the Minister of State office in relation to that.  Their work is important because where life is lost there is sadness.  There are many things that go and they stay on the farm.  They do not disappear.  I acknowledge the enormous work and support they provide.  I also acknowledge the enormous financial commitments in this budget for farm safety, which the Minister of State is responsible for.  I wish him well and I wish Embrace well in challenging and always difficult times around accidents that no one sets out to have.  I thank the Minister of State for coming and am sorry I have to leave.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#C00400"><p>I thank the Senator for his comments.  He is right.  The point that struck me from what he said was that no one expects a farm safety incident to happen to them.  I tend to refer to incidents rather than accidents because they are unintentional but, many times when you engage with families after a  tragic incident, they admit there was an element to it that was probably preventable, if an action had been taken.  Not always, but sometimes that is the case and that regret is there afterwards.  Members know the phrase about when you put on your boots in the morning, you never know who will take them off that night.  I continuously implore farmers to be acutely aware of the risks on their farm and, when hazards are identified, to address them and not put those jobs on the long finger.  No family who suffers a loss or serious injury to a loved one on a farm ever expected it to happen to them.  The Senator's point on that is very valid.</p> <p>  His points in relation to pressure on farmers are also valid.  There are many contributing pressures in the normal exercise of farming activity, for example at harvest time, with the weather, with income, to get the work done and so on.  Often that leads to farmers working long hours under pressure and, in certain instances, mistakes or things that were not intended happen.  We have to be mindful of those pressures, identify the risk in those areas and see where farmers can identify and mitigate those risks.</p> <p>  The Senator made a point about the green cert.  It was a broader point, really, but I am aware, having attended Kildalton agricultural college as an active farmer 22 years ago, that I learned a lot about farm safety there, including the right way to apply a three-point linkage, safety measures around PTO shafts, agitating slurry and all the rest.  I do not consider myself old but I am in my 40s and it is over 20 years since I was there.  That is a challenge for us.  For some farmers, it is a long time since we got farm safety training.  That is why the training in the likes of TAMS is important.  Every time an arm of the State or somebody like the advisers from On Feirm Ground has a connection and interaction with a farmer, we must not miss that opportunity to reinforce the points around farm safety and farmer mental health and well-being.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#C00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Mr. Moloney and Mr. Leonard.  I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak on a topic that is close to my heart and in which I have invested much time and done much work.  I have a Farm Safety Agency Bill in the system in the Seanad.  I thank the Minister of State for his engagement on that and I look forward to continuing our engagements on it.  Who knows where it may go?  The goalposts have moved and that is why I welcome that the Minister of State is in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with responsibility for farm safety.</p> <p>  The Bill's inception was when I was elected in 2016 and appointed to the agriculture committee because I had a keen interest in farm safety.  When we were asked for contributions towards the work programme, I suggested farm safety and was told we could not discuss it at that committee.  It would need to be the committee for trade, enterprise and innovation because the HSA is under that Department.   The wheel has gone round and I warmly welcome the fact the Minister of State has responsibility and a budget of &euro;2 million.  Hopefully, that will increase.</p> <p>  People have a habit of circling the wagons when change is proposed.  I am complimentary of everyone involved in farm safety.  I could not stress that enough then and again now.  That includes people in both Departments and the HSA.  There are people in the private sector the Minister of State is aware of, such as Alma Jordan in AgriKids.  We have mentioned Embrace FARM who we meet later.  I mention two gentlemen in particular, Peter Gohery and Vincent Nally.  All the farm representative bodies on the farm safety partnership advisory committee are playing a major role.  The Minister of State highlighted in his submission the documentation that goes out with the single farm payment applications.  Then there is Teagasc, through the knowledge transfer schemes or whatever.  However, every life and limb is equally important irrespective of whose it is, and people are still falling through the net.  That is my big fear and worry.  How can we get to those people?</p><p>Those who fall through the net can include those who are not members of a farmers' representative organisation and those who are not Teagasc clients, in addition to those who have not gone to agriculture college or obtained a green certificate.  If we reach 99 out of 100, there could still be one in 100 who could have an accident.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?</p><p> What communication, if any, has the Minister of State had with the private sector?  I am thinking of insurance companies, in particular.  Could there be a partnership with insurance companies on the promotion and advancement of farm safety?</p><p> The Minister of State is 90% of the way on awareness.  I welcome the radio and television campaigns that were run last year and again this year.</p><p> On the Saturday before I was introducing the Bill in the Seanad, I was farming.  I was doing a bit of tractor work and working with cattle.  I do not know how it entered my head but I said I had better not get a black eye, scrape my hand or bruise a nail as it would not look good standing up in the Seanad on the following Tuesday to introduce a farm safety Bill.  Because I was so aware and conscious of safety on the day, I saw so many pitfalls and so much potential for an accident.  I was probably being over the top but it opened my eyes.  It was all just about awareness.  On any other day, I would have done what I had to do and gone home, but on the day in question I was being more careful and aware.  It opened my eyes to so many little pitfalls and dangers associated with tasks we take for granted and of which we are not conscious in our daily work.</p><p> As Senator Boyhan said, farmers are working against the elements.  In a bad year, there may be just one window of opportunity.  Many safety concerns go out the window if there are only two days in which to get the silage made and it is expected to rain again at the end of the week.  Farmers are dealing with animals, chemicals and heavy machinery.  There are many dangers around the farm.</p><p> Most farms are family owned and there are children and elderly people on them.  There is much more danger in the farm workplace than in any other conventional workplace.  We have to be cognisant of that.  Will the Minister of State comment on my couple of questions?  I seriously worry about the people who are slipping through the cracks.  There are two Departments involved in addition to so many other organisations, which are all doing a brilliant job, but there are those who are slipping through the net.  How can we get to everybody through awareness-raising and training?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#D00200"><p>I acknowledge the Senator's passion for farm safety and the engagement I have had with him on his proposed Bill.  I acknowledge the meetings we have had on farm safety.  It is a topic very close to his heart.</p><p>There is no single action that can solve the problem.  If it were easily solved, the unacceptably high rate of fatalities on Irish farms would have been addressed long before now.  It is therefore a matter of a series of measures.  I hope we never miss an opportunity where there is a connection to a farmer, whether it is through my Department, an agency or an individual, even individuals in private industry, such as vets or those who deliver the meal in the lorry.  We must never miss the opportunity to engage with the farmer and highlight where there have been incidents.</p><p>The Senator said many people have done a lot of work.  He mentioned Ms Alma Jordan, Mr. Peter Gohery and Mr. Vincent Nally.  I have met them individually at various events.  Ms Jordan, with AgriKids and AgriAware, ran a good pilot initiative in schools last year.  It was a good example of what should be done.  When I was a young lad many years ago, I pleaded with my uncle to allow me to get up on a load of bales when travelling along the road.  Now, through educational programmes in schools, children are going to their fathers or uncles to call out unsafe farm practices.  The day the Senator was very aware of the potential for an incident was the day he was considering farm safety more closely.  If we can get children to think more about farm safety, just as they think more about the environment through the Green-Schools environmental programme in schools, it will empower them to raise the issue of safety at the kitchen table and around the farmyard.  I have four young kids at home.  They point to something dangerous in the yard and ask why it is not being fixed.  Schools present a huge opportunity for us.  We should never miss any opportunity.  There is not one action that can resolve the problem but it is about making sure every interaction is meaningful and highlights the challenges.</p><p>One component of the approach is identifying the risks.  When at a workplace every day, and it is where you live, you become blind to the hazards.  The first step is to identify the hazards and the genuine risks associated with farm activity, including in the yard.  The next step is to take action to make things safer.  It is a question of figuring out what needs to be done in this regard, whether it is through investment or taking action.  Awareness of the hazard is key.</p><p>On the Senator's points on the HSA, I work closely with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, who has responsibility for the authority.  My officials work very closely with the officials in his Department.  The reforms brought about under the chairmanship of Mr. Ciaran Roche and the work on upgrading structures have made the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee, FSPAC, a subcommittee of the HSA, very fit for purpose in the modern era.  As part of the work in this regard, five working groups were set up.  They cover b<font color="#2F2F2F">ehaviour, education and training; health and vulnerable persons; tractors and high-risk machinery; livestock handling; and buildings and working at height.  Each subgroup has clear actions related to the five specific areas of risk and is tasked with identifying actions that need to be taken from a policy perspective to address associated challenges.  There is a genuine focus on that.  I am very proud that Dr. Robert Leonard from my Department is vice chairman of the FSPAC and that my Department is represented on each of the working groups.  There is good cohesion between the two Departments.  I am happier now regarding the gap the Senator talked about but there are always people to reach out to.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  From a policy perspective, I do not believe there is an issue now but there is one regarding individuals.  The Senator asked about how to reach everyone.  The reform of the CAP is a great opportunity.  I want to see farm safety at the heart of everything we do regarding CAP, wherever possible, and everywhere we have a role.  Ultimately, we need farm safety to be the first thought every day.  When we were working with Mr. Tom Arnold on drawing up the agrifood strategy for the period to 2030, I was determined to make farmer health and well-being a central part of it.  Previously, we probably had documents that had referred to ramping up the value of production but that did not refer to the cost to the farmer.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  That leads me to the Senator's point on private sector involvement.  There is a lot we can do through leveraging, not just in respect of insurance companies, which obviously have skin in the game in working with us to reduce and prevent the number of farm safety incidents and make farming safer, but also in respect of co-operatives.  Ultimately, the farmer's farm is his or her greatest asset.  From a business perspective, the farmer is integral to a co-operative in that he or she delivers the produce the latter puts on sale.  All of the relevant bodies have strong corporate responsibility, and we could work with them.  That is where I see a role for the &euro;2 million I have secured this time.  It is not the only fund available &ndash; we also have funding under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, and other schemes &ndash; but there is now a dedicated fund.  I envisage the &euro;2 million being used solely to give to projects in the area of farm safety.  I envisage having the ability to leverage it, working with the private sector, to deliver even more money where projects are good and worth supporting.  It may be a matter of considering innovative ways of communicating because this is key all the time.  Communications are always changing.  Historically, we had newspaper, television and radio advertisements but we can look to other areas.  That is something I am working on.  The private sector could also play a role in that regard.</font></p></speech>

According to <i>www.gov.ie</i>, farming is one of the most dangerous occupations in the country, with roughly 21 dying every year.</p><p>My background is in farming and I have been in and out of farms for over 40 years and I have seen the dangers involved during those years.  There are approximately 2,500 serious injuries annually.  I also agree with what the Minister of State said about many injuries and fatalities resulting from the pressure that farmers are under and the effects of long days, especially when cutting silage and in similar periods.  Even on small farms, there are always jobs to be done and jobs waiting to be done.  Farmers with low incomes, like suckler farmers, do all those jobs themselves.  Their incomes do not allow them to hire people to do some of the work for them.  While the extra &euro;2 million is welcome, I also agree that it will not be enough.  At least it can be spent, though, and I hope it will be spent wisely.  </p><p> Turning to my questions, does the Minister of State think that low-income farms account for many instances of accidents and injuries?  The Minister of State also said that the Health and Safety Authority has the day-to-day responsibility in this area.  Does he perceive the Department playing a more involved role in the future?  The witnesses from Embrace FARM, who will be in with us later, have highlighted the impact of fatalities and serious injuries on the families of the people involved in such accidents.  The opening statement submitted by the group states that "Legislators need to put the farmers first, not just the product they are producing".  Does the Minister of State believe that the way those operating in the agricultural industry are being treated, in respect of the demands handed down to them, is right?  Does he think that enough attention has been paid to the pressure these farmers are under to comply with the various demands being made on them?  </p></speech>

I am a suckler farmer based in south Kildare, with a mixed enterprise involving tillage, and I am acutely aware of what the Deputy has outlined.  On hoping that the &euro;2 million will be enough, to be honest this is not all about money.  Much of what is involved is a change of culture and ensuring that all of us in the farming set-up, including farmers' partners, their parents and their children, are aware of the roles we have to play in identifying hazards and unsafe practices.  That is an important aspect.</p> <p>  Turning to whether low income on farms is a factor in this regard, there are many contributing elements in this area.  When I look at what is being done in respect of sustainability and to incorporate farmers in that endeavour through Food Vision 2030, the health and well-being of farmers is a central part of that process.  In addition, the food systems approach we are taking in Food Vision 2030 makes the sustainability of farmers' income as important as the sustainability of the environment and the rural communities in which they live.  That is the trick, and the key aspect here.  The crucial element of new market development is to ensure that we increase the value that farmers get for their products.  </p> <p>  Farmers are sometimes perhaps taking on jobs that should be done by two people and doing them on their own.  That is a challenge for us, especially when we look at the statistics regarding the age profile of the farmers in this area.  None of these points are excuses, though.  Where factors contribute to farm accidents and fatalities, we must try to identify and mitigate them.  However, we also need farmers to recognise where there are potential hazards in the activities they are undertaking.  I refer in particular to the need to recognise that if a job requires two people that it is then necessary to wait until another person is available to help, instead of farmers perhaps opting to take on such a task alone and thereby taking a real risk.  </p></speech>

This is one of the unique areas where there is political unanimity and every success on the Minister of State's part will be one we will all celebrate because it will result in lives being saved.  Therefore, we wish him well in his endeavours.  I also welcome a dedicated budget line being allocated to farm safety for the first time.  Has the Minister of State received commitments that this &euro;2 million budget line will consist of entirely new funding and that it will not be replacing funds for other farm safety measures included in previous budget lines?  Does the Minister of State have a sense of how much of that &euro;2 million will be direct expenditure by the Department or how much will be allocated in grants to organisations?</p></speech>

I agree, and I acknowledge the cross-party consensus on farm safety.  We all want to see success in this area and it is one of those issues where political differences remain outside the door because we are all in the same boat.  We all know of families in our constituencies that have been impacted by farm safety incidents.  I assure the Deputy that this allocation of &euro;2 million is new funding.  It is dedicated and ring-fenced, as I said previously.  It is not the only money that we spend in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this area, but I was seeking a fund which would have some discretionary aspects to allow for the possibility, if we come across initiatives - I have seen examples during the last year - that are worthwhile and effective and that we would like to support, of being able to support the farming community to undertake such endeavours on a larger scale.  This is the opportunity we have now with this funding.</p> <p>  Equally, people might come to us with more ideas for support if they are aware that such a fund exists for possible initiatives.  We must of course have due oversight of how this money is spent and ensure that there are proper checks and balances because this is taxpayers' funding.  It is new money, though, and how it can be spent is a blank canvas.  I will add as well that when I talk about farm safety that I am also incorporating farmers' well-being and mental health.  Those aspects are inextricably linked with farm safety.  I feel strongly that these elements are also an important part of this initiative and I am open to hearing ideas in that regard, including from members of the committee if they see opportunities, ideas or initiatives that they feel should be supported.  We can look at and analyse those possibilities to explore how the provision of funding might help to get them off the ground or to support existing small-scale endeavours in scaling up.  </p></speech>

He should perhaps talk to some of his colleagues in government about making representations on his behalf in respect of the national broadband plan.  His Internet connection was fairly weak in parts, but I think I got most of it.</p> <p>  There seems to have been a considerable reduction in the number of farm safety inspections.  Returning to the point made by Senator Paul Daly, there is a difficulty here in respect of the cross-over of Departments and their responsibilities.  Those inspections have decreased year on year since 2018, by more than 10% in 2019 and by 50% in 2020, we might say understandably due to the impact of Covid-19.  However, it appears that the number of inspections has again reduced this year compared to 2020.  Is that something on which the Minister of State has engaged with the HSA?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#E00600"><p>I apologise for the poor connection.  It is not 100% but we cannot blame it on the Irish national broadband plan.  I am in Glasgow at the COP26 meeting and our Scottish broadband could do with being a little bit better.  I was determined to participate in the committee today and when the invitation came in I asked the Chair if he could change the timing.  I embraced that change so that I could contribute and play my role here as part of this discussion.</p> <p>  Regarding farm inspections, the impact of Covid-19 is still with us.  It is not all about inspections, and picking up on the point made by Deputy Martin Browne earlier, the HSA is the statutory body with statutory responsibility for ensuring safety in the workplace.  That includes all workplaces in the country.  Regarding determining how that work is carried out, and in the same way that there is a cross-party consensus, there is also a cross-departmental consensus in this area.  We all want to change the culture in respect of farm safety and for our farmers to be safer, but achieving that is not all about inspections.  I say that because some people would argue that the stress of inspections themselves cause challenges.  There is not one contributing factor alone, whether that is big or small farms.  Various elements are involved.</p><p>That change of culture involves heightening awareness of how things can be done in a safer way.  Much of that preventative work relates to promotion   From my perspective in the Department, my role is to work closely with the HSA and every other Department, including the Department of Transport on road safety issues, and to be that voice, but also to be a promotional voice in terms of engaging with farmers, calling out some unsafe practices and pushing for changes in that culture.</p></speech>

I note there has been movement in that regard in recent years with the development of a farmers' charter.  Is the Minister of State satisfied in the first instance that the charter is being upheld by inspectors within his Department?  Are there areas in which that can be strengthened to ensure the experience of farmers who are engaging with the Department is positive?  Obviously, inspections take place for a reason, that is, to ensure that rules are being adhered to and best practices are in place, but all members have had experiences relayed to us of farmers who had what can only be described as negative experiences and interactions.  They felt the purpose of the inspection was to catch them out rather than to ensure they were implementing best practice.  Does the Minister of State see scope for improvement in that regard?</p></speech>

My experience is that the charter is fully upheld.  If there are incidents where farmers believe that has not been the case, I ask them to come forward and let us know.  The charter was drawn up in consultation with the farming organisations and representative bodies, which is key.  It is a collaborative document, rather than one drawn up and dictated by the Department.  It is a working document that involved all the key stakeholders coming together.  It is very much a living document.  I am always open to consideration of further measures but I have not received feedback from farmers that it is not playing an important role.</p></speech>

According to the strategic CAP plan announced last week, it appears that funding for TAMS under the next round of CAP will be reduced year on year for the next five years, when compared with the previous five years.  Is the Minister of State concerned about that?  Does he envisage new capital funding outside the TAMS process that could be available for schemes specifically relating to farm safety in the lifetime of the next CAP, or even separate to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#F00500"><p>As regards TAMS, there is a significant number of measures that have a farm safety element and are funded through TAMS.  Obviously, farm safety will be an integral part of the new TAMS but it is not the only mechanism through which we can support farmers with investment.  I refer to the accelerated capital allowance scheme.  It is a proposal we got through in the Finance Act last year and has been live since 1 January 2021.  There were several issues relating to the rules in the context of finance.  I recently launched the application process of the scheme in the third quarter of this year, but farmers can backdate investments they have made in the 14 key areas, such as farm safety measures, to seek to recoup that money over two years rather than over eight years as is the case for the normal process.  That accelerated capital allowance is another example of what we are providing for farmers.  I hope that, in time, if farmers use it and there is a good take-up of it, that it can be increased.  The total expenditure under the seven measures of TAMS, including transitional expenditure, has reached in excess of &euro;312 million, with &euro;47.7 million paid to date in 2021.  I have a long list of TAMS safety equipment that is available to farmers.  Farm safety will be definitely an integral part of the new TAMS.</p></speech>

In its statement, Embrace FARM refers to some of the experiences of people in that position.  That struck me because it is an angle that may not have been considered in detail.  The statement refers to how people in such situations may have missed out on schemes or incurred penalties for not completing forms.  I know this might be a new area, but it appears there might be scope for the Department to offer a support programme whereby an official of the Department would engage with such families to provide practical supports and, perhaps, step-by-step assistance with the various schemes that applied on the farm and how they can be rolled over, as well as possibly ensuring flexibility would be shown by the Department.  Is the Minister of State open to considering that type of initiative and engaging with Embrace FARM and the committee to see if we can develop such a programme?</p></speech>

It has raised these issues previously with my Department and that actually brought about a change whereby we put in place a dedicated point of contact within the Department for such families to deal with.  There is nothing much more upsetting for a family member, such as the wife of a deceased farmer, than to have to explain every time he or she phones the Department with a query regarding a farm payment, a herd number or something else that the person whose name is on the herd number is no longer with us as a result of a farm safety incident.  My officials are always readily available.  We use the likes of the ploughing championships and the roadshows where schemes are launched as examples of this.  One of the proposals put forward by Embrace FARM and taken up by the Department is that one member of staff in the Department is assigned to a family in this situation.  That staff member deals with every query from the family so that they do not have to tell the story again and again.  These are practical measures that are really important, but I am open to any further suggestions.  Obviously, my focus is predominantly on preventing incidents from happening, but we must be mindful that they continue to happen and, where they do, my Department wishes to be sensitive and to work with the grieving families in dealing with all the practicalities in the aftermath of such an incident.  I think we are doing that better now than we did initially.  In recent years, those changes have made a good difference.  I am always open to considering new proposals into the future.</p></speech>

It is good to hear of the various initiatives the Minister of State outlined.  I have a few questions and will throw out a few ideas to see what the Minister of State thinks of them.

There are other reasons too.  Is there anything being considered on the agricultural side, whether it is special adaptation of a tractor, for example?  Would it be possible to give VAT or some part of the funding back to help farmers if they basically need to get back farming.  I welcome what the Minister of State said about the quad earlier.</p> <p>  Bar the grace of God I could be one of the people I will speak of next.  Many times when a cow calves people take a risk that they should not.  Will anything be formulated by the Minister of State or his Department for a competition of ideas for equipment to use in circumstances?  I have a vision in my head of a pen where a cow would calve with a gate at either hand and it could split open on the bottom so a farmer could get to put iodine on a calf or whatever.  Is the Department considering anything to incentivise people to formulate ideas in a competition?  If it saved one life, it would be great.</p></speech>

With the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, every investment in a farm has a farm safety element to it because we are upgrading facilities and the conditions in which farmers work.  It is making farms much safer.  We have not signed off the decision for the new TAMS yet.  Measures are being reviewed and new options are being considered internally.  That is for the new TAMS process.</p><p>The Deputy mentioned about trying to keep safe when trying to look after a calf and I am in the same boat.  Such a process is covered with the likes of the replacement of slats, calving gates, barriers, dehorning crates and handling units for cattle and sheep, including head scoops.  It also takes in the upgrading of existing sheds with blinds and roller doors because sometimes a dark corner in a shed is a risk as well.  The <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>ran a competition to what the Deputy described and I am always open to ideas.  Farmers have a lived experience and the type of knowledge that is very important for us.  I have always been struck by that.  I am always open to generating new ideas.</p><p>The Deputy mentioned an adaptation element for farmers and we do not talk so much, necessarily, about life-changing injuries.  The headline-grabbing figures are fatalities because of their impactful nature but there are many farmers who suffered a life-changing injury.  I was acutely aware of that when I drew up a list for accelerated capital allowances that we had approved.  The capital allowance for farm safety and disability adaptation equipment relates to 14 measures and where farmers invest in them they can get 50% offset against tax over two years in an accelerated allowance.  Some of the measures look to address hazardous activity through investment in equipment.  An example might be an anti-backing gate where a cow going into a crush cannot get back, which is a very important preventive measure.  Another example would be hydraulic linkage arms for tractors and jacking systems and a lifter for big bags of a half a tonne or more, with or without the integral bag-cutting system.  There are also allowances for chemical storage cabinets and other preventive measures.</p><p>Half of the measures in that accelerated capital allowance are adaptive measures.  They include the quick hitch mechanism for rear and front three-point linkage to enable the hitching of implements without having to descend from a tractor.  We have farmers who have, unfortunately, lost limbs because of a farm safety incident.  For income and mental health reasons, when these farmers recover from their injuries they need to go back to work but it can be prohibitively expensive to adapt machinery and tractors in some of those ways.  I was very conscious of that in formulating the accelerated capital allowance.  Modified controls can enable full hand operation of a full vehicle when somebody has lost a foot or a leg.  There could be a wheelchair docking system or the provision of a lift, hoist or an integrated ramp to the farm vehicle, including modified entry where required, and wheelchair restraints.  These are all really important additional steps that can provide easier access in farm vehicles.</p><p>I encourage everybody on the committee to be familiar with the accelerated capital allowance and let constituents know about it.  When farmers apply for these measures, it strengthens my case next year to make a list of 14 measures even longer.  We should ensure it is fully subscribed because there is &euro;5 million per year set aside for this.  We all need to work together to make farmers aware of the supports that exist for them in that regard.</p></speech>

Many of the other committee members have covered the questions I would have asked but that is fine.  I respect what the Minister of State has said about farmers needing to understand that when there is a two-person job, they should wait and try to get somebody to help.  It is not easy for many farmers, who may be under fierce pressure.  We are calendar farming now and, unfortunately, this puts farmers into a corner and they must work at certain times, with the weather and a deadline on their back.  Much of the time they can be on their own.  They might suffer rural isolation as well, leading to many difficulties.  There was mention of seven fatalities and that is seven too many.  I respect that figure.  Farmers are under much pressure too.</p> <p>  Senator Boylan mentioned the green certificate earlier.  I was speaking to the father of a young man doing his green certificate who told me about the pressure being put on young people today.  Perhaps it is an area the Minister of State might look into.  He said there is a bit of funding under health and well-being provisions.  Any of us who did a farming course know that people have to work as well, up to 35 hours per week.  The gentleman I spoke to said his son was milking approximately 170 cows for a farmer and getting &euro;122 per week.  He is getting &euro;3.48 per hour washing yards, spreading slurry, milking in the morning and evening.  That young fellow must buy tyres and diesel for the car.  He must live as well.  It is a lot of pressure for young person and we can only imagine it.  I would appreciate if that could be looked at.</p> <p>  If there is funding available, perhaps young farmers trying to start in life and get trained would not be asked to work for &euro;3.48 per hour.  These are decent and hard-working young lads and they deserve a little more respect.  It is a failing of the systems in our country.  If we pressurise them at that point in life, how will we improve their lot as time goes on?  The Minister of State might look into it at some stage, although he has the very important brief of farm safety.  We all know that and we are all on the one side on this matter.  I thank the Minister of State.</p></speech>

Young people are under immense pressure for &euro;3.48 per hour, or that is what it works out at for this gentleman.  It is the same in many cases, milking 170 cows morning and evening, as well as all the work that goes with it, including slurry spreading.  He works so many weeks at 35 hours per week.  That brings savage pressure on young fellows.  It is unfair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#G00900"><p>Absolutely.  The idea of work experience is the young farmer gains that knowledge.  I know I did when I did my green cert over 20 years ago.  It is about working on a different host farm and people learn more on another farm than they might at home working for parents, etc.  It is a very valuable part of the green cert.  I would not want to see a position where somebody takes advantage of a young farmer when it comes to the number of hours he or she is expected to work.  Work experience has a role to play and it is valuable.  There must be safeguards around the process.  The Deputy might give me the details of the specific case and I can look into it.  Farmers must be approved as well to take on those positions and with that comes a responsibility to ensure all the jobs being done have a learning element.</p><p>There is very much a learning element to it.  One can also talk about the type of work one is asking them to do.  There must be a learning element to all the work that has been done there.</p><p> Outside of that, I would say to young farmers that in our support for young farmers and to encourage the transition, there are challenges, especially with farm safety and the older age of our farmers.  There are so many farmers over the age of 65 and into their 70s farming and this is highlighted in the figures for farm fatalities where so many of incidents involved those who are in their 70s.  It is very important to encourage intergenerational change, whether it is through partnership or through intergenerational change.  We have made changes in recent years around long-term leasing and the 60% TAMS grant to encourage that generational change.  These are all measures to support young farmers and to encourage them not only to take over the enterprise but also to invest and make farms safer and more efficient in how they do that as well.</p></speech>

Will the Minister of State elaborate on how CAP reform is going to play a part in farm safety and whether he believes that the new CAP talks and the new funding will play a vital role in ensuring that farm safety will be part of that?  Will the Minister of State also elaborate on the well-being of farmers and how they actually operate?  Unfortunately, a lot of farmers work by themselves.  It is a very lonely occupation in so many ways.  They must deal with succession planning and financial planning also.  Will the Minister of State speak on the well-being of farmers on the farm?  I spoke with a farmer during the week and he told me that he would meet the artificial insemination, AI, man and the bulk tank truck driver and these would be his interactions during the week.  There is an issue around how farmers can communicate, can meet and can be involved in the system.  Their mental well-being in particular may be an issue that we must focus on.  Will the Minister of State comment on those two issues?</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned they are the same and one cannot look at them in isolation.  I definitely share the concerns. Farmers work in isolation anyway.  It is the nature of the job and it then makes it harder when the pressure is on.  We are all aware of the impact that Covid has had on farmers.  Across all sectors of society it has affected people who live alone or in more isolation but I have particular concern for farmers who work alone and live alone and particularly during the Covid restrictions.  Their social outlet was to go to mart and maybe go for a pint at the weekend or to go to a sporting match or maybe to a religious service at the weekend.  All of those four things were taken away during the lockdown.  The pressures of farming and the ongoing work of farming did not go away.  The release valve of talking to other neighbours and to share their experiences and to realise that they were not the only ones who are feeling the pressure, was taken away from them little bit.  I am acutely aware that.  This is why the On Feirm Ground project is so important.  The farm adviser is very trusted.  They are in the yard and they have that opportunity to lean over the gate and have that chat with the farmer at the end, and to identify if a farmer is in distress.  The adviser is also in a position to be able to signpost supports where he or she thinks they are needed.  I spoke about the innovation partnership models we have introduced.  A number of the approved European Innovation Projects, EIPs, will address issues the committee has raised such as farm succession and health and well-being.  These include the An Meitheal Feirme Project and Eco-T, which is a collaborative response to farmer mental health and suicide.  The mid-Leinster farming and well-being project will carry that out.  The farm family continuing professional development working group has also secured funding under the EIP.  It is very striking that of the successful applications coming through the EIP model, many of them incorporated the farmer mental health and well-being piece as an integral part of addressing other safety hazards on the farm.  They are inextricably linked, as the committee has also highlighted.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for inviting us to be here this evening.</p> <p>This evening's topic for discussion in the committee is farm safety and I will begin by telling members about how and why Embrace FARM was founded, and this involves telling our story.</p> <p>  I am from west Limerick.  I come from a large family of eight children and grew up in a small house with my siblings, parents and my father's brother and sister.  It was a typical Irish extended farm family.  Ten years ago, I met and married a pedigree Holstein dairy farmer.  As farms do not move, I now find myself living in lovely Laois.  As newlyweds we were in our own little happy bubble, we were renovating the old farmhouse and I found myself pregnant with our first child very quickly.  We were happy out on our journey and welcoming the start of our own little family.  Our daughter, Julie was born, and life could not have been any better at that stage.  We were navigating our way through having a newborn child, but all was good.  I arrived home from hospital on a Sunday, it was Father's Day and Brian&rsquo;s birthday.  Two days later, that happy little bubble was shattered into smithereens on our family farm.  Brian&rsquo;s dad Liam, a champion ploughman and community activist, was involved in an accident on our farm.  He was rushed to hospital and placed on life support.  Those machines were switched off three days later.  That began our journey into trauma and grief.</p> <p>  For me personally, to have no control over that journey was something I found very difficult because my everyday life was now consumed by my husband's grief and his family's grief.  Brian wanted to be strong, to be the fixer in the family and to take on his father&rsquo;s role, but he was obviously hurting and in shock.  He blamed himself for what had happened on our farm, as he was not with his father at the time of the accident.  "If only..." and "Why didn&rsquo;t I..." and "Why didn't he..." were a common theme and a common conversation in those days.  We coasted along, keeping our heads above water emotionally, trying to deal with something neither of us had ever been through before.</p><p>It was a true test in the early days of our marriage.</p><p> Our neighbours and extended family were the best to help, particularly as they are in all farming communities.  They milked our cows and did bits around the farm, but eventually they had to go back to their own lives.  Approximately 18 months later, we started to look for outside support that was specific to farming, but there was none to be found.  After many conversations, we decided to set up our own charity, Embrace FARM, which provides a support network to those affected by farm accidents and supports both the bereaved families and survivors of farm accidents.</p><p> The HSA can provide statistics on how many people die each year on our farms and give the breakdown on the cause of death.  Embrace FARM talks about the people behind those statistics.  We put a person to each one of those numbers and speak about the true toll of the devastation caused.  These farmers are more than just a number; they each leave a legacy behind them, none more so than to their families.</p><p> I would like to tell the committee about some of the people we encounter in Embrace FARM.  We meet women, at all stages of their lives, widowed and left behind to pick up the pieces, both emotionally and practically.  They face legal and financial difficulties.  There may be no will in place and they may not have access to the farm business bank account.  They face succession issues.  What does a young widow do with the farm?  Older widows may have an adult child to take over, but a younger widow with young children faces the dilemma of what to do: whether to farm it, lease it or sell it.   Should she hold onto it for her children?  Will they want to farm it in ten or 15 years' time?  There are so many questions to answer, but her husband is no longer there to help her figure it out.</p><p> On the issue of farm enterprise regulations or schemes, some widows are very familiar with the workings of daily farm life, but others are not.  How do they begin to navigate the myriad of paperwork in respect of meeting deadlines for schemes, regulations to be adhered to and decisions to be made?  One lady told us of how she used to see what the neighbour was at.  For example, if she saw that he was spreading slurry on a particular day, she knew she needed to get that done.  Another lady told us how she was fined by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for missing a deadline on a scheme that she did not even know she had to apply for.  Today, we were contacted by a widow who is looking for prayers and good wishes because she is facing a farm inspection.</p><p> These women are faced with their children's grief.  A mother's primary concern will be for her children and how they are coping.  The trauma a child goes through in witnessing their father or sibling being killed on the family farm is something that requires specialised help to get through.  In some instances, there is further family breakdown.  There are opinions on what a widow should do with the farm.  Her parents in-law will not be happy with her decisions and grandchildren face a further loss of contact with their grandparents because families fall out.  We have seen instances of injunctions being taken out against parents-in-law.  Thankfully, that is rare, but it does happen.</p><p> We encounter parents who have lost their children in traumatic circumstances.  Not always, but usually, it is the dad who is operating the machinery when such accidents happen.  I doubt that any of the members here today can even contemplate what the farmer goes through every day following such an incident.  One dad told us of presenting at the emergency department with chest pains.  After many tests had come back clear, it was obvious to all that the dad had a broken heart following the loss of his son.  The guilt and sense of responsibility that these dads have are no match for any amount of judgment they may face.  It is their life sentence.</p><p> We encounter adults who mourn the death of their father, the loss of their mentor and the person they worked with each day.  They try to take on their father's role within the family.  Sometimes it is welcomed by the other family members, and other times it is not.  Even if it is welcomed, it brings an added pressure.  Even if there is a will in place, there may be division in the family, as some may not be happy with the contents.  All of this is stress and pressure that is added to a person's grief, while they continue to farm, meet deadlines and rush against the weather.</p><p> We encounter men, and sometimes women, who have to adapt to living each day with a life-altering disability following an accident.  They need the strength to battle through the health system to have their voices heard.  Many are farmers who have lost a limb or sometimes, two limbs.  There is very little in the way of helping the farmer to adapt to the situation they find themselves in to be able to continue to farm.  Prostheses need to be changed regularly and there is a very outdated system in respect of how often a farmer can do that through the public health system.  The prosthetic is needed to enable the farmer to live as normal a life as possible and to carry on working their farm to the best of their ability.  When that is not in place, frequently, the farmer has to give up the enterprise they are involved in, often since childhood.  Addiction, depression and suicide ideation are common among survivors of farm accidents.  Living with daily pain does take its toll.  Can you imagine what phantom pain must feel like, when your brain thinks the limb is there when its not?  Farmers believe themselves to be custodians of the land, who pass it from one generation to the next.  For them to not be generation that can hand it on better than they got it, takes it toll on them.  A farmer who survives a life-altering farm accident feels obligated to put on a brave face, just because they survived.  The trauma of the accident, immediate recovery and rehabilitation not only affects the survivor, but also their spouse, children and extended family.  Everyone has to adapt to a new way of living.</p><p> Embrace FARM supports all of these people who unexpectedly find themselves on a journey of loss and trauma.  To help the well-being of our farm families, Embrace FARM has built a community of support in response to their needs.  Embrace FARM creates a space for people to connect and share their story with people who truly understand the devastating impact a farm tragedy has.  We currently support about 300 farm families in our peer-to-peer support network.</p><p> Embrace FARM has recently been successful in being awarded European innovation partnership, EIP, funding to enable us to put in place a structure of one-on-one support for farm families impacted by tragedies on our farms.  This will expand our services to include other types of sudden trauma, like suspected suicide on farms, and will enable us to support more farm families.  This funding is for one year and will enable us to get the work off the ground.  We extend our thanks to Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and the officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for this initiative.</p><p> As a point of note, I would like to mention that Embrace FARM is a registered charity in full compliance.  For the second time we have been shortlisted for the Good Governance Awards in the charity sector.  We pride ourselves in the correct running of our charity to the best of our knowledge.  Our annual remembrance service has been adopted by the group in Northern Ireland, which hosted its first service of remembrance on the 24 October.  The Farming Community Network in the UK will host its first service of remembrance on 7 November.  Up until now, Ireland was the only country to formally acknowledge the death of farmers in a national remembrance service.  It has done so since 2014.  Approximately 600 people attended the service this year, and during Covid times, in the region of 45,000 viewed it online.  The service is also broadcast on RT&Eacute;.</p><p> While Embrace FARM's focus is on picking up the pieces after tragedy happens on our farms rather than on farm safety preventative measures, we can talk about the impact of farm tragedies on our farms.  All of the health and safety experts that we have spoken with over the years tell us there is no one silver bullet to fix farm safety.  In recent years, I have noticed how the fixes are all shifting onto the behaviour of farmers.  I am no health and safety expert, but I feel this is a bit unfair.  While the farmers must take responsibility for their actions on the farm, they are not the entire agriculture sector, but one part of it.  There are people in these Houses and in Brussels who make legislation, officials in the Departments who enact that legislation and wider groups of processors,organisations, private companies and media outlets, among many others, who are also involved in the agriculture sector.  Their behaviour and our behaviour need to change.</p><p> If there is to be a cultural change in agriculture around the behaviours of farmers when it comes to farm safety, then that behaviour needs to change in the entire sector. Legislators must put the farmer first, not just the product they are producing.  Without the farmer, there is no product.</p><p>We are all able to sit here today because a farmer has provided food to sustain us.  Officials and processors, when doing their inspections, need to look further than just the farm gate and the operation of the enterprise.  What about the farmer's well-being?  The media need to stop printing images that condone unsafe practices.  These are just a few things.</p><p> All of us in the agriculture sector need to change our behaviour, not just farmers.  The farmer is just one person.  We, the agriculture sector, need to help farmers, not just shift the blame of farm safety to them without looking at ourselves as well.  Farmers are a resilient people and want to do their best for their land and animals.  I know in my home, as it is in many farmhouses, the animal and the human are treated as being as important as each other.  Even today, farmers face having changing regulations and climate action demands forced upon them.  Farmers want to do their best, with the help of others in the sector, but they do not want to be the only ones making sacrifices and changes.</p><p> I ask members to take a minute to remember a farmer in their localities.  I have no doubt each member will be able to recall someone who has lost his or her life tragically on a farm, whether through a farm accident, suicide or even a sudden medical event.  I would like members to think about that person and now the person's family who are left behind to pick up the pieces.  What happened to that farm family and the farm?  Sometimes bad things happen after a sudden and traumatic death on a farm.  These are usually driven by grief and trauma that is not being dealt with.  It can take many forms, including anger, resentment, isolation, depression, substance abuse, family breakdown and suicide.  It does not always end like this, of course, but for some farm families it does, and this is where Embrace FARM would like to help our farm families before things get very bad.</p><p> With me today are Mr. Brian Rohan, a dairy farmer from County Laois who is also co-founder and chairperson of our board of directors, and Ms Catherine Collins, our development manager.  I thank members for their time.  We welcome any questions they may have.</p></speech>

It was as heart-rending an opening statement as I have ever heard in this committee room.  Unfortunately, we have all walked into sitting rooms and living rooms after a tragic accident on a farm.  Ms Rohan's portrayal of the devastation that it causes is all too accurate.  We have also seen incidents where farmers have been badly hurt or injured and the devastation that it causes, as well as the significant financial hardship it can put on the family farm structure.  Farms usually only have one breadwinner.  If an accident happens, there are many different complications and permutations.  I compliment the witnesses on the group that they have set up and for the help which is given to the families concerned.  Having somebody to talk to can be very important.</p> <p>  I genuinely compliment the witnesses on their opening statement.  It was comprehensive and genuine.  Unfortunately, we all know too many horror stories.  I had a farm accident when I was a young man.  Thankfully, I have recovered reasonably well from it.  I cannot say that I have not lived a full life.  At the time, it put substantial financial pressure on our household.  I was 22 years old when it happened and my father was sick at the time, in the first stages of a long, painful illness.  That created significant pressure and worry for my parents.  I was in and out of hospital for three years.  Thankfully, I got back on my feet, and was one of the lucky ones, since I did not experience a real long-term impact.  Many people's lives have been devastated.  I compliment the witnesses on their opening statement and the work they are doing for families that so badly need somewhere to turn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.49" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#K00300"><p>I concur with every word the Chairman has just said.  I thank Ms Rohan for that opening statement.  I read it earlier today.  It was a rare moment where my breath caught.  Ms Rohan's delivery was even more forceful.  Her message has been heard loud and clear.  I was especially struck when she invited us all to remember people who have lost their lives.  All of us who are engaged on an ongoing basis with the agriculture sector could probably think of multiple people.  I express my condolences to the family of Tommy Feeney from my constituency, who was killed recently.  I did not know him but I know his death has had a substantial impact on his wife, their two young girls and the wider community.  I was talking to farmers dozens of miles away who were struck by just how quickly these things can happen.</p> <p>  There is a particular challenge for us because, as has been said, people who are often derisorily described as part-time farmers are usually full-time farmers with another full-time job.  That means, especially at this time of the year, that they are engaged in the most dangerous industry in the country, often in the dark, either early in the morning or late at night.  That creates significant challenges because, as Senator Daly said, it involves dealing with big, potentially dangerous animals, chemicals and powerful machinery weighing several tonnes, while working alone, which would not be permitted in any other sector, yet tens of thousands of people are doing it.</p> <p>  We need to take heed of Ms Rohan's final message that this cannot be left to people who have another full-time job because they cannot derive a sustainable income from their land.  As part of their role on the farm, as well as being the person who is dealing with the machinery and animals, a farmer is also expected to be an accountant, a bookkeeper, solicitor and legal expert and an expert on EU regulations and domestic legislation, as well as holding together a family, which can be stressful in the modern era.  Farmers cannot be held solely responsible for adopting and implementing a farm safety policy.  There need to be additional supports.</p> <p>  We previously discussed with the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, how the Government and Department clearly have a role that they need to take up.  There also has to be a role for the others along the market chain who are making money off an individual's work.  There is a role for processors, retailers, factories, supermarkets and all of us in society to recognise that we have a challenge.</p> <p>  I do not know if the witnesses heard our interaction with the Minister of State.  My specific question is about the issue of succession and the challenge it presents.  We asked whether the Department could do more to provide supports to families in that situation.  Ms Rohan's statement referred to a young wife who may not be from a farming background and is left with the burden of the farm and the challenges of knowing when the deadline for a scheme is.  We suggested that the Department establish a section to support families and take them step by step through all the processes.  The Minister of State indicated that a point person had been appointed.  I gather from the witnesses' statement that this is not sufficient.  I welcome any thoughts about how that could be improved.</p> <p>  Many good organisations support bereaved families.</p><p>I commend our guests on turning their family tragedy into a positive piece of action that has benefited hundreds of other families.  What needs to be done to support families who are in that position on farms and in terms of the wider supports that could be provided?</p><p> I apologise that I have to attend another meeting at 7.30 p.m., but I look forward to listening to the witnesses' responses until then.</p></speech>

However, when it comes to women who are not familiar with the daily working of the farm, they do not know how it works with the Department.  They do not know one scheme from another.  As they are in grief and shock and are traumatised, some can tend to be distrustful of their circle and are not sure where to turn or to whom to turn.  While the Department may have that one person, what the person is talking about makes no sense to the women, so it is not as straightforward as them just ringing up and getting an answer.  Brian might wish to speak on that.  He has quite a few stories about many of these women.</p></speech>

Dad died in 2012 and the single farm payment was introduced in that year, but in the following year we had to transfer the farm into my name and so forth.  My adviser applied for the basic payment that time in joint names because Dad and I were in joint partnership.  It was applied for in the names of Liam Rohan, deceased, and Brian Rohan.  About a month later, a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine official called out to me and said it was time I put the herd number in my name.  He asked me to sign the paperwork with him and I signed it.  In June of that year, another official from the Department rang me and said I had applied for the basic payment scheme in a partnership with one person who is deceased.  I said that was what my adviser did.  Then he said that a month later I changed the name into my own name.  I said that a departmental official came out and told me I needed to sign the paper.  I said that I tend to do what I am told by departmental officials so as not to get in trouble.  He said I should not have done that.  I asked how would I know and asked him what the problem was.  He said: "It means I have more paperwork to do".  I said I was sorry that my father being killed in a farm accident caused him more paperwork.</p> <p>  That led to an ongoing battle.  The official was to send out forms but they did not arrive.  There were forms to be signed.  He said that if I just had the cop on to fill up an ERAD 2 form, put the details on it and send it back, he would look after it and that would have been done.  However, he was fairly ignorant about it.  I had to make a call to a friend of mine in the Department and he said I needed to talk to a certain man.  I rang him and he told me he would bring the form home with him that night and give it to me to fill it up.  He rang me the next day to tell me it was resolved.  I am used to dealing with the Department and perhaps meeting somebody who is not as efficient as somebody else.  I thought about a widow who knows nothing about farming getting that type of answer from a guy on the telephone.  She is bad enough as she is with her grief without having to deal with that type of hardship.</p> <p>  When it came to basic payment time the following October, I was seeking my 70% like everybody else.  It did not come.  We had to change bank accounts.  Every week that I rang I was told I was cleared for payment, but when Tuesday came there was no payment.  The following Tuesday there was no payment and I rang again.  I have a fair amount of patience, but it was beginning to run out.  Eventually, on the Saturday before Christmas that year I finally got my payment.  I was told to ring Cavan because the Department did not have my bank details, but I had rung the Department a month previously and was told it had the bank details.  Eventually, I got my 70% on the Saturday before Christmas.  The disadvantaged area payment had not come in and I had to start the process again in January.  It was February in the following year before I got my payment.  I felt I had enough to do to run the farm from day to day and to deal with everything else without having to chase up what is my money.</p></speech>

In fairness, he was trying to come for about a month, so we picked that Monday.  He arrived and the job was done and dusted in about two hours.  It was to make sure that the food I am producing is quality assured.  On the Tuesday, I had an unannounced health and safety inspection.  The guy arrived and I told him I had no objection to the inspection but asked if there was any chance it could be done on the following day.  The cattle were out and we were stripping the silage pit for the first time.  I told him we were trying to get the cattle in, that I wanted to get the pit stripped and get them in.  I asked him if he could come back the following day or the next day.  "No", he said, "it has to be done today and will only take an hour".  We downed tools and two and a half hours later he was in and out and then gone.  We had to leave the cattle out for another day.  We got them in on the following day and at 2.15 p.m., when we were having a cup of tea after dinner, the telephone rang.  It was an official from the Department to tell me that he was there for a full cross-compliance inspection.  He had been there two years previously for another full cross-compliance inspection.  I passed both times, by the way.  Messing with him, I told him politely to eff off, but I went down the yard and met him.  We started it at 2.30 p.m. and he was there until 6.30 p.m.  He was back the next day from 11 a.m. until 4 p.m.  That was four days of my week gone.  I just had to drop tools.</p> <p>  That type of pressure should not be put on any farmer.  It was a very busy time of the year.  We had to do it and we have no choice but to do it.  I spoke to somebody in the HSA.  We are friendly with one of the senior inspectors and he sits on our board.  I told him I had the inspection and asked if, after a fatal farm accident, there was not a signpost put up that there has been a fatal accident on the farm.  He said, "I am surprised you had it, but I am not surprised you passed it".  That is how he put it.  He knows me and he knows the farm.  The boardroom for Embrace FARM was our kitchen table until the Covid pandemic.  Now, like everybody else, we are on Zoom.</p> <p>  Those types of pressures, added to perhaps taking bad prices, being hit with bad weather and the like can really get to farmers.  The departmental official who was doing the inspection told me that he often calls to farmers and said that he would know by them when they open their doors that they are not in a good place mentally.  However, he said that inspectors are told to go in unannounced and carry out the inspection.  In one particular case, he said, "I walked away from him and told him I would call back another day", and he went away.  The farmer was on his mind.  The farmer was lucky he had that inspector because I met another unhelpful inspector at another time and I would not like him calling into anybody who was in a bad mental state because he would not do any good for him.</p></speech>

Mr. Rohan said he has patience.  By God, he had some patience putting up with that type of carry-on and when there is pure stupidity like that.  I congratulate Embrace FARM and say &quot;Well done&quot; for the services being provided.  As Ms Rohan said in her statement, behind every one of those accidents there is a family, not a number.  I lost my nephew to a silly farm accident a long time ago.  It is not a number, but someone who has left behind a father, mother or family.  I am in awe of the services the organisation is providing for families.  I can imagine that in my situation, and everybody else here is in the same boat, if these types of services had been available it would have made a massive difference to families over the years.</p><p>The opening statement said that legislators need to put the farmers first, not just the product they are producing.  To be honest, in my time on this committee it appears that with the requirements and regulations that are imposed on farmers, both domestically and by the European Union, alongside the need to be profitable or to break even, at least, our farmers' well-being is being pretty much overlooked.  What can we do?  Do the witnesses have suggestions for what we can do, as legislators, to address this?  In particular, when regulations are passed for farmers and new demands are made, for example, in the case of slurry and soiled water storage, should the regulations be accompanied either by a health and safety message or assistance for farmers?  On the same theme, there is new machinery coming on line all the time and demands are being made of farmers when it comes to the machinery they should use.  Is training in the correct use of that machinery ever an issue?  Could more be done either by the Department or the manufacturers?  I would like to hear the witnesses' opinion on that.</p><p>On the mental health aspect, I recently read a report in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>on mental health and how the ripple effect of changes to the agricultural policy and the restructuring of farming have an impact on the mental health of farmers.</p><p>Is this something our guests have seen or become aware of?  Is attention being paid to it, given the changes the farming community faces?  Do our guests have any suggestions about how to address that need?</p></speech>

Nevertheless, legislation and regulations have their part to play and they are there for a reason.  When legislators are producing legislation, focusing on the product is only one aspect.  Farmers' well-being has to be side by side with that, not at the bottom of the pile.  The Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, has committed that in the new Food Vision 2030 policy, the farmer will be up there, although I am not sure about that.  Similarly, the Health and Safety Authority and its officials want farmers to be safe.   They do not want them injuring themselves or dying.</p> <p>  Even so, when these people are front-facing with farmers, there is a way to deal with and interact with people.  It might be a suggestion for the Department to have a psychotherapist or psychologist on its payroll to help with training of officials and so on.  There are no official figures from the CSO on farmer suicide in Ireland that we can get our hands on.  Apparently, our country is too small and it is too easy to identify people.  Based on the figures from the UK, however, we estimate approximately one farmer per week takes his or her own life.  That is an estimate but-----</p></speech>

The CSO argues the country is too small and the people can be identified.  The estimate nonetheless is that one farmer takes his or her own life every week.  Ms Collins might wish to comment on legislation, regulations and mental health.</p></speech>

We should imagine them producing the product productively and economically for the country and ask who that affects throughout the supply chain.  That needs to be examined as a whole rather than just in respect of the individual farmer.</p> <p>  Mental health campaigns happen specifically in the summertime, at the height of the farming season.  Peter Hynes has started the new Ag Mental Health Week in Cork, which will focus on the autumn.  There is also the time of year from January to May when it is considered as well.  The Department should get behind that a little more, flag it and offer more supports, and have more discussion of mental health.  That is the problem.  People do not want to talk about it and the stigma is still there, especially in rural Ireland.  From our perspective, we have found that suicide ideation goes hand in hand with grief and loss.  There are mothers who just do not want to continue and who exist just because of their children.  There are farmers who have had limbs amputated and have had the same circumstances leading to the addiction issues Ms Rohan mentioned earlier.</p> <p>  Retraining and redirection could be better examined.  I can think of one person who has tried several roads he would like to go down but, because he is in his 60s, he is coming up against so many issues and he cannot continue farming.  In theory, he should be able to continue farming for at least another five years, until the statutory retirement age.  Small matters such as that could be adjusted and made more accessible to help with people's mental health and well-being.  That is part of the process of recovery, especially for the survivor of a farm accident.</p></speech>

The Health and Safety Authority has indicated that, in many cases, the farmer's wife is sent to complete the course and tick that box because the farmer is too busy to spend the half day doing the training, although I completed the half-day training myself because I wanted to see what goes on at these training courses.  The Health and Safety Authority has trained people in State bodies to conduct these training courses but what I witnessed that day was horrendous.  We were shown a picture of a tractor that had been overturned, with blood on the yard, and the man asked what we thought of it.  He said an 80-year-old man with a tractor had lifted the loader too high, gone down a rough lane, turned over and was killed.  We were told also about a farmer who had brought his five-year-old son onto the yard and asked whether it would be okay for him to be left loose on the yard while the father was feeding the cattle.</p> <p>  I lost my own dad.  Thankfully for me, he did not die at home and got to the hospital, but there are many families where the father was driving a tractor that drove over his son, or where a son was with the father who was attacked by a cow.  There has to be a better way to do this training than by showing these pictures.  Survivors or people who have lost somebody and gone through an accident can deliver the training much better than some of these training professionals.  We have to think of the people who have been affected.  No questions were asked about whether anybody in attendance had lost anybody in a farm accident or had suffered a farm accident.  It was just a matter of doing the two or three hours' training that day and some of the stuff was horrendous.</p></speech>

Their opening statement was fantastic and set a tone for the debate, which is one we need to have more often.  I acknowledge their presence and welcome them.</p> <p>  I made a couple of notes while they were speaking.  I asked myself what would happen if I died tomorrow morning.  How would my wife, Catherine, survive?  I was thinking about how the bank account and the co-operative are both in my name and asking how that would work.  Is my will up to date?  I was thinking of issues all the way down to the coroner's court and the Teagasc adviser.  There are so many to address in regard to how a farmer's family would survive if he or she was no longer at home.  A great deal of communication is required.  My discussion group and others need to be involved in order that we can prepare for what, unfortunately, could happen, although we hope it will not.  That will be an issue for us a society and an industry.</p> <p>  Mr. Rohan spoke about training courses and I have a great story about them.  A colleague of mine in a different industry ran a health and safety training course and was trying to get about 15 lads through it.  They were not engaging, so the man in charge of the course began talking about children, what would happen if they were choking and what way the men would cut their sausages.  The 15 of them perked up straight away and everyone started listening.  When an issue affects people or they think it is logical, they will engage straight away.  This is about engaging and trying to ensure we get out the message that we should not rush, even though that is something we all do.</p> <p>  The issue of how a family will survive after an accident is very important.  We all know somebody, perhaps in our townland or parish, who has, unfortunately, lost a limb.  I have a neighbour in the townland next to me who lost a limb when he was 12 years of age from a PTO shaft.  We have all lost neighbours over recent years and we all know exactly who has been lost and how.  How we deal with that as a society is the big issue.  That debate and trying to get that information out there is the most important matter.</p> <p>  I have spoken previously about young drivers of quads and similar issues that need to be raised.  Is it appropriate that a 16-year-old might drive a charter that can do 60 km/h and carry 25 tonnes behind it?  There is demand for these girls and boys in summertime but there needs to be a debate in society as to when we should say "stop".  That will be a difficult debate because we are working harder to provide for our families but, unfortunately, we are putting ourselves at risk.  The debate on when to say "stop" will be the most important one.</p> <p>  Our guests' services are very important, both for society and for those who are left behind.  They concern a big issue and I compliment them on those services.  A farm fatality is shocking but, in many ways, a farm accident is just as bad.</p><p>It means that people might not have the ability to take full control of the farm in the same way as they did previously.  I have a personal friend who is in that scenario.  As a farmer with a young family, dealing with that, mentally in particular, is a trauma not alone for him but the entire family and, probably, the entire community as well.  There are so many moving parts to this.  The most important part is the participation of services like Embrace FARM.  It gives a focus so that people can talk about it, get involved and acknowledge that there is a problem.  We need to start scenario planning for the "What if?"  That is what I am taking away from this debate.  We need to start that scenario planning because, God forbid, there are an awful lot of things that would need to be tied up if that is not done.  I compliment the witnesses on their work.  What do they think we, as a committee, can do?  Where do we need to go?  </p><p> Several years ago, the Seanad Public Consultation Committee did a report on farm safety and raising awareness around farm safety.  Senator Paul Daly and I, as members of that committee, were very involved in that work.  Do we need to do more?  What are the issues about which we need to raise awareness?  Where do the witnesses think this debate is going to go?  In terms of the mental health issue, as it gets darker earlier in the evening, people have too much time to think.  That is a big issue that we need to start talking about.  Peter Hynes was mentioned, whom I know personally.  He is a very good advocate on this issue.  I often say to him that he does his best to drive me mad about date nights.  He continuously does so every Saturday night.  He is out to show us all up.  We have to have time for ourselves and our families as well.  It is not just all about work.  I thank the witnesses for being here.  This has been one of the most important discussions we have had as a committee.  I acknowledge the wonderful contributions of the organisation.</p></speech>

Following on from his remarks with regard to Mr. Hynes, kindness, acknowledgement and talking are important things.  Farming is a male dominated sector.  They say men do not talk, but I reckon farmers do a lot of chatting.  As I said earlier, I am not a health and safety expert.  In terms of a cultural change around behaviours, there is no point in expecting one part of the sector to do that on its own while everybody else goes about their own business.  It has to start in every part of the sector.  The legislators need to make the farmer as important as the product that is being produced.  There is no product without the farmer.</p> <p>  Senator Lombard spoke about mental health, isolation and so on.  The farmer is all of the time having to fight for his or her spot or place.  We need a lot more joined up thinking in every area rather than just a focus on the product.  We need to focus on the farmer as well, and his or her family.  It has been said many times that agriculture is the backbone of this country.  We need to place the value on the farmer and the family and to respect all of them for what they have done and the legacy that they leave behind.  As I said, we are all here today because farmers produce food for us to eat.  We need to come together and support the farmers to do the work they need to do, without constantly imposing more regulations and legislation on them.  I accept that the latter have to happen, but there is a way to do them.  You cannot just go in and make demands.  You need to talk to people and treat them with respect and kindness.  That will go a long way towards bringing a cultural change.  That is my humble opinion.</p></speech>

We could have a broader corporate social responsibility.  In other words, everybody across the sector would pledge towards the safety, security and responsibility of the sector.  This goes hand-in-hand with what is happening with the climate change responsibility which we all have to adapt to and take on at the moment.  We need an industry-wide message that every aspect of the supply chain for the agriculture sector has to buy into, from the processors to the farm workers and right up to top, inclusive of everybody who is in this room this evening.  That might be one way of addressing it, to begin with.</p></speech>

On the question of what would happen if we were not operational in the morning, we initially set up Embrace FARM to facilitate a remembrance service on the last Sunday of June, which was to be held annually.  That was it.  We had a great PR person behind us.  He got us into the newspapers and on radio and television interviews.  I am not a person who likes public speaking, and never have done, even when I was at school.  My father, Lord have mercy on him, was into public speaking, but I am not.  However, I just had to step up and do it.  We were receiving emails at 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. from widows telling us their life stories.  As stated, in one particular email, which was two or three pages long, a widow set out her life story to us as strangers.  Her partner of many years was killed.  They had two children.  The bank accounts were immediately frozen.  She had a good job, but the farm needed to be looked after.  In fairness, her partner's brothers came on board and supported her 100%.  They also engaged with the co-operative and got it the co-op name changed into her name so that when the corn was cut she would get the money from the corn to give her some sort of income.  It took six years for her to get her bank account opened.  Her partner was a contractor and so there was money owed, but she does not think she got half that money.  The genuine customers paid up for bailing or cutting corn and so on, but an awful lot more walked away.  She then had to hire two solicitors, one to represent her and the other to represent her two children.  One third of the farm was required to be held in trust for the two children until they reached 18 years of age and she got the remaining two thirds, but she did not know if her son would be interested in farming.  At the moment, he wants to be a contractor like his father was.  He is currently 21 years of age and he is starting into the contracting game.</p> <p>  Again, for the past few years it has been all about developing farms and pushing on as the production of milk quotas is gone.  If you walk into the bank and get approval for &euro;500,000 loan you must take out life cover on that loan, which you cancel the following week.  I have said previously at meetings that if you borrow &euro;500,000 you are responsible for it and if you are not here next week the family is responsible for it, but if a person has life insurance the loan is taken care of.  It is one less worry for the family at a time when they are grieving.  That might be something that requires to be changed by the banking sector.  In other words, if a farmer borrows, be it &euro;100,000 or &euro;500,000, life cover must be put in place and cannot be cancelled.  </p></speech>

Like other speakers, in preparation for meetings I read through the submissions in order that I could prepare questions for the witnesses.  However, following on from the submission given today, the questions I had intended to ask have been already answered.  It was one of the best and most moving submissions I have ever heard at this committee.</p> <p>  By way of history, in 1983 I ploughed my first all-Ireland in Waterford in the under 21 section.  I was a young lad, mad to get out the traps.  At the time, John Summers, John Treacy, Martin Kehoe, Willie Ryan and Liam Rohan were the lads we aspired to be.  I might as well be honest; I never made it.  I cannot see it happening when it did not happen before now.  I think it was in 1986 Liam Rohan won the all-Ireland outright.  He won a few stubbles, but having done two together he won outright.  He represented Ireland at world championships on four occasions.  In terms of what the witnesses have done, at the time of his death or before it, representing Ireland was probably the legacy, but I can guarantee them today that if he could come back, they would be the legacy.  Embrace FARM is the legacy.  It would out trump him having represented Ireland.  The work Embrace FARM is doing is fantastic.  He could not but be proud.  That in itself has to be a solace for them, which solace they are now providing for other families.  I cannot compliment them enough.  It must mean so much to families to have available to them a service that was not available to the witnesses.  As mentioned in the submission, when they sought help it was not there but rather than walk away frustrated they set about fixing that for other people.  That is to be highly commended.</p><p>I have some short questions based on a couple of things Ms Rohan has said.  With regard to the European Innovation Partnerships, EIP, funding for one year, what happens next year?  Without going into detail, are there are many other families who are prepared to row in with Embrace FARM?  When something happens to you, people always say it is great to talk to somebody who has been there before.  Ms Rohan has been there and is talking to all of those families.  Are many others prepared to row in, talk to people and help?  Are there many who are willing to club in with Embrace FARM to make it bigger?</p><p> Ms Rohan has said she is not a safety expert.  There is a big issue, which Senator Lombard has mentioned.  When I was young, I started driving a grey Ferguson before moving on to a Massey Ferguson 135 and Massey Ferguson 165.  I had a bit of experience before I got into what you would call a half-decent tractor.  Now young lads are stepping up.  Something has to be done about it, to be honest.  It will not be popular with the 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds who are looking for licences and who think they will be drawing silage next year but something has to be done there.  You have to have a bit of experience before you are put up on a massive machine.  I do not know how to handle that but, as Senator Lombard has said, it is something we definitely need to look into.  </p><p> Earlier, in our meeting with the Minister of State, we mentioned the difficulties some families have had with the Department after a death, accident or tragedy, which the witnesses highlighted in their submission.  I have no doubt he will pursue that matter.  The Minister of State was a bit taken aback when some sections of the Embrace FARM submission were quoted.  I have no doubt but that he will pursue the matter and I will certainly be pursuing him to do so.  It is heart-wrenching.  My own uncle died just a couple of months ago.  It was recorded as a farm accident but it was a heart condition.  He was dead before he crashed the tractor.  I see what is going on in the family and the grief they feel.  They are trying to sort things out.  He was a bachelor.  My mother and his other sister and brothers are looking for things in the house but do not know where anything is.  I know exactly what it is like because I have lived it.  Everybody has, as the Chairman said earlier.  You do not need an unhelpful Department official or a letter saying you are not getting paid because you missed a deadline, which was a week after the family tragedy, on top of that.  There has to be a little bit of leeway within the Department.  We will be pursuing that with the Minister.</p><p> On behalf of everybody, I again thank the witnesses.  They have done a lot for many people.  It is a pleasure to have them here today.</p></speech>

It was addressed at the time, when Deputy Coveney was the Minister in charge.  The examples I gave in my opening statement illustrate the issues we have encountered with families.</p> <p>  With regard to 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds, as a mother, I will ask who wants to see a 16-year-old up on a tractor with a big piece of machinery attached to the back of it?  I do not believe anyone thinks that is right.  God love the 16-year-old or 17-year-old.  I am sure that is where he or she wants to be but there should be adequate precautions and regulations in that area.  Again, it is up to the Department and legislators to address that.  These are the Houses that make that kind of legislation.</p> <p>  With regard to the EIPs, the &euro;300,000 we are about to receive is for one year.  However, I believe that the Minister would say that there will be further road for a number of those projects at the end of those 12 months.  I am not too sure what that means at this point.  We are putting a little bit of that &euro;300,000 in funding aside to look at the sustainability of the project to ensure we can fund it for year 2 and year 3.  It provides one-on-one support for farm families and mentors and helps them through a process of grieving and some practical issues.  There is a fine line as to how much advice we can give when mentoring widows and others as to how to deal with the issues they are facing.  We want to look at that.  We currently provide peer-to-peer support.  Before Covid, we held residential weekends.  We hope to get back to them in the springtime.  We bring a number of families together.  These groups may comprise a number of widows or a number of farm families where children have lost their dad or a sibling.  While Embrace FARM facilitates these meetings of people and families and while a trained psychotherapist is also involved, those families help each other and tell each other their stories.  They become their own support network.  Since the start of the Covid pandemic, most of our stuff has gone online.  We are doing as best as we can online but there is nothing like meeting in person.  We have very active WhatsApp groups involving survivors of farm accidents.  We also have a widows' group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#O00300"><p>I thank Ms Rohan, Mr. Rohan and Ms Collins.  There is no family who has not come near a tragedy in their lives.  As the witnesses were talking earlier, I remembered what happened to my own brother-in-law a long time ago.  He had five young kids and another on the way.  Unfortunately, he fell off a load of straw.  A few things touched me.  Senator Paul Daly brought up a problem with bank accounts and everything being frozen.  Is there any way a charter or guidebook could be developed?  I listened to Mr. Rohan speaking about nearly everyone calling everyone, one day after another.  Could this committee or the Department help Embrace FARM with a charter which would result in a red flag in the event of a tragedy, meaning that there would be no inspection for a year and that all the different people who would give you a headache would not come around while you are in distress and while things are tender?</p> <p>  I remember setting up a turf cutters and contractors group.  There were three or four of us.  There was a lot of pressure on those three or four people.  How are the three witnesses coping?  Do they have support they need to answer every phone call and email and to organise the weekends Ms Rohan talked about and the psychotherapists or psychologists?  What is the structure?  Is there a great burden on a few, as is the case for many different organisations and groups?  If there is not, that is great, but if there is, how do the witnesses envisage that issue being resolved?  No more than with anything people do, you would crack up if there is too much pressure on you constantly over a long time.</p> <p>  With regard to funding, Ms Rohan seems to think there might be more funding streams available next year.  Will she come back to the committee if there is a problem in that regard, because I am sure everyone here will be willing to help?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.74" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Norma Rohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#O00400"><p>With regard to developing a charter or guidelines, working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we welcome working with anyone to make any farm family's life easier in the aftermath.  Our current structure is that we have a voluntary board of directors, of which Brian is the chair.  There are ten directors including people who have been affected personally and people from the agriculture industry who know how to run a business.  The team that works for Embrace FARM comprises Ms Collins and me.  I work part-time for 20 hours a week while Ms Collins works 25 hours a week.  That is it.  With the new funding of &euro;300,000 we are getting from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we will be employing one person full time and another person part time.  Again, that funding is only for 12 months.  I am living on a prayer that there will be a few bob to be got after those 12 months.  I welcome the Deputy's invitation to come back to the committee in 12 months for help in getting a few bob more.  We would gladly take it.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the burden.  There is a great burden on charities to operate with good governance.  When Brian and I first started out, another charity was falling apart due to mismanagement and embezzlement of funds.</p><p>As husband and wife we were determined from day 1 we would do the governance right, and we pride ourselves on that.  However, as any charity will tell you, there is a huge burden on charities to comply with that regulation.  It is the law and we must comply with it.  We do that but it is cumbersome.  The team is myself and Ms Collins.  Between the two of us we are one full-time person.</p></speech>

When does the funding for Embrace FARM start?</p></speech>

We signed the official contract on 23 October so it is for 12 months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#P00400"><p>I see.  I suggest the committee write to the Minister to see if we can get a long-term pledge that kind of funding would roll over for more than one year.  I appreciate &euro;300,000 is grand for one year but I imagine from all the work our guests have detailed to us, that it will go very quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#P00500"><p>Just to clarify, the funding is to run the programme.  The programme is to expand into different types of sudden death and traumas on farms.  We still have to run our regular services as we are currently doing.  That runs separately from the programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021110300002#P00600"><p>I imagine that for the long term, our guests want to know now that projects can continue beyond 23 October next year.  I suggest it would be appropriate that the committee write to processors, the IFA and all those bodies.  The kind of work being done by Embrace FARM is priceless.  The sum involved is a pittance when you consider the anguish and distress families go through, and &euro;300,000 was mentioned.  Not just the Minister and the Department but farming organisations should really get on board and support our guests as well.  I do not know if is appropriate for the committee to get involved.</p></speech>

It is, as I said at the start, a charity doing invaluable work.  It is about more than the fatalities.  Where someone is injured, the problems may not be as bad but there can be huge financial issues for a family when someone gets badly hurt.  At our next private meeting we will put together a note to go to the Minister.</p></speech>

That is providing a residential bereavement weekend once a year for each cohort.  The new programme costs &euro;300,000.  We would welcome any support we can get.</p></speech>

You all took on this work on a voluntary basis.  Unfortunately, it was born out of tragedy you had in your own families on your own farms.  We will try to get this formalised and get it on a formal footing.</p> <p>  What Deputy Martin Browne said about going to the industry and processors would be up to our guests themselves as an organisation.  The work our guests do is invaluable.  Again, I sincerely thank them for coming in this evening.  Often we have confrontation in this room where witnesses are getting cross-examined.  That definitely was not the case this evening.  I thank our guests for taking the time to come in.  If we can be of any help to Embrace going forward, just communicate with us.  As I said, we will sit down at our next meeting and discuss how we can open up negotiations between our guests and the Department to get their funding onto a formal footing.  I most certainly cannot see any member of the committee objecting to that because our guests have seen the sentiment is unanimous around the room.  No-one can help but admire the work our guests have done.  Unfortunately, it spawned out of tragedy but it is to be commended to the highest degree.  As I said, if there are any issues with which our guests want help they should feel free to contact the committee and we will do our best.  I give them a commitment we will contact the Minister as an Oireachtas committee to see how we can formalise funding for the organisation.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Department and the officials there have their own protocols and legislation.  They cannot always cross over the line informally to help families.  If that is something we as a charity within the sector can help with through a discussion with the Department, it is something we can discuss going forward.</p></speech>

On the model Embrace has, our guests are far more knowledgeable than anyone else about what is needed out there.  I do not think the Department or we as a committee are going to prescribe to our guests.  They know exactly what is needed and how to go about it.</p></speech>

I thank members for their good comments.  We were up here in the Seanad a few years ago.  I think Senator Paul Daly was there.  I am not sure if Senator Lombard was there.  Senator Conway proposed a discussion on farm safety.  I do not think much has happened with that proposal since.  I would like to think that moving forward now are getting serious.  We did think when Covid hit that farm accidents and fatalities would rise with children at home from school and perhaps daddy trying to home-school and farm and mammy on the front line and not there.  Thankfully however, numbers have dropped but one is one too many.  We need to look at that going forward.  Again, on behalf of Embrace FARM, I thank the committee for the invitation.</p></speech>

I welcome members participating in today's committee meeting in line with exceptional circumstances and measures we have to take due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Attendees are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene.  They will notice that every second seat has been removed in order to facilitate social distancing.  I urge those attending not to move any chair from its current position.  They should always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should always be worn during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for members' full co-operation on this.  Any member participating in the meeting remotely is required to participate from within the Leinster House complex only.  Members will be well aware of this requirement.</p> <p>  Today we are considering the issue of the challenges to Ireland's competitiveness.  At the end of September 2021, the chair of the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, NCPC, launched the report, Ireland's Competitive Challenge 2021.  As well as immediate competitive issues that require urgent attention, the NCPC identified in the report four broad medium-term and long-term strategic challenges aimed at enhancing Ireland's competitiveness and productivity performance, including ensuring Ireland has a dynamic business environment, increases productivity growth, delivers infrastructure to meet evolving demands and implements progress, sustainability and inclusivity policies.  The report also made 20 recommendations to the Government to facilitate economic recovery and improvement in the standard of living across society.</p> <p>  More generally, there is a broad understanding of the difficulties, including bottlenecks, difficulties in securing supplies in materials and rising prices, being experienced by many sectors at present as the economy recovers.  Many members have raised these issues in recent meetings of the committee.</p> <p>  To assist the committee in its consideration of the challenges to Ireland's competitiveness, I welcome from the NCPC, Mr. Oliver Gilvarry, head of the NCPC secretariat, and Ms Linda Kane, economist.  The chair of the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, Dr. Frances Ruane, was unable to participate in today's meeting.</p> <p>  I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter if they so wish.</p> <p>  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The Department's opening statement has been circulated to members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I now invite Mr. Gilvarry to make an opening statement on behalf of the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council.</p></speech>

I pass on the apologies of Dr. Frances Ruane, chair of the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, who, due to a family commitment outside the country, cannot attend today.  I am head of the secretariat for the council and I will be representing Dr. Ruane today.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Linda Kane, economist in the secretariat.</p> <p>  The National Competitiveness Council, NCC, was established by government in 1997 under the Partnership 2000 agreement.  The council serves as an independent voice and reports in an advisory capacity to the Taoiseach and Government, through the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, on issues affecting competitiveness and productivity in the Irish economy.  Initially, the council&rsquo;s mandate was concerned with competitiveness issues.  However, issues concerning productivity have seen increased policy focus in all advanced economies since the establishment of council.  This has been in response to the slowing pace of productivity growth in that period despite significant technological advancements.</p> <p>  The importance of supporting productivity growth has also been recognised by the European Union.  In 2016, the European Council recommended the establishment of national productivity boards by all euro area countries.  In March 2018, the Government designated the then National Competitiveness Council as the body responsible for analysing developments and policies in the field of productivity and competitiveness in Ireland.  This was reflected in the NCC's change of name to the NCPC in 2020.</p> <p>  The council members, who serve in a voluntary capacity, are appointed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and are drawn from civil society.  These members bring to the table an understanding and experience of the factors that affect the competitiveness of the Irish economy and of the policy domains that can influence productivity levels in Ireland.</p> <p>  While the council&rsquo;s mandate is wide, involving both macro and micro perspectives on the economy, its particular focus is on competitiveness and productivity issues.  It recognises the roles of other bodies that have been created since its establishment and draws on, rather than duplicates, their work.  The council provides an evidence base for its policy recommendations.  The NCPC regularly publishes two benchmark statistical reports, the costs of doing business in Ireland report and Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness scorecard.  Each year, the council publishes the competitiveness challenge, which outlines the main challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and makes policy recommendations to address these.  Since last year, the Government, through the Department of the Taoiseach, issues a formal response to the council&rsquo;s competitiveness challenge recommendations.  It is expected the response to this year&rsquo;s report will be published before the end of November.</p> <p>  In addition to these main deliverables, the council also produces a series of short bulletins on specific competitiveness issues.  For example, so far in 2021, there have been a number of bulletins issued by the council examining topics such as remote working, insurance costs and international competitiveness rankings.  I will now provide an outline the main issues discussed in this year&rsquo;s challenge. </p> <p>  At the start of the pandemic, the Government moved quickly to introduce a suite of supports for employees and businesses.  The cost of these measures has totalled in excess of &euro;38 billion, or almost one fifth of national income as measured by GNI*, but these measures have helped to avoid an even more severe economic recession and massive economic hardship.</p> <p>  The council, in this year&rsquo;s challenge, has made clear that in the short term there is a continuing need to support workers and businesses as the economy reopens and restrictions are relaxed.  However, these immediate challenges resulting from the pandemic should not distract Ireland from addressing structural weaknesses that work against long-run competitiveness and more widespread productivity growth.  In addressing these long-term issues, the council strongly believes that a systemic policy approach is required, with careful sequencing of targeted actions that can generate the greatest impact in the near term and position the economy for medium to long-term sustainable growth.  This will require policymakers to tackle some major issues that have proven intractable in the past.  The council has made 20 tangible, actionable policy recommendations to the Government in a number of key strategic areas which address both immediate competitiveness issues and more medium-term challenges, aimed at enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and productivity performance.  I will now outline these in more detail, starting with the immediate challenges identified by the council.  </p> <p>  The economic recovery plan published by the Government in July, along with the recent budget, have outlined the Government&rsquo;s plan for phasing out the various supports provided to businesses as the economy recovers.</p><p>This will require moving away from the broad-based supports provided to all businesses during the pandemic to identifying those businesses or sectors that may continue to need support but which have the ability to grow in the future.  This will require designing appropriate new support mechanisms that will target aid to businesses that are viable but vulnerable.</p><p> As this process begins for withdrawing support schemes and better targeting others, it is vital we have the appropriate insolvency framework in place in Ireland to help struggling businesses restructure.  The recently introduced new regime that provides an alternative route for smaller businesses to restructure their liabilities, the small companies administrative rescue programme, SCARP, is an important step.  While it is important to support businesses as they transition to the new post-Covid environment, it is equally important employees who have either been out of work and in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, or who may lose their jobs in those businesses that will close or restructure in the coming weeks and months continue to be supported.</p><p> To manage this process successfully, the Government will need to allocate its resources to aid workers impacted by the pandemic, alongside and in line with the supports for businesses.  This will include the ability for firms to access help to pay mandatory redundancy or to ensure workers are not disadvantaged from having a break in service due to PUP when their mandatory redundancy is being calculated in the future.  In helping people back to work, the economic recovery plan includes a pillar focused on that objective.  The plan&rsquo;s objective to have 2.5 million people back at work by 2024 is welcome, but it is critical the required actions are undertaken quickly and there is a focus on those aged under 25 years.  The Pathways to Work 2021-2025 Strategy will need to ensure this is achieved, and the council welcomed the specific focus this has on younger workers.  In particular this includes the ring-fencing of roles for younger workers on workplace experience programmes, promoting apprenticeships, and incentives for employers when recruiting younger workers.  The focus on apprenticeship as a core skills development option for employers across all sectors of the economy, and for workers across all sections of society, is one that can make a significant contribution to addressing Ireland&rsquo;s skills needs, especially in response to the changes being brought about by the green and digital agendas.</p><p> As I stated earlier, these short-term challenges facing the economy should not distract policymakers from dealing with structural weaknesses that work against long-run competitiveness and productivity growth.  The pandemic has ushered in new ways of working for many people in certain sectors and occupations.  In turn, these may open up possibilities for new ways of living, potentially improving quality of life.  In the face of these changes, Ireland must have a clear vision on our collective priorities in the years ahead.  Our competitiveness and productivity performance must deliver for all parts of society, and this will require concerted effort from consumers, employees, enterprises and Government.</p><p> The council has recommended to Government that four key competitiveness and productivity strategic challenges should be focused on over the next decade.  First, Ireland needs to have a dynamic business environment that supports entrepreneurs and enhances employment opportunities.  To achieve this, it is important Ireland addresses the levels of costs businesses face in operating in Ireland.  The council has focused on the cost of insurance, legal costs and the cost of credit and has made a number of recommendations in these areas.</p><p> Second, Ireland&rsquo;s productivity growth needs to be more broad-based, requiring policies to be put in place to boost the productivity of indigenous Irish firms.  To achieve this objective, the council has a number of recommendations, including support for research in the area of productivity growth; assistance for new ways of working, including remote working; and the provision of the appropriate training and upskilling initiatives so workers have suitable skills for the future world of work, including the need for employees to have the appropriate management skills for this new environment.</p><p> Third, Ireland needs to address the delivery of key housing infrastructure, together with other critical social and economic infrastructure projects.  In addition to its vital direct contribution to national living standards, Ireland&rsquo;s housing market should not generate pinch points that could damage long-run competitiveness. Housing is also not the only vital infrastructure needed.  Other critical areas include water, wastewater, electricity, communications and transport infrastructure.  The attractiveness of a location cannot be focused solely on it as a place to work; it must also be on it as a place to live.  In delivering on the affordable housing objectives of the Government&rsquo;s Housing for All Strategy, it will be important to address also the availability of other essential services for sustainable living in Ireland.  It is critical the needs of social infrastructure in the areas of childcare, health and social care and in education are not ignored.</p><p> The final challenge is to progress sustainability and inclusivity policies as a matter of priority to ensure the Irish economy is less vulnerable to economic shocks and plays its part in the global effort to avoid a climate disaster.  The council has identified the need to make substantial and sustained progress on the climate action plan along with the need for research on the interaction between competitiveness and measures to address climate change.</p><p> This year&rsquo;s Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge Report has highlighted a number of short- and medium-term challenges facing the Irish economy and has made recommendations on these to Government.  While the council recognises these challenges, it has also drawn attention to the potential opportunities in the form of new ways of working, such as remote working.  These opportunities can present possibilities for new ways of living and potentially deliver real improvements in the lives of people based in Ireland, with sustainability and inclusivity at the core.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses, especially for being here.  It is very welcome.  I want to look at the issue of productivity.  There are two parts to my question.  Clearly our economic base is pretty unique in Europe.  We went from agrarian straight to foreign direct investment, FDI, and did not stop on the way to build manufacturing or any indigenous industry.  I would like to hear the officials' thoughts on what it is important for the State to be doing to develop our domestic SME sector into one of those high-wage, high-growth, high-productivity economies, especially in manufacturing, engineering, ICT, green technology and pharmaceuticals.  I would be interested in their views on how we can grow that but equally in knowing why the officials think we have ended up where we have, that is, with a very heavy reliance for our productivity on FDI and there does not seem to be that stable, indigenous manufacturing base.  In economies like those of Germany and the Scandinavian countries there are high-value, high-wage jobs we just do not seem to be able to replicate.  They have a high-productivity indigenous sector we do not seem to have.  I would be interested in the officials' thoughts first on how we ended up here and, more productively, what is our best route out.  I do not see sustainability without a stable indigenous manufacturing base.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.99" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Linda Kane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#B00400"><p>The Deputy is absolutely right.  We have a unique economic set-up here where there is quite a divergence between very high productivity growth within the multinational sector and a quite a diverse mix between the indigenous SMEs.  One of the things that gets disguised in some of the aggregate data for Ireland is productivity looks quite high and that productivity growth has been remarkable compared with all our OECD peers.  The areas driving that growth are ones like ICT and manufacturing in things like pharmaceuticals.  Those are the areas that are driving that very high level of productivity, but the indigenous firms are more mixed.  In the past the council has called for more research to be done on the underlying drivers of what is happening in the indigenous sector and the areas where we see potential for improvement.  That would be things like investment in education and skills.  We are talking about digital skills, management skills, areas where there is potential for growth where we want Irish SMEs to be doing quite well and taking advantage of the digital transition, the move to cleaner energy and the climate transitions.  We are talking about getting investment in skills needed for those areas.  We are also talking about innovation policies.  We are talking about encouraging Irish firms to invest in new products and new services to enable them to compete internationally.  We need to see that investment there on the skills side and on the innovation side to get those firms up to speed and ready to compete in those markets.</p></speech>

That is interesting because there is much we need to do in terms of training.  I am conscious I do not see that this is being driven.  There seems to be an element of contentment with the growth.  As it is, I do not believe it is sustainable without that manufacturing base there and that is what we see in other jurisdictions.  Notwithstanding that, to reference the report and the need for competitiveness and productivity again, when we look to Scandinavia and Germany we see states that have very strong collective bargaining rights for workers, very strong trade union movements and very strong and effective mechanisms for worker representation.</p><p>I would be interested in the witnesses' views on what role the right to collective bargaining would have in making Ireland a more attractive place for workers and contributing to the high wages and high growth that are necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver Gilvarry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#C00200"><p>One challenge that I will try to bring across this year is the new way of living and working.  The Deputy made a point about employees' rights, whether collective wage bargaining or, as we referred to, minimum wage or mandatory sick pay.  Labour was always mobile.  As a result of the pandemic, we have the added dimension of the blended working environment.  People do not need to be in the same jurisdiction as the office.  We can even see that with today's hybrid meeting, with some of us physically present and some of us having dialled in.</p> <p>  It is important for Ireland to be not just a good place to work but also a good place to live.  We want to attract highly skilled people to fill different roles.  Part of that is about the offering.  In the report, we have called for measures such as mandatory sick pay and auto-enrolment to be brought forward so that people look at Ireland as a location not just to work but also to live.  Linked into the living issue are issues with infrastructure and childcare costs, among others.  In the report, we have sought to balance that with costs for employers.  It is a matter of balance.  It cannot be a case of saying it is okay for employers if workers cannot be attracted.  That applies across the range of skills.  We talk about ICT and pharmaceuticals but this applies across the board.  If there are high housing costs and there are not the appropriate protections in place for staff, it will not be possible to get people in, whether for the hospitality sector or at the high end.  While we did not talk about collective bargaining, we are saying that the Government needs to consider balancing from both employee and employer perspectives and to have Ireland be both a good place to live and a good place to work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#C00300"><p>I believe that the right to collective bargaining has to be part of that.  We cannot simply have a system whereby the State, when it feels like it, gives rights to workers or says to employers that if they do a certain thing, it will give them a certain thing and they have to respect workers' rights.  If workers' rights are for sale, eventually the price becomes too high.  I would like to see a focus on collective bargaining as a mechanism for workers to achieve a decent place to work and not for the State to somehow gift it to them.  Eventually the State may run out of benevolence and workers would be left behind.</p> <p>  Mr. Gilvarry referred to the need for this to be a good place to live.  We all know that it is not a good place to live for many people.  With regard to childcare, its costs, the cost of living in general and the state of housing, do the witnesses have specific recommendations about what workers are looking for to keep them here and to attract them?  I could not see anybody who lives in a place with a normal housing market looking at Dublin and thinking that it would be a good place to move to.  The witnesses should not get me wrong.  Dublin is the greatest place in the world to live but I cannot see people who live in a place with a functioning housing market looking at Dublin or Ireland and thinking that they want to move here.  The cost of housing, the lack of protection for renters and so on drive workers out.  It would be interesting to hear what steps the witnesses think we can take in the short to medium term that will bear fruit and have an impact on attracting workers.</p></speech>

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is working on new funding models for the early learning and childcare and the school age childcare schemes.  In our report, we have called for the analysis and recommendations in that report, which is due in the fourth quarter of this year, to be action on as soon as possible.  OECD data show that we are the most expensive place in both net and gross terms to acquire childcare, if a place can even be secured.  It can be quite difficult to even secure one.  That lack of supply is acting as a barrier to attracting the highly mobile labour we are looking for.</p> <p>  There is a similar issue with housing.  Following the last property crash, we saw the supply of housing dry up.  That is only coming back on track now.  A significant deficit has obviously been built up over the years.  In our report in September, we called for the actions in the recently released Housing for All strategy to be implemented in a step-by-step fashion to make sure the supply comes online.  We really need that supply to be boosted.  We would like to see action on all the measures coming from that side.  These are all quite big issues.  Actions need to be taken with a sense of urgency now that will deliver in the years to come.  That is one of the main things that we will push for.</p></speech>

Is it necessary to put measures in place to control rents?  At the moment, there is a difficulty with the rental market in Dublin.  It is driving people out of the capital and to the regions.  It is acting as a barrier for this highly productive mobile labour that may wish to move here.  Are rents a barrier in the short to medium term?  Could more be done in the short term to attract that labour?</p></speech>

There was always a debate in economic circles about rent controls.  One of the concerns pushed out in the challenge is about the significant number of measures in the Housing for All strategy.  The pinch point is that we should not have a situation where we see the demand measures all coming along together.  If there are not supply measures at the same time, all that will do is push up prices, whether for the purchase of a house or on rental markets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#C00700"><p>We are going to push up prices unless we control them.  The raging free market got us the rental market that we have.  I agree that more pressure on the rental sector will push up the prices unless controls are in place.  I would like to focus on that in the short to medium term.  I am talking about people who are scanning the rental sector here with a view to potentially moving, either from one part of Ireland to another or from abroad.  Do the witnesses agree that we need to take somewhat more dramatic measures to ensure rental costs are controlled?  I think that is what people will look at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.108" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver Gilvarry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#C00800"><p>From the announcements that we have seen, the Government is supposed to bring forward proposals on Thursday on capping rent increases at 2% or the inflation rate, whichever is lower.  The Government seems to be bringing forward some of those measures which are attempting to deal with the increases in rental costs.  In reality, supply is needed.  Controls can be put in place.  There is always an economic argument that rent controls lead to properties coming out of the market.  We need to see supply.  Within the challenge this year, we need to be careful that the supply measures and the demand measures that have been put forward by the Government do not lead to an imbalance which makes the situation even worse.</p> <p>  It is important to flag that one of the recommendations is that we need to ensure the planning system has the appropriate people to move planning forward quickly so that we do not have developers waiting a long time for approval for developments or even the State waiting to build social housing.  We should have the appropriate resources in place so that we can get those applications through quickly.  In reality, the supply coming on will normalise the market and bring prices into balance.</p></speech>

The report states there is an impact.  Can that be quantified, maybe not in pounds, shillings and pence, but maybe using another quantifiable figure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.110" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver Gilvarry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#D00100"><p>I cannot put a quantifiable figure on it but there is a question mark over what we are seeing in the shortages in certain parts of the economy.  Due to the pandemic with the restrictions imposed, we saw people leave and go back home.  We can see it in Dublin.  There are vacancies in the hospitality sector.  There is a question mark there as to whether people have returned home and seen that the cost of living is lower in continental Europe.  One thing we are seeing in discussions with other countries, not only member states of the European Union but also of the OECD, is that Singapore, New Zealand and, from an EU perspective, Denmark are all experiencing labour shortages.  I cannot tell Deputy O'Reilly that it is X amount or, as she said, the pounds, shillings and pence, but there is a question in this regard.  Something that we have put forward in the challenge is that we need to deal with these competitiveness and cost issues in order that Ireland is an attractive place, not only to work but also to live.</p></speech>

The SMEs highlighted three costs in particular which are very challenging for the sector, namely, the insurance costs, legal costs and the cost of credit.  Stating the obvious, the insurance firms pass on the costs of the legal bills to consumers.  That is an issue.  The report also states that new personal injury guidelines on award levels should be assessed and monitored.  Naturally, that needs to be done.  From my point of view, I wonder whether the council has a view on the guidelines as written.  If they are implemented, is the council of the view that this will make a real impact in terms of reducing the cost of legal bills for insurance firms?  If that is the case, it should result, I would hope, in significantly reduced premiums for SMEs.  I would welcome Mr. Gilvarry's thoughts on that.</p></speech>

In February, we published a bulletin on insurance in which, from a council perspective, we welcomed the adoption of the judicial guidelines.  When we look at what we are seeing in the context of some of them, since 2016, there have been high costs.  We have seen, on the motor side, a reduction in costs.  We are seeing approximately 30% of a decline from the peak in 2016.  At the same time, we are seeing it in the employer liability and the public liability.  From a council perspective, the judicial guidelines are a positive step.  Within the challenge, we think they need to be reviewed in order to see what they impacts are, how they are working and the position regarding changes.</p> <p>  The Government has drawn up the action plan and appointed the cross-departmental working group.  A number of actions have been delivered, but there are continuing issues.  We are seeing an issue with employer liability and public liability in the context of availability and cost.  There are a number of levers that are within our control regarding legal costs, and measures have been taken to try and attract new entrants to the market.  We have to be realistic and recognise that some entities which were providing insurance here, particularly on the specialist side, out of the UK and with Brexit and the UK leaving the Union, are not passporting those services in anymore.  We need to attract other entrant to establish operations here, either those out of the European Union or even for UK entities to establish subsidiaries in Ireland.  There is work under way, I believe, with the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment on a promotion or increased provision of an insurance office.  There are all those measures.</p> <p>  I also wish to note the reforms relating to the Personal Injuries Advisory Board, PIAB.  It has become clear that the national claims database, and the welcome extension of that into the area of employer liability, EL, and public liability, PL, is highlighting what is making up the awards relating to claims - both legal costs and the amount of awards.  Putting more claims through the PIAB is completing settlements quicker and also drives through in a reduction.  The more normalised the market in insurance, the more attractive the market ultimately will become for new entrants.</p> <p>  I referred to our bulletin in February.  When you talk about insurance markets, you talk about soft markets and hard markets.  A soft market, in essence, is a more normal market, where then you see a hard market with increased premiums and people pulling out because they have higher claims costs and reserving.  We want to have a more stable market where there is consistency regarding claims and awards.  That makes it more certain for insurance companies providing services here.  Changes to the PIAB and the judicial guidelines replacing the book of quantum will assist that.</p> <p>  The council has been quite clear.  We need to review how the judicial guidelines are working, sooner rather than later, and move forward to complete the other reforms in the action plan, particularly in the context of civil liability for work the Department of Justice and others are undertaking there, so that we can continue to drive down costs and have a more normal environment for businesses and individuals alike.</p></speech>

It shows the level of claims and the breakdown of claims - how much goes to the award and how much relates to legal fees.  Something we have seen previously - the council has called for this for a number of years - has been the lack of information in respect of insurance.  The more data you have coming through - we have seen that with the database - the more information policymakers have to move forward and identify what changes need to be made.  The first Central Bank report on the national claims database was published more than a year ago.  It identified that in reality the award to the individual, whether it was through the PIAB or going through the courts, was pretty much the same.  It highlighted again the issue of needing to identify legal costs and also to look at the book of quantum.  There is more information that we have coming through, and there is the expansion of that into EL and PL.  The first report on that, which will be coming out from the Central Bank in the next week or so, will identify whether things are moving in the right direction or whether policy action has to be taken.  It also will allow entities such as the council to look at the data and put forward recommendations to Government.</p></speech>

What I am asking is, now that the legal costs have been reduced, will that be passed on to the SMEs?</p></speech>

They would argue, because they have to hold back more reserves, it is an increased cost of doing business.  As we see the reduction in the award levels, that argument falls away.  Coming back to the database perspective, that is why it is so important to see that information flow coming through because then there can be a challenge put to the industry as to why prices not falling.  More importantly, from a market perspective, if they are able to retain higher prices, it will make the market more attractive, particularly if there is certainty regarding the level of awards.  If, whether it is through the PIAB or through the courts, an award has been made to someone and the insurance company knows roughly where it will be, it gives certainty and stability to the market and will make the market more attractive for new entrants which, in turn, will increase competition and reduce insurance premiums.</p></speech>

Naturally, Government representatives will tend to see the glass half full and Opposition will see it half empty.  I suppose it would be remiss of me not to say that while we may not be perfect as an economy, before Covid we had full employment and rising wage levels that would have been simply unthinkable a decade ago.  In the context of the housing market, during the crash, house-building fell to zero.  There was no building whatsoever.  The latest housing starts number 30,000.</p><p>Some of the policies, such as that relating to the new State developer and the new approach to driving supply &ndash; there are many of them &ndash; are working but that is not what I want to ask about.  Broadly speaking, the witnesses are saying the Government is on track but needs to implement existing policies faster.  That is useful to know, and we all urge speed, but I would like to know about three specific policy changes that the witnesses would like to see that are not being made.  It would be useful for the committee to hear about these.</p><p> I want to probe a little the issue of the cost of finance.  This has always been an issue in Ireland.  Have the witnesses specific suggestions that could start to address the cost of credit, on the one side, and the cost of start-up finance, on the other?  They are difficult issues, and we are not seeing new entrants from the banking sector.  Are there initiatives we should be considering to address the costs?</p><p> The third question I would like to pose is on the obligation on, and need for, the enterprise sector to remove environmental damage from its entire supply chain.  The climate aspect is a part of this but the so-called circular economy is also a factor.  Do the witnesses believe enterprise is engaging seriously with this agenda?  If not, what changes need to be made?  To my mind, change is urgent.</p><p> Have the witnesses addressed specifically the concept of a circular economy &ndash; the idea of considering the entire supply chain and designing out some of the bad features that cause environmental damage?  I do not see this figuring much in debates on competitiveness.  I believe that in ten years, the companies that have not addressed their supply chain in the root-and-branch way I envisage will not be competitive in the emerging markets, which will be characterised by the European Green Deal.</p></speech>

The council&rsquo;s mandate and name were changed in 2018 but, from a State or Government perspective, we need to consider more how we are promoting productivity and what changes need to be made.  This relates to other questions asked on the high levels of productivity in our multinational sector and the position in the other sectors.  Along with examining how we can promote productivity, we must examine how the climate agenda will have an impact on productivity and competitiveness.  This relates to the Deputy&rsquo;s last point.  We must ask how we can use the climate agenda to boost productivity.  With regard to the focus on the climate internationally, a country can be a climate tech importer or exporter.  Climate change is happening.  As we can see with COP26 over recent days, the carbon agenda exists, it is not going away and we have to reduce emissions, but doing so will require technology.  Countries may have to import it.  Ireland needs to consider how it can be an exporter, be it through linking in on the manufacturing side with wind turbines, tidal power technology or other new ways of doing things.  It all feeds into the productivity side, and we need to focus on that more in Ireland.</p> <p>  Another point that comes across to me, from Government and Civil Service perspectives, concerns the use of data and how we are using our information and data to make policy decisions.  It is a matter of trying to utilise the information across Departments.</p> <p>  This is linked to the third area of change.  We are still seeing very high levels of Covid infection but we introduced many measures very quickly as we shut down the economy in March 2020.  We adjusted them and had measures for both employees and businesses, but we need to learn the lessons from them and stand back to see what worked well and what did not.  In the context of the challenge we highlighted regarding schemes such as the Covid restrictions support scheme and others helping businesses with fixed costs, we ultimately ended up with about six or seven schemes supporting different types of businesses with fixed costs, different pay-out levels and different criteria.  We need to see what we can learn from this in designing such schemes to avoid replication.  That is my initial view on the three policy areas.</p> <p>  On the issue of credit, we have highlighted that the exit of two institutions &ndash; KBC and Ulster Bank, one of which is relatively large &ndash; presents a challenge of concern on the competition side.  Whereas Ulster Bank has a significant SME book, KBC does not.  It is still a matter of concern that a small business starting off in the first stage must often rely on an overdraft from its retail bank.  The loss of two players is an issue for smaller businesses starting off.  I am referring not only to businesses of medium size but also to small businesses and microbusinesses.  It is another loss for the latter.</p> <p>  The question of what the competitive banking environment in Ireland will look like with the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC is an issue.  We were speaking about insurance earlier.  Deputy Bruton mentioned that we do not have new entrants in the banking sector.  The one positive is that we have seen several non-bank lenders come into the market.  These are relatively small, but they are growing.  They are seeking to provide credit to the Irish economy in various areas.  When Ulster Bank and KBC leave, it will be important to have the non-bank lenders.  We are seeing that the credit union movement is more involved in a few the loan guarantee schemes that have been launched by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other Departments.  This is an issue.  It is a one that the Department of Finance&rsquo;s announced review on banking needs to take into consideration.  Whatever emerges from the review on the competition side will need to be acted upon quickly so we will not have quite high costs or high interest rates, or circumstances in which people cannot avail of credit to start their businesses.  This does not apply only to standard SME loans.  Somebody seeking to set up a coffee shop or start a new manufacturing business will often have to work from a personal overdraft.</p></speech>

I have read their detailed and long report Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge 2021.  I very much welcome some of the analysis in that report, particularly the comments on the pandemic unemployment payment and the need to have an adequate transition process in place.  I welcome also the references to the need to introduce the paid sick leave Bill and to the right to request flexible working conditions.  It is important to acknowledge and welcome those aspects of the report.</p> <p>  My question relates to labour supply.  This matter has already been touched on in the context of housing.  It was stated that the need for affordable housing is now a competitiveness issue as regards attracting workers to the country and retaining workers in certain sectors and areas.  I want to understand a little more the work of the council on labour supply in construction.  As we are aware, a significant ramp-up is planned for new builds and retrofitting over the coming years.  When I examined the data, I saw that the construction labour figure in the first half of this year was as low as that for 2017.</p><p>Of course, that will improve in the second half of 2021.  The labour supply into construction and the competition for skilled construction labour, in particular considering the strength of the Polish and eastern European economies and the need within the UK at present, poses a real challenge.  I want to understand more about the work of the council.  I note a report was produced last year, however, I want to know if work has been done this year in that regard.  In addition, the report stated the Government's action plan to secure the pipeline of apprenticeships is taking effect.  I would like to hear more detail on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Linda Kane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#F00200"><p>We highlighted in the report on this year's competitive challenge that attracting workers into the construction sector will be difficult, especially if some of that labour is being attracted from abroad.  Due to the demand for workers, the number required could increase to 80,000, when housing construction ramps up, from the 40,000 full-time equivalents that are working in the construction sector at present.  We referred to the expert group on future skills needs.  It published a report that highlighted the demand for labour coming from construction.  As the Senator rightly said, demand will not only come from houses.  In addition, it will come from the many large scale infrastructural projects that are ongoing, and the retrofitting of homes and office spaces.  We called for the training available to people who rejoin the workforce to be more widely available.  I refer to apprenticeships and getting more young people involved in the construction sector.  We must offer people entering the construction sector a good career and long-term prospects.  They should be offered a career path to follow.</p> <p>  I refer to the work we are doing for climate change and the new modern methods of construction that are anticipated.  We will need people who have those new skills who can look at digital ways of proving productivity in the construction sector.  We must bring those higher skilled workers into the sector, as well as the labour on the ground for producing the homes.</p></speech>

Some of us remain to be convinced that adequate resources and effort are being put into ensuring we have a sufficient skills pipeline of training and apprenticeship programmes in the construction sector in particular, as in other sectors, that will be badly needed in future years.</p> <p>  I have another question about youth unemployment.  We know youth unemployment levels have always been almost double that of the unemployment level for the whole population.  On the initiatives taken at present, do we really believe we can dramatically reduce the pre-pandemic unemployment levels of between 15% and 17%?  This has been a long-standing issue in the Irish economy, about which there have been some initiatives taken but no radical or comprehensive youth unemployment strategy forthcoming for some time.  What are the witness's thoughts on these issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.127" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver Gilvarry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#F00400"><p>I have not looked at the most recent numbers on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  There has been a significant increase in the number of people under the age of 25 years benefitting from EWSS.  One thing concerning the council as we move out of the pandemic, is to not see people who were in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment or whose employment was supported by EWSS moving into long-term unemployment as those schemes come to an end.  In particular, it is a concern in respect of youth unemployment.  That is why, in the competitive challenge report, we pushed for the Pathways to Work strategy.  We welcomed the focus on younger workers and the different measures within that for them but we need to see those activation measures introduced quickly.  As supports are rolled back, it is a question of whether people under the age of 25 who are no longer in receipt of PUP therefore move into long-term unemployment.  As EWSS is reversed, it is a question of whether people are let go from employment.</p> <p>  I take on board the Senator's point on the apprenticeship places but we consider the apprenticeships, as Ms Kane outlined, as a pathway to work for people in order that they can have a career from this.  Pathways to Work focuses on payments to employers who take on younger workers.  They all have an important role to play in this regard.  On the question of whether we can drive the youth unemployment levels lower than what they were pre-pandemic, introducing those measures quickly, particularly as certain support measures are reversed, gives us the best chance of achieving that.</p></speech>

Their organisation does very interesting work.  It is important for all public representatives to get independent advice where possible on the health of the economy and in obtaining projections on where things are going in regard to the issues that may arise.  The year 2020 was exceptionally difficult for many businesses across all sectors of the economy.  I gather from the witnesses' contributions that we are facing a lot of uncertainty in the next 12 months.</p> <p>  I want to raise an important point.  I am a rural Deputy from Cork East constituency, where the agrifood sector is by far the largest employer.  There are many thousands of jobs in the processing sectors within agriculture.  At the primary level there are those who work in farming with basic English, and those working in the production of cheese, whey and powder.  We are a major constituency in regard to those areas.  Following on from that point, a matter which is repeatedly brought up in my constituency is the difficulties facing employers who try to bring in employees from outside the European Union.  From the engagement I have had with employers working in agriculture, it is increasingly the case that they find it more difficult to bring in workers from eastern Europe.  Many have faced almost impossible challenges in hiring workers living in the Republic of Ireland, be they Irish or other European citizens who have moved to Ireland.  That is one issue that has been identified to me.  Will the witnesses expand on the points made in regard to the NCPC's work in trying to solve current labour shortages in the area of the agrifood sector and the wider economy, in addition to the issue of work permits?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.129" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver Gilvarry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#F00600"><p>While this year's report on the challenges did not consider the specific area of work permits, there was a recent announcement by the Government about changes to work permits and a number of them involved the agrifood sector.  This issue comes back to the points made earlier about trying to have Ireland seen as a location that is attractive for people to come and work in.  There are a number of aspects to that.  First, if people come from outside of the European Union, we need to have the permit system in place in order that the process is relatively smooth.  I note the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, announced the Government's intention to improve that.  Ultimately, however, we need to be a jurisdiction that is attractive for people to want to come to work in.  This comes back to the concept of Ireland as an attractive place in which to both work and live.  We must have the other supports in place such as mandatory sick pay and affordable housing.  Those different aspects will help to attract people into the country.  The agrifood sector has always had labour shortages.  In primary production, employers have been trying to recruit workers for fruit picking - not so much in east Cork but certainly in other parts of the country - and to get people in to support the dairy sector.  While we did not consider it in our report, we regard it as a new way of living and working and it must, therefore, be an attractive jurisdiction.</p><p>In addition, from a state perspective the Government must have a process in place where the permit system is working appropriately, it is identifying where there are shortfalls in relation to workers and that they can come in.  Ultimately, however, it is that people are willing to come in and see Ireland as an attractive place to come and work, whether that is within the Union or outside it.  </p></speech>

It is something I would like to see the NCPC do work on.  I know its board has representatives from the agrifood sector.  It is a significant issue.</p> <p>  If the council could see the Government solve or make progress on any issue in the next 12 months, what is the single biggest risk to our competitiveness in the next year or the medium term?</p></speech>

At more of a macro level, there was the large debate and the challenge before the OECD reform on corporate taxation was agreed.  I would not say it is the one specific challenge but there has been a lot of debate on the multinational sector here and what will happen with the minimum corporation tax rate.  One thing would be the levers and costs, whether insurance, legal fees, cost of credit etc., the old reliables that we talk about in the council, so that the costs of working and doing business in Ireland are managed.  Those things are in our control and we should reduce those costs as much as possible.  Insurance, cost of credit and legal fees are somewhat interlinked and they are one of the more immediate issues.  Action that has been taken by Government need to be delivered on.  The housing side is linked to that so that we do see the supply coming through and the measures in the Housing for All strategy.  I would say that it would be those old reliables.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Gilvarry feel the co-operation between those Departments to tackle the issues of competitiveness are being done in the most efficient manner?  Joined-up thinking is a phrase often used in politics and political jargon but are we maximising our ability to bring Departments and different sectors together?  There is the approach to housing and to taxation but has the body of work been approached in the most efficient manner possible for the benefit of the economy?</p></speech>

They are more statements of fact but they can highlight the issues.  Look at where we are in the challenge and some of the recommendations on the climate action plan.  I refer to the actions arising from that plan, which is supposed to be published this week.  The Housing for All strategy was in September.  We need to give time for these actions to come true but the council does have that soft power if things are not being done that were promised by the Government, particularly in the response, the council can call attention to that.  The Deputy raised timelines.  The Government will respond to us by the end of November, the next challenge will be out by September.  There is ten months or so of a gap.</p> <p>  A number of Government strategies have come out during its term so far.

It is great that the council exists, however, its opening statement has no mention of climate and I find that quite disturbing.  To quote a billionaire, which I rarely do, Larry Fink, "climate risk is investment risk".  That is what we need to move towards.  Deputy Bruton touched on it but there is a lot of work to be done on carbon calculation of businesses to enable them to compete in the market.  I have spoken to businesses in the community, ISME and local enterprise offices.  They want help with the SME sector getting decarbonising supports and knowing their carbon footprint.  It is not only an issue for themselves locally.  Many in the private sector are working on their carbon reductions.  You can see that with SuperValu, SAP and other multinationals.  They say their biggest challenge is that their suppliers do not have carbon calculations or that they have not done enough on reducing their carbon footprint.  When a large company puts in its carbon calculation, it must take all its suppliers into account.  I raised this with the T&aacute;naiste and, in fairness to him, he gave good money for it in the budget, with some &euro;22 million for the SME sector to be digitalised and decarbonised.  What does the council intend to do to support the SME sector into decarbonising so that it can be more competitive?  The two are inextricably linked.</p></speech>

Under the current climate action plan commits to reducing those emissions by 10% to 15%.  That is likely to increase in the new climate action plan.</p> <p>  Making investments in new sustainable methodologies and products requires a level of certainty.  The council welcomed the announcements in budget 2022 that the carbon tax will increase to &euro;41 to tonne and a planned increase to &euro;100 per tonne.  That certainty really helps enterprises when they are making those long-term investment decisions.  They need that element in place to know the playing field.  </p> <p>  On our competitiveness, there is a global shift where consumers are demanding more environmentally conscious products.  That is a niche market that our suppliers can work into.  If they want to expand their businesses, they need to respond to what their consumers are demanding.</p></speech>

I am wondering what the council intends to do about it to enable them to become competitive by decarbonising.</p></speech>

At local enterprise office level, we are talking about peer-to-peer learning and advice for enterprises on how they can transition to a low-carbon future.  We are also talking about working within those networks to explore options for electrification, the use of substitute fuels, efficiency projects and supply chain management, as the Senator mentioned.  It is about getting those firms to change their suppliers sometimes, to more environmentally conscious ones, and to change some of their own practices to make them lower emitters.</p></speech>

This year, in one of the chapters, it is a key issue for competitiveness and productivity.  There is work under way and we will see what comes out of the climate action plan tomorrow.  I refer to measures that have been discussed before such as the carbon calculator for businesses, a one stop.</p><p>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is leading on that.</p><p> On a broader issue that Ms Kane has flagged, there is a need to see what is the impact on carbon reduction and how that impacts on the productivity and competitiveness of different sectors in our economy.  We also have to focus on where we can take the opportunities.  The Senator made the point on the supply chain for businesses and their suppliers.  I would see that all linked in to what I mentioned before about being an exporter of climate tech.  We can think about having a wind turbine as that kind of tech but it can also be processes and the way businesses identify within their supply chain where carbon has been removed, whether that is the removing of plastic packaging or different packaging methods, for example.  We need to keep pushing that.  It is something the council has been very focused on so that businesses have that support to see how they can improve their own carbon footprint, not only from their own perspective but also from that of those supplying to them and then onwards in regard to them supplying to others.  Consumers will look for this, ultimately, whether that consumer is an individual or a business.</p></speech>

It is great that the council is aware of it but I did not see it mentioned in the opening statement, which is why I asked.  All businesses, given consumer demand, know the plan is that we need to go green and decarbonise.  Irrespective of carbon taxes or the targets we get in the climate action plan, we have to support businesses which want to do the right thing because it can be costly.  I am focused on helping small businesses.  It is easy for big businesses to have full-time staff whose job it is to decarbonise, but small businesses in general are flat to the mat just working and they find it difficult to find the time to decarbonise, source grants, get green loans and all of those things.  I am coming from the perspective of small businesses and I am looking for them to get clear supports.  If the council has it available, I would like to receive information on that.</p></speech>

I call Senator Paul Gavan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#H00500"><p>I thank both speakers for coming in today.  It is a very valuable report as there is a lot of very good content in there.  It is welcome to have this debate.  I was struck by one of the comments made by Mr. Gilvarry in response to Deputy O'Reilly on the importance of making this country a good place to live, which I think comes through in the report.  We have one of the highest proportions of low-wage workers in any economy in Europe.  Does Mr. Gilvarry think it is a good country to live in for those workers at the moment?  People are taking home &euro;380 a week despite the challenge of the costs they have to face in terms of rent, ever-spiralling bills and the cost of living.  What steps does Mr. Gilvarry think we need to take in regard to those workers to make the country a good place to live?  Does he have a view on the EU minimum wage directive, for example, which is an issue that has come up with the Government?  Unfortunately, it looks to date as if the Government certainly wants to water down that directive and it does not want to make it binding, yet that is the type of directive that could actually influence increasing collective bargaining in this State and giving workers a decent and better pay packet.  I will start by asking Mr. Gilvarry for his views on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.149" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver Gilvarry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#H00600"><p>I thank the Senator.  When we look at the level of low wages for workers, the counter-argument is in regard to the level of redistribution within the economy.  If we compare the situation to the UK, for example, in regard to the percentage of tax that is taken for someone on the minimum wage in Ireland compared to a person on the minimum wage and aged over 23 in the UK, people have more take-home pay here.  As I said in regard to the challenge, a good place to live is one that gives certainty to employers.  When we look at the issues on mandatory sick pay, again, that is very much targeted at the lower paid.  Whether it is in the coffee shops or on the hospitality side, people are not there for 20 years and they are in and out, changing jobs, and we see more churn there.  Those are important things to have in place for people.</p> <p>  Moreover, from a lower pay perspective, remote working is not as much of an option for those people.  It has to be that we have a lower cost of living here for those people so there is access to the healthcare system - we referenced the Sl&aacute;intecare package - as well as housing.  Auto-enrolment is another aspect so those workers know they have another scheme for a top-up when they are coming towards retirement.  It is all of those measures, which do increase costs on businesses, but that balance makes us an attractive place for people to come to work and live, as the Senator referenced - it means it is a good place to live as well as a good place to work.</p> <p>  I am not sure about the higher percentage in terms of the minimum wage in Europe but, again, it is that balance.  We can see that the tax take out of that minimum wage is quite low but we have to ask what are the other aspects.  That is why we have called on the Government to move forward.</p> <p>  Another point we made in the document, which is quite important for the lower paid in the economy, is that when we look at the PUP numbers, many of those who were on the lower wage were impacted again, as were many in the hospitality sectors.  Again, it is about ensuring those people are not going to be disadvantaged when mandatory redundancy calculations are coming through and aspects like that, and that measures are being taken in that regard.  We need to see things happening there.  It all feeds into having people say, &ldquo;Yes, Ireland is a good place.  I can get housing at an affordable level.  The minimum wage is X but there is not a huge tax take and I am not spending a lot of it in other areas, and the healthcare and education systems are good.&rdquo;</p> <p>  I do not know a huge amount about the minimum wage directive and what the minimum aspects are, so I could not comment on those.</p></speech>

In terms of the social infrastructure that was emphasised in the report, can the witnesses share a view on how out of kilter this country is in terms of the cost of childcare for working families when compared to our competitors in Europe?</p></speech>

We had a chart in last year's report, Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge 2020, which highlighted that we were the most expensive jurisdiction in the OECD, and I can make those figures available to the Senator.  It is very important that we get in place those schemes which make childcare more affordable to lower income and middle income families, so it makes going to work worthwhile.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#H00900"><p>That would be great.  I want to raise the issue of housing.  Again, I praise the very clear way in which the council has called out the issue of housing.  The report states:</p> <blockquote> 	The prolonged undersupply of new housing has led to chronic shortages of properties in both the rental and home ownership markets, resulting in house price increases, rental market pressures and increased homelessness, as households are priced out of local markets.  The dysfunction in the housing market has spill-over effects on private enterprises as firms struggle to recruit skilled labour, and face wage pressures as employees demand higher compensation packages &hellip; </blockquote> <p>We have spoken about the struggle in terms of attracting people into the country but do we not face another challenge, which is hanging on to the young generation of workers we have here in Ireland at the moment?  Certainly, that is the case for the people I speak to.  I can even cite the guy who works with me at the moment, who has had to move back in with his parents this week at the age of 26 because he cannot afford to rent a house in Limerick.  Is the real danger that we are going to lose some of our brightest and best people if we do not tackle the cost of housing in this country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.153" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver Gilvarry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#H01000"><p>Yes.  It is the whole cost issue.  It is not just that Ireland is a good place to attract people, whether, as I said earlier, that is the very highly paid people working in ICT or pharmaceuticals or people who are working on the minimum wage or just above minimum wage, and it also applies to our own domestic situation so that we hold on to our people.  People will always move and they will come back again, but it is a point worth making.</p> <p>  The issue on the housing side is that we see the supply coming through but given the large number of measures that have been put forward in the Housing for All strategy, we need to step back and look at whether they are having the correct effect.  We need to ensure that adjustments are made quickly so there are proper monitoring frameworks and, in particular, that we do not see certain measures coming in on the demand side earlier than we are seeing supply coming through, which then makes it even more difficult for people to get housing.  That can put them at a disadvantage compared to other jurisdictions in Europe which have huge labour shortages, so people decide to go there rather than here, or our own people decide to go there rather than, as the Senator said, that we keep the brightest and best and the skills here.</p><p>It is always great when people go and come back.  That will always happen but we should not have a situation in which we educate people who go through the system and then we have huge skill shortages because we are losing loads of people.</p></speech>

Much of what I was going to raise was brought up by my esteemed and learned colleagues so I will be short and sweet.  I want to focus on a point that has been raised by a number of speakers and that is green finance.  One of the issues facing many businesses is the need to decarbonise.  There is a particular catchment of businesses such as mom-and-pop shops and the small SMEs that are at sea in this area.  If one looks at firms that are associated with Enterprise Ireland, EI, IBEC and IDA Ireland, they are probably decades ahead in this challenge but there is another large cohort of businesses.  We repeatedly remind the public that the engine room and driving force of rural Ireland is SMEs and they feel isolated.  I am conscious that there may be some direction for them in tomorrow's announcement but we need to see a specific green energy finance programme for them.  We saw a good initiative from the credit unions last week on finance for private home-owners to future-proof their homes but there is nothing in that space yet for the SMEs.</p> <p>  We all appreciate and know that the finance market has contracted significantly and that is a challenge.  Deputy Bruton also mentioned the circular economy and for rural Ireland in particular there is a huge opportunity in this.  We are seeing some progress in this area such as the EDI centre in Longford, for example, which is doing excellent work but it is still too hard for smaller businesses to get proactively involved in this area.  If one looks at the big retailers one can see that there are opportunities for small businesses to grow on the back of a circular economy.  On efficiency and businesses moving forward, those are the two key opportunities for SMEs if we could give them advice.  As Mr. Gilvarry rightly says, there may be an outline of that in tomorrow's announcement.  We need green finance and a clear pathway forward for the circular economy.  I would welcome any observations on those points that have not already been given.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver Gilvarry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#J00500"><p>The banking system has a role to play in green finance and we have seen that more on the mortgages side with building energy ratings, for example.  The Deputy mentioned the credit unions and retrofitting and we might get further details tomorrow in the Housing for All strategy on the retrofitting of housing.  It is being touted that 500,000 houses will be retrofitted over the period of the strategy.</p> <p>  We are seeing more happening at a European level on the circular economy and there is a greater push on that.  Different supports are being provided by the LEOs and EI and a number of those would be targeted at the smaller businesses.  This has to become more of a focus because of what I said about the supply chain earlier.  Either the suppliers of a business or those being supplied by it will ask the business what it is doing and what it can do in that area.  There is a role for the banking system in this and it is fulfilling that role.  A portion of that is being driven at European level such as advantageous capital requirements because money is being loaned for green projects.  We will see more of that coming through under this Commission and the existing support schemes from the LEOs and EI will help businesses to adjust but let us see what is announced tomorrow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#J00600"><p>I would like to return to the issue of enterprise and the environmental adaptation it needs to make.  I am not sure if enterprise has seriously addressed this and even the way Mr. Gilvarry presents it, that enterprise is responsible for a small share, understates the contribution of the enterprise sector.  Enterprise uses substantial amounts of transport, which is attributed to the transport sector but is still coming from enterprise, and it has a lot of buildings which are generally poorly energy rated.  Huge adaptations are needed in the enterprise sector and while the climate plan will set out its first cut at the policy tools we need and the choices we make the council needs to focus on this more because the choice of those tools will affect our competitiveness.</p> <p>  I have done a report on the circular economy for the Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  The council should be advocating for sectoral audits that look at creating a sense of obligation in enterprise to redesign its supply chains and look at things like the repairability and end of life treatment of its produce, the necessity for packaging and so on.  I do not see another way for Ireland to get a competitive edge in this new economy unless advocates such as the council recognise and point out to Government and enterprise the changes that are needed.  I urge that more work would be done in that area.</p> <p>  Has the council made a contribution on the reform of the leaving certificate?  One of the most important decisions that will be made in the next 12 to 18 months is the direction of reform in the leaving certificate because it will trigger many of the things Mr. Gilvarry is talking about in the areas of productivity, skills, capacity for innovation and so on.  Has the council looked at this and has it given Government any guidance on the direction of travel of reform of the leaving certificate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.160" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver Gilvarry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#J00700"><p>Leaving certificate reform has not come up with the council.  The focus and challenge this year has been on pathways to work and apprenticeships but it is a good point.  We need to foster the skills, start at that stage and feed that through.  Reforms have been led by colleagues in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to look at the CAO system but from what we have seen from the pandemic the leaving certificate will be reformed and restructured going forward so that we will have the appropriate skills coming through into our labour force from colleges, institutes of technology or apprenticeships.  The starting point will be that people come out from the leaving certificate system and that they have the basic skills or qualifications coming through.  However, we have not looked at contributing to the reform of the leaving certificate.</p> <p>  On the climate side of the circular economy, a productivity research programme has been called for and that is in the process of being established by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  That will have a significant climate component because as the Deputy rightly said, the climate agenda is not going away and it will be coming more and more to the fore.  We are seeing proposals at an EU level on the circular economy such as directives on the repairability of appliances and the like.  From the council's perspective it would be important for the Government to consider the export of climate technology.  It must also consider how our businesses are established, how they can take advantage and how our support schemes that are being put forward can deliver on that project.  In that way we will see people and businesses putting solutions in place that can be utilised elsewhere.</p><p>With regard to the point on the climate side, there will be a research programme and that will be a big part of it.  As I said, this relates to how the climate agenda is affecting the productivity and competitiveness of firms, and looking at advantages that might be gained.  A number of other projects will also be in the climate area.</p></speech>

I recommend the review of the leaving certificate because there is a tendency for only insiders in the education system to engage on questions like this when it really affects our entire society, not least our enterprise sector.  These are big choices that will shape Ireland for quite a while to come.  They deserve a certain input from groups like the council, which has a wider perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#K00300"><p>I thank Mr. Gilvarry and the other members of the council.  In his statement Mr. Gilvarry has spoken about the renewed focus on productivity and I wonder whether, in the context of the programme for Government, the NCPC has looked at the productivity of our Civil Service.  We will have protests outside the D&aacute;il later today regarding forestry, and it looks like the five-year forestry targets will undershoot by over 80%, and this is essentially, I suppose, down to problems within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in processing afforestation claims, felling licences and all of that.  It is something that should be examined.</p> <p>  There is a similar issue with wind development.  We are still waiting to designate a wind port.  We need to get that done or we will lose much of that business to other markets, whether it is in the UK or on the Continent.  We also have issues with the grid infrastructure, and it again seems to be largely vested in problems with the Civil Service.  My first question relates to Civil Service reform and whether the witnesses have any remit to speak to the Civil Service or meet the Government to discuss it.</p> <p>  My second question relates to the construction sector and the embedded costs, particularly the Government's take of development costs.  There is also the issue of dominant suppliers.  I have mentioned it before at this committee that if people buy building materials on the Continent, they will be up to 30% less than the equivalent in Ireland.  That 30% difference does not comprise the cost of shipping those materials to Ireland.  We definitely have a cost disadvantage.  Is the council giving consideration to that?</p> <p>  A third question has been covered a number of times but it concerns apprenticeship schemes.  There is a particular problem in the country with the wet trades, particularly plastering and blocklaying, as well as carpenters and electricians.  I know many subcontractors in the area and they have no sons or nephews coming into the business.  Nobody is following those people into the business because they do not see it as an attractive area in which to work.  In Germany, there are two streams of higher education and the guilds can lead to a qualification at graduate level.  Is that something the council is examining?</p> <p>  The fourth matter is insurance and we now have a wholesale exit of underwriters from the UK leaving the Irish market.  There are a number of business sectors that will fail to get any adequate insurance as a result.  What is the NCPC doing in looking at schemes of self-insurance or further legal reforms to this process?</p></speech>

The council is looking at productivity in this area and the plan is that before the end of the year or early in January, we will have a bulletin examining the question of productivity in the public sector.  In the initial look at this, not only from an Irish perspective but a European, global and definitely advanced economies perspective, there is not a huge amount of data.  The council is looking at it and we will have a bulletin on productivity within the public sector.</p> <p>  On the insurance side, the council's role is to provide independent advice to the Government or the Taoiseach via the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  With insurance, we have seen entities providing insurance into Ireland from the UK but which had no other operation in the Union, and that process was affected by Brexit.  There options were either to stop providing insurance into an EU member state such as Ireland or to establish a presence in the Union.  If they were really only servicing the Ireland and UK market, a number of them would have decided, because of the size of our market, it was not worth their while.</p> <p>  We should focus on the measures that have been put forward to reduce the costs of premiums, including changes to the PIAB judicial reforms and civil liability reforms.  This will give greater certainty over the cost of claims and make the market more attractive for entrants.  It is very much where we were in council this year and we pushed for those reforms.  In particular, we want an early review of the judicial guidelines that replaced the book of quantum to see if the process is working and what tweaks need to be made.  That is how we are looking at dealing with the issue of firms leaving the Irish market that have been operating out of the UK.</p></speech>

The Ulster Bank purchasing managers' index has indicated consistent increases, so we are seeing not only higher prices but also longer lead times.  Part of that is driven by a very significant increase in demand for those inputs and there is also a global shortage of materials, including steel, certain types of plastics and copper.  In Ireland, there is the addition of some Brexit delays and hiccups with the supply chain.  Given that ours is such a small economy, we must import quite a bit of that material, which is leading to shortages coming down the track, especially when we must ship across various supply chains.</p> <p>  We also expect that some of the global increases in prices are likely to be temporary and related to Covid-19.  We anticipate that these will unwind in the coming months.  We will be keeping a close eye on these matters, particularly as there will be much planned construction activity in Ireland over the next couple of years under the Housing for All strategy and various infrastructure projects.  We expect to see a very high level of demand for those construction inputs.  The council will keep a close on production inputs.</p></speech>

Again, the greater focus on apprenticeships will come through in trying to bring in people.  We mentioned earlier that within the new Pathways to Work strategy people need to see what is their career path and how it can develop over a career.  We need to make it more attractive to get into this area.  A greater number of apprenticeships are being offered and it is an option for people.<br/><br/>The other issue in that sector is that we saw no or very limited building for a number of years post crash.  With the targets for the Housing for All strategy and the money being put into the building sector, we should see greater demand for those wet trades as greater work comes through.  There is no easy answer <i>per se</i>on this but we see apprenticeships and Pathways to Work as key to continuing development.  It is an issue for such trades to get in younger works and reduce youth unemployment levels.  It is important for people to see a career path and it can be developed.</p></speech>

He may not wish to comment before this committee, but he will have to look at specific matters like what is happening currently with the forestry sections.  We have put in extra resources in the past year and yet the time it takes to complete the licensing process is lengthening.  We are not even dealing with the number of applications coming in.  We have a significant problem and the NCPC should look at it in considering the broader topic of climate change.</p><p>Mr. Gilvarry spoke about the PIAB and trying to expand its use and so forth.  Has the NCPC looked at any increase in post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, attachment claims to soft-tissue injuries?  I believe this is something that must be examined in the context of further legal reforms.  We cannot introduce legislation to try to cap awards and then have it circumvented by other attachments bringing them back into the Circuit Court and High Court.</p></speech>

Are there any actions the council would recommend that the Government take in the coming months to support exporters?</p></speech>

Some of the numbers there show a continuing decline in UK imports over a number of years.  There is a question about whether that has been exacerbated by Brexit or is basically people stockpiling.  We are still seeing trade flows coming through, but the trend for more than a decade has seen a smaller percentage of imports going through and the UK becoming a smaller proportion of our exports.  The issue we were trying to convey on this is similar tastes.  The example of cheddar cheese is always used.  Ireland, the UK and the US are jurisdictions where one sees cheddar cheeses, but not so much in Europe.  There are very similar tastes and a shared language.</p> <p>  The ability to replicate a large market of 60 million people by switching into a European market where there are different languages and different tastes across those jurisdictions is not easy.  Our point in the challenge is that there has to be a greater focus on this from the enterprise agencies to see how to support businesses going into, for example, the Austrian or the Belgian markets, which will be quite different in how to support them.  The point we were trying to make is that it is not easy to replicate and say we are not going to export to the UK anymore but will export to the European Union.  The European Union is made up of a number of different jurisdictions that have different cultures, languages and tastes, so it is not as easy to replicate and that has to be considered as we help our business to transition away from the UK market.</p></speech>

What is stated on page 60 is very interesting.  It relates to the feedback that has come from employers on the effects of remote working and how it has and has not worked.  I wish to delve into that a little.  The report states that 44% of managers said it is more difficult to manage their teams remotely compared to those on site, 47% said there was no difference and 9% said it was less difficult.  That is fascinating data.  As regards the future of remote working or a hybrid working model, can the witnesses comment on the competitiveness or the analysis of the competitiveness of that from talking to employers?  What is the feedback on that and is there a future for it?  In the context of people who may have younger children, they are trying to manage the work-life balance.  Working from home might save them a significant amount of time that otherwise would be spent commuting.  There are other aspects as well.  Could the witnesses expand on those points further for the committee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.175" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Linda Kane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021110300002#L00800"><p>We also released another bulletin in May on remote working.  We had the opportunity there to delve into much more of the academic evidence.  There is very positive evidence that there is a productivity boost by remote working.  There are many studies internationally and serving evidence from within Ireland.  Obviously, it is a little early to get the hard data for Ireland yet, but we will be monitoring that very carefully.  The Western Development Commission has been responsible for doing the national survey on remote working and it is seeing that self-reported productivity has increased by 68%.  There definitely are benefits for both the employer and the employee.  It is about bridging those two groups so both can see the benefits of this future arrangement.</p> <p>  One of the issues we pointed out in the challenge was equipping those managers with the skills to manage the teams remotely.  A slightly different set of skills will be required to be able to communicate more effectively with one's team, to have possibly difficult conversations remotely as opposed to face-to-face and to motivate a team when one does not see its members every day.  There is definitely great potential in Ireland to reap the benefits of this.  We will do it the right way by making sure that people have the right skills, both digital and managerial, and making sure they have the right equipment and access to good quality broadband.  Those are the things we can put in place to ensure that there is the most productive outcome from the move towards remote working and blended working.</p></speech>

To follow up on that point, there is the important overall point, and it was mentioned earlier regarding our competitiveness, that there is extreme strain at present on the energy grid.  It is something I have received feedback on from employers.  What is quite interesting is that if people are working at home there is a change in the demand being placed on the grid versus people working in a centralised hub.  From an economic point of view, and taking the social aspect out of it for the moment, one could argue in that context that it is less efficient having people working in the domestic home versus working in the workplace.  Have the witnesses any thoughts on that and on the future management of it in terms of the pressures that may arise environmentally?  I have in mind things such as heating in homes and energy bills.  Has there been any analysis of that for the report?</p></speech>

There is one thing more generally.  I will take some of the numbers from the top of my head on the Deputy's point, but our emissions  from transport last year were down significantly.  The number for transport for 2020 was down something like 15% or 16%, but from households it was up 9%.  On the Deputy's point, one has to heat one's home so that one can hold a pen or type on the personal computer, PC.  If everyone is in one building, it is more efficient.  Everyone is there for heating.  A modern office building will be more efficient than people working in ten or 20 different types of houses.  However, first, we have to be realistic and accept that we are now in a blended working environment.<br/><br/>The second point comes back to the retrofitting of the housing stock.  Regardless of whether we are doing blended working or we are back in offices, we are still heating homes so we must do that in the most efficient way possible.  That involves insulation, heat pumps and other things.  Yes, it would be more efficient if everybody was in the office, but the pandemic has shown a new way of living and working.  One could argue that it is a better quality of life, with people having more time but still being able to be as productive as if they were in offices.  It is an issue.  The retrofitting of houses will ultimately deal with some of that.  In some ways, we cannot reverse it now.  People will be in the offices for some of the time and then will be working from home.  That is not just in Ireland, but globally.  People will have blended working so we have to offer that and have it in Ireland so we are competitive and an attractive place to live and work.</p></speech>

We all should recognise that people are not returning to work because they have been working all along.  They are just returning to the office a little more.  I note the contribution about the stress that remote working perhaps causes for managers.  With regard to workers and the stress caused for them by working remotely, however, the always-on culture and so forth, would the witnesses recommend that the inclusion of a right to disconnect as part of any future legislation would be important in terms of giving us a competitive edge, first, but also for the health, safety and welfare of workers in their new workplace, which will be at home for many?</p></speech>

We called for the right to disconnect and we welcomed that because inadequate mental health protections for employees who are working in their homes, where the line between home life and work life gets blurred, can lead to long-term stress issues, poor productivity and poor performance, which, again, is bad for the business as well as being bad for the individual.  Therefore, as I mentioned earlier, the NCPC sees remote working as an opportunity to benefit both the individual employee and the employer and broader society, so having those protections in place is very important.  It is also a matter of having things like guidelines as to how you work and where you work, making sure that people are safe in their homes, that they have the right equipment and technology and a broadband connection to be able to do their work safely in their homes without back issues from a poor chair or poor lighting and so on.  We think it is very important to have those protections in place for employees.</p></speech>

I have spoken to workers who, out of necessity, have conducted their business balanced on the edge of the bed in the box room in their parents' house because they have nowhere else to go.  All these things need to come together.  I am aware of the bulletin.  I just wanted to pivot back to the workers in this regard because there has been a heavy emphasis on managers.  Of course, managers are workers too, but we should probably be cognisant of the impact of this on workers generally.</p> <p>  The NCPC's paper touches on investment in research, development and innovation and the fact that, since 2011, as a percentage of the modified GNI*, the Government's investment in research, development and innovation has been decreasing.  Given that we hear from academics, specifically those from the Kemmy Business School, that for every euro invested in research and development, more than &euro;5 is returned to the economy, can the witnesses elaborate for the committee on the importance of RDI for economic expansion and how it can make our economy more robust?  Does the NCPC see scope for an increase in investment, which, by my reckoning, has been decreasing as a percentage of GNI*?</p></speech>

It is due to be published in quarter 4.  The council is eager to see the recommendations that will come out of that report.  One of our key roles is to keep an eye on all those recommendations, which we will do in order that they will be implemented in the way they were set out in the strategy.  They refer to making Ireland a global innovation leader.  That was one of our previous commitments under the old strategy, so we would like to see what the proposals are for that next stage.  That is incredibly important because we have seen the link in the latest CSO data, when it did the productivity in Ireland statistics for 2019, that those firms that were investing in innovation, research and development were the ones that had the highest level of productivity growth over the past ten years.  It is circular.  The ones that innovate are productive, but then the ones that are productive also have the capacity to invest in the innovation, so it is very hard to disentangle the causality there.  They are intrinsically linked, though, so we would like to see more of the smaller firms, maybe, engage in that innovation as well so they could also benefit from-----</p></speech>

We have seen during Covid the digitalisation of small businesses.  For example, there are now lots of food ordering services that can be provided through an app on your phone.  Lots of smaller restaurants have signed up to apps that they do not have to manage themselves but with which they can integrate their business.  That is a small sign of the digitalisation.  An innovation, from that business's perspective, saves one person answering the phone so the business can grow and serve more customers.  There are smaller elements like that.  Again, improvements in digital skills will help those businesses.  There are also opportunities through the local enterprise offices for peer-to-peer networks so they can learn from other businesses in similar areas and help them to grow.</p></speech>

No apologies have been received.  Members in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practice good hand hygiene and leave at least one vacant seat between them and others attending.  They should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  I ask for the full co-operation of members in this regard.  I have been encouraging our members to dial in remotely if possible considering the high Covid numbers at present.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee I welcome from the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, Professor Niamh Moloney, chair, Mr. Colm O'Reardon, secretary, and Ms Sinead Ryan and Mr. Gary Hynds, principal officers of the secretariat.  I thank them all for attending today.  The purpose of today's meeting is to meet the newly formed commission.  The committee would also like to discuss the commission's remit, terms of reference and priorities for the coming year.</p> <p>  Before we begin I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and by statute, by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses today are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  They are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity the witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present in the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and in some cases this year the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, members who attempt to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  With that, we will begin our session.  There is huge interest in the work of the commission and I am sure there will be over the coming years.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance today.  I ask Professor Moloney to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

As per the invitation, my opening remarks will focus on the remit of the commission, its terms of reference and our priorities for the coming year.</p> <p>  The commission was established by Government and commenced its work in June 2021, with the objective, as set out in our terms of reference, to "independently consider how best the taxation and welfare systems can support economic activity and promote increased employment and prosperity, while ensuring that there are sufficient resources available to meet the costs of public services and supports in the medium and longer term".  The Government has asked us to report by July of next year.  As I will outline in a moment, the terms of reference for the commission are extensive.  While the commission got off to a good start and has held nine meetings so far with our tenth on Friday, we are still in the early stages of our deliberations.  I hope committee members will appreciate that we are a long way from reaching conclusions at this point in time.</p> <p>  The commission&rsquo;s remit covers both taxation and welfare but its outlook is firmly of a medium to long-term nature.  Our role is to stand back from the day-to-day debates on taxation and welfare and look at how well the tax and welfare systems are likely to fit the country&rsquo;s needs over the next ten to 20 years.  In doing so, we have been asked to consider factors such as the impact of the Covid-19 emergency, ageing demographics, digital disruption and automation, and the long-term strategic commitments of Government regarding health, housing and climate.  Members of the commission are drawn from a broad cross-section of relevant backgrounds, including taxation, welfare, economics, law and broader civil society, each bringing a mix of applicable skillsets and backgrounds to the table.  We are undertaking this work as an independent body, unencumbered by political pressures, stepping back and with a long-term perspective.</p> <p>  As well as this overall remit, as committee members will see from our terms of reference, the commission has been asked to look at a number of specific issues.  These include: ensuring there are sufficient resources available to meet the costs of public services into the future; supporting economic activity and income redistribution while promoting increased employment and prosperity; and examining what changes, if any, should be made to the social insurance system.  Also included is examining how welfare policy can work in tandem with the taxation system to support economic activity while continuing to support those most vulnerable in our society in a fair and equitable way.  The terms of reference also include examining how the taxation system can be used to help Ireland move to a low carbon economy, the appropriate role for the taxation and welfare system in achieving housing policy objectives including an examination of the merits of a site value tax.  The commission's terms of reference also include: examining Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness to foreign direct investment; the taxation environment for SMEs and entrepreneurs; the role of taxation and welfare in promoting good public health; the process for reviewing taxation measures and expenditures; and tax administration.  As members know, and as provided for in the terms of reference, we are also being asked to look at some of the revenue-raising proposals as set out in the recent report of the Commission on Pensions.</p> <p>  As committee members can see, this is a challenging agenda but it is an important one.  Our terms of reference reflect the central role that taxation and welfare play in our society.  The taxation and welfare systems make up some of the most significant and regular interactions between individuals and the State and define, in large part, the nature of the relationship between the State and the individual.  The tax and welfare systems are, accordingly, at the crux of the relationship between the State and the individual.  They are part but not the totality of the wider social contract, which is the set of rights and mutual obligations that come with living in Ireland.</p> <p>  Put simply, the taxation system provides the investment we make as individuals and as businesses for the public services we use, from our roads and bridges to our hospitals and schools.  For those of us at working age, our social welfare system serves to temporarily replace income lost to periods of unemployment, injury, disability, sickness or maternity.  Where earnings from employment are insufficient to avoid poverty or social exclusion, our system intervenes to provide a floor below which income will not fall and, of course, the social welfare system provides a core income for those in retirement.  Together, these are the most important instruments that we have to provide a safety net, to provide income redistribution and to pay for the needs of our society.  We have all seen over the course of the pandemic how crucial the tax and welfare systems have been in supporting families and businesses that have been so badly affected by the public health measures that had to be taken.</p> <p>  Our role, as I said, is to take a medium to long-term view.  This is, in essence, a strategic exercise in that we are being asked to stand back and look at systems as they are, the challenges ahead and to consider what changes are needed for the future.</p><p>Not least among these challenges is that of fiscal sustainability.  The primary function of the tax system is to fund Government expenditure at a level determined by the democratic system.  While the fiscal position will improve as the Covid-19 pandemic subsides, the public finances will face significant structural challenges in the medium to long term.  Of these, costs associated with demographic change are the most certain, with an ageing population putting pressure on pension and health costs.  While there are currently four working age people to support every person above 65, in 2050 the equivalent ratio will be 2:1.  This will place significant pressure on the public finances, even if just to provide the existing level of services.  Costs associated with the climate and digital transitions will also need to be funded.  It is vital therefore, that we think strategically now about the changes that might be needed to the tax and welfare systems in the future so that we can rise to these challenges and begin to prepare.<br/><br/>Each of the elements of the terms of reference represents an important issue which must be borne in mind when thinking about how the tax and welfare systems should be structured into the future.  What is crucially important, however, is that we think about these systems as systems.  How well do these systems as a whole hang together and meet the needs of our country?  The commission will examine each of these items in turn but that holistic viewpoint is also central to our work.<br/><br/>I mention our public consultation.  This engagement, which I value greatly, is particularly timely as the commission launched its public consultation entitled Your Vision, Our Future on 20 October.  This public consultation differs in a number of important ways from previous such exercises.  It is hosted on <i>cotw.citizenspace.com</i>, which is an online platform used by hundreds of government bodies worldwide.  This is a truly accessible, sophisticated and in-depth public consultation which complies with the web content accessibility guidelines.  In order to ensure we cast our net widely we have advertised on print, social and outdoor advertising platforms, ensuring that as many people as possible have an opportunity to make a submission.  Since the launch of the consultation we have already received 24 submissions.  This level of interest, even at this early stage of our work, is most heartening, as is the invitation to attend the committee to discuss this important undertaking.  Following the public consultation, the commission plans to undertake further stakeholder engagement events early next year to further explore themes and matters arising.  All of us have a stake in the taxation and welfare systems.  The committee members, as public representatives have unique insights into the views of the people they represent.  I greatly value the opportunity to meet members and I look forward to a fruitful and positive exchange over the course of the session.</p></speech>

It was not by accident that we asked to meet with it at this point because we would like to engage with the commission as much as possible throughout the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.198" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1455" speakername="Aindrias Moynihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#B00300"><p>I thank Professor Moloney for his presentation.  There is a broad task ahead and I appreciate that a huge volume of work is involved.  I understand that the commission has met up to nine times already and that it is aiming to report in July.  Is Professor Moloney satisfied that the commission is still on target for that July deadline with the volume of work that is ahead?  I mention the submissions the commission is receiving and the public consultation.  The interest groups will find whatever way they can to express their views to the commission whereas Professor Moloney mentioned 24 submissions to the public consultation.  Who is the commission getting the submissions from?  Are they from the general public or from those interest groups?  What level of engagement is the commission expecting to get from the general public?  They are the reason for the commission to be in place so is the commission getting engagement and input from the public?  How long has that engagement been run for up to now?</p> <p>  Professor Moloney referred to rights and obligations that come with living in Ireland.  Is she confining her terms of reference to those who are living here or is she looking beyond to those who might be trading through here or conducting business here?  Those people are also generating income through Ireland.</p> <p>  I mention the commission's outlook for the next ten to 20 years and Professor Moloney refers to demographics and other factors that might have an influence.  Is the commission confining itself to a 26-county republic when it looks to the 20 years ahead or is it looking at possibilities beyond that, including a 32-county republic?  I take the point that the commission is not wearing any political colours but is it looking at the possibilities that are out there?</p></speech>

I appreciate his comments and questions.  I thank the Deputy for acknowledging the scale of the task.  We have big, demanding and challenging terms of reference.  All of us on the commission have a sense of excitement and serious endeavour.  Commissions do not come along too often; we are the fourth that has come about over a long period of time and so we feel a strong sense of moment.  We have had an extraordinary year and a half by any measure in what the nation has been through and the different jobs the tax and welfare systems did in that time.  It is a key moment to have this chance to stand back and take a strategic look at those systems.</p> <p>  We have clear terms of reference, which is always helpful.  We have an overarching objective in what we are doing to ensure the tax and welfare systems effectively promote economic activity, support prosperity and employment and do so in a way that is resilient, stable and sustainable in supporting the public service.  We have a clear framework for that and within that we have the different elements of the terms of reference.  From the outset we have been conscious of this privilege, charge and responsibility.  A lot of thought has gone into work planning and we are clear about what we need to do, by when we need to get there and we are fortunate to have an excellent secretariat that supports us in doing that.  We are meeting every fortnight or so, which is keeping a good sense of momentum for our work going.  I feel a strong sense of confidence that we will deliver and it is my expectation that we will do so.  We want a credible, serious and practical report that we can deliver to the Minister by next July.  It is great to have an opportunity like we have this evening to have a preliminary discussion with the committee about how the terms of reference work.</p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for his interest in our consultation.  We are very excited about this and it is a key part of what we are doing.  As chair of the commission, I feel that tax and welfare are the two critical points that we interact with all of the time as households and businesses and as a society.  These are the two big vectors through which we interact with the State.  It is fundamental that we carry out a serious consultation that reaches beyond the more usual engagements and gets out to speak to people.  The 24 submissions we have received so far are from members of the general public, which is great.  We will keep an eye on this and continue to watch the consultation submissions that come through.</p><p>We will do another round of reminding the public as it goes through.  The consultation process is being promoted on bus shelters, social media and print media.  We want to hear from everybody.  Social welfare and taxation affects us all very heavily.  Of course, there is a role for our major stakeholders, our major constituencies, and they will be feeding into our consultation.  However, we view this consultation as fundamental.  Hence, our online platform is organised to be accessible and easy to navigate for the wider world at large.</p><p> I thank the Deputy for his helpful observations on our wider framework and the areas we might be examining.  We are looking at the tax and welfare systems as they support economic activity, public services and welfare in Ireland.  Tax is an extremely complex matter.  It involves all those international interactions and engagement.  We have seen in recent months just how important that international interaction is.  We are aware of tax as a very dynamic complex system that interacts in many different ways, internationally, domestically and with the EU, across different kinds of tax bases.  That is the great value of a stand-back review.  One can look at the system with all its different interactions internationally, domestically and so on.</p><p> One aspect that is perhaps different for our commission compared to others are issues related to different ways of working.  As a consequence of the pandemic, people are working in all sorts of different ways.  That is a wider frame, which is part of what a commission of our nature would find useful to examine.</p><p> In looking towards the future, it behoves a commission like ours to think around corners as it were, whatever those corners may be, internationally, domestically or regionally.  I do not think any of us could have predicted 20 years ago the major disruption to the nature of work that has occurred.  National tax might have evolved.  We take very seriously an element of foresight to how we think.  The commission at the start of its deliberations was very concerned to equip itself fully to think around corners.  We are very anxious to think consistently and strategically about the future.  For example, how do we think about the future, how do we recognise opportunities and how we recognise threats and challenges and so on?  We are taking a very wide-angle lens when it comes to all the different variables that might shape our tax and welfare systems into the future.  I very much appreciate the Deputy's interest and thank him for his comments, which are helpful to us in thinking about our work.</p></speech>

I am sorry I missed her opening statement, which I read earlier.  Second Stage of the Finance Bill is being dealt with at the same time as this meeting and I am trying to be in a number of locations at the same time.  I welcome Professor Moloney's opening statement and the commission's broad terms of reference, which are broader than those of previous commissions given the issues of welfare that come under its remit which it needs to consider.</p> <p>  I apologise if any of my questions have already been answered.  If so, Professor Moloney can bypass them and I will read the transcript of the proceedings later.  The commission has a wider remit than previous commissions.  How will that remit be dealt with by the commission?  The commission is to report by 1 July next year.  Does it expect to meet that deadline?  I am sure Professor Moloney will say it does at this stage.  More importantly, will the report be just given to the Minister or will the commission publish it at that stage?  The previous commission's report, which extended to 600 pages and contained much detail and analysis, was quite significant.</p> <p>  I have another question on the public consultation exercise and the user-friendly platform the commission has used, which I have not used but I will have a look at it.  How does Professor Moloney expect the public consultation exercise will shape the priorities of the commission as it carries out its work?  That brings me to my next question on the wide remit of the commission covering areas, such as the climate challenge we face, which were not under consideration when the previous commission reported.  We had a different crisis in terms of housing at that time; there was possibly an oversupply then but now there is a major undersupply.  The commission has to deal with issues in terms of tax expenditure, public health and the social welfare system.  How does Professor Moloney define the priorities in all of that as the commission carries out its work over the coming months?</p></speech>

I am very conscious of how busy their schedule is, particularly this evening.  I thank Deputy Doherty for his questions.  I will reply to them in the order in which he asked them.  Regarding the commission's wide remit, it has very extensive terms of reference.  I am appreciative to the Deputy for noticing that.  When we stand back and think strategically about something as fundamental and significant as the tax and welfare systems and how they interact, we need a big canvas.  We need to be able to stand back and see this as a system and how it all interacts together.  While in some respects, it is very big and almost even somewhat daunting, in other respects it reminds us of the scale of the canvas it operates on and the number of ways in which it interacts back into society.  This is not just tax in terms of a code; it is tax and welfare.  It impacts the environment, health, incentives to work and the smallest of SMEs.  The very scale of it reminds us of just how fundamental this kind of exercise is.  We all welcome it.  We welcome the scale of it and the picture it is requiring us to paint in terms of how the tax and welfare systems work together.</p> <p>  We really feel a sense of responsibility.  It is a big exercise to set up a commission, resource it and have a secretariat.  Governments do not do it very often.  We feel this is a very serious opportunity to stand back.  It is the fourth time there has been this kind of exercise.  We aim to do a serious, strategic, evidenced-based piece of work that lives up to this.  My hope and expectation is that we will report by July.  To do that, we need to be organised, systematic and serious about what we are doing and that is how we are operating.  We have a fantastic commission, comprising 14 members, who bring with them a great deal of experience and expertise and great enthusiasm and energy as well as a terrific secretariat.  We meet roughly every two weeks.  We will have our 10th meeting on Friday and we will try to keep that momentum up.  Our work is focusing us very closely.  I agree with the Deputy that we have a big challenge.  We have a responsibility to make sure we do this as effectively as possible.</p> <p>  The report will go the Minister and then it will be published.  Part of our job as a commission is to think seriously and deeply and come up with practical and useful recommendations, but there is an element in which it is helpful to outline and communicate what tax and welfare do, why the systems are set up the way they are and what shaped them.  It is very important there is publication of a report of this nature.</p> <p>  That brings me to the Deputy&rsquo;s second question on the consultation exercise and the platform we have used.  We view this as very important for a number of reasons.  The last year and a half has shown us the importance of the way we support each other and what we owe each other, and how the tax and welfare systems work together to make that happen.  That has been one of the significant lessons for us during the past year and half.  Even during the past ten years, there has been so much change in our society and economy.</p><p>This is a real moment.  We have a reason, a context and resources, as an independent body, to talk to people.  That is very important because this is a key vector through which individuals interact with tax and welfare, hence the platform.  With regard to the feedback, the commission members and I strongly believe there must be feedback when people take the time to speak to us and work their way through the consultation questions, whether just one - which is absolutely fine - or all of them.  It is iterative.  That will be coming through.  We will look at the reaction we are getting.  It is very important that the consultation reaches as widely as possible.  It is our job, as a commission, to feed that into our deliberations, to get a sense of what is coming through and what people are worried about and to determine how that can shape our work.  We are planning some kind of stakeholder event for early in the new year, perhaps in January or February.  That will be a useful point.  We will be further advanced in our deliberations and the public consultation will be closing in January.  This will be a useful staging point to take stock.  We see it as absolutely fundamental.</p><p> On the width of the remit and how things have changed, Deputy Doherty mentioned the housing crisis, prioritisation and how we frame our work.  I will offer a few reflections on these matters.  It is a good time to stand back and take this strategic long-term view because one thing is absolutely clear, namely, that the constant dynamic challenge faced by tax and welfare systems is enormous and has been over the last ten years.  The Deputy rightly mentioned the housing crisis.  This is a very significant issue.  Going back ten years, we had other crises.  We now have the pandemic.  That is the nature of the modern economy.  It is not static.  There is always something shaping circumstances that we need to react to.  This is a chance to stand back and take a systemic strategic look at the system to ensure it is best equipped for the future.  My academic work is in the area of financial regulation and I often fall into the notion of stress-testing.  Who knows what challenges may arise?  We know what some of them are but we must think about the system to ensure it is best equipped to deal with them.</p><p> With regard to our priorities, we have terms of reference which closely guide what we do.  My overall priority is to ensure we produce a report that is coherent, evidence-based and strategic and which responds to what the Government has asked us to consider.</p></speech>

I wish Professor Moloney really well on her work.  While we may not agree with some of the recommendations and may be delighted with others, the important thing is that we have evidence-based research.  I have a couple of final questions before my time runs out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#D00300"><p>Deputy Doherty is welcome to come in with a couple of questions but he is well over time so I ask him to keep them short.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.207" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#D00400"><p>I will keep them very short.  Is the commission going to look at international experience?  For example, employers' PRSI here is way below what is required.  That brings me to my second question.  The commission has been asked to look at long-term commitments from the Government but governments change.  Some parties want to see a bigger State and greater State involvement while others want to see more of the lifting done by the private sector.  Will the commission look beyond current Government commitments?</p> <p>  My third and final question relates to the expert group on childcare which has been established.  The Department is publishing papers as it goes along.  The final report will consider recommendations and so on but research papers are being published to inform the debate and discussion as we go along.  I looked at the minutes of one of the commission's meetings and they indicated that the commissioning of a number of papers on tax expenditures and tax levers for public health was being considered.  It is really important that those papers be published as the commission goes along with its work.  Obviously, there would still be a final report which would cover the commission's analysis and final recommendations.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for noting the international context.  There is value for this kind of exercise in looking at what other international systems are doing.  I will make a couple of observations in that regard.  The extent to which there are great debates about very similar issues and questions in so many places internationally right now is interesting.  It behoves us to look at these international debates.  We must always be very conscious of context.  Debates, particularly debates on tax and welfare, happen in very distinct local, cultural and institutional contexts.  In drawing and learning from international experience, we have always been very careful about how it is imported and about learning the right kind of lessons.  Considering the international context is the kind of value a commission like this can bring.</p> <p>  The Deputy's second point related to interacting with different governmental perspectives about the role of the State and so on.  Our view is that we are a technocratic commission and that it is our job to stand back, think about the systems and take a ten, 15 or 20-year perspective.  That is our job.  Once we have delivered on that, the political and democratic system steps in.  We hope and aim for our report to be a credible and resilient resource over the long term.  We want it to be something that can be used by the people of Ireland over a good timeframe and a resilient resource for the future.</p> <p>  With regard to the papers, at the moment, we are publishing our minutes because it is very important that the public has a good sense of how we are approaching matters.  Along with our consultation document, we prepared a primer document with data and discussion on different tax bases.  That aimed to support our consultation.  The research papers will feed into our ultimate report in different ways.  The data and so on we will be using will be available in the report in due course.  That will form part of the report in July.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#D00600"><p>I thank Professor Moloney.  I am sorry for hesitating; I was just making sure I was giving her the correct title.  I also thank her team and wish the commission good luck.  It is welcome.  I apologise that I will also have to run over and speak in the debate on the Finance Bill.  It is an interesting contrast in a way because the Finance Bill comprises lots of individual measures relating to different headings such as income tax, USC, corporation tax, property-based taxes and so on.  It comprises lots of individual measures.  It might be argued that there is no strategic debate going on in respect of the Finance Bill and the taxation measures it contains.  That happens to some degree in a budget but in the context of a particular year and particular political pressures.  Some questions never get discussed having stood back from those things, so this is a good initiative.</p> <p>  I would like to quiz Professor Moloney a little bit more about how she sees the commission doing that and the extent to which she thinks it is possible to have evidence-based views when many of the issues are heavily contested, not least by the people they affect.  The submissions of the people are evidence in and of themselves.  With the best will in the world, it strikes me that great numbers of those who are most economically disadvantaged are among those least likely to even know this is happening and will not be terribly well-equipped to engage with it.  Does Professor Moloney accept that is a concern and that it is something we must address?  How do we get the voices of those who are generally not heard on issues like taxation and what taxation should be there for and welfare and what welfare should achieve heard when it will tend to be - for want of a better word - the political nerds and the people who know about these things who make submissions?</p><p>One thing I said about public consultations in a slightly different context is that we should advertise these public consultations.  There should be radio advertisements to the effect that a serious look is being taken at tax and welfare in this country, what they are for, how fair they are and whether members of the public think they are working for them.  We should be advertising those public consultations.  Of course, if we did that, we probably would get many submissions.  There would be many more than a couple of hundred.  Then, there would be even more work on the hands of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  I want to run that by Professor Moloney because there is a danger in any public consultation that the voices that are often not heard will not be heard again, even with the best will in the world.</p><p> Will Professor Moloney quickly state what she sees as the role of the committee in this process?  Is today the day for us to give suggestions as to what we think?  I do not think we have time today.  However, most people in our committee and possibly some other committees would like to have a discussion about the big strategic questions on tax and welfare that need to be addressed, as well as on our views about how they should be addressed.  Professor Moloney might say a word about that.  To give a couple of examples, wealth taxes need to be discussed.  They happen in some places.  They have generally been resisted in this country.  However, there is a real debate about them.  It is a debate that is also relevant to the climate debate at the moment.  To give a big bold statement, unless you deal with the gross and growing inequality in wealth and income across the world, you will not address the climate emergency.  I put it up as bluntly as that.  Not everybody shares that opinion but I am convinced of that.  It is a pretty undisputed fact that the 1%, as they are famously called, although you could call them the 10%, own 50% or 60% of the wealth in this country.  Those figures are generally repeated around the world.  The bottom 50% have 2% or less of the wealth between them.  Unless you address that, I cannot see how you could address the climate emergency.  Will the commission look at that sort of thing?  What are the serious arguments?  Does Professor Moloney feel that at the end of the process, the commission will be able take a position on things like that? </p><p> To give another example, I looked at the Commission on Taxation and Welfare's survey.  The witnesses might respond to my belief that it is a little bit loaded in respect of the local property tax and the site value tax.  First, I still struggle to fully understand what a site value tax is, in comparison with the local property tax.  I imagine that many other people would too.  There are also other options that are not considered in that binary question the commission is asking.  I favour a multiple property tax for the non-principal private residences.  I bet that were people asked whether those with multiple properties should be taxed on their property wealth, as against those who just have the family home, a majority would probably state that would be fairer.  Why is that question not asked?  Should it be asked or will the Commission on Taxation and Welfare ask it?  That is just another example.  There are some things that might not even occur to people unless one puts the facts in front of them.  </p><p> One thing that greatly struck me, when looking at tax in the run-up to the most recent budget, particularly in the aftermath of Covid-19, is that corporate profits went through the roof.  This followed a consistent pattern over recent years, although it seemed to be even be more pronounced during Covid-19.  I believe this year pre-tax corporate profits were &euro;203 billion.  That is approximately 127% more than they were a decade ago.  They pay approximately &euro;11 billion in tax.  All of the workers in this country together earn &euro;127 billion.  This figure is a little bit more than half of what the corporations earned.  However, the workers paid &euro;27 billion in tax.  To me, that is a radical disparity between the corporate sector making huge profits and making much smaller tax contributions relative to its profit income, as against workers who have less income between all of them but who pay a much higher proportion in tax in both absolute and relative terms.  Are those sorts of issues going to be addressed, discussed and put to people?  There are a few questions there.  I can think of a lot more.  </p></speech>

Again, we appreciate the engagement of the committee with us this evening.  I thank the Deputy for his rich observations.  I will take them in order as best I can.</p> <p>  The first point the Deputy mentioned was on evidence base.  To be sure I was clear on this issue, we will be producing papers as we go along and we will publish all of those at the end.  Once our final report is published, we will also publish the different papers that have informed our work.  We are keen to take an evidence-based approach and to show colleagues, as well as to everybody affected, how we went about our decision-making.  </p> <p>  The Deputy makes a good point about consultations.  They are tricky things.  On the one hand, we do them to try to engage as many voices as possible, including small businesses, households and individuals.  We do this to try to capture as diverse a range of opinions as possible.  When one considers that the last time this exercise was done, which was ten or 12 years ago, we did not have these kinds of tools.  It was difficult to get wide-ranging public consultations.  Digitalisation has made all of this so much more possible.  However, I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about how to engage with as wide a group of people as possible.  On a purely functional level, we are using all different kinds of outreach and different kinds of media.  </p> <p>  A point I should mention is that we have all sorts of expertise and experience around the table at the commission.  There is a strong, collective commitment to ensure that systems of tax and welfare are fair and equitable to the most vulnerable in society.  That is expressly called out in our terms of reference.  Additionally, as a group, we are all deeply conscious of the importance of the two systems of tax and welfare and how they interact.  That interaction is particularly important for those who are most vulnerable in our society.  We are hoping to have as broad an outreach as possible.  We as a commission hold that close in our deliberations, as well as in how we approach these different issues.  We are conscious of that.  </p> <p>  Our engagement with the Deputy is hugely valuable, as is this whole exercise this evening.  From my perspective, and I am sure I am speaking on behalf of the commission, this interaction with the committee is extremely valuable.  We would be hugely appreciative if Deputies were available to respond to our consultation and, of course, in respect of any bilateral engagement.  Were Deputies able to write into the commission, we would be delighted to learn from submissions they and their colleagues may make.  We value that greatly.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the scale of the issues, as well as the great debate that is necessary about some of these big questions.  The Deputy mentioned wealth tax and the link between inequality, the just transition and the huge carbon challenge that we are all facing.  He mentioned property tax and site value tax.  In some ways, that shows the scale of what we are dealing with.  On the one hand, there are huge choices about how one designs a tax system.  What bases does one use?  Who is taxed, depending on what those bases are?  The bases could be income, consumption, or different sources of wealth.  Then one devolves right into the seemingly technical but really important questions about how local property tax is designed.  How is something like a site value tax designed?  How is some other tax designed?</p><p>Our job is to stand back and try to make sure the technical design choices fit within a coherent system that supports economic activity, prosperity and employment while also ensuring we are protecting the most vulnerable through the big decisions we make about how the tax and welfare systems work.  These are big debates that are happening internationally.  Even in recent weeks, the Biden Administration had a very big debate on the role of a wealth tax and how it might be designed.  There are big debates in the UK right now.  The UK has a commission on wealth taxation.  There are big debates on the role of public health and taxation.  For our commission, these are big questions but we are in the right place at the right time.  There are very big debates internationally &ndash; generational debates &ndash; on what we owe one another in society and how we express what we owe one another, whether it is through paying our taxes or supporting those who are vulnerable through a welfare system.  We very much embraced the opportunity to stand back and have a serious debate on the role of the various taxes and how they support welfare and interact and to examine strategically the technical components of the system.  If they are not working together correctly, it feeds back into the overall design of the system.</p><p> We very much welcome the engagement of the Deputy and all his colleagues on the committee.  By way of making a small footnote, we have already found significantly helpful the committee's 2019 report on the review of tax expenditure, for example.  We will very much welcome further engagement by members and thank them in advance for it.</p></speech>

To what extent does the commission envisage itself making recommendations on what should be adopted after it has considered the climate crisis and various taxes, such as wealth tax, property-based taxes and corporate tax, and having examined the evidence and listened to the public?  Does Professor Moloney envisage the commission recommending a wealth tax or saying the corporations are paying too little or too much? I hope the commission will not argue they are paying too much.</p></speech>

We are absolutely in the business of making serious, practical, evidence-based recommendations that we very much hope will stand the test of time and be sustainable over ten, 15 or 20 years.  We absolutely want to make a serious contribution to how public policy works in this country as regards tax and welfare.  Our mission is to produce specific recommendations.  We are aiming to have recommendations that are credible, coherent and evidence based.  We are animated by the sense that we can make a serious contribution and make recommendations for the political process to work with.  We take this with the utmost seriousness.</p></speech>

One of our terms of reference requires us to consider the balance of taxation in respect of earned income, consumption and wealth.  The question of how the various bases work together forms a logical part of any stand-back analysis of a tax system.  One of the points that is important when examining a tax system as a whole concerns all the various sources of income, wealth and consumption.  There are different ways of thinking about taxes on sources of wealth, such as property tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and DIRT.  It is a matter of thinking about the various sources through which tax operates, about whether taxes are operating effectively as possible and about whether the right levers are being pulled in the right place, having learned from international experience.  There are very big debates internationally on all this right now.  We will absolutely be taking seriously the big questions on how tax systems should be designed.</p></speech>

There are very interesting conversations going on.  I want to concentrate on a few principles.  Professor Moloney talked about social welfare and taxation.  The main challenge I see in our country is ensuring that work pays.  It needs to be the case that people are better off when working so they can pay for whatever is required, be it childcare or otherwise, rather than having circumstances in which the difference between going to work and staying at home and not working is marginal.  Work that pays is a vital cog in the economy.  If we are to have a sustainable economy, we need to make it attractive for people to go to work.  The margins are too thin now.  Increasing pay might be an obvious approach but that decreases our competitiveness.  It is in the area of taxation that we need to consider this.</p> <p>  Let me address the other areas I am concerned about.  We tax people.  We must do the analysis to see whether we are extracting tax from people, businesses and other sources &ndash; it is all coming from people &ndash; in a fair way, and whether we are allocating the revenue, through social payments, in a fair and reasonable way.</p> <p>  One of my bones of contention is business premises having to pay rates regardless of whether they are profitable.  I am not talking about multinational companies but ordinary people in towns and villages.  We have got into circumstances in which local authorities are relying heavily on rates.  They are a tax on business as opposed to a tax on profit or turnover.  They are paid in accordance with the size of one's premises.  It is very much a draconian approach in that when somebody sets up a business, the tax is foisted on that business.  In many cases, businesses say they do not get a return for paying rates.</p> <p>  When taxing people, be they the super wealthy, business people or others, there is always a tipping point beyond which they would be overtaxed.  How can that be managed?  What are the commission's comments on that and my other views?  It is time that a commission examined taxation and social welfare.  We should not be waiting for this; it should be done regularly, such as every five years, to inform politicians and policy on how we perform.</p> <p>  I like Professor Moloney's freshness.  She is clear in her mind on what she is going to be dealing with and recommending.  I like that and compliment her on it.</p></speech>

It is very helpful for me to have this interaction with the Deputy and all his colleagues.  I appreciate it, particularly because I am aware that the committee has a very busy schedule this evening.</p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising a very distinct part of the job of the 2021 Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  A distinctive feature that has not been a feature of other commissions so far is the focus on the interaction between the tax system, incentives that make it worthwhile to work, the welfare system and all the various incentives along that chain.</p><p>Our terms of reference bring us right back to supporting economic activity, and prosperity and employment, while also being very cognisant of those who are most vulnerable in society and taking a fair and equitable approach.  This is something that is novel and we embrace it.  As the Deputy said, it is in that interaction that we are at the crux of the issues of prosperity, economic incentives and supporting people in the best possible way.  It is something we are looking at and taking very seriously.  </p><p> There are many different facets to this, including the points of interaction between when it is worthwhile to work, given the return from work, the different forms of tax charge and the point at which they activate.  These are technical issues but they are very important.  For someone who is going to work and moving from one threshold or rate to another, it is very important we have the mandate to look at that, the impact it has, how those different rates, bands and thresholds all fit together and how they feed back into our terms of reference of supporting our prosperity and the economy.  I very much welcome that part of our terms of reference.  The comments the Deputy made in that regard are very valuable and I thank him for them.</p><p>Regarding the issues of business premises and rates, one of the themes undercutting our terms of reference, alongside the interaction between tax and welfare, is the interaction between much of the tax code and smaller businesses and SMEs because we run the gamut on that.  On tax administration, for example, it is very important for small businesses that the tax system is navigable and not overly complex and that the administration of it works effectively.  Equally, and some of the statistics are very stark for small businesses, 91% of all businesses employ fewer than ten people.  That is the absolute beating heart of our economy so it is very important the tax system is cognisant of that and reflects those sorts of challenges in allowing small businesses to grow in scale and to start.</p><p> A whole ecosystem sits around that, from corporation tax through to income tax, different reliefs and the commercial rates system and how it works.  Again, it is this sense that, for a small business and the system within which it sits, whether it is the tax wedge that applies as it pays its employees, how the commercial rates system works or the administration of the tax system as it engages with it, these are all very important matters for us to look at holistically.  We need to stand back and ensure, especially for smaller businesses and entrepreneurs, that all this is working effectively.  I thank the Deputy for his comments.  They are well noted and will be very helpful for us as we go forward.</p></speech>

We sometimes bring in systems that do not always suit everybody and we need to be able to tailor them.  Even at the moment, I see individuals trying to pay the local property tax and if there is a glitch in the system, they just cannot move with it.</p> <p>  To give an example, we have set up very sophisticated ways of dealing with procurement to try to save money.  Sometimes I believe we have created an industry called procurement without actually saving money.  We have just transferred costs from the base price of the product to the procurement system.  The cost of procurement is such now that smaller companies, if they are to compete, have to have in-house expertise in procurement or they have to buy it in.  That is something that gets lost when we bring in systems.  What is the cost of running these systems within small companies?  It is just another part of it.  I wish the commission well and I look forward to working with it over the coming months.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Moloney and her team for everything they have been doing.  We are very aware that the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from 2030.  Will the commission consider other ways of replacing the inevitable loss of revenue?  What are Professor Moloney's early thoughts on how we would best do this?</p></speech>

I am very conscious that all the Deputies have a very busy evening so I very much appreciate them being with us.  I thank them for that.  The Deputy has asked a very important and interesting question.  Over the past ten years or so, there has been a real concern, globally, not just in Ireland, to address the enormous generational challenge of climate change.  We see it this week with COP26 but there has also been a long slow burn in that our tax system has been adjusting to reflect this and to better nudge our behaviour.  Sustainability issues then arise regarding the revenue streams coming through from certain forms of tax base.  This is called out specifically in our terms of reference.  We are very glad to have that because this is a key issue.  It feeds back into our overall terms of reference, which are ultimately there to make sure the State has sufficient revenue to provide the public services and supports that are fundamental to us as a nation.</p> <p>  On some of the numbers, if the rate of electric car uptake, for example, continues as one hopes, we are looking at a revenue hole in the region of &euro;1.5 billion by 2030.  On the one hand, the incentives are doing a very good job but, on the other hand, they are opening up a sustainability issue.  We are very conscious of that in our terms of reference.  It is too early in our deliberations to say how we might specifically address this, but we have a sense that it is important, ultimately, that public services in this country are funded not just for now but in the context of all the challenges we will face into the future.  We have a sustainability issue as regards certain taxation bases.  Looking into the future, we see the ageing demographic, which is one of the very big issues.  If we operate using our current services in terms of health, pensions and so on, something like &euro;17 billion extra will be needed by 2050.  We are acutely conscious of the sustainability question that arises on revenue.  Our job is to stand back, look at the system as a whole, check it is all working in the best possible way and as effectively as it should be, but to do this with a medium or long-term lens to see what best specific recommendations we can make in this regard.</p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue because it is one that is particular to where we are at this moment in time, having had this period during which we have been adjusting to a new way of using taxes.  It is now very important, as taxes become more effective, to consider how they loop and feed back into the wider sustainability question.</p></speech>

Will our current inflation rate have a bearing on the work the commission does?  If it does, how will it impact on that work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.226" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Niamh Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#G00600"><p>This really is one of the questions of the hour.  For the past number of weeks, there has been a debate on inflation, which has been important.  I will again go to the sense that our commission is looking at these questions at this moment in time, because five years ago inflation was not so much of an issue in considering how fiscal sustainability was to be addressed.</p><p>It is a very good reminder, and I thank the Deputy for it, of the scale of the certain and uncertain challenges that lie ahead.  It is very difficult to predict how inflation is going to go.  There are all sorts of different discussions and narratives around that.  It is part of a very dynamic picture that our tax and welfare systems are currently grappling with.  Our job is to factor that in and to be aware of all of the different headwinds that are coming over the medium to long term.  There is a difference between the immediate yearly budgetary cycle and the immediate pressures and the fluctuating odds, which is about five, ten or 15 years out.  The value of one's salary when taken home is fundamental to how tax and welfare works.  That is part of the framework within which we will be operating.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue this evening.</p></speech>

The floor is now open to anybody who would like to come in a second time.  Members can indicate if they wish to speak by raising a hand.  While they are thinking about, I have some questions for Professor Moloney.</p> <p>  My first question is on an issue that has come up previously at this committee and at the Joint Committee on Health.  We have talked a little today about health.  I note in the work of the committee thus far a discussion around the demographics challenge of providing suitable services into the future.  Does the commission have enough access to suitable data in terms of its work?  As a committee, we are aware that sometimes Ireland falls short on the provision of disaggregated data for the purposes of, for example, health service planning.  Has the commission come across that yet?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.230" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Niamh Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#H00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for that very good question.  It goes to something we are very conscious of doing, which is having an evidence base.  One of our challenges relates to longitudinal evidence.  We are trying to look out to 2030, 2040, 2050 in order to get a sense of the long-term pressures and so we are looking around corners.  We are benefiting from much of the Government evidence that is out there and we are drawing on international evidence.  For example, one of our terms of reference calls out good public health policy.  While this is an enormous challenge in some respects, particularly as regards poor diet and the challenges that creates, it is an issue that many of the major advanced economies are grappling with and so we are able to access policy debates from across Europe.  There are many debates going on about how different forms of welfare tax support might be structured to respond to public health challenges.  We are very conscious of having a strong evidence base.  We are lucky in that we have a very strong secretariat, that is very effective and nimble.  We would be very grateful for support across the Civil Service and Government for the type of data that would feed our discussions.  We are very thankful for the level of support we have received thus far, but it is something we are very conscious of.  We would be anxious to make sure that when we are making our recommendations we can support why we are going in certain directions.</p></speech>

I am mindful that the commission represents a group of experts in their field.  It no secret that during the negotiations there some issues that the coalition could not reach consensus on, including for the Green Party, a site value tax and a wealth tax.  That is, in part, the reason the commission was established and tasked with discussion of those issues.  In terms of the process, how easy is it for the commission, as experts, to bring forth particular issues?  Are all of the points of debate or the issues with which the commission will be dealing coming from the public consultation, the terms of reference as set out by the Government or is the commission easily able to table issues that it believes are important?</p></speech>

There are a couple of reflections I would make.  We are very conscious of working within our mandate.  It is a privilege to have been set up.  The commission's terms of reference guide its work, which we take with the utmost seriousness.  It is a very wide terms of reference.  That has great strengths in that it allows us, as a commission, to reflect widely and deeply and to challenge each other on how we think about tax and welfare from all of our different perspectives.  We certainly do not see it as limiting us.  It is very helpful in terms of setting our direction and framework and in ensuring we are looking in the right directions and producing something that will be of use to Governments into the future.  It allow us to have very productive and engaged discussions. </p> <p>  I feel very lucky to be working with the group of people who are on the commission.  We meet every two weeks, which is great.  We are working very closely and there is a wide range of expertise and experience around the table.  There is something else as well, namely, a great willingness on the part of everybody to engage regardless of the question.  This is a function of the fact of our terms of reference.  There is very important language therein about a fair and equitable approach, looking after the most vulnerable, supporting SMEs and bringing us back into the big framework about how tax and welfare supports economic activity, funds prosperity and ensures that we can support our public services.  Whatever our experience and background - there is a great deal of experience on the commission from all different areas - there is a common, collective sense that we all have a responsibility and stake as regards those very big issues.  To go to the question, that prompts wide and expansive debates.  We are discussing a very wide range of issues.</p></speech>

We have had a great deal of discussion today about the content of the commission and various types of taxes.  Will the commission also address the timing of taxes, the budgetary cycle and how it interacts with tax and welfare?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Niamh Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#H00800"><p>I thank the Chairman for the question.  Tax and welfare operate at two levels in some respects.  The budgetary cycle, which is an annual cycle, is a really important political process.  It debates and adopts the budget for the year and makes the choices for that year around spending, borrowing and how tax and welfare are going to work.  That is fundamental and critical to ourselves as a nation.  There is also that wider debate and discussion and choice about the bigger system, standing back from the immediate pressures that the Government or Parliament face in any given year and the short-term choices that have to be made about particular issues.  In terms of where we come in, cognisant of the types of issues, pressures, changes and dynamics that are out there, we put all of that into a melting pot and try to come up with menus, recommendations and options that will be resilient in ten, 15 or 20 years and that are there to be used by the political process in accordance with the needs and pressures that arise and the choices that need to be made at any given time.  We are very cognisant of it and we are conscious of what is going on in any particular budgetary cycle, but we come in at that wider point.</p></speech>

I do think that sometimes the budgetary cycle has an impact on the manner in which tax is implemented.  I would like to put that out there.  I am hopeful that in this Government cycle there will be significant progress on issues such as equality budgeting and well-being indicators.</p><p>I am thinking in particular of gender and diversity issues and considering them in terms of the impact tax has on particular groups.  Will that be part of the commission's remit?</p></speech>

In our kind of exercise where you are standing back and looking at the system, that is part of what we are doing.  We are looking at how different constituencies and cohorts are supported and protected by the tax member systems.  Society has evolved, and where we are now in 2021 is somewhat different from where other commissions on tax and welfare would have been over earlier periods.  It is very important for us to have that kind of lens on the society we are in and the society we are becoming, as it changes and as we look at how tax and welfare operate.</p></speech>

I must apologise to them as I was in the Chamber for the past hour and a half, and I have missed the discussion up to now.  I will ask the questions I had prepared but I may be repeating what has been said.  As I do not like people repeating themselves, the witnesses should feel free to say if they have already covered an issue.</p> <p>  One of the issues I am interested in is the analysis of taxation in this State and how the weight of taxation is broken down by taxes falling on labour versus capital.  In the former category, I refer to income tax, universal social charge, USC, etc., and in terms of tax on capital, there is corporation tax, capital gains tax, etc.  Globally, over the past 40 years, taxes on capital have been falling while tax on labour has been rising.  This kind of analysis in an Irish context could be very valuable.  The distribution of taxation is a pull-policy issue.  Legislators having such information would be really helpful in informing the debate.  Is that something the commission is looking at?</p></speech>

I appreciate it very much.  I thank Deputy Farrell for her reflections.  She raises a very important question.  It is exactly the kind of question that a commission like ours is best positioned to look at.  To do that kind of assessment, we need to stand back and take a longitudinal perspective.  We also need to look at other systems.  As Deputy Farrell mentioned, there are big debates around this right now.  In 2021, in terms of where we are right now, if you look around most advanced economies, they are debating how tax systems work and, as Deputy Farrell mentioned, what is the balance between current income and consumption and different sources of capital and wealth.  UCD does a huge amount of work in this area and it is coming out of the other universities also.  There is a very rich source of debate about this.  It is a great debate as to how we organise tax.  This is the kind of thing that it is appropriate for a body like ours to look at, in particular because we are the stand-back for the ten, 15 to 20 years, where the stress-testing body is not working.  Do we need to look here or there?  If we look there, how does that interact with what is sitting over there so the whole system is working sustainably?</p> <p>  Even though we have a broad term of reference, the timing at which we are looking at this is interesting.  We have seen huge debates in the US in the past two weeks.  The Biden Administration is looking at a very distinct form of tax on income levels that were stratospheric.  That is the kind of debate they are having.  It is important to be aware of the debate and why it is happening and what we can learn from it.  It is important that a commission of our nature looks across the different bases of taxation and how effectively they are working together.</p></speech>

I am annoyed that I missed the meeting up to now because it sounds like the committee had a very interesting debate.  I will probably look back on it.  Professor Moloney is correct that it is very interesting to see.  I love to look at how things are developing internationally and how the conversation is going.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett may have already mentioned this, because it is something he raises a lot.  He often says that tax expenditures act like a shadow budget.  It would be interesting to see what we spend every year on tax expenditures versus actual spending.  Will the commission be looking at that kind of analysis as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.242" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Niamh Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021110300002#J00700"><p>Absolutely.  Tax expenditures are a really important part of a tax system.  Since we are taking a systemic view, in my head I think of all these clocks that are interacting with each other, in terms of bases and expenditures and so on, and what we end up with as all the clocks are moving together.  Our terms of reference calls this out specifically, that we look at the process around which tax expenditures are reviewed.  This is a very important analysis for us.</p> <p>  It is striking that we have in the region of 180 tax expenditures.  They cost somewhere in the region of &euro;7 billion.  This is a core part of our tax system in the same way that the different bases are a core part of the tax system.  It is important that we stand back and look at the system for doing this, in terms of the data that feed into tax expenditures, the process through which they are reviewed, what objectives they are designed to achieve and what metrics we use to assess those objectives.  These are big questions.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the importance of the committee's work on this.  It is very useful for us to have the committee's 2019 report into the tax expenditure process, which made eight recommendations on how one could think about tax expenditures.  We are very grateful to have that.  This is a really important area.  In some respects, tax expenditures are very technical and specific, but what we need to do is to stand back and look at that as a system and how we can review and test them.  We will be looking at tax expenditures.  We are very grateful for the work done by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in this regard, and we look forward to reflecting on it very seriously.</p></speech>

I can see Professor Moloney's enthusiasm for the subject.  I do not blame her.  She has an interesting project ahead of her.  It will be no mean feat, as it is huge and serious in its scope.  We wish her every good luck with that.  I thank Professor Moloney and the commission for their attendance and their assistance to the committee.

Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and housekeeping matters.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or to engage otherwise in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks.  It is imperative to comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law that would impact on their evidence.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable.</p> <p>  For anyone watching the meeting, Members of the Oireachtas and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or of joining the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members participating via Teams to indicate and confirm that they are on the Leinster House campus.  If members are attending in the committee room, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are advised of the good practices in terms of using masks and sanitisers.</p> <p>  With the formalities over, I am pleased to invite Ms Boix Alonso to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am very honoured to join the members in this meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, in particular, to speak about this very important subject of cybersecurity.<br/><br/>The Commission President, Dr. von der Leyen expressed it well in her state of the Union address on 15 September when she said that &quot;If everything is connected, everything can be hacked.&quot;  In recent times, unfortunately, we have witnessed the hacking of the Colonial Pipeline in the US, the Solarwinds incident, the ransomware attack on the IT supplier, Kaseya, and, of course, one that the members are all very well aware of, the massive cyberattack on the Irish Health Service Executive precisely at a very bad moment which was in the middle of fighting a worldwide pandemic.  This, unfortunately, according to our figures, will not diminish.  According to the European Union Agency for Cyber Security, ENISA, so-called &quot;supply-chain attacks&quot;, which are very difficult to fight regardless of how many measures you are taking in your own company or administration because they come from someone else in the supply chain, will multiply by four this year and attacks on cloud infrastructure have increased fivefold in one year.  You have seen also the increase of ransomware attacks.  Some studies state that they have increased by 60%.  Others give a higher figure.  This is the reason the <i>status quo</i>is not an option.  Basically, what we have been doing until now is clearly not sufficient because the attacks keep on increasing, and the impact keeps on increasing as well.  Sometimes you would believe there are no limits for the hackers.  They just attack everything.<br/><br/>This is why the Commission, in December of last year, came with a strategy to reinforce what we have now and to make sure that citizens and business are protected, both online and offline.  This strategy, which was adopted by the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy together, was presented at the same time because it is part of the Network and Information Security Directive, a reform of our NIS directive.  The strategy provides, from our point of view, a fresh vision and plan for cybersecurity to deal with the challenges we are facing.  The idea is to build resilience and ensure we can all benefit from digital technologies because digital technologies promise a lot of things.  Of course, if they are not cybersecure, none of the benefits of digital technologies will be available to citizens and businesses.  Building upon what we already have in place, the strategy focuses on three main angles.  The first angle is to build resilience, so-called &quot;technological sovereignty&quot; and leadership.  The second angle is to build operational capacity so that it is not only about making sure we are protected and are resilient, but that we have a capacity to act, whether it is to prevent, to deter or to respond to large-scale cyberattacks, in particular.  Lastly, of course, the international dimension is extremely important and advancing a global and open cyberspace through increased co-operation is also important.<br/><br/>For each of these pillars, there are concrete actions.  I will not go through all of them because there is no time.  As I mentioned already, an important pillar of building resilience is the NIS 2 directive, which is currently being negotiated in the Parliament and the Council of the EU.</p><p>We hope that the trilogues will start as soon as possible.  The main objective was to build on the success of the NIS directive and go beyond that by enlarging the scope in order that more sectors can be covered by or subject to the obligations of this directive, ensuring that the rules are clear and that there are stronger supervision tools.  That is the main objective behind the NIS directive reform.</p><p> I mentioned operational capacity and the need to react together in order to help each other.  The incident that happened in Ireland is a good example of the potential of this operational capacity.  At the time that happened, the co-ordination system at EU level was triggered.  The Irish authorities triggered it.  They sought to receive support from the European computer security incident response team, CSIRT, network of all the member states.  The idea of going beyond being operational was put in the strategy by a proposal to create what we call a joint cyber unit, namely, a hub that would potentially allow all communities, not only civil but international communities and law enforcement communities, to share information and co-ordinate potential collective responses to major crisis and incidents.  That idea is being discussed with the member states.</p><p> Another element of the strategy being pushed by the Commission President is the cyber resilience Act.  In the strategy, we set out the need to have horizontal rules that would set common cybersecurity standards for connected products and services in the Internal Market in order that we ensure cybersecurity by design whenever a product or service is put on the market and that a whole-life cycle of that product or service will be done.  President von der Leyen, in her state of the Union speech, announced a cyber resilience Act, and this will be a follow-up of that announced initiative.</p><p> I will not continue further.  I will stick to the five minutes allocated in order that we can have a debate.  I believe cybersecurity is one of those challenges that is impossible to face alone.  No member state alone can face it.  That is clear by now.  The attacks will increasingly have an impact across borders.  We are here to be in solidarity and to support each other.  I thank Ireland in particular for the constructive and co-operative role it always plays in discussions on cybersecurity.  That is very much appreciated.  We will continue to listen to members' views.  I am happy to answer any questions they may have and to engage in a debate.</p></speech>

I have a certain sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>being back here.  On a personal level, it is nice to be back and in a committee room again.  To introduce why I am here, I sit on one of the 20 committees of the European Parliament, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, ITRE, which deals with cybersecurity.  I want to give members a brief overview of the EU's cybersecurity strategy as well as touch on some other topics that might be relevant.  We have just come to the end of European Cybersecurity Month, the European Union's annual campaign dedicated to promoting cybersecurity among EU citizens and organisations, therefore, it is an appropriate time to be here.<br/><br/>The European Commission published a joint communication on the EU's cybersecurity strategy for the digital decade last December, just under a year ago.  The latter aims to bolster Europe's collective resistance against cyberattacks and threats and ensure citizens and businesses can fully benefit from trustworthy and reliable services and digital tools. The strategy includes a proposal for the revision of the directive on measures for high common levels of cybersecurity across the Union, which is the network and information security directive or NIS 2, and a proposal for a new directive on the resilience of critical entities.<br/><br/>The original directive dating from 2016 has three parts, national capabilities, cross-border collaboration and national supervision of critical sectors.  First, EU member states must have certain national cybersecurity capabilities and they must have a national cybersecurity incident response team and perform cyber exercises, etc.  Second, we need to collaborate across borders.  The strategy provides for that also.  Third, member states have to supervise the cybersecurity of critical market operators in their country such as in transport, water, and health sectors.  Obviously, the focus has been on health, but it must also be on the energy sector, as we saw from the recent incident in the US, and in the finance sector to ensure we have good measures in place.  However, member states were quite slow to fully implement this directive and, therefore, the Commission proposed this new directive, a revision of the directive last year.  That has just come through committee last week and I voted on it.  Therefore, a new directive is in the offing.  The question is: will it change things?<br/><br/>NIS 2 aims to strengthen cybersecurity capabilities and to have better information sharing and co-operation on cybersecurity crisis management at national and EU level.  It provides for an all-hazards framework to support member states to prevent, resist and recover from disruptive attacks wherever their source may be.  My group has strongly pushed for the need to develop those cybersecurity skills we all need, particularly to get better gender representation in the industry.<br/><br/>From January 2019 to April 2020, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity reported approximately a quarter of a million malware infections every day within the Union.  Europol highlighted a notable increase during the pandemic in the number of ransomware attacks on public institutions and large companies.  Europol&rsquo;s Internet organised crime threat unit stated that targeting such institutions allows cybercriminals to increase the ransom amount and has noted a significant increase in attacks on governments such as healthcare and education, energy and transport systems.  EU institutions and bodies as well as member states have been targeted.  We are all aware of the attack six months ago on the HSE but in the same month there were two large-scale cyberattacks against public service organisations in Belgium.  The first concerned Belnet, the network which serves third level institutions and research centres as well as hospitals and federal ministries.  The federal internal affairs department was subjected to a cyberattack of such a scale that it raised suspicions of the involvement of a foreign state.  Given the Vice Chairman's caveats at the start of this meeting, I am reluctant to name names but it is commonly known certain states outside the EU would appear to be the focus for our attention on these attacks.<br/><br/>In March, the European Council adopted a cybersecurity strategy.  It states we need to have a network of security operational centres across the EU to both monitor and anticipate signals of attacks on member states and a common cyber unit to provide clear focus to the crisis management framework at EU level.  It also promotes strong encryption standards while permitting law enforcement and judicial authorities to exercise their powers online and offline to prevent such cyberattacks.<br/><br/>To touch briefly on the new legislation, it insists that member states have national cybersecurity strategies, establish computer security incident response teams and appoint national competent authorities for cybersecurity.</p><p>We need to strengthen the security requirements of member states, address the security of supply chains, streamline reporting and introduce more stringent supervisory measures.  We have an awful lot on paper but really it comes down to the individual member state to implement not only the first directive from five years ago but the new directive when it comes into force.  This is where the critical weakness is.  It is about the implementation of the directives at member state level.</p><p> It is not just about the EU or the member state.  It is also about ourselves.  We need to be cyberaware.  We tell our children not to get into a car with a stranger but all too often we click on the wrong link on our device and that opens up the pathway for a security breach.  We are all guilty of simplifying things.  In a world where half a dozen passwords are often needed in the course of a day we often take shortcuts.  We need to practice better security awareness in our own operations.  We are only as strong as the weakest link.  We need to improve our own security.  We need to do exercises at a member state level in the same way as our Defence Forces do physical exercises to prepare for attacks on us as a member state.  At a cybersecurity level we need to prepare and share information and be ready for the next attack.  It might not be on our health system.  It might be on our energy networks.  We are only as vulnerable as the weakest link and we have to take action to prepare for the next attack.</p></speech>

I hope I have pronounced the name correctly.  I am fairly sure I got Mr. Cuffe's name right.</p> <p>  We all accept the reality of the world we live in and the dangers as regards cybersecurity.  The ransomware attack on the HSE brought it absolutely home to us.  My question breaks into a number parts and, in fairness, the witnesses have dealt with some of them.  I am looking for a greater amount of information.  We all accept it is down to capacity and, of course, we all work better together.  However, it fails miserably if nobody follows through on implementation, particularly as regards where the directives are at this point in time.</p> <p>  There is capacity at State and EU level.  There is international engagement.  We have had enough people and experts throw out commentary on certain states where there may be operations that almost operate on a subcontractor basis.  While they are not necessarily within the employ of the state, they can be brought into action.  We even heard commentary that they were generally given operational rules not to touch anything infrastructural on the east coast of the United States or anything that brings too much heat.  I assume the ransomware attack on the HSE might have been one of those things where they bit off more than they could chew and could be the reason keys were handed over.</p> <p>   We suddenly became aware of the number of companies paying off money, including to avoid reputational damage.  There was a report out a while ago that stated &euro;22,712 was the average payment made.  For small and medium enterprises this is not nothing.  In many cases I do not think people got all of their information back.  I suppose it was a case of mitigating harm from their point of view.</p> <p>  We have the capacity at localised level.  We have had the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, review here.  We were not up to scratch.  We would like to think that in future we will have a greater element of capacity.  This is accepting that it will always come down to the best level of digital hygiene that can be employed, whether at an individual level or a group level.  This is an absolute no-brainer.</p> <p>  What do the witnesses see as regards the joint cyberunit?  What will be its remit?  I have a slight fear.  We all accept the necessity to secure ourselves from cyberattack.  The problem with this is that it has become conflated with general defence, a European army and these wider questions.  This is something that has to be separated.  This is not taking away from the absolute danger.</p> <p>  We have experts in the State who said the NCSC should probably have made greater use of the expertise we have in third level institutions.  People have been running courses on cybersecurity over many years and have much more expertise than an awful lot of others.  My question is on long-term proposals for what the unit will do and how we ensure we have and maintain best practice and capacity at a localised level.  Some experts have spoken about an ability to disrupt.  I will use the term "counterstrike".  This would be in the middle of an attack.</p> <p>  There is also the issue of what we intend to do on an international basis from a legislative point of view or in conversations with certain states and certain players.  We have all heard anecdotal stories on members of certain elements of the US Administration that may have made their voices clear to certain of these players.  This is not something I would anticipate happening at European level.  I apologise for the circular way I have asked these questions.  It is about the unit and state and international capacity.  It is what we do on an international basis.  I would like a bit more detail.  I thank the witnesses for their commentary.</p></speech>

I will begin with the question on whether there is an issue with implementation.  There is an issue with the nature of the NIS directive.  A number of sectors are included and it is up to member states to decide which companies to identify.  We are in the hands of member states.  This is why we decided to propose a revision of the directive.  We were facing situations where some member states, including Ireland, had identified, for example, a huge number of hospitals in the health sector.  Other member states had not identified any.  This was not ideal for merging.  This is what we are now trying to fix with the new NIS directive.  All of the sectors identified will be extended and companies will be covered automatically and, therefore, subject to these obligations.  The nature of the legislative technique will make a difference.  That being said, what is clear and what has to be acknowledged is that we constantly receive input, including in the context of the negotiations, from member states complaining they do not have sufficient resources.  This is not something I can evaluate because I do not have the exact picture.  The solution we propose is to have an overview in the new directive.  It is very valuable to know the amount of money, and let us hope it is only money, that is being lost due to cyberattacks.</p><p>Are we putting the right resources into cybersecurity at all levels?  That may include ourselves in the European Union in that.  This is a very valid idea which probably goes beyond purely implementing legislative acts.</p><p> On ransomware I do not have much to add.  Of course, under the NIS directive if there is an incident there is an obligation to notify if one is covered.  A different thing is the whole debate about communicating payment or non-payment.  Again, that is also a very valid debate.</p><p> The Deputy's main question was about the joint cyber unit.  What is the joint cyber unit?  My first answer is that the joint cyber unit will be what member states decide they want it to be.  The European Commission is perfectly aware that this is a subject where there is a lot of sovereign power of member states, which is why the Commission came with our recommendation on a process to set up the joint cyber unit.  This would then go to the Council to be blessed.  In a way we said this is our proposal and left it up to the member states to decide.</p><p> The idea that we have is basically to set up something that to date has not existed.  There is a gap.  The gap is that right now there are a number of different communities, including the international community with the cyber toolbox, the law enforcement community and the civil community.  Very often large-scale incidents happen together because it is not only a civil attack but a criminal attack.  As the MEP correctly said, very often it comes from third countries so there is an international angle and sometimes a different angle.  What we are missing today is a structure, a network, a one-stop shop, that is, a single point of contact.  It can be defined in many different ways but it is a way to co-ordinate all of these communities when something big happens.  </p><p> What are the advantages of having a joint cyber unit?  Of course, the idea is to have well-defined roles and responsibilities so that if something happens, everybody knows who does what and whom to call.  There would be a crisis response plan to a cybersecurity incident.  There would also be constantly updated information and situational reports because the entire community would have the same information.  The Deputy rightly asked about these cybersecurity rapid-reaction teams that we propose.  The idea is not at all to create an army.  The idea was very much like what we have today in the civil protection mechanism, the civil reaction teams.  For example, during the summer there were fires in many member states and those member states that had capacity available helped member states that were in trouble if they so wished.  The request for help is voluntary.  That is basically what we had in mind and these are the types of ideas that are currently being discussed with member states.  </p></speech>

It seems clear that the weakest link is the implementation of the directive.  I am not familiar with the operation of the computer security incident response team here in Ireland.  I do not know how many people are employed in this area.  However, as a test case it might be useful to quiz those people on the staffing they have and what exercises they perform.  We could even look closer to home to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which has charge of the IT systems in these buildings.  We could use it as a test case for what kind of readiness or exercises are in place.</p> <p>  I am mindful that cybersecurity in Ireland also has a non-EU component.  Our energy grid is managed by EirGrid, which manages the electricity grid in the North of Ireland as well as in the South.  It is important to think about the challenges that emerge from these issues of semi-State agencies having joint jurisdiction over this member state and over part of a foreign state.  That might also be worth dwelling on.  </p> <p>  In Brussels, we are providing the framework for member states to fill with the staffing, finance and oversight that is required.  Perhaps it is a good exercise for the committee to interrogate that in the Irish context to see if we are ready.  </p></speech>

I want to drill down on two areas, one a bit more parochial than the first.  Ms Boix Alonso alluded to the first one, which relates to working with partners throughout the world.  Cybersecurity strategy includes a programme of action in the UN.  What form has that engagement taken?  Where is the discussion at?  What sorts of insights are there for enhanced engagement?</p> <p>  My second issue is a bit more practical and relates to the cyber resilience Act planned for late next year.  I understand the purpose of the legislation is to introduce common cybersecurity standards for connected devices.  How will it address any gaps left by the Council's and Parliament's NIS 2 proposals?  Will it come soon enough to address these gaps?  </p></speech>

A system of peer reviews would help.  I am comfortable with the negotiations with member states, but it is something that would help.<br/><br/>On the United Nations, our colleagues in the European External Action Service are dealing with it.  We are very much engaging with the United Nations.  We consider that this is extremely important.  These things are delicate.  The engagement and co-operation with like-minded countries is always easier and there is a lot of engagement, as the Deputy knows.  Recently the United States in particular regarding ransomware launched a big call to work together and we are basically working with all like-minded countries.  We have a number of cyber dialogues with them.  Of course, it is more delicate with other non-like-minded countries.  <i>Voila</i>.  In particular on the UN convention, we are engaged in the push for norms of behaviour in cyberspace and also on the Budapest Convention where we are quite advanced.  It is going well there.  <br/><br/>On the cyber resilience Act and what would be the complementarity with the NIS directive, basically we are dealing with two different things.  The NIS directive is about the obligations on companies to report, notify and take certain security measures on incidents, and the monitoring and enforcement tools.  We are at the exploratory phase of the cyber resilience Act.</p><p>What we are exploring at this stage is the gap that exists in the current legislative framework in respect of products and services that are put on the market.  Right now, what we have are very scattered sectoral pieces of legislation that deal with specific products and very often deal with security without necessarily having cybersecurity in mind.  We have launched a study that we are closing now that has performed this exercise of identifying the current gaps.  Those gaps are that we do not have anything general that would cover those products and services that are connected and, therefore, as the President of the Commission has stated, are subject to being hacked.  That relates specifically to their cybersecurity.  This is the analysis we are doing now.  We will see whether these Acts should cover more or less than that but, right now, this is the analysis we are doing.</p></speech>

It is good to see Mr. Cuffe back in again.  This is my second day in a row of engaging with him.  Both our guests referred to the level of attacks that are currently being experienced.  Ms Alonso stated that there is an expectation that we will see a fourfold increase in 2021, as reported by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity.  Mr. Cuffe pointed to the highlighting by Europol of a notable increase in attacks on public institutions.  That is quite alarming.  It sounds as though a degree of urgency is required on this matter.  The revised or updated directive is very welcome, but it seems to be more a medium-term plan.  What is being done right now at European Union level to deal with what appear to be attacks that are happening today and will happen tomorrow and the day after that?  What is being done to increase supports for member states and in terms of co-ordination at EU level to deal with these ongoing attacks?  I genuinely was not aware how large-scale the problem was and is, or the rate at which it is increasing.  That is quite alarming.  We certainly need to get that information out to citizens in member states because it will generate broader supports for what our guests are trying to achieve in terms of the directive.</p> <p>  Mr. Cuffe referred to the original directive and what was required of member states.  I am not sure if he has this information to hand.  He referred to the requirement for member states to have certain capabilities at a national level.  I ask our guests to comment on that.  Where is Ireland at in that regard?  How well did we do in transposing the directive and meeting the minimum requirements for member state capabilities under the original directive?  I am trying to figure out what gap we need to close in order to get to where we need to be.  Ms Boix Alonso and Mr. Cuffe both referred to the HSE attack.  It has focused minds here and brought home to every household how important this issue is and how much it impacts on all our daily lives.  It is tangible.  If we can take any positive from what happened, it is that it will allow us to respond better to future attacks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.269" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021110300002#F00300"><p>The dreadful thing about being a Member of the European Parliament is that we pass the directives but we do not receive sufficient feedback on their implementation within member states.  That is certainly the situation in the case of the committees on which I sit.  However, I note that, anecdotally, several State agencies draw attention to the risk of cyberattacks.  Each year, Irish Water drew attention to the critical risks to its infrastructure in delivering drinking water to the public, industrial users and the IT sector.  All it would take is for one or two pumps to be taken over to dramatically damage the resilience of our entities.  There may be a role with regard to quizzing the institutions in Ireland that have responsibility for implementing those directives.</p> <p>  In addition, we are seeing an extraordinary increase in the number of connected devices.  The Internet of things is taking over the world, from washing machines to teddy bears, and we need to educate citizens on good practice in the context of cybersecurity.  As I was leaving Brussels last week, I noticed a big billboard advertising cybersecurity month, but I do not know whether that permeated through to national campaigns or campaigns within organisations such as this one or State bodies.  In a world that is increasingly connected and where, due to the pandemic, many people are working remotely, the IT links we have are crucial to carrying out our daily work, so it is important that the committee ensures the resources are available at a national level to make sure that we are cyber vigilant, that exercises are carried out and that there is in the public domain a report on the main bodies in Ireland and how well they are performing.  Just like the generals fighting the last war, next time it probably will not be the HSE that is under attack, but it could be the energy networks that keep the lights on or the water coming out of taps or the infrastructure that allows us to appear in committee rooms.  There is a need to hold public bodies in particular up to scrutiny.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorena Boix Alonso" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021110300002#F00400"><p>I agree with the Senator that it is worrying.  I am not going to hide the fact that it is a worrying situation.  A significant number of actions are already being taken under the current legislative framework.  For example, I mentioned what happened in the case of the Irish incident.  We have the sister network of all these entities at national level, which did act in that case.  Whenever there is an incident, the network exchanges information and, if requested, provides support.  We have the cyber crises liaison organisation network, CyCLONe, which is more at a political level or between political and operational levels.  It is already active and compiles reports on incidents so that lessons can be learned.  At the level of the current directive, we have the network and information systems, NIS, co-operation network, through which there are many discussions ongoing to learn from each other and strengthen implementation.</p> <p>  I did not mention it in my opening statement, but there is certainly a need to increase and improve the capabilities at member state level.  Unfortunately, the level of investment in Europe in cybersecurity is not yet comparable with that of certain third countries.  The first calls will be launched next year under a new digital EU programme that is devoting approximately &euro;3 million to support capability.  It is not research; it is really going to the deployment of technologies.  We will launch the first calls next year.  We are doing what we can to help and support member states.  In the context of the resilience fund, we strongly insisted that member states dedicate part of that money to reinforcing capabilities.  Many of them have gone in that direction.  As regards international co-operation, as I mentioned, several dialogues are taking place with third countries and we are co-operating.  A lot is being done now and more will be done in the medium to long term.</p> <p>  As regards the level of implementation by Ireland, as I stated, the current directive has been implemented, but to say whether Ireland has implemented it well or poorly is not so easy because it is very much left in the hands of member states.  That is what we are trying to fix.  I know that when the incident happened, the health authorities were covered and had been identified by Ireland.</p><p>I know that in Ireland a lot of exercises are taking place.  Therefore, I would not say that Ireland is not implementing the strategy well.  As I said before, a particular country can do a lot of exercises.  For example, in hospitals, we do cybersecurity exercises.  However, if the investments are not there and as a result, the capabilities are not there or if the relevant authorities do not take the responsibility, things do not happen.  It is another issue that we are trying to fix in the new directive.  We are trying to ensure that the management of companies and institutions take responsibility for adopting measures.  A country can do a lot of exercises, but when the moment arrives, things do not happen.  That is not for Ireland but generally, certainly, every member state can do much more.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021110300002#G00200"><p>I welcome the guests to the committee today.  This area is fascinating and is one that needs serious attention and focus, given our recent experience of cyberattacks.  We have seen how it has decimated Ireland and our health service.  There is a fear that it could be replicated very easily in other areas.  I listened with interest to the opening statements and the responses to some good questions.  Certainly, Ireland has a responsibility to develop a cybersecurity strategy alongside all of our EU counterparts, but it is only as good as the resources available to back up that strategy.  Indeed, looking at the capabilities and responsibilities at a national level, I have some concerns around our responsibilities.  I want to hone in on one area in particular, and concerns I have with regard to one of the key pillars in terms of us as a country and a State living up to our responsibilities, namely, the Defence Forces.</p> <p> There are serious difficulties with the recruitment and retention of Defence Forces personnel.  Looking specifically at the Naval Service, there are massive issues there in terms of recruitment and retention of.  I also sit on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and we recently visited the naval base at Haulbowline, County Cork.  We listened to the concerns raised by members in all ranks within the Irish navy in respect of the recruitment and retention of staff and how it is impacting on their role and responsibilities.  Obviously, they are tasked with a number of responsibilities in policing Irish waters, not just in terms of fishing, but also in policing the multitude of transatlantic data cables that pass through Irish waters off the southern coast, serving all of Europe.  I imagine that Ireland must be the first line of defence for those cables that serve not only Europe, but Ireland as well.  We have a domestic responsibility and a European responsibility to police those cables.  </p> <p>  The concern is that currently, out of a fleet of nine ships designated for policing what is a massive maritime area that is ten times the size of the landmass of Ireland, only one is at sea due to a multitude of reasons and ongoing issues within the Naval Service, including the retention of members of the service.  Looking at the fleet of nine ships of which only one is at sea, they have a responsibility to police not just what is at water level, but everything that is above that and, probably more importantly in this case, everything that is below the water level.  We do not have sonar capabilities in our fleet, so we are absolutely blind as to what is going on under the water.  Concerns were highlighted last August when what was described as a foreign spy ship was alleged to be monitoring some of these critical cables off the west coast of Ireland.  All we could do was to monitor that ship; we could not see exactly what it was doing under the water, or whether it was attaching any devices to any of the cables.  I imagine that is quite concerning.  When we talk about capabilities and responsibilities at a national level, do the witnesses view that as a concern?  For me, it is a very serious concern, given that in my mind, we are the first line of defence.  We can talk about all of the other issues further down the line, but if we cannot police at that very basic level, it is of serious concern.</p> <p>  The other issue I wish to raise, which was touched upon quite extensively by Mr. Cuffe, concerns cybersecurity for consumers.  It is a key area of concern.  Mr. Cuffe outlined all of the activity that consumers and children do online etc.  I certainly believe that there needs to be a massive campaign in this area, both nationally and across Europe.  Mr. Cuffe spoke about cybersecurity week at a European level.  I do not think that was picked up here in Ireland.  I imagine that very few people know about that awareness campaign here in Ireland.  I am aware of the Webwise initiative that is rolled out by the Department of Education, which is tasked with giving parents, teachers and children the tools around cybersecurity.  I am not sure how well that initiative is resonating with people.  I am probably showing my age but I refer to the campaigns on road safety and the green cross code.  Perhaps some of the other committee members will be aware of those campaigns.  I am sure some of them will remember the song that went along with the campaign.  The campaigns resonated and stuck with people in respect of safety issues around roads and how to cross roads etc.  There is no campaign that delivers that powerful message not just to young people, but to people right across the board in terms of the security, their responsibilities as consumers and how to use the online world safely.  Serious focus within our own national strategy must be placed on how we are going to get that message across.  Going back to the core point, there needs to be national campaign with the resources behind it to promote it and ensure that when people go online, the message of "security, security, security" is there.  The areas that I wanted to touch upon are the national responsibility of the Irish State, the failures, as I see them, around its primary responsibilities in cybersecurity, and at the other end, the consumers and the need for a comprehensive campaign around cybersecurity.  </p></speech>

Certainly, in my own submission to the Defence Forces public consultation on the future of the Defence Forces, I mentioned cybersecurity and stated that it will be a core competency of the Defence Forces in years to come.  In fairness to Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, the former head of the Defence Forces, he has spoken at length about cybersecurity threats.  The Defence Forces are aware of the issue and I am sure they would like to have more resources to address it.</p> <p>  I am aware of the incidents to which the Deputy referred.  There have been incidents where foreign submarines have been located beside undersea cables with aircraft circling overhead.  It is like something from James Bond movie.  The worry is that foreign powers are stealing data from these cables.  We do not have the capability to have complete oversight, particularly when these cables are in international waters.</p><p>Whatever about international ICT cables, we will be more dependent on energy networks connecting us to other EU member states.  We are already connected to the UK but the Celtic interconnector will connect Ireland to France.  A Norway-UK cable opened within the past month.  This interconnectivity is happening at an increasing rate and it is hugely dependent on ICT to ensure that these entities operate correctly.</p><p> Even closer to home, I remember when a water pipe broke in Dublin and I asked the team repairing it what happened.  They told me somebody clicked the wrong button on a pump and the pressure built up.  We are really dependent on a secure ICT system to deliver the day-to-day services on which we depend.  Every branch of Government must focus on ensuring it is ready for the most severe threats that are out there and that will increase.</p><p> Ms Boix Alonso alluded to the need for umbrella legislation at European level to cover all consumer items that are connected and I see a gap there which may be addressed within the European institutions in future years to ensure that any new device has certain levels of protection that are easy to understand for the consumer and that will stop unwanted intrusions into connected devices elsewhere.</p></speech>

Technically, submarine cables are covered by the NIS directive.  Is it enough?  That is a different question.  I am perfectly aware of the issue and debate around it.  Defence considerations are beyond my remit because I am dealing with civil matters, but our president is very aware of these issues.  She insisted on them in her state of the union speech.  We are very much in contact with our colleagues in the Directorate-General for Defence, Industry and Space, DG DEFIS, dealing with defence, on the need to push a cyber defence strategy.  We are certainly discussing those issues with the colleagues in DG DEFIS because there are clear synergies in these fields.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the issue of skills.  I reassure him that things are being done on the issue of skills on two different fronts.  Two types of skills are needed in the cyber area.  One is the basic cyber skills whereby people know and are aware where attacks could come from or how to identify phishing and things like that.  Those are the basic cyber skills.  There is also the extremely worrying subject of specialist cybersecurity.  We have a huge shortage of those skills, not only in Europe but in the world.  There are not enough specialists.  We need to keep up our knowledge because the nasty guys and girls are becoming extremely sophisticated.  Those are the two types of skills we need to deal with, and the Commission is doing so now, at least from the point of view of funding.  In the digital EU programme that I mentioned before, there is money available for universities and workforces to help in specialisation and providing specialist courses on cybersecurity.  We are acting to try to cope with the gap.  We must also act on basic cyber skills.  As was mentioned before, we had cybersecurity month.  Within the competence and education we have, we try to take action but there is certainly an issue around both basic cyber skills and specialist cyber skills to cope with the level of sophistication we are facing right now.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions, one of which has been addressed by Ms Boix Alonso in her consideration of the skills shortage and how we are going to combat that.  That will be one of the biggest challenges we will face in cybersecurity.  We must find the brightest and the best for our teams both nationally and at a European level.  One of the projects on which we worked together is the EU digital Covid certificate.  It has been a large, collaborative project and more than 800 million people have Covid certificates.  What measures has the EU taken to avoid cybersecurity attacks on the management of that particular system?  Perhaps our guests can reassure us in that regard.  If we cannot get that right, we will not be able to get any other critical infrastructure right, whether that is to do with water, health or finance, including the mooted digital euro project which is due in the next number of years.  The Covid certificate project is a pilot project for the digital sphere and I am wondering what cybersecurity measures have been taken to ensure the system does not get hacked.</p></speech>

I appreciate it because from the technical side, the EU Covid certificate was done by my team.  The beauty of being the director of a directorate that deals with cybersecurity and e-health is that you can put the two teams together.  Privacy was very much taken into account when designing the system.  The fact that the EU Covid certificate is the only certificate today that is available in the world across borders is precisely because it was conceived from the outset to take into account security and data protection.  It was decided together and that is why it has been such a big success.  We did not even wait for the legislative proposal to be on the table, even less to wait for the close of negotiations, to put the system in force.  It was a beautiful joint project.</p> <p>  It was, from the beginning, foreseen with a gateway.  The gateway, which is managed by a contractor, is centralised by the European Commission.  The certificates are done with a digital and electronic signature so that it cannot be faked.  It is not like a PDF, which can be faked from home.  The certificates need a digital signature.  It is done in a way which requires a private key and a public key, to be a bit technical.  If a person does not have both keys, he or she cannot create or read a certificate.  That is the secure way we did it.  I assure the Senator it is working.  She will have seen fake certificates in the press.  There are certificates in the name of Adolf Hitler or Bob l'&Eacute;ponge.  There are all types of unpleasant jokes.  In those cases, it was not a result of a hack or an attack.  Those cases are, unfortunately, because somebody who had the right to validly issue certificates made fake certificates.  It has, fortunately, only happened in a few countries, but it is a criminal act.  It has, in some cases, been a doctor with the power to issue a valid certificate who has issued these fakes.  The system has not been hacked, for the moment.  It is working.  It has been, unfortunately, at member state level where some unpleasant people have abused the system.  We are now working on a centralised system for revoking those certificates.</p><p>What is done in those cases, and what has been done, is revoke the certificates.  We are working to see whether we can make the revocation system even more efficient.  This system aside, we have weekly meetings with the contractors to analyse every possible incident and act accordingly.  I reassure members of that.  Could something worse happen?  I do not know.  I cannot commit to saying it will not but every measure is being taken and, for the moment, it has not been cyberattacked.</p></speech>

As no member is indicating, I will ask a question.  It concerns parliamentarians, democrats and civil society across Europe and the integrity of our democratic system.  We have seen interference and hacking in various elections internationally.  There are a lot of data and we have seen inquiries into the matter in the United States.  There are grave suspicions of interference in referendums in the United Kingdom.  How focused is the European Union at Parliament and Commission level on protecting the integrity of our electoral systems and democracy?  What measures are in play to ensure upcoming elections across the European Union are safe from external or internal interference?</p></speech>

I have done a training exercise for that.  Increasingly, the focus of election monitoring is on the electronic side.  There is monitoring of social media and the integrity of the ballot box.  As some elections move more online than is our experience here, we increasingly need IT skills to understand what is going on and safeguard the process.  It will require a new set of skills for those of us interested in the monitoring process.  I imagine the European Commission is also moving with the times and ensuring its skill set changes on this.  I will leave it up to Ms Boix Alonso to answer on that side of it.</p></speech>

We have, as was mentioned, our CSIRT for the institutions that works on the cybersecurity of EU institutions.  I can give that reassurance.  As was mentioned, we do exercises and a cyber exercise was done in 2019 for the European elections which was a success and went well.  We also have a compendium on election cybersecurity which is a practical tool for national election authorities.  For the European Parliament and national parliaments, we are trying to invite help and support.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Se&aacute;na Cunningham, director of enforcement and anti-money laundering.</p> <p>  The Central Bank is responsible for maintaining monetary and financial stability and ensuring that the financial system works in the interests of the community.  The proper and effective regulation of financial services providers is an essential component of that mission.  Households and businesses reliant on financial services require a resilient and trustworthy sector in which firms and individuals adhere to a culture of fairness and high standards.  Experience has shown that in order for a regulatory framework to work well, it should stimulate high-quality governance and behaviours within firms.  Firms need to be effectively managed and organised, individuals need to be clear as to what they are responsible for, and both need to be accountable if they fall short of expected standards.</p> <p>  The Central Bank's behaviour and culture report on Irish retail banks recommended the introduction of an enhanced individual accountability framework for individuals working in regulated firms.  Our recommendations are reflected in the four key components of the general scheme: first, conduct standards which set out the standards of behaviour the Central Bank expects of regulated firms and individuals working in financial services, with additional standards for senior executives; second, senior executive accountability, which requires clarity as to where responsibility and decision-making lie for different aspects of a firm's business, and accountability in discharging those responsibilities; third, enhancements to the current fitness and probity regime to strengthen the onus on firms to assess proactively individuals in controlled functions on an ongoing basis; and, fourth, an improved enforcement process to ensure we can pursue individuals for misconduct without first having to demonstrate a breach of regulation by the firm itself.  These four components complement one another to incentivise positive behaviours and promote improved governance and culture within firms.  They will provide a proportionate and predictable framework to help the financial sector fulfil its role of supporting the economy and serving the best interests of consumers and other users of financial services.</p> <p>  The Central Bank operates a framework of assertive risk-based supervision underpinned by the credible threat of enforcement.  As at the end of September 2021, the Central Bank has concluded 144 enforcement actions, imposing fines amounting to more than &euro;166.5 million under the administrative sanctions procedure.  Individual accountability is already a core focus of our work.  We have pursued and sanctioned individual wrongdoing by way of monetary penalty and disqualification.  In our gatekeeper role we have prevented unfit individuals from being appointed to senior positions in the financial services industry.  The proposed new framework will enhance the effectiveness of our processes for holding firms and individuals to account.</p> <p>  Turning to the key aspects of the general scheme, the proposed conduct standards will apply to all regulated firms, irrespective of sector, comprising common conduct standards for individuals carrying out controlled functions, additional conduct standards for senior executives, and the important general standards for businesses themselves.  The conduct standards set out the behaviour expected of firms and their staff, including obligations to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity and to act with due skill, care and diligence and in the interests of consumers.  We consider these to be the basic standards that should underpin the provision of financial services and the relationships of trust that are central in this area.</p><p>We also believe they are the standards to which most firms and individuals already hold themselves.  The additional conduct standards will be applied to senior executives and will require them to meet a standard of reasonable care in how they manage their respective areas of the business.</p><p> Effective culture requires both firms and the individuals within them to adhere to high standards.  The proposed framework therefore retains the existing accountability requirements for the collective actions of firms and adds effective participation in collective decision-making as a component of individual accountability.  We believe this represents an important integration of these two components.  The senior executive accountability element of the framework requires in-scope firms to set out clearly and comprehensively where responsibility and decision-making lie in order to ensure transparency.  Firms will be required to provide statements of responsibility for each senior executive function which clearly set out his or her role and responsibilities, in addition to a management responsibilities map for the firm documenting key management and governance arrangements.</p><p> We expect that implementation of the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, will support senior management in implementing an effective governance framework by identifying how risks are managed and any gaps which may arise.  This has been the experience in the UK, whereby the senior manager and certification regime has been credited by firms as providing a sound framework for enhancing governance.</p><p> The fitness and probity framework will be enhanced by including a requirement for firms to certify, on an annual basis, that individuals exercising a controlled function remain fit and proper.  This introduction of a positive duty on firms to certify each control function strengthens the focus on the responsibility of firms for the conduct of their staff and their corporate culture.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s primary enforcement process, the administrative sanctions procedure, ASP, will be enhanced to enable us to take enforcement action against individuals without first needing to establish wrongdoing by the firm.  The general scheme provides the Central Bank with regulation-making and guidance powers.  Once the proposed Bill has been enacted, we will move quickly to consult on these.</p><p> The objective of the individual accountability framework, IAF, proposals is to ensure good standards of governance and behaviour amongst financial firms to the ultimate benefit of consumers and investors while respecting the key principles of proportionality and predictability.  It will help firms identify risks before they crystallise, facilitate greater internal challenge and ultimately should result in fewer serious issues in the sector.  Where serious issues do arise, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action, using the enhanced toolkit of the framework to ensure individual as well as firm-level accountability.</p><p> We welcome the publication of the general scheme and will continue to work with the Department, the Oireachtas and this committee to progress this important proposed legislation.  We look forward to questions from members.</p></speech>

I also welcome that we are dealing with the heads of this proposed Bill.  It was mentioned the Central Bank's behaviour and culture report into Irish retail banks which called for this type of legislation was published in July 2018.  We are now coming to the end of 2021 and we still do not have the legislation, only heads of the proposed Bill.  What is disappointing for me is that the eventual legislation will not be implemented until January 2023, which is more than four years after the Central Bank's report.  Given what this country has been through, it is unacceptable that, in the context of holding senior individuals within the financial sector accountable, four years on from the Central Bank's report, the necessary powers are still not in place.  That said, we are where we are.</p> <p>  As already stated, I welcome the general scheme, which we need to deal with in quite some detail.  We have, like the Central Bank, called for an individual accountability framework for bankers and those within financial institutions.  Head 4 provides for the role and responsibilities of regulated institutions to map out the key management governance in reporting respect of arrangements, including the reporting lines of senior executive functions, SEFs.  If a senior employee who comes under the scope of an SEF takes all reasonable steps to avoid the firm committing or continuing to commit a prescribed contravention and reports that action further up the chain of command and the contravention continues and he or she reports that further up the chain of command, would the framework hold those further up the reporting line responsible, such as the CEO?</p> <p>  We know that many former senior bankers during the financial crash waltzed off into the sunset with their savings and were not held accountable.  What is proposed in the general scheme would bring former employees under the scope of the proposed legislation.  Head 5 includes the criteria that must be satisfied for a person to have committed a prescribed contravention.  Would the general scheme allow for a former employee, who is no longer working in the financial services sector to be investigated and sanctioned under this legislation, because, according to the heads of Bill, this action can be taken to ensure no further damage would be done in the financial services.  I am talking about former senior bankers.  We all know their names, which are common knowledge.  They left the country and the banks bust.  They behaved recklessly, but are no longer working in financial services.  They have retired.  Do they still fall within the scope of the proposed legislation?</p></speech>

The scheme is designed to be both clear and demanding, but also flexible.  The issue the Deputy identified on the reasonable steps is very important.  Of course, I know the banks and others would like us to be very clear about what reasonable steps are.  It is important we provide guidance and clarity and we will do that in our consultation, but it is also important for the banks, insurers and those caught by this regime to think about and put in place the appropriate steps without us leading them by the hand.</p> <p>  In the example the Deputy provides, it can be the case if a more junior member of staff with responsibilities does everything he or she reasonably should to address and bring an end to the issue, which includes taking it up the line.  Then the view is that there was not much more he or she could reasonably do, he or she can have discharge of duty.  It may be that is not case.  It may be, given the circumstances, that something else could have reasonably been done.  That would be a different story.  If the view of the steps taken is that all reasonable measures have been taken by that employee and he or she has really tried to get that job done in the firm, the employee could have discharged his or her duty.  It depends on the circumstances, but the scheme is designed to be flexible and allow people to discharge.</p></speech>

Each of these regulated financial institutions will have to map out the structures and roles each individual has.  This person would have that area of management.  He or she has taken all reasonable steps and therefore absolves himself or herself from action by the Central Bank, but by reporting the issue further up the line to the CEO, if the CEO is not mapped to have those responsibilities, can this now capture them?  The person at a lower level has taken the necessary steps.  How will we ensure the more senior managers up the line are also mapped as having responsibility in this area, even though it is delegated to somebody below them?</p><p>How are we going to ensure that the more senior managers up the line are also mapped here, as this is an area of their responsibility, even though it is delegated to somebody below them?</p></speech>

When the Central Bank regulation is drafted and consulted on, in respect of the role of CEO, for example, we will ask what the inherent responsibilities are in that role and what is expected of a CEO.  That will include the overall responsibility for the management of the firm and for leading that firm.  The answer to the Deputy's question is that in that case, yes, the CEO can certainly be responsible, and be held responsible and accountable, because there is a fitting together of the structure of the firm and an articulated responsibility at different levels of abstraction, if I can put it like that.  Yes, they can be held responsible.</p></speech>

What is changing under the general scheme in terms of the administrative sanctions procedure is the pool of people to which it is applicable.  Currently, the ASP does extend to people who are formally concerned in the management of regulated entities.  It has been the case that the Central Bank has sanctioned people who are formally concerned in the management of entities.  The general scheme also looks at the fitness and probity regime, and talks about investigating a person who held, but no longer holds, a controlled function, and using the legislation to look at a period, pursuant to which an investigation may be commenced after a person departs a controlled function.</p></speech>

What the scheme is looking at is the idea of whether there should be a timeframe, after a person has left a controlled function in financial services, during which the Central Bank, nonetheless, could commence a fitness and probity investigation.</p></speech>

Many of them cut and run; they sell up the company.  We have seen it with the Davy Group, and so on.  We need to have reach in a situation where somebody has been caught red handed, leaves, and is no longer in that role.  We must have the power to individually hold them accountable, whether it is through the imposition of a fine or taking legal sanctions against them which could end up in imprisonment or whatever.  I know that we are not talking about imprisonment here; we are talking about administrative sanctions and the ability to impose fines on individuals, in particular.</p></speech>

On defining a prescribed contravention, it is the same as set out in the Central Bank Act 1942.  It includes the mistreatment of consumers under a breach of the consumer code.  I presume that that will be the same and it will be in the scope of the legislation.  The question is how that will be defined and how the mistreatment of consumers will be defined under the consumer protection code.</p> <p>  Mr. Cross mentioned breaking the participation link.  This has been a big problem, as the regulated firm must be found guilty before one can take individual action.  My reading of this legislation is that that will still be the case.  I would like to tease that out.  My understanding is that the change under the new legislation is that there will no longer be a requirement to prove participation in the original finding against the firm.  My view, from reading the heads of bill, is that the firm will have to be found guilty of a contravention before the individual can be pursued.  Is that the case, or have I got a wrong reading of this?</p></speech>

We are not losing entirely the idea that a firm has committed a prescribed contravention and an individual can be sanctioned, now that we know who was responsible for oversight of that.  However, looking at the conduct standards themselves, this is where we see the directly enforceable obligations on individuals that are not necessarily tied to the firm having committed a contravention.  It is about having a suite of options available in order to appropriately address the problem that you find yourself dealing with.  The common conduct standards and the additional conduct standards for those in senior roles are a very significant enhancement in that they are common and additional conduct standards that people must abide by that are directly imposed on them and enforceable against them.  The concept of participating in firm contravention remains, and is still important.  However, I think part of the challenge, and what one finds sometimes under the current framework, is that the contravention committed by the firm does not necessarily equate with the conduct of the individual.  This gives us a great deal more optionality.</p></speech>

Whatever about common standards, a breach of that is committing a prescribed contravention.  Clearly, in this legislation, it is defined how somebody commits a prescribed contravention.  Therefore, you will have to find that the regulated firm is in breach first before you can find the individual in breach, because it states very clearly: "there has at that time been (or continued to be) a prescribed contravention by the regulated financial service provider". Therefore, you will have to find a prescribed contravention by the firm before you can actually look at the individual.  Is that still the case, although it is now better than it was because you do not have to prove that that individual actually had hand, act or part?  Basically, ignorance is no longer a defence if that person has an area of responsibility.  It still creates a problem for us in terms of the process and length of time it will take if we have to prove that the firm committed the act before we can pursue the individual.</p></speech>

Basically, what is being said in the scheme is that once you are a senior executive, you will be held accountable.  Without anything to do with the firm, you will be held accountable for the general conduct standards and the additional conduct standards.  The additional conduct standards are about how you run your area of the firm, for example, whether you run it properly, set up the proper systems and ensure that there are no breaches, etc.  The important point, and the duty of responsibility to which I think the Deputy has referred, is that in addition, if an offence or breach is committed by the firm, and it is in your area, then you are also responsible for that.  It is an additional thing which is built on top of a person's responsibility for what goes on in their area of the firm.  The only way you can discharge that responsibility is by showing that you have taken the reasonable steps needed or expected in that case.  The  Deputy is absolutely right in how he has described the particular provision to which he has referred.  However, it is an additional provision which states that where there has been a breach, then you are on the hook for it.</p></speech>

I am not coming from a legal point of view but I presume there is a defence in this instance that it must be proved there was a contravention by the regulated financial service provider before it can be said that person is, therefore, responsible.</p></speech>

We are not losing entirely the concept of a firm committing a breach and somebody, through his or her seniority, being part of that breach in terms of holding him or her accountable.  There are directly enforceable obligations against individuals envisaged that are not dependent on establishing a contravention by a firm.</p> <p>  Having said that, again it will be when you are looking at a particular issue that you would look to decide how best to come at this in the context of what this tells us.  Is it that a firm has failed across systems and controls in a particular area?  Is it that I am then looking at this senior person or am I actually looking at a failure by a senior person to act with integrity and honesty?  The more high-level common conduct standards may come into play as of themselves.</p></speech>

Head 5, section 1(c) reads, "the senior executive function performed by the person was at that time responsible for the management or oversight of the regulated financial service provider's activities in relation to which the contravention" was happening, and that is my concern.  It is crucial that more senior people are captured in terms of their responsibility in terms of management or oversight on those so that no junior people are caught out.  I am not satisfied that is fully got in subsection (c) but perhaps the Central Bank regulations can deal with that.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses' views on this.  The tracker mortgage scandal was one of the biggest scandals.  We can call it theft as &euro;1 billion has had to be paid back into the accounts of more than 40,000 people.  Family homes and buy-to-lets were taken off people, and we know the misery that has caused.  Do the witnesses believe, had we had this legislation five or ten years ago, the Central Bank would have been able to hold individuals to account and fine them as a result of their actions?  I ask because that is the slat tomhais or barometer we want to use when assessing whether this legislation will work in the future.</p> <p>  My last point is about holding people to account and, it is hoped, dissuading practices that went on in the past, but we need to find out about these practices.  If it had not been for the handful of individuals taking their case to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, we may never have heard about the tracker mortgage scandal in the first place.  Is it not now appropriate to introduce a proper whistleblowing regime in the financial services industry?  It is too small of a club and there is too much fear in terms of moving up the ladder and so on.  That has been seen in terms of what happened in America where, following a scandal there, legislation was introduced that allowed for a financial benefit for those who blew the whistle on what was happening within the sectors.  Is that something the Central Bank would support?  Are there other areas the Central Bank would like to see in this legislation?  For example, I am conscious that payment gateways, such as Revolut and Stripe, are not included.  These are new platforms that allow people, using their phones, to invest thousands of euro in cryptocurrency, yet none of that comes under the scope of this legislation.</p></speech>

We believe these are very good proposals to enhance the framework we have at the moment.</p> <p>  In terms of the tracker mortgage examination, it is important I make the following point.  We made a commitment in the context of enforcement arising out of the tracker mortgage examination.  PTSB was fined &euro;21 million in 2019, last year KBC was fined &euro;18 million, this year Ulster Bank was fined &euro;37 million, and Springboard was fined &euro;4.5 million in 2016.  We were very clear in saying that, in conducting those investigations, under our current framework, we would be looking at the actions of individuals.</p> <p>  Our work on the tracker mortgage examination and enforcement is ongoing.  We are using the framework we have currently, but we are very happy to be here today to engage in the general scheme.  We think the enhancements proposed will serve to drive what it is we seek to achieve, which is better management risk, better governance and higher standards in financial services.  My colleague, Mr. Cross, will respond to the question on scope and application.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.318" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Cross" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021110300002#D00800"><p>I will also mention the whistleblowing question.  It is a very good question for us to ask ourselves and it is not covered in this legislation.  As the Deputy said, protected disclosures or whistleblowing are a very important aspect of a well-functioning supervisory and regulatory framework because they are a very good source of information and they provide very important information.  It is also the case that enhancing the governance and culture within firms, especially around speak-up, so there is an indirect benefit from this framework, will help with that.</p> <p>  On the question of financial incentives, we do not have a formulated final view on this at the moment.  It is something worth considering but it needs a lot of consideration because there are pros and cons.  The positive aspects can be seen but it brings aspects about which we would want to think very carefully.  It is something worth further discussion.</p> <p>  On the issue of scope, the draft legislation potentially does have a wide scope.  In terms of the conduct standards, it applies to all regulated financial service providers.  On the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, in the first instance the proposal is that it would apply to the most high-impact firms.</p> <p>  Again, it is very important to say the financial system is evolving very quickly, as the Deputy has said.  There are all sorts of opportunities and potential benefits but also challenges and risks on how technology companies of different types and business models are engaging.  Certainly for the future it is something we will need to be very alive to and think about how this fits there.  We are moving more quickly and fully than the UK did in its first steps because we have had the benefit of seeing their experience, but it will be a case of we apply this legislation in a broad yet limited way in the first instance and then roll it out further over time.</p></speech>

I note the Bill does not seek to transpose a European directive.  Is the Bill modelled on legislation in other jurisdictions such as the United States or any European countries?  If so, how effective has the legislation been in those countries?</p></speech>

Australia is particularly notable in this regard, as are Singapore and other countries.  Other EU countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium have aspects of it but not in this comprehensive way.  As the Deputy has intimated, Ireland will be the first country in the EU to introduce such a scheme.  There is quite a bit of interest in Europe.  Indeed, in the recently published Commission proposal for the capital requirements regulation, based on Basel III, there is reference to this type of scheme.</p><p>It is not proposed to implement it in a full-blown way, but our experience and that of others is being considered in that regard.  It is something that is of interest and it is being looked at elsewhere.<br/><br/>Turning to lessons learned, the timing of developments in the UK has been useful for us.  The Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority in that country have recently carried out reviews and they have seen the real benefit.  I think that is how they have assessed it.  That description refers to how the firms themselves consider it, the enhancement it has been for the firms in respect of their governance, how they enhance and improve their cultures, and generally in the sense it has been a real foundation and boost for effective governance and standards in the UK regime.<br/><br/>Regarding areas where we are a little different from the UK situation, I mentioned in my opening comments the issue of collective responsibility.  That is an important aspect for us.  The UK authorities have also noted this point in their reports.  It is obviously important that individuals are held to account, but we do not want to end up in a situation where that is the whole story and everybody is looking after his or her own part of the business.  It is important we also have the elements of collective decision-making and collective responsibility functioning.  We have tried to do that and this scheme seeks to create a good bridge between individual and collective responsibility.  The UK system does not have that, but the deficiency was called out in a report as something for the relevant authorities there to think about further.<br/><br/>The other thing we have decided to do that is not in the UK scheme <i>per se</i>is to include non-executive directors in the senior executive accountability regime.  The UK did not take that approach, although non-executive directors who head committees are included.  We have thought long and hard about this aspect and engaged with the Department on it.  On balance, we think it is right to include them because non-executive directors are such an important part of the effective functioning of financial firms.  It is also important to say, however, that the proposed legislation does not expand their duties or impose additional duties on them.  Rather, it is simply stated we must be clear how the non-executive directors fit into the governance of the firm, that they must be clear about what they are responsible for, and that they must also take reasonable steps in discharging their responsibilities.  We think this facet of what is proposed is proportionate and we do not think it will have an adverse effect.  It was important to have that comprehensiveness.</p></speech>

We cannot just say everything will be fine in this regard.  It is a context we must think about as we implement the framework.  We do three things that are relevant to how it will work effectively.  We call out the senior executive functions, such as the chief risk officer, the chief credit officer etc.  We state the inherent responsibilities of those functions, such as what the job of the chief credit officer is.  Separate from all that, we stipulate a list of responsibilities that must be ascribed to people within a bank.  That is to ensure there cannot be any gaps.</p> <p>  I think a firm that tried to game the system to its advantage by putting a person in charge of credit but without giving him or her the title of chief credit officer would quickly end up with two problems.  First, there would be a mismatch between the inherent responsibilities of a role and the name of a role.  I do not think it would work.  If such an attempt was pursued, however, that would be one of those instances where we would immediately say there was a problem with the governance and culture of the firm concerned.  It would be possible to see the mismatch between a more junior person holding the title in question and the more senior person really making decisions.  That would set off alarm bells everywhere and we would quickly be saying we must intervene.</p></speech>

That is where that aspect remains relevant in the context of a senior person, the oversight of a particular area and ensuring the firm is compliant with the regulations in that particular area.  I say that because, in the main, all the obligations are placed on firms.</p></speech>

The way that would work in the context of an investigation is that typically people would be interviewed by officers authorised by the Central Bank enforcement division.  Ultimately, sanctions could be imposed by one of two ways.  It could be by way of a settlement between the Central Bank and the firm and-or an individual.  If such a course of action is not appropriate as a resolution, then a case would go to an inquiry.  It would be a Central Bank inquiry which would have powers in respect of calling witnesses before it, allowing them to present their evidence and be examined on their evidence and the documentary evidence.</p></speech>

Many questions have been asked already, but one aspect I wish to ask about is the monetary sanctions involved for individuals.  Head 5 of this proposed legislation deals with monetary sanctions.  It states they shall be &ldquo;effective, proportionate and dissuasive", while also taking into account "The financial position of the individual concerned&rdquo;.  I ask the witnesses to outline, by way of example, the range of monetary sanctions which will be possible for breaches of the conduct standards.  My colleague, Deputy Doherty, for instance, mentioned the tracker mortgage scandal.  I would also like the witnesses to confirm that under head 5 it would not be possible for the employer or service provider to pay or contribute towards a monetary sanction imposed on an individual.</p></speech>

First, it is capped at &euro;1 million.  The sanction was capped at &euro;500,000 before 2013, but then increased to &euro;1 million.  Second, the sanction cannot have the effect of rendering someone bankrupt.  We have published extensive guidance on how we sanction firms and individuals.</p><p>The general scheme envisages that what we have set out by way of guidance will now be enshrined in legislation applying the key principles that would cover any sanctioning process based on its seriousness, nature, duration, proportionality etc.  The sanctions imposed to date by the Central Bank under ASP range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;200,000.  We have that range in our toolkit to impose an appropriate fine, based on the seniority of the person, the expectation of the person and the level of the misconduct.</p><p> The Deputy asked who will pay the fine.  As that will depend on a particular case, I do not have a clear answer to give on that.</p></speech>

Much of the discussion has been on the fact that individual accountability is a core focus of the Central Bank's work.  As a number of the questions I had have already been asked, I would like to focus on the Cum-ex scandal that has been in the news recently.  This involves billions of euro and several firms across Europe.  I looked at the Companies Registration Office, CRO, database to see if any of the directors had been disqualified.  While looking at the database, I noticed that some people are directors of more than 100 companies simultaneously and that some had more than 300 previous directorships.  One person currently holds more than 150 directorships.  Based on media reports, we are aware that a non-executive director of one of the funds had met officials from the Central Bank and had offered to resign at the time but was requested to stay on.  I would be interested if Mr. Cross could advise about this.  Given that a person can hold multiple directorships simultaneously, possibly involving hundreds of companies, is this conducive to a culture of high standards and an ability to perform fiduciary duties?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.337" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Cross" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021110300002#F00300"><p>I obviously cannot comment on individual firms, individual cases or supervisory restrictions.  There are several aspects.  The cum-ex issue is very important.  It potentially involves a range of issues of concern, including whether the firm is in compliance with the basic regulations that apply to it or the individuals.  It is fundamentally about the culture and behaviour within a firm as evinced by its business model.  We would look very closely at that aspect in that context.  As the Deputy indicated, it is very relevant in our considerations about the fitness, probity and suitability of the person.  It is a really important issue which manifests itself in a number of ways.  In addition, there could be criminal aspects to it.  That is how we think about it.  Of course, it is a very complicated context.  We have engaged closely with the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, the European Banking Authority, EBA, and other European authorities on this.  It is a complex picture and it is necessary to look at the circumstances of each individual case.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the issue of directorships of several different companies.  We have pressed quite hard on the issue over recent years.  I do not have the numbers to hand but we have set out the appropriate numbers including hours, commitments, etc.  We can do the maths on how much time an individual should commit to a directorship and therefore how many directorships can be legitimately or appropriately held.  It is an important issue.  If it goes beyond a certain level, we would have questions and we have been pressing quite hard on that issue.</p> <p>  There can be umbrella structures where a director has several directorships of sub-entities within that.  That is a slightly different picture.  On the whole, I agree with the Deputy that a limited number of directorships should be held in order for a job to be done well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021110300002#F00400"><p>I agree with Mr. Cross about the cum-ex scandal being complicated.  Those people were able to defraud billions of euro from European tax authorities over a number of years precisely because it was complicated and it took time for what was happening to be noticed.  The reality is that it is not a victimless crime.  They took that money from tax authorities, meaning that ordinary people suffered because they do not get the services that they should as provided from the state.  That is a simple fact.</p><p>With some of the firms related to this cum-ex scandal, all the directors are still in place and some of the directors still hold 100 or 150 directorships.  That this happened before their noses is deeply concerning.  I know that the Central Bank engaged with the EBA.  I read online the Central Bank's responses to the EBA questionnaire.  Some of the responses are quite interesting.  It was asked about the various investigations that were being carried out by other European regulators into the scandal.  When asked if it was aware of any criminal investigations being carried out relating to the dividend arbitrage trading schemes and if it was taking any specific actions, the Central Bank stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) has not carried out, nor are there any current plans to carry out, supervisory reviews/actions to detect tax related operational and compliance risks in the context of dividend arbitrage schemes. </blockquote> <p>The Central Bank also noted that it was aware that two credit institutions were included in the German tax authority&rsquo;s case investigating such schemes but that no supervisory actions were taken against either.  I find that of concern.  Why did the Central Bank not sanction any of the funds or firms involved in this?  </p><p>The Central Bank also advised European financial regulators that it was not resourced to investigate these complex cases.  We are all aware that these are complex trading schemes.  The Central Bank stated that market surveillance for such suspected tax-retained schemes were outside its remit.  Why does Mr. Cross believe it is outside the Central Bank's remit?</p></speech>

There is the issue of how we, as a jurisdiction across Europe, approach the schemes of tax evasion, avoidance, etc.  We do not have a specific tax remit <i>per se</i>.</p><p>That is what we were trying to convey in our response to the EBA.  However, and this is very important, we absolutely do have that mandate and remit in regard to regulated financial services firms and, as Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell said - and I could not agree more - this is not a victimless issue.  This is not something to be accepted as part of business.  That is not the case.  As already stated, this type of activity raises questions about regulatory compliance, culture, conduct, behaviour, the fitness and probity of the people who are doing it, and so on.  I cannot comment on individual cases; that is not permitted.  What I will say is that in our supervision, we need to engage with all of the facts as we find them.  We need to understand what happened, what did not happen and what the case was.  That is as much as I can say.  I fully agree that this is not something that is somehow outside our mandate or that we would not at all be worried about.</p></speech>

What I am very concerned about is that because this is complex, it can go over people's heads.  It is a really bad mark against this State to be linked to this in any way.  It was a fraud involving billions of euro.  Clearly, Mr. Cross cannot comment specifically on individual cases, but I would like to see something very clear coming from the Central Bank - a statement in whatever form is permissible - that the matter is going to be pursued and that we cannot have such a thing happen again.  As we both agree, it is not a victimless crime.  What happened is absolutely outrageous.</p></speech>

I welcome discussion.  Many of us were frustrated at the long time it has taken for the heads of Bill to come before us, but we have them now.  I have two questions.  One relates to head 5 and the identification documentation of the responsibilities of senior individuals.  Under that head, what will be the reporting requirement to the Central Bank?  Will the Central Bank have a function to ensure that the documentation process is up to date?  If we look at the UK experience, I note that a directory of certified persons was established at the end of 2020.  Does Mr. Cross believe that is necessary or should be included in proposed legislation such as that before us?</p></speech>

To answer the first question, as I mentioned in response to Deputy Doherty's question earlier, it is very important in this context that the financial services industry does not think that the Central Bank will take it by the hand and check its work every step of the way and lead it step by step along the way.  This proposed Bill is about bringing the culture, governance and approach of the financial sector and its firms up a level.  Crucial to that is that it takes responsibility, that it takes the view that it is for firms to get matters right in the first instance.  Having said that, of course it is the job of the Central Bank, as the regulator and supervisor, to ensure that firms are doing so and to supervise them in a way that we are comfortable with and that makes us confident that they are meeting their obligations and what is expected of them as they should.  In terms of the maps and the statements of responsibility, they will come to us and we will have regard to them and they will be part of our supervision of a firm.  They will be very helpful part, frankly, because they will give us a very clear basis upon which to engage, consider and involve ourselves with a particular firm.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.  They will come to us, we will use them and have regard to them, and make sure that they are doing it properly.  However, it is not the case that the firms will submit and expect us to advise as to whether they are right.  It is about the firms taking responsibility for themselves.</p> <p>  On the issue of a directory, that is not something that at this stage forms part of the proposed Bill.  It is something that could be considered.  I do not have a strong, clear view on it.</p></speech>

That is the reason for the introduction of the certification proposal.  While we already have an ongoing obligation to assess the fitness and probity of people involved in key functions, the general scheme envisages enhancing that further in the context of a firm's own role in that assessment.  That would be a certification process which we think would be helpful as we move forward.  Mr. Cross talked about the Central Bank's assessment of the statements and maps of responsibility.  These will be enormously beneficial, particularly in a supervisory context.  It is being approached in two different ways because there are also enhancements of how the firms will be required to look at and assess on an ongoing basis the fitness and probity of people in their employ.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021110300002#G00600"><p>I certainly believe that an element of transparency or at least public access to the details of people in those roles would be an important element in the context of the goal of improving the culture or forcing firms to improve their culture and behaviour.</p> <p>  My next question relates to an issue Mr. Cross touched on in terms of the primary focus - I am paraphrasing him here - being improve the culture across firms.  We have seen that from the UK experience.  One of the other dimensions of the UK experience, which we are looking at along with the US and other countries, is that there has been only one prosecution since the legislation was brought in there in 2016.  To gain an understanding of this, as the regulators who will be enforcing the standards and bringing more contraventions to light by means of this proposed Bill and ensuring that more wrongdoing is exposed, how busy do the witnesses expect to be?  It is not just about a general improvement in the culture, rather, that we are actually going to see more prosecutions, if that is the right word, or more enforcement actions being taken.  Do the witnesses have an expectations in that regard?</p></speech>

What this framework is designed to do is improve governance and the management of risk and outcomes for consumers.  Of course, built in to this framework is an enhancement of enforcement in circumstances where things go seriously wrong.  As Mr. Cross stated, what we are being very clear on is that is the intention behind the framework, but we remain committed to assertive risk based supervision underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement.  Where serious issues arise and enforcement is appropriate, that is what we will certainly do and what this framework allows us is an enhancement of our process in terms of individual accountability, and we very much welcome that.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  We welcome this proposed legislation and hope it achieves a change of culture as outlined in the objectives relating to it.</p><p>I wish to take the focus back a little, if I may.  At the heart of this is the threat of white collar crime and the effect it has on corporate governance and society, as well as the significant costs it has on society.  The State takes a fractured approach to white collar crime.  There are several locations of investigation, of which the Central Bank of Ireland is one.  Legislation is currently going through the Oireachtas to establish the corporate enforcement authority.  Obviously, the Garda has an involvement in this area.  There are also probably half a dozen commissions of investigation currently going through the system and those commissions of investigation are anything but satisfactory.  They have been going on for years and are costing massive amounts of money.  I am thinking of the commissions of investigation relating to NAMA and the IBRC.  Would it not be better for the State to have a department or an office of investigations that could actually build the critical skill sets needed to be able to enforce and investigate?  It could ensure there are efficient investigations that are timely and do not cost a bomb.  That is not a matter specific to this legislation; it is relevant to it and to other legislation.  I would like to hear the views of our guests on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.349" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Se&aacute;na Cunningham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021110300002#H00200"><p>It is a very interesting question.  As the Deputy stated, it certainly steps back a level.  The Law Reform Commission has looked at this issue.  On one aspect, we have had the Hamilton review that was conducted.  The report by Mr. Hamilton was very interesting and made several recommendations, including the creation of an advisory council on economic crime and corruption.  There is always the idea of different functional mandates.  Certainly we in the Central Bank find that supervision and enforcement in financial services sitting together is useful, but it is very important that we are part of and co-ordinated into the broader framework because, as the Deputy stated, there are several actors in play and the issue of which of them is appropriate to take the lead on a particular investigation, which of them offers supports, etc., and where the right skill sets are is really important.  Arising from the Hamilton report, there has been the creation of an economic crime and corruption forum that brings together the sort of lead agencies with a view to better co-ordination with each other, which we would all welcome.  The Central Bank is a constituent part of that.</p> <p>  A key area of focus for us in recent years has been how we have worked very effectively with the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  There are cases in which we identify suspicions of serious criminality and report that to the Garda, which will be the lead investigator but with the Central Bank providing support.  That sort of modelling is very important - obviously within the context of our respective mandates and frameworks - and we have seen it be successful.</p> <p>  For me, the key area of focus needs to be on using the framework effectively.  I refer to the idea of joint training programmes which is being considered in the context of the forum in terms of rolling out training to investigators across several regulatory functions and the Garda so that we have consistency.  However, we all operate with different frameworks and powers.  The consideration of better co-ordination, working effectively together in relevant cases and seeking to ensure that things are addressed by the right agency in the right way is very much to be welcomed.</p></speech>

However, sometimes regulation can become cyclical and there can nearly be a pro-cyclical regulatory experience.  After a major crash or difficulty, regulation becomes very tight.  One can see that is almost the case in the banking system currently in terms of the capital ratios that are in force in this State and the effect that is having on the banking industry.</p> <p>  In reply to earlier questions, our guests talked about adverse effects the Bill could have.  I am not suggesting for a second that the Bill goes too far; it does not.  What research have the witnesses done in respect of potential adverse effects?  I am thinking of potential vexatious behaviours that could happen within an organisation.  If the responsibility of an individual at a certain level is to bring an issue up to higher levels within a firm and that person exhausts every opportunity in that regard, he or she potentially reduces his or her own liability for an act or wrongdoing and that pushes the liability onto somebody else up the food chain in that firm.  Is there any understanding of what could happen in firms in that regard?  Mr. Cross mentioned that this regulation differs from the British regulation in that non-executive directors are made responsible under the Bill.  Will that have potential competition effects in the context of Irish firms?</p></speech>

The Deputy started by considering cyclicality of regulation.  That is a really important point.  It is our job as regulators to look through that cycle because it is well shown.  If one looks back, one can see a pattern of post-crisis tightening, then times get good again, and just when there is a need for regulation in good times to be firm, it can be weakened because people think we are in the good times and it is bit different now to how it was before and that we can relax a little.  We have a responsibility as regulators and, if I may say so, as legislators, to look through that cycle and to remember what happened in the past.  That said, it is really important that we keep proportionality and predictability and the overall purpose we are trying to achieve, which is a well functioning economy and the economic well-being of those whom the financial sector is there to support, that is, consumers and users.  It is about getting this right; it is not about making it so rigorous that things cannot happen or so weak that bad things arise.  It is about getting it right and it is really important that we do so.  I refer to the marketplace and competition within the marketplace.  I was asked by Deputy Doherty about Stripe as an example of a tech firm.  It is really important that the financial system is able to benefit from technological development and competition from tech firms.  It is important that we get these things right and that we do not regulate in a way that unduly dampens that kind of innovation activity while looking through the cycle and seeing what are the risks that we need to guard against.  It is very important to consider that in the context of this particular regulation.  For example, the regulatory impact statement that accompanies the general scheme is very helpful in calling out some of the aspects that need to be balanced and have been balanced in arriving at the general scheme.</p> <p>  On the issue of vexatious behaviours, it is right to say that we need to be aware of that risk.  The UK has also called out the risk of juniorfication of roles that I was asked about earlier by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  However, the system is designed in such a way that it is about substance and what are reasonable actions and us ultimately standing back and asking what is the culture of the firm in question and what is happening in it.  The type of behaviour described by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is the exact type of behaviour that would set off alarm bells for us and cause us to say that what is happening in the firm is not good governance or good culture but, rather, box ticking and formalisation of things, which is precisely what this regime is designed to avoid.  Although there are aspects on which we must keep a very close eye, the framework is designed to avoid that.</p> <p>  We have closely considered the issue of non-executive directors.  I come back to the very important issue of the proportionality of the regime.</p><p>It is designed not to impose new obligations on people <i>per se</i>but to set out for those in a given role the obligations attached to it.  With a non-executive director, those obligations are really important, but they are not executive functions.  Non-executive directors are not responsible for the running of the firm at executive level.  It is a matter of determining whether, within the constraints concerning the responsibility of a non-executive director, she or he takes reasonable steps necessary regarding implementation.  On the matter of whether she or he should be accountable for that, these are really important roles.<br/><br/>It is absolutely right to say we have to be very alive to the question of whether we are getting this right but, in our engagement with the Department and on the scheme, we believe we have struck a good balance in respect of the differing aspects.</p></speech>

The conduct standards, whether they be common or advanced, apply to all firms.  That is in the proposed legislation.  On the legislative measures on senior executives &ndash; covering the mapping and prescribed responsibilities &ndash; it is correct to say it is to be a matter of regulation by the Central Bank.  We have said from early on that we propose that, in the first instance, the arrangements apply to banks, most insurers and investment firms that deal on own account or hold client assets, and branches of third country firms operating in Ireland.  We have been very clear all along that this is what we believe the right first tranche should include.  It is probably right.  It captures a very large component of the financial services sector, and, going back to the idea of proportionality, it is probably the right cohort in that regard.  It is envisaged that in the future, as in the UK, the arrangement will be rolled out more widely.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty asked me about the new types of firms.  As time goes on, they will be material players in this field.  That is a matter we will have to keep a very close eye on.</p></speech>

My question is on resources.  While it is fantastic to have all the legislation in the world, it is not worth the paper it is written on if it is not enforced.  I appreciate that Mr. Cross&rsquo;s colleague has said the objective is to change the culture.  Ideally, enforcement might not need to expand if the culture changes.  I hope that will be the case but my instinct is that, in the real world, enforcement will need to happen before the culture changes.  What new resources will be needed to increase the investigative and enforcement powers of the Central Bank?</p> <p>  My last question is on timescales.  How long will it take to come up with the additional investigative and enforcement capabilities?  How long will it take for the new regulations to be put in place?</p></speech>

We have been very focused on, and have built, enforcement capacity over recent years.  We have multidisciplinary teams, constituting investigators, lawyers and data analysts, that we bring into play in our enforcement investigations.  We have conducted enforcement investigations at scale, with forensic retrieval and analysis of data.  We are well set up as an investigative function.  We have demonstrated that in the context of some very significant investigations we have conducted.</p> <p>  What we see coming to bear here are proposals that we believe will enhance our enforcement process and perhaps, critically, our inquiry process.  We have run Central Bank inquiries.  As is typical when running inquiries, ways of bringing enhancements to bear are identified.  We very much look forward to some of these enhancements as they are brought to bear.  We have been really focusing on and building our capacity for conducting enforcement investigations over recent years.  Considering the complexity and scale of investigations undertaken to date, we believe we can continue as we have been doing as the new regime is introduced and our process is enhanced.</p></speech>

Obviously, the legislation needs to pass through these Houses, and we await that, but we are keen to have it in place without further delay, not only because of the value of having the regime in place but also because of the momentum that now exists.  We propose to have our draft regulations and guidance ready for consultation.  We need to consult because this is important stuff.  It is important that we engage as we should with stakeholders on what we propose to introduce.  We will have the drafts ready to go shortly after the legislation is ready.  We will then move quickly to get the consultation done, take on board any responses we get and begin implementation.  We are moving fast.</p></speech>

Regarding what the framework does in terms of key enhancements, we have a clear statement on what senior people are responsible for.  We have a mapping exercise that allows a key feature of overlaid governance so we can see who is responsible for what, and where.  We have the application, for the first time, of conduct standards that are directly applicable to individuals in key positions in financial services, and enforceable.  We really believe this enhances the framework we work under.  It is informed by the experience we have had over several years in conducting multiple investigations and in the context of the work we have done on supervision and enforcement, whereby we see the potential for better outcomes and, where things go seriously wrong, the potential to have a clear eye to where accountability and responsibility lie in a particular firm.  I would come at the question that way.</p></speech>

There is a focus on monetary sanctions and administrative sanctions under Part IIIC of the consolidated Central Bank Act.  I know these include monetary penalties and disqualification but these are still administrative sanctions in that context.  I note the only new criminal offence being introduced under legislation relates to the confidentiality of the documents used in an inquiry, so again it is a witness that is potentially facing a new sanction relating to the confidentiality of an inquiry if he or she is seen as having breached the confidentiality of a seen document.  I am little concerned that obstruction of an inquiry is being downgraded whereby there was a criminal sanction but it is now proposed a civil remedy would be used instead of the criminal offence.</p><p> The witnesses have mentioned co-operation with the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  It would be very useful to know and be clearer on where those connections move and at what point they move.  What are the formal mechanisms in an inquiry if matters arise that are of concern?  Has consideration been given to perhaps strengthening criminal offences under this Bill?  As I have said, currently the only new criminal offence I have seen - I may have missed some in the heads - relates to the confidentiality of documentation.  I am also concerned that in terms of obstruction of an inquiry, in the heads of the Bill the case is put that a civil remedy would be quicker to use because it would be impracticable to use a criminal offence.  From a deterrent perspective, and if the case being put by the bank it is that it is keen to deter obstruction, I worry that a civil remedy would certainly be seen as a less serious deterrent than a criminal offence when it comes to the obstruction of an inquiry.  I worry that we might even be giving a signal that people can obstruct an inquiry and although civil action may be taken, they are not taking a risk associated with a criminal offence, as they may have done before.</p><p> There are two or three other matters.  The witnesses mentioned where they see the first tranche of application and I would like their perspective on investment limited partnerships.  I have significant concerns about the investment limited partnership legislation that recently went through the Oireachtas in general in that it seemed to move accountability away from a number of people who may sit on the boards of organisations making key decisions on those organisations and on investment partnership policies but fall under the new thresholds for responsibility.  What is the perspective of the witnesses on the investment limited partnerships and are they seen as something they want to look to?</p><p> I have another one or two queries but perhaps the witnesses might answer those questions first.  The proposed amendment to section 33BC of the principal Act relates to settlements.  I am quite concerned about settlements as an option.  I note that within settlements, there may be a decision as to whether to publish information and the reputation of the relevant executive person is a consideration in that regard.  Again, I am concerned that there may be a scenario where we see many settlements but not actual accountability for individuals.  Individuals who settle may reappear with other roles or continue to hold multiple roles, as Deputy Farrell outlined, as people could hold 100 or more roles.  The questions relate to section 33BC of the principal Act and the proposed head 25 on obstruction, as well as the wider question of criminal sanctions.  There is also the issue of investment limited partnerships.</p></speech>

I will start with the criminal sanction aspect.  This proposal is around a civil or regulatory framework being enhanced.  The Senator asked a specific question about how it works more broadly.  Pursuant to the legislation, the Central Bank has obligations where we form a suspicion of a criminal offence to make reports to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, in some cases, other agencies.  There are occasions where we make reports like that and where the Garda takes ownership of the matter and there is a criminal investigation.  There are other cases where the Central Bank deals with the matter under an administrative or regulatory process.</p> <p>  It is interesting to look at the UK and Australia, where similar regimes were introduced, and they were also civil rather than criminal in nature.  We are very clear in our view that there are areas where criminal sanctions are appropriate and others where civil or regulatory remedies are very important and have an enormous deterrence value.</p> <p>  The Senator made a point about the public statement aspect and what is there is essentially a codification of an "as is" position.  We have been very clear on, and conscious of, how we see enforcement so that there is transparency and it is of a public nature.  Looking at regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, they do not bring the level of transparency that the Central Bank brings in enforcement.  There may be a kind of one-line statement such as "Firm A sanctioned &euro;30,000" but we have an entirely different approach that we propose to continue under this enhanced framework.  This would see the Central Bank publishing the name of a firm or individual, along with details of sanctions imposed so the market is clearly aware of them.</p> <p>  For example, this year we published an enforcement statement relating to an individual concerned with the management of Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The individual is set out therein and it is set out that he is disqualified for 15 years and that he has been sanctioned &euro;200,000.  What he did exactly is also set out.  We have an approach of transparency under settlement.  That will not change and it will continue.</p> <p>  There may be specific concerns about an appropriate consequence and sometimes this is more about trying to bring somebody into compliance rather than punishing people.  That is something we think about when considering the most effective tool to bring about compliance in certain cases.  For example, in an inquiry context we want co-operation and participation of individuals before that inquiry.</p> <p>  I mentioned earlier that it is important that both regulatory and criminal regimes operate effectively and in a way that is informed by each other so the system deals with matters in the right and appropriate way.  Much of this is down to how different agencies interact and co-operate with each other.  We will continue to have excellent engagement and co-operation, particularly with colleagues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in appropriate cases.</p></speech>

As she said, the legislation on these was recently amended by these Houses.  We have been comfortable with the legislation and what it introduced.  As I said earlier, the framework in the first instance is to give quite a wide scope.  Of course we will look in future where it could be further applied and further benefit could be applied.  I do not want to prejudge that sort of sequencing.  We have not yet got to that stage but I note the Senator's comments.</p></speech>

Previous legislation referred to a person concerned in management but, in the new legislation, that would become a person performing a controlled function or pre-approved to perform a controlled function.  I would like comment, clarity or assurances in that regard.  If an individual, a Mr. Smith or a Ms Lynch, is performing a controlled function, I would like it confirmed that the individual would be held accountable for any wrongdoing so we do not have a situation whereby a person can move out of a role and the problem stays with that role but does not concern the individual.  The old legislation referred to a person concerned in the management.  While I accept that was quite wide and needed clarity, I am worried that narrowing the wording to a controlled function or a pre-approved controlled function may give rise to a situation whereby senior executives who are not directly in those controlled functions but who have a key role in terms of management and who drive or allow for poor, unethical or dangerous decisions might not get captured in this regime.  I am a little concerned about that.  There are different ways in which I am worried we could end up narrowing the scope so much that people are not captured by it.  </p><p> I would push back on some of the comment around encouraging compliance.  I am always amazed by the amount of second, third and fourth chances we distribute in the white-collar, financial services sector, compared to any other sector, where misdemeanours are very seriously consequential for individuals.  My concern is that if the goal is simply to say we have made senior executives in this country adopt different practices or improve their current practices, an issue may have been addressed within that company but the senior executive may not have been held accountable.  Does it trigger an investigation of their roles within other companies?  How does the inquiry follow the individual, as opposed to following the individual's controlled function in a company?</p><p> Head 5, section 2 mentions all the factors which need to be considered when assessing whether somebody should be investigated or held accountable.  It strikes me that a number of the reasons somebody might be able to say they should not be held accountable are in the control of companies.  Complexity is offered as a potential reason.  The nature, scale, complexity and timeframe are offered as reasons someone can avoid accountability.  Who do we hold accountable for the creation of circumstances which an individual can use, under head 5, section 2, to evade accountability under this regime?  Is it the company or is it the individual?</p></speech>

The Senator asked about the role of individuals and the possibility they could wriggle out, empty out the senior function and get their people out of the picture.  It is an important question and comes back to an answer I gave earlier.  In our discussions with the Department of Finance on this issue, we have tried to design this legislation in a way that learns from the experience of others and whereby it is really about substance.  People should not be able to say they are not on the hook because allegations of wrongdoing do not apply to the title of the role they carry out.  It should be the case that the substance of the role goes with the responsibility for the role.  There is also the other context of the allocation of responsibility.  As I said earlier, the way the Bill is designed means it should not be possible for someone to decide they will make the decisions but will not assign themselves the relevant role and, therefore, get around the legislation.  Ms Cunningham can speak to this better than me.</p> <p>  The issue goes back to some of our earlier discussions about the participation link.  The essence of it is that individuals understand their responsibilities and know what is expected of them, and that we hold them to account, as individuals.  That is the heart of the matter.  If the regime was not hitting that target, it would be a big miss.  It is about individuals.  It should not allow a company to claim an investigation did not show that the firm broke a regulation and it is therefore off the hook, nor should it allow a company to assert that because it has now left the business or the financial services sector, it is off the hook.  It is about trying to close those escape routes.</p> <p>  I agree with the Senator that this should not be about nice language with references to improving standards.  This is about improving the way financial services are done in firms and how they think about their roles and responsibilities as firms and individuals.  That is at least partly driven by being on the hook for what they do and what they fail to do.  That has not been the case at all times and that is what this legislation has been designed to address.  It is about driving up standards, culture and behaviour.  It is about the financial sector fulfilling the role it should have, which is to support the economic well-being of citizens and the economy.  That can be done by introducing clarity and expectations, while underpinning the regime with clear accountability.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about reasonable standards.  It comes back again to some of the things we were saying earlier.  We need to give sufficient clarity to people so they know what is expected of them but we cannot and should not be telling people they are okay if they tick certain boxes.  That is not what this is about.  This is about people taking responsibility for their jobs.  One could suggest that a firm may be able to create complexity but we will look straight through that.  We will ask what is the substance of what is happening here.  This is about asking an individual whether reasonable steps were taken to do his or her job and fulfil his or her responsibilities.  If we are seeing add-on complexity and obfuscation, how we see the situation will move the other way.  It will make us say we do not think an individual was taking reasonable steps.  We would suspect that something was going on if individuals should have said that in order for them to do their jobs, unreasonable complexity should be removed.  Of course, there are situations where things are complex.  It is a complex world and we need to take that into account.  The questions raised by the Senator are very important and legitimate.  I hope and think this scheme will allow us to deal with those issues because if it did not, it would not be hitting the mark.</p></speech>

This legislation has been designed not to narrow the scope of application but to widen it, and to address issues over what moving on therefore means.</p><p>What it allows in terms of enhancements is a reach into a broader population.  It also allows us to deal with the idea of somebody leaving a position.  Under the administrative sanctions procedure and fitness and probity, the consequences subsequent to an investigation and fair procedures are the possibility of disqualification or prohibition.  These can go beyond the firm the person worked in.  It can include all financial services firms.  It is quite a breadth of consequence ultimately.</p></speech>

Where are the knock-on effects?  Very quickly, will the witnesses speak about where there is an inquiry into somebody who has a particular function in an organisation and is a senior executive?  For those who hold multiple roles, will this trigger an inquiry into the other roles they hold?  We heard about this from Deputy Farrell.  This is something that has caused frustration.  We seem to have siloed investigations.  It is welcome that it was mentioned in the presentation that there is not a need for a finding of wrongdoing against a firm before there is an inquiry into an individual senior executive.  Will the witnesses confirm that if there is an inquiry into wrongdoing in a firm that it will not preclude a parallel investigation into the behaviour of a senior executive?  Does this trigger a wider investigation of the individual?  If a pattern is emerging of a similar practice in a sector will it trigger a sectoral investigation?  Will the witnesses confirm that the investigation of either an individual or a company does not preclude them happening in parallel?</p></speech>

It does allow that there could be an investigation into a firm and an investigation into an individual.  We have prohibited individuals under the fitness and probity regime with consequences.  When we look at the conduct of a particular individual in a particular firm the consequence at the end could well be, and has been, that the person is not allowed to hold positions in any regulated financial services provider.  This is provided for.  There is a similar consequence in the context of an administrative sanctions procedure investigation, whereby a person is disqualified from being a person concerned in the management of any regulated financial services provider.  It not only deals with the conduct investigated, it also prohibits somebody holding any other position in financial services, which is a very important consequence.  When we identify an issue with an individual we look at it in total, as we would from a sectoral perspective in our supervisory work, to see whether something has broader application.  I hope this answers the question.</p></speech>

A theme that came up again and again was addressing issues after they had happened.  The theory would be that we try to prevent them.  This was the theme of the replies.  I was a member of the DIRT inquiry more than 20 years ago.  Banking practices in the country at the time ended up in an sworn inquiry.  We felt they would tend to undermine credibility and the integrity of the banking system if they were allowed to continue.  When we had concluded the inquiry, we were told that in future this would not happen.  There was a promise of good fiduciary practices, good governance and alternate accountancy in terms of visiting accountants to ensure the books had not been deliberately swayed or skewed in a particular direction.  There were promises on transparency, accountability and reliability, which were all issues that were sworn into at the particular time.  We felt we were on the right path and that this would not happen again.  However, it did, and that is the problem that I see.  This is the theme of the questions raised by most members.  We had the awful experience during that period and then we had the financial crash where some of the same practices we had identified previously were carried on, almost as soon as we had gone around the corner.  With the best will in the world we go through the performance again and again.</p> <p>  Incidentally, the members of that committee, who were public representatives, were not very popular because of the inquiry we carried out.  Some of us almost lost our seats in the subsequent election and others did so, unfortunately.  We felt it was necessary to do our duty because of what happened.  Unfortunately, what happened ultimately was that each and every member of the public was severely punished by virtue of non-adherence to the promises made.  Some of those members of the public are still suffering ten or 12 years later and will continue to suffer for some time.  I am not laying the blame for this on the witnesses.  I am merely suggesting that it happened and everything possible must be done to ensure it does not happen again.</p> <p>  I know we have provisions for fines, criminal responsibility and accountability.  I know we went through in great detail at that time the concepts of malfeasance and misfeasance.  These are all issues that are very pertinent to the context of this debate.  We have not learned our lessons from then.  By "we" I mean all of us involved, including the institutions and public representatives.  We were blamed for allowing it to happen but we did the job that had to be done, unpopular though it made us.  Nobody else took it seriously.  In fact, that report was ultimately treated with contempt.  Approximately &euro;1.2 billion was recovered for the taxpayer and that was fine.  I still worry.</p> <p>  The banking system in this country seems to have become depersonalised.  We have had the closure of branches all over the country and less contact with the customer.  Who suffers at the end of the day?  It is the customer, the economy, the general public and national and international confidence in the banking system, which is hugely important in this country.  I am not attributing any blame to the witnesses.  I am merely saying these things have happened before and the remedies have been introduced before and the questions raised by committee members this evening are along the same lines.  There needs to be a dedication to the application of the principles contained in the Bill, and maybe more, to ensure we do not find ourselves at this juncture at some stage in the future.</p> <p>  My next point is not necessarily relevant to this debate but I should warn the witnesses about it.  Some banks are leaving the jurisdiction at present.  I have noticed that some are retaining an interest thereafter for one or other purpose.  They have sold off their bad debts but they have retained some particular interests or have indicated they will do so.  I hope this is not for cherry picking purposes.  It would be seriously detrimental to the whole question we have been discussing here if any lending institutions were to be able to maintain a cherry picking interest in our finances thereafter.</p></speech>

First of all, ultimately, the financial system is about people and the service of them.  If we look at how we, as a regulator and supervisor, seek to achieve our objectives, that is at the core of it.  Therefore, what the Vice Chairman said about prevention being better than cure is completely right and goes back to some of the questions asked earlier.  This framework is designed where if one does wrong, one will be held accountable, but more than that, it has the basis for getting the banks, the insurers and investment firms, etc., to do what they do better to prevent the things we have seen in the past.  I thank the Vice Chairman.</p></speech>

Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in respect of protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and leave at least one vacant seat between them and others attending.  They should also maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of a medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking, and I ask for the members' full co-operation in this regard.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call on Ms Claire Gordon to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

The proposals in the general scheme are grounded in our national tobacco control policy, Tobacco Free Ireland, which has two underlying objectives - the denormalisation of smoking and the protection of children.  According to our latest survey data, 14% of our adult population smoke daily, 3% smoke occasionally and 5% of school-age children are current smokers.  The primary objective of this proposed Bill is to reduce tobacco smoking rates in all the population.  The measures are particularly focused on measures to prevent young people from starting to smoke.  This is in order to spare them a lifetime of addiction and illness due to a decision made in childhood.</p> <p>  In the long term, smoking causes a range of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, aneurysms, stroke and 16 types of cancer.  These entirely preventible illnesses may not develop for up to 30 years after initiation of smoking.  In the shorter term, smoking during childhood and adolescence causes both reduced lung function and impaired lung growth.  Smoking during adolescence and young adulthood is also a cause of abdominal aortic atherosclerosis in young adults.  There is also evidence that smoking during adolescence increases the risk of developing psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment in later life.  In addition, adolescent smokers suffer from attention deficits which become worse with years of smoking.  According to the evidence, one out of three young people develop a compulsion to smoke after only three or four cigarettes.  One out of two develop it after only ten to 19 cigarettes.  The measures proposed in this proposed Bill are designed to reduce the likelihood of a young person trying those first few cigarettes and becoming a smoker.</p> <p>  Part 1 of the general scheme contains heads 1 to 7, which are standard and transitional provisions.  Part 2 contains heads 8 to 15.  It sets out some detail on the proposed licensing system for retailers of tobacco products and nicotine inhaling products, including that licences will have to be renewed every year and one licence will be needed for each retail outlet.</p> <p>  Part 3 contains heads 16 to 21.  It deals with restrictions on the sale of tobacco products and nicotine inhaling products.  The proposed measures in this part include: a prohibition on the sale of tobacco products from temporary or moveable premises; with some exceptions, persons under the age of 18 years will no longer be allowed to sell tobacco products or nicotine inhaling products; a prohibition on the sale of nicotine inhaling products to persons under 18 years of age; and a prohibition on the sale of tobacco products at events or locations primarily intended for children.</p> <p>  Part 4 contains heads 22 to 25.  This part gives the enforcement body, the environmental health service of the HSE, additional tools to ensure compliance with tobacco control law.  These tools include compliance notices and prohibition orders and the power to publish the names of retailers that have been convicted of an offence under tobacco control law.</p> <p>  Part 5 contains heads 26 to 31.  It includes the power to issue on-the-spot fines and proposed minimum periods of suspension of a licence for retailers convicted of an offence.</p> <p>  Part 6 contains heads 32 to 39.  This part contains amendments to the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002.  Head 35(1)(b) repeals section 43(2) of the Act and its effect will be the prohibition on the sale of tobacco products through vending machines.</p> <p>  Part 7 contains heads 40 to 43.  It applies the new range of enforcement tools to the 2016 regulations which transposed the tobacco products directive into Irish law.  The tobacco products directive is the primary EU law on tobacco products and nicotine inhaling products.  These heads are likely to be revised when drafting starts as we have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that it may be better to do these changes through secondary law as the tobacco products directive is currently being reviewed and likely to be revised at EU level.</p> <p>  Part 8 contains head 44.  This is a necessary amendment to align the treatment of nicotine inhaling products with tobacco products under criminal justice law.</p> <p>  Part 9 contains heads 45 and 46, which deal with repeals and any consequential amendments.</p> <p>  Again, I thank the committee for giving its time today and we look forward to this opportunity to discuss these proposals.</p></speech>

It is a follow up on a great deal of progressive legislation relating to nicotine over a considerable number of years.</p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to stop or discourage young people getting hooked.  Ms Gordon referred to the statistics that indicate how few cigarettes it takes for children to become hooked.  That is an important measure.  The people, mainly adults, who wish to give up cigarettes and turn to e-cigarettes are in a slightly different category.  Research states there is insufficient evidence to conclude that heat-not-burn tobacco products are less harmful than conventional tobacco cigarettes.  They are all included in this.  Is this being kept under review subject to further evidence?  I refer in particular to the cohort who currently smoke and have changed to heat-not-burn products.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.388" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Claire Gordon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021110300002#B00200"><p>I wish to make a distinction between e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn.  They are two separate kinds of products.  In the context of cessation, e-cigarettes are very popular in Ireland and are used by a lot of people who quit.  I will explain the two ways e-cigarettes can be considered from a risk-benefit analysis, and I will refer to heat-not-burn products afterwards.  This Bill prohibits the sale of e-cigarettes to young people.  For a young person who is not a smoker, there is a risk with e-cigarettes because they are not harmless and there is no benefit to a young person who is not a smoker.  For smokers, as I have mentioned in the briefing material, there is no consensus about the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes but there is general consensus that they are less harmful than tobacco cigarettes.  Let us consider a risk-benefit analysis for a smoker.  In this case, the risk of e-cigarettes is lower than the risk of tobacco cigarettes.  If a person can go on to use e-cigarettes and get off tobacco cigarettes, it is generally agreed that it is better for him or her.  The person will be in better shape as a result.  I have said there is no consensus on this.  There is huge disagreement across the scientific community about e-cigarettes, particularly because it is a new product with multiple types on the market so no one can say what the long-term health effects might be.  From a risk-benefit point of view, from our understanding of the evidence, if a person is a smoker, it is better to go on to e-cigarettes.  That is something we would welcome.</p> <p>  Heat-not-burn products are slightly different.  E-cigarettes contain an e-liquid chemical that has nicotine in it.  Heat-not-burn products contain tobacco.  There are some interesting devices that look like a mobile phone into which what looks like a little cigarette can be inserted, which is then heated.  The reason they are considered a harm reduction product, relative to tobacco cigarettes, is tobacco combustion does not occur.  Much of the harm caused by smoking cigarettes comes from that moment of combustion and the tar.  That does not occur in the heat-not-burn products, although that assertion is up for grabs because some scientific papers argue that with the level of heat achieved is similar to combustion.  The bottom line on heat-not-burn products is that there is not as much evidence for their harm-reduction value as there is for e-cigarettes.  The WHO stated that it is not clear at present whether heat-not-burn products are less harmful than tobacco cigarettes.  E-cigarettes are used in Ireland.  There are no heat-not-burn products for sale in Ireland at present.</p></speech>

The present system was easy on multiples in regard to single applications.

It prohibits the sale of tobacco products or nicotine inhaling products by persons under the age of 18 except for close relatives of the licensee.

I understand why they should be exempt in cases where children work behind the counter of a small shop.  At the same time, is it right that a distinction be made between two sets of families?  This goes back to the time of the smoking ban when it was suggested that family-run businesses should be exempt because they were aware of the risks they were taking.  Ms Gordon does not have to comment on this now, but it is an area worth examining.</p></speech>

We are trying to be proportionate and pragmatic so that certain businesses by virtue of their size do not suffer more than others.  We are fully behind the proposal but it is about being proportionate.  It is certainly an interesting area we could consider again.</p></speech>

The other issue is the subliminal use of advertising through the making of programmes, which I will not name, in Hollywood and elsewhere that are based on the 1940s or 1950s and within which every second person is seen smoking.  That is a subliminal way of avoiding the rules.  The majority of people do not smoke now, so perhaps James Bond will not be seen smoking but an equivalent character or ordinary people from the 1940s and 1950s are portrayed smoking.  I have heard people ask whether it is as a result of the tobacco industry funding such drama series.  Perhaps there is evidence of this, perhaps not.</p><p>It is interesting that three years ago in France there was talk about re-editing old movies such as the James Bond movies to take out the bits where they smoke.  I was quite new in the Department at the time and I thought this was crazy.  Now, three years later and after I have been exposed to the extraordinary damage from that product, this seems like a reasonable proposal.</p><p> There is no doubt about why children start smoking.  Mostly it is because they see adults around them doing it.  Adults must take the responsibility.  The other bit is the glamorisation.  There is no question that seeing role models smoking is a big issue.  Certain organisations have taken this into account.  Netflix, for example, has a policy of watching the dramas to see whether characters are smoking.  Netflix is aware of that and has a commitment to reduce or eliminate smoking by characters.  In the past we have written to RT&Eacute; to discuss that issue also and to draw RT&Eacute;'s attention to characters smoking in certain dramas.</p><p> The advertising of tobacco and cigarettes is essentially eliminated in Ireland, but there is that thing whereby a 12-year-old or a teen sees someone cool having a smoke.  Smoking itself as an action is not particularly enjoyable.  We have the plain packaging, tobacco products are located behind the shop counters where we cannot see them, and the warnings are there, including the horrible pictures of the damage done.  It is easy to see why people took up smoking 20 years ago a 30 years ago as they were not aware of the dangers.  The current generation are aware of the dangers but are still attracted to the product.  We must ask what are the areas that are left that we must try to shut down.</p><p> It is one of those public health tragedies.  If we can stop someone from taking up smoking - and 99% of people have had their first cigarette by the time they are 25 - and if we can stop them from starting in the early teens to early 20s, they will never smoke and they will never have all the illness.  How do we block off what could be perceived as the positive messages about something that is a hideous habit?  It does nothing for a person except to make them sick.  It kills two out of three people that use it.  The only enjoyment that a smoker gets from it is the feeding of the nicotine addiction that is started by the product.  A person does not get a high from smoking such as from other substances.  It is just feeding the addiction that the product causes.  To say there is nothing good about it is an understatement.  It is expensive and dirty and two out of three people who use it will be killed if they use it as instructed by the manufacturer or the retailer.</p><p> It is to try to understand how a product of that nature, that has nothing going for it, is still being taken up by young people all of the time.  Re-editing the James Bond movies so that Sean Connery is not smoking seems like a reasonable idea when one looks at the full travesty of the product.  I am not saying that this is policy, just that it seems like a good idea.</p></speech>

During the lockdown many people may have watched a lot of TV.  I could not believe the number of new shows and series, such as those commissioned in the past five years, where major characters in all of the shows were constantly smoking.  Some of the series were period dramas but many were more up-to-date shows or set in the future.  Touching on Ms Gordon's earlier point, is there a policy on this from the Department and is the Department looking at this?  It might be hard for us to do it in Ireland, but certainly the EU might send out a clear signal that this is a type of advertising.  In fact, it is probably even more dangerous than normal advertising because a major character in a motion picture or a TV series is being associated with cigarettes and it is being glamorised.  These characters are over the age of 18, but we know that teenagers watch these shows, and they see these characters smoking.  Does Ms Gordon see the Department pushing the EU on this and is it something that the EU is looking at?</p></speech>

To be fair, there has been a pandemic and it is reasonable to have focused on that, but it is one of those areas where other public health problems have come to the fore such as obesity and so on.  Another element with smoking is that it occurs more in disadvantaged areas than in more prosperous areas.  There is, for example, a nearly 10% difference between smoking rates in a disadvantaged area and a more affluent area.  There is an element, clearly not within the Department of Health, but outside, that believes the problem is solved and that "we have done that plain packaging, we have put them behind the counters, so what more can we do?"  After that, when one starts doing other things such the Deputy talks about, it becomes exactly like my reaction when I initially came into the Department: "Sure that is ridiculous; people have a right to do what they want; can they not make their own decisions?; why do we need to keep censoring things?; and are people not adults?"  These arguments come up.  In the context of drama, we certainly get the argument that smoking is necessary for the story or it is necessary for the character.  Strangely enough, people find it hard to believe that things like a drama will cause people to go and try smoking.  With children especially, the number one thing with smoking is that it is an adult activity.  Therefore, I am making myself an adult if I have a smoke.  What smoking looks like is the attraction, the actual experience of smoking is fairly rotten.  It is about how it looks.  Essentially it looks cool and the programme- and film- makers use it in dramas to make characters look cool.  I am not aware of any concerted action at EU level to look at those dramas.  Potentially there would be issues of artistic freedom.  We could be pushed back on the old issue, which is that people have been told it is a risk.  The warnings and the plain packaging in Ireland especially are very good.  Looking at a box of cigarettes as they are sold in Ireland now it would be difficult to be attracted by it.  We could certainly come up against the argument that we are going a bit too far and that people should be left to themselves.</p></speech>

I started smoking in my teens and I am off them a year.  I smoked for 40 years.  I had made numerous attempts.  Every 1 January I would make an attempt.  For many years when I played sports I was able to stay off them for a couple of years at a time.  Playing sports gives a person a huge incentive not to smoke.</p> <p>  I go back to the point made by Ms Gordon in her introduction about de-normalising smoking and protecting young people.  This is key to the Bill.  We support this Bill and we have a couple of ideas we would like to see incorporated to make it as strong as possible.  Once a person starts smoking as a teenager or a young person, the consequences include trying to give it up.  It is a battle for the rest of that person's life.</p> <p>  With regard to motion pictures and television shows, I often sat down at night and saw somebody on the television light up a cigarette and I instantly had an urge to smoke even though I am off them now.  I remember when I did smoke, that feeling would often lead me to have a cigarette.  My wife hates cigarettes.  Her father, God rest his soul, passed away from lung cancer.  She always hated it.  As a student she worked as a barmaid and she would hate coming home at night with the smell of cigarettes on her clothes.  I never smoked in our house and I would be out the back.  I would see someone on TV smoking and I would end up throwing on the kettle, making a cup of tea and going out the back to have a cigarette.  Thankfully, my 12 year-old and 15 year-old daughters never saw me smoking because I was always conscious of that.</p><p>However, many people, including me, did not know the consequences of cigarettes as they were growing up.  We know now and we have to protect our children to the best of our ability.  That is why this Bill includes restrictions on e-cigarettes for those under 18.  I certainly support that.  </p><p> I will also touch on advertising, which was discussed earlier.  When passing an e-cigarette shop or any other shop that sells e-cigarettes, people will see posters promoting them and their different flavours.  The flavours are a key issue.  We saw this issue years ago in respect of alcopops in the drink industry.  E-cigarettes now come in different sweet flavours, including bubblegum and candy.  These appeal to a younger audience.  These companies are trying to get young people onto the candy flavours to start with.  People, especially adults, may want to have an e-cigarette because, as the witnesses have said, there may be a benefit to using e-cigarettes instead of smoking as regards risk reduction.  It may not be completely risk free, but the risk is certainly lower than for cigarettes.  Should they then be limited to tobacco flavours only to avoid covering up what the product is?  The witnesses touched on advertising earlier.  Could there be a complete ban on e-cigarette advertising as is the case for cigarettes?  There is also the issue of flavoured products.  </p><p> My colleague mentioned earlier the work the Irish Heart Foundation is doing.  Like the Department, the foundation is looking at the travesty of smoking and the carnage that results from it.  Will the witnesses touch on that?</p></speech>

The global percentage of smokers who successfully quit is less than 10%.  Our year-on-year data collected for Healthy Ireland tells the same story.  Some 60% to 70% of smokers want to quit.  Approximately half, or 50%, give it a go and approximately 10% succeed.  I understand that there is a view that people need to just put in more effort.  That is not the case.  The younger people start smoking, the more addicted they will be.  The brain chemistry changes.  Their brain actually changes when they get a hit from a cigarette, which begins that gnawing addiction.  Addiction is interesting.  A person can, for example, smoke one cigarette every month or two months.  People think that such people can take it or leave it but that is considered addiction.  A person does not to smoke 80 a day to be addicted.  There is a change in the brain chemistry.  A person who has been a smoker for a few years may begin to try to fight it but I have seen the intensity compared to heroin addiction with regard to how difficult it is to quit.  Different people have different brain chemistry.  It works in different ways.  However, one of the ways it can be made more difficult to quit, by which I mean extremely psychologically and biologically stressful, is to start young.  The younger people are when they start, the more likely it is that their brain will take that twist, leaving them stuck with a nicotine addiction.</p> <p>  The Deputy discussed e-cigarette flavours.  As I said earlier, we have to think about two cohorts.  One is, of course, the younger people.  There is no benefit for them in e-cigarettes, which is why we are banning them for those under 18.  However, we also have to think about smokers who have tried patches, gum and, perhaps, medication from their GP and who are now trying e-cigarettes.  In striking that balance, some of those flavours may be useful.  I am not saying that all flavours are necessary.  We certainly have not come to any conclusion on the flavours.  We will probably be led by the EU on this issue because the governing law on e-cigarettes in Ireland at the moment is EU law.  </p> <p>  We have to tread carefully because, while we absolutely do not want young people vaping, we do not want to take away flavours if flavours are one of the reasons a person would choose e-cigarettes over tobacco cigarettes.  One has to look at the product from the point of view of younger people, and banning it for them is clearly correct, but we cannot forget about smokers.  There has been a great deal of attention on younger people and how much they vape but people are forgetting about heavy smokers and people who have been smokers for 30 years, for whom the patches and the gum do not work and who are not going to their GP.  They have voted with their feet to a certain extent because they are using e-cigarettes instead of tobacco cigarettes.  Some 42% of smokers in Ireland in 2019 used e-cigarettes to try to quit.  We have to strike that balance.  I am not coming to any conclusion on the flavours.</p></speech>

That would introduce regulation.  At the moment, a person who is under 18 can go into a shop and buy bubblegum flavoured e-cigarettes.  This law, which we support, will ban e-cigarettes for those under 18.  However, an 18-year-old or a 19-year-old will still be able to buy bubblegum or candy flavoured e-cigarettes.  That is not right.  Perhaps prescriptions should be considered.  I have friends who are off cigarettes and who are successfully using e-cigarettes instead so I acknowledge what Ms Gordon is saying.  I know people who have said that has made a profound difference in their lives.  That is welcome but the problem is that we now see more young people using e-cigarettes.  Unfortunately, we are also seeing more young people using cigarettes again.  A multifaceted approach is needed.  We should certainly highlight in Europe how many people smoke cigarettes in television programmes and films relative to the number of people who smoke.  There should be some kind of restriction on that.  We should also make flavours available by prescription only so that those who need them and who are over 18 can get them while young people are protected.  That would accomplish what the Department is trying to do, which is to support people who are in addiction while preventing young people from getting on nicotine.  I was out with my wife at the weekend.  Every time I have a drink, I feel I want a cigarette because, growing up, that is the way my life was.  I still have pangs and want to smoke.  I am very lucky - touch wood - but many others out there are not.  If we can prevent what happened to me and many other people of my generation happening again, we will support that.  I hope the witnesses can take that on board.</p></speech>

This is important legislation, which is quite complex.  One of the reasons it is complex is that, similar to other issues we will deal with in the committee in the near future, there is not a great deal of relevant research, particularly on vaping.  Does that pose a particular challenge in progressing legislation in this area or locking things in now?  Do the witnesses envisage the lack of long-term research in this area being an issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.416" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Claire Gordon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021110300002#D00500"><p>The lack of research on the long-term effects is a feature of the fact that these are a new product.  There is no way around that.  We cannot go forward.  I would not say there is a lack of research.  There is significant focus on this at the WHO level.  Across the globe, there are at least three scientific papers on different aspects of the issue every week.</p><p>From our point of view, the Minister for Health asked the Health Research Board to examine three areas of e-cigarettes in 2019 and published a paper in October 2020.  I wish I had brought in the paper on the harms and benefits because it is about 400 pages, but it is too much research.  The Health Research Board came to some conclusions.  It was asked to look at three areas on e-cigarettes.</p><p> The first was whether they were useful as an aid to smoking cessation.  It concluded that e-cigarettes were as useful or as effective as nicotine replacement therapies, such as patches, nicotine gum and those sorts of items.</p><p> The second area that they looked at was whether the use of e-cigarettes appeared to lead to smoking tobacco products by adolescents.  The Health Research Board found an association between adolescents who use e-cigarettes and subsequent smoking.</p><p> The third area looked at was that the board did a map of what might be called the harms or benefits, or both, of e-cigarettes.  That is the 500-page document.  This examines matters at a chemical level and the effect of the vapes on one&rsquo;s cells and such matters.  The essential conclusion was that it definitely appears that from all the research examined - I forget how many research papers it looked at but it was probably 150 - there is evidence that e-cigarettes are less harmful than tobacco cigarettes.  There is also evidence that e-cigarettes are not harmless.  The final point that the board made, which returns to the Deputy&rsquo;s point, was that more research is needed.</p><p> We are at a point in history, unfortunately, where e-cigarettes as a product are relatively new - I believe they were introduced in 2005 or 2007 - but it is also the case that the e-cigarettes that came on the market at that time bear little resemblance to the e-cigarettes that are around now and there are new products coming on stream all the time.  As I was saying earlier about the heat-not-burn products, weird hybrid products are appearing.  They are e-cigarettes in the sense that it is a liquid that is vaped but there is also a capacity for tobacco to be used in those products.  Much of the research is trying to keep up with the technology, no more than mobile phones.  There are some very attractive, sleek, e-cigarette products out there and these are being developed all of the time and made more beautiful in appearance, for want of a better term.  Also, I cannot remember how many ingredients are in the average e-liquid but there are quite a few.  As has already been mentioned, the flavours are out there.  To try to have solid research on all of those aspects is very difficult because the minute the research is done another product is coming out in Japan or somewhere else.  Then, exactly as the Deputy has said, it is a question of the point at which we can say we know what the long-term effects are.</p></speech>

I was just wondering if the newness of the product is a particular challenge.  Does the Department of Health feel that this legislation will be a suitable framework as the technology moves faster than we can perhaps keep up with?  Will we be able to add to it as new products come online?</p></speech>

The key measure in it with regard to e-cigarettes is the banning of their sale to under-18s.  It will be illegal to sell any of these products to a person who is under 18.  The number one effort is to remove from the table the ability of those under 18 to buy the product legally.</p> <p>  The licensing system is another matter.  At the moment one does not need to register or to have a licence to sell e-cigarettes.  We are going to have a full licensing system whereby one has to fill out a form to get a licence every year.  This will involve showing that one is a true and fit person, and there will be a fee.  The impact of licensing e-cigarette retailing can be seen in data from Pennsylvania.  When a licence was introduced there, the use of e-cigarettes among adolescents went down.  One of the features of introducing licences, and it is the same for tobacco cigarettes, is that some people get out of the business because it is no longer profitable.  If the licence is of a sufficiently high price, if there is much paperwork and if certain obligations have to be met, if it was an-----</p></speech>

I am very interested in the relationship between the density of retail outlets in Ireland and smoking prevalence and use of vaping products.  Does the Department envisage that if we introduce a licensing fee, the density of retail units will naturally fall?  Will there be any mechanism for us to be able to further control the density subsequently?  I am thinking specifically around schools, perhaps.  There may still be a very high density in urban areas but not in rural areas.  Are there any other kinds of mechanisms around density that the Department thinks are worth considering?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.421" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Claire Gordon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021110300002#E00500"><p>The Deputy is completely correct.  There is evidence that the density of retailers only impacts on the initiation of children.  In other words, the more shops that sell cigarettes around me, the more likely I am to start smoking.  The other unfortunate consequence is that the more outlets there are around me, the more likely I am to fail in my attempts to quit.  Essentially, I am being presented with it all of the time so it is really difficult.  As the previous speaker was saying, every time one sees it, the urge comes back.</p> <p>  With the current registration system, we know that at a certain point somebody registered to sell cigarettes but we do not know what happened after that.  Under the current system, one registers once, one pays a one-off fee and one has no obligation to communicate with the HSE from then on.  When our new licensing system comes in, one will get a licence for a year, which then will have to be renewed.  For the first time, we will know exactly who is selling cigarettes and e-cigarettes, and where.  We will have proper data on where the outlets are.  At that stage, and I am not saying that this is a proposal from us, we will at least understand the density of retailers.  There is evidence that the density of retailers has an impact on consumption.  That is something that might be looked at in the future.  For now, we need to know who and where.  There is no system for the retailing of e-cigarettes or nicotine inhaling products under the current system but there is a registration system for tobacco products.  That was a one-off fee and one registered once.  Essentially, we do not know whether some of the people who registered are still selling.</p></speech>

I am aware that we do not have advertising on TV or radio but a similar phenomenon has come up in childhood obesity, in cigarettes and in alcohol in respect of the density of advertising and its proximity to particular areas like schools and sports facilities.  Does the Department envisage that this will be an important part of the legislation?</p></speech>

This general scheme was submitted in October 2019.  It is hard to keep track of years since the pandemic.  Following the submission of the general scheme, the new programme for Government came in and one of its recommendations is the curbing the advertising of nicotine inhaling products near schools, public transport and cinemas.  This is a similar provision to the one that is in the Public Health (Alcohol) Act.  That is clearly in the programme for Government and is something that we would go to the Government on in order that we can include it in the scheme.</p> <p>  The other very good provision in the general scheme is the ban on the sale of tobacco products in places or at events which are designed for children.  We do not have any of the detail of that provision right now - for example, with regard to what would constitute a place for children or a children&rsquo;s event - but it will definitely be a very powerful provision if the Office of the Attorney General drafts it in the way that we hope, which would involve keeping it fairly wide.  Essentially, you are not naming out.</p><p>This is one of those provisions whereby it is quite difficult to set out in law exactly what events or places you are talking about, but anyone would know them if they saw them.  For example, we would all know that a Peppa Pig concert would be directed primarily at children, so that would be an event at which we would not want someone selling cigarettes.</p><p> Deputy Hourigan referred to the density of retail outlets.  This is another way to address that issue and make sure that a child can go about his or her daily life without being exposed to the sale of cigarettes.  Somebody mentioned denormalisation earlier.  That is the issue for us when we look at the damage.  This is a normal consumer product.  That is what is so odd about tobacco and cigarettes.  As a legacy, for historical reasons, there is a product for sale beside the chewing gum and the newspapers that will literally kill two out of three people who use it.  Historically, fair enough, it was there as a consumer product, but now, when we know what we know, it is always a matter of saying this is not an ordinary consumer product.  It kills, I think, 7.6 million people a year and, because our population is increasing across the globe, yes, the proportion of people who smoke is going down, but the actual number of people who smoke is going up.  There is a huge level of disease and death to come, and that is from just a consumer product.  That is what it is.  It is sold in shops, it is legal to buy it and there is nothing going for it except that it will kill you if you keep using it.  We are trying to find ways-----</p></speech>

I do not know if I have enough time, but I have one question that is kind of related to this.  I know that there are 13,000 registered tobacco retailers right now and that there were only 61 convictions in the six-year period between 2014 and 2019.  How important is it to see applied regulation and that the Revenue Commissioners and nobody else would be responsible for collecting this licence fee?</p></speech>

The register I have just slagged off, whereby you pay the one amount and register, is run by the environmental health service of the HSE.  That is the enforcement body.  It does food law, alcohol law and tobacco control law and has been doing them for years.  We presume, therefore, that that service will hold the licensing system and the ICT relating to it, and that in the context of the fees paid by any tobacco and cigarette retailer, some of that money might go towards tobacco control law enforcement.  I know it is a tricky business to get hypothecation of money but we might give it a go anyway.  That is one part of the enforcement.</p> <p>  As for the other one, Deputy Hourigan might have noticed in the general scheme that we are seeking to legislate for minimum suspension periods.  In other words, if an offence is committed, we are setting out in law that a licence should be suspended for a minimum period of, I think, two to seven days for a low-grade offence and seven to 30 days for a high-grade offence.  One of the reasons for that is that it is not always the case that tobacco control offences are treated very seriously in terms of suspensions of registration given out by courts.  There are examples in the past whereby someone's registration was suspended for one hour, so the response to the offence that was committed was that the retailer could not sell cigarettes for an hour.  There was one suspension for a day and another for two days.  I can understand this in one sense because the harm that comes from breaching tobacco control law requirements is not so obvious.  It is not as obvious as that relating to assault or burglary.  It is not clear because this is strange law in the sense that tobacco control law regulates people who sell tobacco, but the ultimate objective is the smoker, so the people being regulated are not the people who are affected the most.</p> <p>  For us, it is a sin to sell cigarettes to a person under 18 because we understand what the consequences of that will be, including early addiction and a lifetime of illness.  However, a person on the street might say, "Sure, he sold cigarettes and did not ask the customer whether he or she was over or under 18, but is it not the buyer or consumer who should make the decision?"  It is tricky to communicate to people out there that these are serious offences.  That is why we have tried in the general scheme to provide that the licence will have to be suspended for a minimum period of two days, even if the offence is considered light because while the offence itself, on the face of it, may not look that serious, the issue is the consequences of that - for example, for the consumer who is under 18 and who was sold cigarettes.  It is a tricky one because, obviously, the average person would clearly recognise assault, burglary, etc.  Those are terrible offences and of course a penalty should apply to them, whereas something like this seems almost like an administrative error in what the person has done, and to read into that the consequences is not always easy for the courts.  We are trying to push through that public health message that, in and of itself, the fact that a retailer did not have the sign up is not a big deal but it is a big deal overall in the context of what we are trying to do denormalise this and to protect children.  Sorry.  That was too long an answer.</p></speech>

Okay.</p> <p>  While we are waiting, I will come in with a couple of questions.  In the scoping note we got, one of the issues and one of the worrying trends is that, for the first time in 25 years, smoking among young people between the ages of 15 and 16, a key age period for smoking initiation, has increased.  When was this research carried out?  Did this happen last year?</p></speech>

Is it a one-off?  Are there plans for more research on this?  It is worrying that this is happening after 25 years.  Are there particular reasons this has happened at this particular time?  During the pandemic people have been told they are going to die, so long-term life considerations go out the window for many people, but for young people aged 15 or 16, I presume there are probably different triggers.  Why is this happening in those years?  Is it a trend right across the world or is it just in Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.433" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Claire Gordon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021110300002#G00100"><p>It is definitely a trend throughout the world that the fantastic decreases that were happening in the number of people smoking have stalled.  I think that happened around 2007.  A total of 50% of persons under the age of 18 smoked at certain periods in the 1970s and 1980s and that figure was falling steadily, but there was a stall.  There is no single answer as to why that has happened and we would not jump to conclusions based on one year.  We cannot say whether it is a trend or a blip.  Nevertheless, it is definitely the case that when it initially became clear, following new information, how bad cigarettes were for people, steep decreases happened.  Now, it is almost as though people feel that problem has been solved and there is nothing to worry about anymore.  The media do not necessarily talk about it as much and there is not as much panic about it, for want of a better word.  Perhaps the younger generations have just missed that information older people had whereby all these revelations were coming out about the new diseases and harms coming from smoking.</p> <p>  The pandemic was interesting in the impact it had on smokers.  This is a classic example of how the tobacco industry operates.  During the pandemic, the Minister for Health had to issue press releases making clear that smoking did not protect people from Covid-19.  Some data suggested there were fewer smokers in hospital with Covid-19 than there were in the general population.  It appeared smokers were less likely to become ill from Covid-19.  As we can imagine, those data were exploited by the industry.  The message going around was that one of the ways to protect from Covid-19 was to smoke, whereas exactly the opposite is the case.  The data show a person is more likely to have serious illness from Covid-19 if he or she smokes.  Trends or events always occur that can be exploited by the industry, and the person, who might be 15 or 16 years old, is left in the middle.  Who are they to believe?</p> <p>  I do not have any explanation for why the trend has changed.  I would imagine it is more of a stall than an increase, although there was definitely an increase in the period the Chairman mentioned.  Throughout the world in developed countries, the decrease has definitely stalled.  Obviously, the ideal objective in all countries is a figure of 0% for under-18s who are smokers.  It is about how to get there and that is part of what the provisions in the Bill are about.  Much of the messaging has been shut down and we are just trying to shut down the others.  We do not know which factor causes a 15 or 16-year-old to smoke.  Part of being that age is we think we are invincible.  We do not have that fear about our health or health harms.  We believe that stuff happens to someone else, years from now, and it is nothing to do with us.  Unfortunately, it is true to a large extent that someone who smokes at 15 or 16 is not going to pay for it for perhaps 30 years.  There is some rationale in that, but what young people do not realise - this is the tragedy of smoking - is they are addicts.  They may smoke, the addiction may be developing and they may think they are smoking voluntarily.  They just do not realise they have started what could be a lifetime addiction.</p> <p>  That was a long answer, but there is no one reason for the stall.  We are trying to do exactly what the Chairman identified.  The main steps have been taken, such as putting cigarettes behind cabinets and in plain packaging, and now we are trying to shut down the other messaging and the other exposures, such as selling them in shops or at festival stalls.  We are trying to shut that down.  We do not want them to be sold in temporary or moveable premises.  Vending machines are another example.  The data suggest it is easier for persons under the age of 18 to access cigarettes from vending machines than over the counter.  The big steps have been taken and we are trying to shut down smaller channels or smaller messaging to people of that age group.  We hope that, with a suite of measures, we will hit on the right ones for individuals and get that number decreasing again.</p></speech>

As for older ages, every year, including in the most recent budget, the price of tobacco and other nicotine products has been increased.  Many people make the argument that this will only make people who have an addiction try to get the products somewhere else.  Every time the price of cigarettes is increased, people are further encouraged to go elsewhere.  We are driving them into the black market and the dodgy products, where there is no regulation and we do not know what people are smoking.  That is the downside of that approach.  Similarly, there is no evidence that the latest legislation, relating to graphic pictures on the products, is working on people.  There was evidence at one stage that some young women smoked because they believed it was linked to losing weight and so on.</p></speech>

Deputy Gould spoke about the smell of the product on a person's clothes and breath.  There is also the impact it has on health but that seems to be secondary for many young people who start smoking.  I am not convinced by the idea of censoring images of people smoking in old films and so on.  On some of the chat shows from years ago, everyone was smoking.  I grew up during that period, but that looks really odd to me when I see it now.  I ask myself what these people were doing.  It is a bit like people who used to drink and drive; it is not acceptable to society now.  At one stage, we almost turned people who smoked into pariahs in that we put them outside the pub or the social areas, but there was a sort of bounce-back and people would talk about how all the craic was outside.  We are going through cycles in that regard but my main worry regarding the research relates to why more people are trying it.  I do not think the price increases work, although they are a good earner for the State that can be reinvested.</p></speech>

There is a new challenge coming now in the form of the alternatives to smoking.  As was noted, they might be a benefit to those who have smoked and want to stop, but they could also be a gateway drug for those who have not started to smoke but might fancy it.  I was once told that when someone becomes addicted, he or she will need to undergo a long programme to quit.  That is not true at all.  It is possible to stop instantly and walk away from it, although there is no doubt it has weight implications.  We need to counter the argument the Chairman made correctly.  Some women believe smoking is an alternative way of controlling weight, and while it does have an effect on weight, it is also bad.  We need to bring those two arguments together in a way that is receptive to people who are looking at it from that point of view.</p><p>Small children, the 10-year-olds to 12-year-olds, who start smoking are influenced by the cinema and television.  The hero who smokes casually is part and parcel of that.  I refer to Clint Eastwood with the chewed-off cigar at one side of his mouth and so on.  That was a big influence in years gone by, before the witnesses were born.  The damage to health must also be emphasised much more in order to have a positive impact on that particular generation.  We need to be very clear in our minds about that.</p><p> The next thing to consider is the alternatives.  We discussed e-cigarettes and what goes with them.  I cannot understand how products with tobacco content can represent an improvement because they continue the use of tobacco.  The argument can be made that such products involve a reduction in the amount of tobacco and nicotine heated or taken in, whatever way one wishes to describe it, but it still continues the hazardous habit of smoking, albeit by an alternative means.  I know the science is still out on this.  There is an argument taking place at present.  That argument needs to come to fruition and reach a conclusion at the earliest possible date.  The advice should err on the side of safety because, if it comes to pass that the alternatives lead back to smoking again, there is no advantage for anybody, including the scientists.</p><p> I will raise an issue that came up during the Covid pandemic.  It appears that there was increased consumption of tobacco by way of home-rolled cigarettes.  Two issues arise from that.  I refer to the size of the pack in which loose tobacco is sold and made available in sales outlets and to the illegal importation of tobacco, which is a different matter but which also needs to be controlled.  Is the Department satisfied that the legislation as proposed will deal adequately with the reintroduction to nicotine, tobacco and smoking by that route, the home-rolled method?  From indications we are seeing, it also appears that the increase among the younger age cohort has been fairly substantial.  I regard that as worrying.  I have put questions down on this already.  Does the Bill contain sufficient obstructions and restrictions to discourage the return to smoking in that way?  That is my first question.</p></speech>

There is evidence that this idea is completely untrue and that whether younger women smoke or not does not impact on their weight.  This idea has been exploited by the industry, which sells products like Virginia Slims in the US.  These are long, slim cigarettes.  The boxes are also slim.  We have banned those kind of fancy boxes.  The industry is fantastic at targeting particular cohorts.  It probably understands why people smoke and how to appeal to them better than we, or public health officials in general, do.  There are some horrifying advertisements from the 1970s suggesting that women can show they have become independent by being a smoker.  There is a brilliant advertisement with the slogan "You've come a long way, baby", which shows a woman having a smoke.  Smoking is supposed to be a sign of her liberation.  I have seen evidence that smoking has literally no impact on weight.  Young women who are smoking to manage their weight should know it has no impact on their weight at all.  I just want to get that idea, which is beloved by the tobacco industry, out of the way.</p> <p>  I was asked whether I think the measures in the proposed Bill are sufficient to deal with illegal importation.  I will hand over to Ms Brophy on that.  We might talk a little bit about the EU track-and-trace system, which is designed to reduce the amount of illicit cigarettes in circulation.  At the moment, 15% of the market comprises illicit cigarettes.  Revenue has estimated that 15% of cigarettes sold are illicit.  That is not a Department of Health estimate but that of the Revenue Commissioners, but we are involved because of this EU-wide system which we hope will reduce that figure.</p></speech>

Since 2019, every tobacco product, whether cigarette or rolling tobacco, has a unique identifier on it.  This can be tracked all the way through the supply chain.  This comes under the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the protocol on illicit tobacco.  It is an EU response to the issue of illicit tobacco.  We have worked with the Revenue Commissioners.  This comes under the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety, DG SANTE, in the EU.  Its overall objective is to make sure that each tobacco product leaving a manufacturer can be tracked all the way through the supply chain to the retailer.  It could be argued that what we are doing by introducing a licensing system is the next step in this process.  It will bring in greater controls which will lead to better and more comprehensive enforcement.  Revenue would say that it is becoming more successful in targeting the smuggling of tobacco products.  It has the figures to back that up.  The traceability and security of this system is another tool to help us deal with the issue of illicit tobacco.  The World Health Organization would still say that raising taxes on tobacco is one of the most effective and efficient ways to reduce tobacco consumption.</p></speech>

As a result, a lot of this is estimated.  There is no real way to tell.  I am sure that Revenue has its own methodologies but the figure was definitely lower than 15% at a certain point and is now increasing.  From our perspective, there is an argument that the price cannot be increased too much or people will go to the illicit market.  As Ms Brophy said, there is evidence that increasing the price is an effective way to make people decide to quit.  The more expensive it becomes, the more impetus there is for a smoker to think about quitting.  That is one of the most powerful tools across the globe.  It is not just an Irish concept.  Raising prices is the best way to reduce harm.  It is absolutely the case that persons on lower incomes are affected more by this measure but persons on lower incomes are also those carrying more of the burden of disease from tobacco.  When people say that those who are experiencing hard times should be left with their smoke because it is the only treat they have, they are essentially saying that it is okay to leave that person to illness and death.  That is what they are saying.  I understand perfectly why that comment is made but, from our point of view, we have seen the devastation smoking causes.  The WHO says that 14% of cases of Alzheimer's disease across the world are caused by tobacco.  I am referring to dementia.</p><p>The width of disease that comes from this product is unbelievable.  Every system in the body - reproductive, respiratory, cardiovascular, you name it - is affected.  When I hear it said that it is not fair on people on lower incomes, I think this is the only way to help those on lower incomes because illness causes poverty and poverty causes illness.  It is to try to get the push over-----</p></speech>

There is another issue.  How do we inform people who, for instance, wish to lose weight and, rightly or wrongly, will rely on smoking as a means of quelling their appetite at particular times of the day?  They may be right or wrong.  What other product that is medically safe can be offered to those people who, rightly or wrongly, believe smoking kills their appetite for food?  Even though they know smoking is bad for them, they still have to resort to it because they wish to control their weight.</p></speech>

All we can do is to say that cigarettes are not the answer to anything.

I refer to the size of cigarette cartons.  It has been suggested that cartons containing more than 20 cigarettes are another means of offloading considerable amounts into the marketplace that otherwise would not be as readily available to potential consumers.  Is legislation needed to deal with that issue?  The Bill does not address it.  Can our guests take that issue on board and consider bringing forward such legislation?</p></speech>

At the moment, there is no evidence that more cigarettes being in a box leads to an increase in consumption.  Under the WHO framework convention on tobacco control, FCTC, a ban on selling boxes of cigarettes with fewer than 20 cigarettes is recommended, and we certainly have that ban in the law here.  As set out in the convention on tobacco control, if cigarettes are sold in smaller boxes, they become more affordable for minors.  Many smokers began by buying a single cigarette over the counter.  That was the way it used to work.  When you were a kid, you could afford to buy one cigarette with your pocket money.  In 2002 we brought in a ban on boxes with fewer than 20 cigarettes.  There must be a minimum of 20 cigarettes in a box.  Right now in 2021, there is insufficient evidence that boxes with more than 20 cigarettes cause an increase in consumption.  The issue was considered in an Australian study earlier this year which stated that there is a dearth of evidence that having more cigarettes in a box causes the person to smoke more.   That is not to say that evidence will not be found in the future but, for now, we do not have a basis on which to examine that issue.  We have a basis in respect of boxes with fewer than 20 cigarettes because they make it more affordable for minors.  That is well known and it has been stated in the FCTC.  The WHO understands that to be an issue.  However, there is no evidence at this stage that boxes with more than 20 cigarettes are an issue.</p></speech>

My apologies for the delay in joining the meeting.  To follow up on Deputy Durkan's remarks relating to packets of cigarettes, there is legislation stating that cigarettes may not be sold in packets of fewer than 20 but there is no law in respect of an upper limit.  For instance, 30% of cigarette packets sold now contain more than 20 cigarettes.  Those are the figures I have received.  Is it not time to consider stipulating that cigarettes only be sold in packets of 20?  If a person who normally smokes a packet of cigarettes a day buys a packet of 27, 28 or 25 cigarettes, is he or she not likely to smoke 25 or 27 cigarettes instead of smoking 20?</p> <p>  Finland will not allow cigarettes to be imported unless the health warning is in Finnish and Swedish.  During the lockdown, the sale of tobacco in this country increased by approximately &euro;150 million in 12 months, which gives an indication of the amount of product that is coming in.  As people were not able to travel abroad during the lockdown, they were not able to bring in cigarettes.  There is no restriction in real terms in the context of health warnings on cigarettes that are brought into the country.  The health warning may be in English and Spanish, for example.  Why can we not legislate to stipulate that all cigarette packets must have a warning in English and in Irish?</p> <p>  Another issue is the number of cigarettes people are allowed to bring in.  The number is far higher here than in other European countries, such as Sweden and Finland, for example.</p></speech>

At the moment, there is no evidence on the matter.  I understand what the Deputy is saying.  Intuitively, it sounds correct, but the evidence is not there to support it.  There is not enough evidence to justify a prohibition on packets of more than 20 cigarettes.  An Australian paper published in April or August 2021 stated there is a dearth of evidence on this issue.  The measures in tobacco control are evidence based because, in effect, we are regulating and preventing people from going about their normal business and making a living.  Irrespective of what we think of the product, people are entitled to import, manufacture and sell tobacco products.  These products are not illegal.  For every measure we take and every measure in the Bill, we need evidence that shows that if we do this, it will reduce consumption.  That evidence is not currently available in the context of packets with more than 20 cigarettes.  If such evidence becomes available, it is definitely something at which we will look, but there is no evidence currently available to state that it has an impact.</p></speech>

If there are 27 cigarettes in a packet, they are costing the purchaser less per cigarette compared with a packet of 20 cigarettes.  By allowing there to be packets with more than 20 cigarettes, are we not encouraging people to smoke 10%, 15% or 20% more than the number they might smoke if we brought in a regulation stipulating that cigarettes only be sold in packets of 20?</p></speech>

The aspect relating to cost is absolutely something that we address.  We are lucky that the Minister for Finance agrees to this.  Each year, the Minister for Health writes to the Minister for Finance and seeks an increase in the excise duty on cigarettes and other tobacco products.  I refer to cigarettes being purchased more cheaply.</p><p>The evidence-based way to address that is to increase the price.  As I said, there is no evidence currently that the bigger the box, the more people will smoke, but there is evidence that the more you increase the price of cigarettes, the more people decide to get off them.  If evidence were to emerge showing that we could justify a measure to ban boxes of more than 20 cigarettes, that is absolutely something that the Minister of Health would look at, but when the evidence is not there, we do not have a reason to act.  Where we do have a reason to act is in respect of the price, which we do every year.  We are lucky that every year in the budget, prices are continually increased.  Irrespective of what manufacturers do to try to make someone think that they are getting a bargain or whatever, in Ireland we relentlessly and consistently increase the price of tobacco products every year.  That is the way to address that.</p><p> On the other issue of the number of cigarettes a person can bring into the country, was the Deputy referring to the personal quota permitted when a person is travelling?</p></speech>

The figure I provided related to the increase in the sale of tobacco products from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. I do not have the exact figure here, but there was an increase in sales of over 150 million.  It is being put down to the fact that people were not able to travel, therefore, less product was bring brought into the country by individuals.</p></speech>

First of all, and it is kind of a blunt statement, but from a public health perspective, the cigarettes that have warnings on them in English will kill you just as much as the cigarettes that do not.  So, in one sense, if a flood of tobacco products came into Ireland through personal use that did not have the warnings on them or did not have the warnings on them in a language that was understandable, it would definitely undercut and undermine what we are trying to do in terms of the messaging.  However, there is no particular merit in cigarettes that have those warnings, in the sense that they will kill you just as much.  As I understand it, decisions are made at EU level about personal quotas for bringing cigarettes into the country.</p></speech>

There is a huge price differential within the EU on the cost of cigarettes.  People can get them a lot cheaper in other countries and bring them into Ireland.  Under an EU directive, the maximum number of cigarettes that can be brought in is 800 per person.  I know that the Finnish have done something different on this.</p></speech>

At EU level they are also looking at a review of the tobacco products tax directive.  We are certainly pushing for them to look at the differentials in prices from a public health perspective.  We will continue to push that on regardless.</p></speech>

If you want to bring in a product that contains a warning that is only in English or Spanish, for example, you will not be allowed to bring it in.  They have limited the number of cigarettes that can be brought in to 200 per person.</p> <p>  The figures for the 12-month period in 2020 are interesting as they demonstrate how the sale of products in this country increased by over 150 million, which gives a clear indication of the amount of product that is coming in that is not on the record, as such.  It is the first indication that we have got as to the extent of those goods coming in.  </p></speech>

Why do people bring the products in?  They do so because they are cheaper elsewhere.  In that sense, where is the EU harmonisation on the issue to make it so that it is not worth your while bringing products in?  Everybody knows somebody who asks them to bring them back a carton of cigarettes when they go on holiday.  That is the driver for it.  At an EU level, there is such a push for harmonisation on so many issues, and that is one issue that definitely needs to be harmonised to balance it out.  Essentially, when we are talking about Finland, what we are wondering is how they got away with it, because it is definitely something that is harmonised at EU level.  We are all supposed to act the same way, so we are trying to find out how they got away with it exactly.</p></speech>

I fully understand that for someone who is a smoker, it is not easy to come off cigarettes.  It is such a challenge for anyone and we must acknowledge that.  The question is whether there are sufficient supports in place for people who want to stop smoking for their own health.  I am not sure whether there are enough supports in place currently.  Perhaps that is something that we should also be reviewing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.468" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021110300002#K01100"><p>I agree.  I think we all have evidence and know of people who have been told that they will lose limbs because of smoking and they have lost limbs.  I know of one man who lost two limbs because of his smoking habit, which eventually killed him.  It is very easy for us to tell people to give the cigarettes up.  The man tried everything and he could not give them up.  It would not have been unusual when I was growing up to know people smoked 40 or 50 cigarettes a day.  How would anyone be able to afford that in today's world?  There is a cost implication and it does impact on families.  There is also the issue of passive smoking, and so on.  There are many good reasons for quitting that we need to be getting out there.  I think the Deputy is right about the provision of additional supports.  Perhaps we can come up with ideas about that.</p> <p>  On the legislation and some of the issues that have been raised, I think the pandemic has brought important information to light because people were not travelling, so we will have a better idea of what products were coming in.  On would imagine that the fact that people were not congregating should have made it more difficult for them to get the black market cigarettes but, again, people probably have contacts in local areas.  People are not just going into Moore Street or the traditional areas to buy them.  In every community there is someone who is involved in the trade, whether they are selling them in a shop or door to door.  All of that is still going on.  However, it should have been more difficult for people to buy them during the pandemic.  We know that certainly at the start of the pandemic, people were drinking more .  Perhaps as people were working from home they were smoking more.  Deputy Gould spoke about the social aspect of smoking.  That was not going on during the first part of the pandemic, as pubs and restaurants were closed.  It might have been easier for people to try to give up cigarettes in that period.</p> <p>  Has Deputy Burke finished?</p></speech>

Going back to the point raised by Deputy Burke, an advertising technique that is used is to offer 10% extra free.  That technique is used in all products, from breakfast cereals to soap powders, or anything that consumers want.  It is clearly an area that needs to be addressed, whether it is in relation to how the products are sold in the retail outlets or the way they are being brought into the country.  I could never understand why people would want to bring half a tonne of tobacco products into the country at one time.  I could never work out the logic of that.</p><p>People look at things differently.  I would strongly recommend that the Department look at that and see to what extent it can address it, if it is not already addressed in the proposals.</p><p> The other issue relates to habit forming, if I might go back to that again.  Any product that recreates the habit is a threat to the whole programme and a danger.  I speak as a person who has given up smoking, which I enjoyed immensely, incidentally.  There is no good saying I did not.  If I was driving a long journey late at night, as people in this business must do from time to time, from Donegal or Cahersiveen to Dublin, smoking was a refuge and helped keep me alert.  We need to look at the medical alternatives in terms of products that will address those issues.  The cup of coffee is a great idea and it works as well, without a doubt.</p><p> In regard to weight loss, I am of the firm opinion, and I have been for a long time, that if people are convinced smoking dulls the appetite for food, they are going to do it, especially because it is enjoyable.  If a product were found that was safe, and I am told such products are available but they need to be thoroughly tested, that would be a big breakthrough in terms of the attractiveness of smoking to some people who may want to lose weight and at the same time want to give up smoking.  The witnesses might look to their colleagues with a view to addressing that issue because it is an issue.  From my experience I know losing weight and stopping smoking at the same time is a double challenge.  I am not suggesting everyone's experience is the same but that is an area we need to address.</p><p> The last point I want to make is in regard to the home rollers.  I do not know how that can be controlled effectively.  The product cannot be banned outright.  I am not certain whether the legislation herein contains adequate provision to dissuade people from relying on home manufacture of cigarettes, because there is an economic element to it as far as they are concerned.  We must be able to explain to the smoker that this product is not good for him or her; in fact it is worse.  That point needs to be driven home.</p><p> There should also be a review after a year of the legislation being in operation to see how it is working, and whether it is working as was intended.  It would not be necessary to spend much time on the review, just to tap into the various bullets points with a view to seeing whether the legislation is as effective as was intended.</p><p> There are people who will find it extremely difficult to give up smoking - there is no doubt about that - and we must be sympathetic to that and address their problems in a meaningful way.  E-cigarettes can be used to wean them off, but the emphasis should be on weaning-off.  It is similar to dealing with drug consumption, where we have programmes for people which are used sometimes as a means of continuation of supply rather than a weaning-off from the product.  I urge in particular that the weaning-off element be addressed in a very aggressive way, which means and includes identifying smoking alternatives that are on the market.  All need to be geared towards weaning off and away from the tobacco products and away from dependence on their alternatives if they happen to be habit forming as well.</p></speech>

There are many alternatives, such as the HSE Quit programme which provides support, groups and face-to-face cessation counselling.  There is gum, there are patches, and there are medications like varenicline that will literally suppress the nicotine urge.  Those are all available, but by and large most people try to do it on willpower, and that is why it is so difficult and the numbers are so low.  I understand perfectly someone who does not want to medicalise it.  He or she is a smoker who wants to get off smoking but who does not feel it is something to see the GP about.  It would be great if more people would look at the services that exist and take advantage of them.  At the moment, clinical guidelines are being developed by the HSE for GPs and others about how to deal with people who are smokers, as in what advice to give them, where to point them and what to discuss.</p> <p>  One of the terrible things for us is that many services and alternatives are available but there is the attitude, "Just have a backbone", or, "Just give up; what is your problem?", and there is always this example of Jimmy who gave up without any help.  However, everybody is different, neurologically and biochemically, so the addiction is different for different people, and I do not need to tell the Deputy that.  For us the view is, why would someone not get the help that is out there?  Why do people try to hard-nose it and do it all by themselves?  They do not see it as something medical but as a lifestyle issue, like eating less or exercising more.</p> <p>  We need to recognise the power of the addiction - the absolute power of nicotine addiction, so much so that a colleague of ours who is a public health doctor was on a ward, exactly as the Chair said, where four men had limb amputations because of their smoking and one of them would get into the wheelchair five or ten times a day to go out and have a smoke.  That is the power of the addiction.  It is such a tragedy then when people think, "Oh I failed.  I did not quit.  I tried and gave up.  I had to go back", as if it is some kind of character failing or lack of moral spine when it is not that at all.  It is a massive biochemical addiction such that someone who has already suffered something like a lost limb will continue to smoke.  There needs to be more recognition of that, no more than harm reduction with other drugs as well, because it is the same thing.  It would be brilliant if we were all doing everything right and off everything, but if some in-between stage can assist in quitting cigarettes, such as gum, e-cigarettes, the drugs or talking to the GP, it is a sufficiently serious problem that needs all the help that is available.  Definitely one of the things for us is that 42% of people try to go it alone, and it is really hard.</p></speech>

To the smoker that is a comfort zone, an enjoyable place to be.  Within that zone the smoker feels this is lovely, like a garden of roses.  It is a different perspective altogether.  How do we address that?</p> <p>  I did not smoke until I was in my 20s, which is most unusual.  It was out of a reason to have something to do while I was listening to people like me talking for a long time.  I gave up and the first thing I discovered was the smell of smoke permeated the car, for example, because I would always smoke in the car.</p><p>It was now repugnant whereas previously I did not notice the smell of smoke at all.  The smoker is not aware of that aspect at all.  Others can smell it where the smoker cannot.  There are a lot of areas there.</p><p> The information the witnesses have given to us, and the discussion, have been very helpful.  The points I have taken from it relate to the packaging, which has been referred to already; the 10%, 20% or 30% extra that becomes available in larger amounts; and the need to ensure habit formation in the alternatives does not become a feature.</p><p> I saw a guy in a car in front of me at the traffic lights the other morning and he was obviously using one of those machines that exude a lot of smoke.  I thought the car had gone on fire there was so much smoke around it.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for the indulgence and I thank our witnesses for the information they have made available to us.</p></speech>

Other organisations and research institutes, including the WHO, would look at that figure and say it is too early to make that kind of call.  This essentially is what it is.  In the UK, for instance, it was announced last weekend that e-cigarettes are going to be put onto prescription.  The UK and New Zealand are two countries that are going foursquare behind e-cigarettes as the alternative.</p> <p>  One of the things this will include is that someone can be prescribed e-cigarettes.  This will be e-cigarettes that go through their equivalent of our Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  They will be medically approved devices.  A manufacturer of e-cigarettes can send its product to that body and it will be approved, essentially at the level of a medical device.  It can then be prescribed by doctors to people to get them off smoking.  Across the globe in other countries such as Brazil, India and Australia, they have banned e-cigarettes.  This will tell committee of the incredible polarisation of views.</p> <p>  The 95% paper is one paper but then the WHO has said it is too soon to tell, that we do not know what the harms are, that we have certainly identified some harms, and that the jury is out on this.  This is not to say the 95% figure is wrong but it is just one of many views, and it is certainly one view that Public Health England and the UK have gone behind.  That is the way they are going.  Equally respectable and authoritative research sources are saying other things and other countries are making the decisions based on that research.</p> <p>  One of the most difficult things around e-cigarettes is that there is no consensus except on those couple of levels, which is that tobacco cigarettes are definitely worse than e-cigarettes.  Is it agreed across the globe that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than tobacco cigarettes?  It is not agreed across the globe that this is a meaningful figure or that it is true.  As was said earlier, ultimately, there is always the question of the long-term effects.  A lot of the illness from tobacco cigarettes takes 30 years, so while a person would be okay now, he or she has already started the process whereby, 30 years from now, he or she would get peripheral arterial disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Nobody can tell right now that this is what is going to happen.  That is the big fear about e-cigarettes.  Everything looks pretty good and a 95% figure sounds very good but nobody knows what that means 20 years or 30 years from now for the people who are vaping now.  "I do not know" is the answer.</p></speech>

Is this what Ms Gordon is saying?</p></speech>

Oddly, even though tobacco cigarettes seem like a more natural product, there are fewer toxins in e-cigarettes by quantity than in tobacco cigarettes, because with tobacco cigarettes it is not a case of pulling the tobacco out of the field, rolling it up and off you go.  There are a lot of things added.  Ms Brophy has looked at the website of one of the American manufacturers, which are required by law and by a court order to state on their website that they have modified the product to make it more addictive and harmful in the past 50 years.  Cigarettes from 50 years ago are not the same as cigarettes now.  The industry has modified them so a person will get his or her nicotine hit faster and they are more addictive.  This is through the introduction of chemicals.  Oddly, a so-called natural product has more toxins in it than the artificial product that is e-cigarettes.  I forget why I was saying this now.  Perhaps the Chairman will remind me.</p></speech>

I cite the example of the head shops and some of the drugs that were coming in.  The shops then changed the names or changed one of the elements of a product and so on.  This presented difficulties for legislators in trying to keep up with that, which was almost impossible.  Are we into a similar situation with some of the e-cigarettes in the sense that these additives are potentially harmful?  Is there anything we can firm up in this legislation around this part of it, if there are concerns about some of the additives?  I believe people can make up their own minds where they believe it is less harmful than tobacco cigarettes and whether they feel e-cigarettes can progress them away from tobacco cigarette products to make them give up.  This was included in submissions made to us and included some information coming from Public Health England around that.</p></speech>

There are regulations around labelling and the nicotine content, and there are restrictions around characterising flavours.  There is a pretty strong notification process because of the number of products out there.  On an EU database we are talking about 300,000 different types of products currently registered within the EU.  Manufacturers and importers are required to notify the HSE in Ireland if there are issues with products.</p> <p>  The revision of the tobacco products directive will definitely see further regulation of e-cigarettes.  It is hard to know at this stage whether they will go down the road of having more restrictions on flavours, which poses the problems I spoke about earlier.  They may reduce the tank sizes for the actual devices.  There are already restrictions on the nicotine content.  There are warnings on every product telling consumers this product contains nicotine and that it is a highly addictive substance.  The EU is definitely concerned by e-cigarettes, for all the reasons we have spoken about.</p> <p>  With regard to cessation, the Commission has said, not unlike the UK, that if electronic cigarettes are to be used as a cessation product or tool, it should fall under niche pharmaceutical legislation.  They are not saying this is proposed for the revision of the tobacco products directive but that is where the Commission is coming from, and that may be the route other countries go also.</p></speech>

Members of the Oireachtas might wish examine such examples in order to go down that route.</p></speech>

Hungary has done and Lithuania is considering it.  There is a potential role for restricting flavours favoured by children, which other countries have examined.  Once this proposed legislation comes into force, it will be interesting to see the impact of banning the product to under-18s.  Given that 38% of people who try to quit smoking use e-cigarettes, there is a question as to whether, if we were to cut off the type of e-cigarette they might use, we risk them not using a safer product to give up a product that kills two of every three people who use it.  Should we try to find out what flavours people are using to try to give up and whether we can identify a limited number of flavours?  That may be a way of doing it.  There are definitely measures we can consider that other countries are taking.</p></speech>

Is that another avenue whereby, as in the case of other products, people use the post or the Internet to get these products into Ireland?</p></speech>

We should bear in mind that the regulations in place in the EU are much stricter than those in the US.  Anybody who sells products into Ireland or uses cross-border distance sales needs to be registered with the HSE.  There is regulation of purchasing products online.  Under a market surveillance regulation that applies to a range of products, the HSE will get increased powers in the area of online sales.  If there is an issue with products or if the HSE believes certain products are unsafe, it will have increased regulatory powers to instruct a company to remove them from its website.  There are also many reporting mechanisms within the EU to highlight dangerous products through the RAPEX system and the market surveillance system, and that is increasing.  The EU, as a whole, through market surveillance and within the review of the tobacco products directive, is recognising there need to be increased restrictions, and they will come.</p></speech>

There was mention of the influence of films, with actors smoking and so on.  Ben Affleck had a film about the release of hostages from Iran, where the plan was to disguise a crowd of people as actors and to get them out of the country that way.  He smoked wall to wall and floor to ceiling throughout the film.  I almost choked looking at him.  That is a relatively new film, released in 2012, and it got through the production companies somehow.  It is a good film - there is no doubt about that - but that was the sting in the tail.</p></speech>

That is the balance we need to strike as a society.</p> <p>  The meeting has been really helpful.  It would be useful if we could receive examples of other jurisdictions' approaches, for the benefit of the wider Oireachtas.  I thank our guests.

There are several non-members present as well as members.  We look forward to hearing their views.  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or put them in flight mode.  While they might not make noise they can still interfere with the sound recording, which will not become apparent until after the meeting.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders who have made written submissions on the topic of women's shelters and domestic abuse refuges.  All witnesses are appearing virtually from a location outside Leinster House and all Members are in Leinster House.  I welcome our witnesses: Ms Mary McDermott, CEO of Safe Ireland; Ms Lisa Marmion, services development manager at Safe Ireland; Ms Allison Graham, CEO of Saoirse Domestic Violence Services; Ms Kathrina Bentley, CEO of Men&rsquo;s Aid; and Ms Christina Sherlock, head of strategic communications and fundraising at Women&rsquo;s Aid.</p><p>The witnesses are all welcome.  As usual, we also have an observer from the Department of Justice, Mr. Ben Ryan, assistant secretary, attending the committee.  He is also very welcome.</p><p> Turning to a little bit of housekeeping, I ask the witnesses connecting to the meeting remotely to unmute their device when they are speaking so we can hear them, but then to re-mute their microphone when they are not speaking to ensure that we do not have any interference in the background.  I ask the members participating remotely to note that point as well.  I think everyone can hear me okay and we are all hooked up.</p><p> Another piece of housekeeping involves a note on parliamentary privilege, but it has implications for what can and cannot be said and what should and should not be said.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a manner as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity not represented in the room.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  I request everyone to note that point as good order.  For witnesses attending remotely, and some witnesses of necessity are participating from outside the precincts of Leinster House, as is the norm these days, I ask them to note that there are potentially some limitations to the parliamentary privilege they will enjoy.  If they were in a position to be physically present, they would have a higher degree of immunity.  I ask that that point be noted because if there was a challenge in respect of something said by people off-site, they might not enjoy the same full immunity as if they were present here in the building.  There is not much we can do about that situation.  We are where we are, as the saying goes.  Members are advised similarly, although I understand they are on the campus and enjoy absolute privilege, at least when they are on the campus.</p><p> The format of the meeting is that I will invite a representative from each of the participating organisations to make an opening statement for three minutes.  Organisations with more than one speaker can divide the time between them, but it is three minutes per organisation.  Once the opening statements have been delivered, I will then call the members of the committee and the other members present to put their questions.  I will take members in the order they indicate.  For everybody's benefit, we have a system in this committee where we have a first round of engagement with the normal members of the committee for seven minutes.  Those seven minutes include time for the questions and the responses.  Therefore, if members choose to have a long preamble and a short time for a response, that is fine and it is their decision.  Equally, though, some members choose to ask short snappy questions and then leave more time for responses, and perhaps some to and fro afterwards.  The seven-minute allocation includes the questions and the answers, however.  When we have completed the first round of questioning with the members of the committee, I will then invite non-members to come in.  The protocol is that they will also have seven minutes for their questions and answers.  Once that process is complete, we will then take a second round of questions, if any remain.  The second round will be a little bit shorter, at four minutes for each participant.  That is how we do it.  I hope it makes sense.  It is intended to enable equal time to all and it is good housekeeping.  </p><p> I will call a representative of each organisation now to deliver an opening statement.  I call Ms McDermott to lead us off.  She has three minutes.  </p></speech>

All members of Safe Ireland provide a front-line specialist response to women and children who experience coercive control and abuse.  Our single call today is for a fully-integrated and resourced Government response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p> <p>  We thank the committee for the invitation to present on the pressing issue of emergency accommodation for those experiencing violence and control.  We commend the committee's initiative and we hope that the evidence we present to the members will also be made available to their colleagues on the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We wrote this submission on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence within the terms of reference set out by the committee.  Therefore, our starting point is a direct statement that Ireland&rsquo;s domestic violence response infrastructure, and in particular its accommodation infrastructure, is critically deficient.  These deficiencies place women and children at very real risk of grievous trauma, injury or fatality.  We have set out the wider context within which emergency accommodation must be analysed and where solutions must be developed.  All inquiry must attend to the absolute necessity for wraparound services to be integral to responses at every point of a woman&rsquo;s journey to freedom.  The limitations of examining emergency accommodation itself in isolation from a whole housing approach cannot be overstated.  An important qualification here is that we still await the publication of the Tusla audit of domestic violence accommodation, which was due for release in the first quarter of 2021.  Safe Ireland and our member organisations worked closely with Tusla in that process over two years, and we are eager to respond to the audit&rsquo;s findings.</p> <p>  While the collection of data on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is an ongoing problem at a national level, some statistics may help to frame this large-scale social problem.  In the context of contact with front-line services between March and December 2020, there were more than 57,000 calls to local and national helplines.  During this time, on average each month more than 2,000 women and 500 children sought support, 6,000 new women made contact and 216 requests were made for emergency accommodation.  Between March and August 2020 alone, there were 1,351 unmet requests for refuge.  Without the introduction of the innovative domestic violence rent supplement, which Safe Ireland members lobbied for, and without the corporate assistance of Airbnb, which made hotel beds available for use as refuge, outcomes for women and children would have been much more serious.</p> <p>  Figures relevant to this committee may also help to frame this issue.  In 2020, a total of 23,785 incidents were reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with 4,000 breaches of protective orders recorded.  It is the case that the first line of support for women and children experiencing domestic abuse must be immediate access to protective services to prevent further harm.  At a minimum, this must also include immediate direction to safe supported accommodation, appropriate information, access to judicial protection and access to therapeutic supports, all of which are provided by Safe Ireland member organisations across the country.  Our pre-budget submission called for increases in core funding for front-line wraparound support services, for capital investment in refuges, for safe-at-home sanctuary schemes and for safe and transitional housing.  </p> <p>  We again reiterate our primary call for a truly integrated strategy for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in Ireland and for the responsibility for national policy and services to be housed within one Ministry.  I and Ms Marmion will be happy to take questions, and if the committee members have any queries which require further clarification, we will respond to them in writing within the week.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Domestic violence occurs in all walks of life, in all cultures, backgrounds, ages and genders, and Irish society is no different.  That is because the perpetrators of domestic violence also come from all walks of life, regardless of race, culture, age, profession or financial standing.  I have worked in this sector with women and children suffering domestic violence for more than 20 years, and while the experience of domestic violence may be individual and personal, what unites all people who have experienced it is that it is never their fault.  Domestic violence is the abuse of power over another person in an intimate or close family relationship to maintain absolute control by the perpetrator.  It takes many forms, and, unfortunately, myths such as alcohol and drugs contributing to domestic violence, that it is an anger management issue or that it is a private matter between a couple are too often still believed.</p> <p>  Saoirse Domestic Violence Services provides safe supportive refuge accommodation for women and children across two refuges and two safe houses in the south-west Dublin area.</p><p>We also provide a 24-hour helpline and expansive outreach support services that reach communities across south and south-west Dublin, and into west Wicklow.  We have a dedicated childcare workers in both refuges that offers support and programmes for resident children who have witnessed or experienced domestic violence as well as a space to just be children.<br/><br/>Since opening a refuge in Tallaght 16 years ago we have been unable to accommodate all of the requests for refuge.  Unfortunately, every refuge in this country shares our experience as there are not enough spaces.  In 2020, we turned away 369 requests for refuge from women and children.  That equates to us not being able to provide safe shelter to 78% of the requests that we received.  Sadly, these figures reflect our experience for the 16 years that we have been open.<br/><br/>Even though Dublin city has a population of approximately 1.4 million, it has four refuges that are currently open currently and offer 31 spaces.  Other counties such as Kilkenny, Cork and Galway have one refuge while some counties have none.  The oldest purpose-built refuge in Ireland is in Rathmines but it has been shut for five years and has left a huge void in refuge accommodation in the wider Dublin city area.<br/><br/>Every person has been touched by the Covid-19 pandemic and none more so than the survivors of domestic violence.  The shadow pandemic refers to the escalation of violence as a consequence of families being locked down with perpetrators during restrictions.  Victims were unable to make a call to family, friends, a support service or even the Garda as their every move was monitored.  Children were out of school due to Covid-19 so had to live 24-7 in an environment with no escape for even short periods or to get support from a grandparent or teacher, which has had devastating effects.  The pandemic may be moving along but, unfortunately, the issue of domestic violence has not and will not.  In addition, the escalation of the rate of domestic violence is not about to de-escalate even if the pandemic were to pass.<br/><br/>Operation Faoiseamh and the awareness raising programme, <i>Still Here</i>, by the Department of Justice are very welcome.  They offered increased support and protection to victims during the pandemic and raised much-needed public awareness of domestic violence.  We are keen that such operations continue and that real commitment across Departments to help and protect families is realised.<br/><br/>As Ms McDermott commented, we await the completion of the accommodation review by Tusla in terms of the provision of domestic violence and the future plan for same because the State has under met needs in terms of its <i>per capita</i>expenditure that should exist.  I welcome any questions from Members and thank the committee for the invitation to make a presentation.</p></speech>

Men's Aid is delighted to represent the voice of men and their families on the topic of women's shelters and domestic abuse refuges.</p> <p>  Men's Aid is dedicated to supporting students, men, dads and their families who experience domestic violence.  Our mission is to destigmatise intimate partner violence, raise awareness of the trauma that affects men and provide a victim-centric approach.  As a front-line response service that actively engages with victims, Men's Aid is committed to supporting victims together with all stakeholders and working collaboratively towards the day that every citizen can enjoy a life free from the threat of partner violence.  Our work is underpinned by an equality and human rights approach that has empathy and inclusion at its centre.</p> <p>  The current situation is as follows: in 2020, we supported more than 5,000 contacts; in 2021, we expect to support 8,000 contacts, which is a 32% increase; in quarter 1 of this year, we supported men who represented 24 nationalities; Government research from 2005 showed that 95% of the abuse experienced by men is not reported to the Garda so the under-reporting of domestic violence is a huge concern and highlights how difficult it is for men to report an abusive partner; and recent research by the Office of National Statistics in the UK presents that one in three victims of domestic violence is  male.</p> <p>  The men who call our helpline range from in age from 18 to 88.  They are schoolgoers, tradesmen, professionals, unemployed men, men from the LGBTQI+ community, farmers, men with disabilities, men from the Roma and Traveller communities, men living on the margins, men in uniform, etc.  Men in Ireland are aware that there are no refuge options so do not usually ask about a refuge when they call our helpline.  However, to date this year, we have had 30 requests for a safe bed.</p> <p>  Men's Aid made a submission, including recommendations to the project called the provision of accommodation for victims of domestic violence that was led by Tusla.  So far this year we have attended more than 14 meetings at Government level yet, despite that, vulnerable male victims appeared invisible.  Following considerable engagement with Tulsa, the Department of Justice and the office of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, on 22 October we received confirmation from the Minister that addressed all of the concerns that we raised, and acknowledged that there is a need to provide shelter and support for men in domestic violence situations.</p> <p>  The Dublin Simon Community produced its annual report a few weeks ago.  The report shows that two thirds of the homeless people who used its services are single men.  Together with the disclosures that we hear from men who are sleeping in their cars, vans and tents, and those with suicide ideation, we recognise the importance and urgency of providing accommodation for men who must flee an abusive relationship.</p> <p>  We wish to continue our victim-centric approach, which is tailored to meet the needs of victims in this ever-changing landscape.  Our approach has more focus on care, empathy, equality, inclusion and safety.  We want to continue to work alongside our colleagues in a respectful and non-discriminatory way to deliver a service that helps make victims feel safe and delivers on their rights under law.  We all need to work more closely to give confidence and encourage victims to come forward for information and support.  We urge Oireachtas Members to prioritise this issue so that men and their families will have somewhere safe to go where they will be supported and by Christmas 2022 at the latest.</p> <p>  Finally, we welcome any questions and will follow up afterwards.  I thank Members for their time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Christina Sherlock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021110300002#C00300"><p>Women's Aid welcomes the opportunity to offer its views to the committee on the topic of shelters and refuges for women escaping domestic violence and abuse.  We wish to make some recommendations for change.</p> <p>  Women's Aid operates a 24-hour national freephone helpline and a number of other face-to-face domestic abuse services.  Last year, in 2020, in excess of 30,000 contacts were made with our services, an increase of 43% on the previous year.</p> <p>  One in four women in Ireland has been subjected to domestic violence and abuse.  It has serious, long-lasting, multifaceted impacts on the mental and physical health of women and children.  Domestic violence also has significant impacts on women's finances, their employment prospects and their risk of being pushed into poverty and homelessness.</p> <p>  A lack of in-depth, up-to-date data and research on domestic violence makes it difficult to gain a thorough perspective on the prevalence, nature and scope of domestic abuse in Ireland, particularly in terms of younger people.  Better data collection and more research is needed to ensure all victims of abuse are provided with high-quality specialised support tailored to their individual needs.</p> <p>  Ireland does not have enough refuge places available to meet the Istanbul Convention standard and nine counties have no refuges.  This urgently needs to change.  All refuges should also meet the needs of minority groups and those affected by all forms of gender-based violence.</p> <p>  Funding is a significant issue in the area of domestic violence and abuse.  Funding for refuges needs to be increased urgently to meet the surge in demand brought on by the pandemic and maintain compliance with Covid-19 health regulations.  Funding is also needed for the provision of specialist children's support in refuges and to fund qualified external supervision support for all domestic violence specialist support workers.</p> <p>  Women's Aid believe that the proactive, victim-centric approach embodied within Operation Faoiseamh should be part of Garda routine procedure.  Women's Aid also believes that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be briefed on their obligations under the Garda domestic abuse policy.  Training on the dynamics and impacts of coercive control should be rolled out to all front-line members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to support responses to calls from victims and for the effective roll-out of new risk assessment tools.</p><p>A comprehensive strategy for move-on, long-term accommodation for victims of domestic abuse needs to be developed to provide long-term options.  The needs of domestic violence survivors must be included in any national homeless and housing strategy.  </p><p> I wish to share one statistic from the Women's Aid national helpline.  For two out of every three calls we receive from women asking us to help them find a refuge place in Ireland, the refuge is full when we call on those women's behalf.  What option does that leave those women?  They either sleep in their cars, they have to try to find a bed for that night to be safe, or they go back to an unsafe home.</p><p> I thank the committee for the time.  I am happy, like all my colleagues, to answer any questions from the committee members.</p></speech>

A number of members have indicated and I am sure more will come in as the meeting goes on.  The usual protocol is to start with committee members.  I will first call Deputy Carroll MacNeill, followed by Deputy Niamh Smyth.  Those Deputies were the main movers behind this session and expressed an interest in these issues at an early stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021110300002#D00300"><p>I thank our guests for their attendance.  It is great to see so many of them again.  The final statement Ms Sherlock made was the most important because it painted a picture of what women are going back to and the choices they have to make.  I am constantly challenged by the premise that women have to leave.  I spoke yesterday with a woman who is stuck in a family law situation going back to May 2019 when she and her three children left an abusive situation and she is still struggling to find accommodation while her former partner remains in their family home.  That story is not new to any of our guests and they do not need me to tell it.</p> <p>  I will ask a couple of specific questions, as we are tight on time.  I congratulate Ms McDermott of Safe Ireland on the No Going Back document, which I found powerful.  I thank her for coming to Oireachtas Members to talk about the document.  When she mentioned the delay in Tusla's audit, she described the situation diplomatically.  She said was keen to see the audit and I am sure other providers are too.  I would like to give her the opportunity to expand on that.  Why does she think the publication of that audit has been so slow, when it was due in quarter 1 of this year?  What is the issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.507" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary McDermott" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021110300002#D00400"><p>The simple answer is that we are not in Tusla so we do not know.  However, we have participated in the work for more than two years and as part of the national monitoring committee, we had a preview of some of the early findings.  There seems to be a large volume of material.  The bigger question is where accommodation lies.  That is a significant problem within government generally.  Everybody is essentially passing the buck about who is responsible for those made homeless, either correctly or incorrectly, in the context of safe-at-home shelter, where women should be staying at home.  Where they are made homeless, who steps in and takes responsibility for them?  Tusla found itself facing a certain structural problem in that regard, in that it has no remit around accommodation.  We have found ourselves passed from Billy to Jack.  As is clear from the budget, if I might speak forthrightly, domestic violence was erased from the national budget.  It is almost completely invisible, which is shocking given the fact it has been a national priority for the past two years during the pandemic.  I am not sure if that answers the Deputy's question.  The issue is the nature of homelessness as it arises from domestic violence and who, precisely, has responsibility for it.</p> <p>  On the publication of the review by Tusla, it was a thorough engagement.  To the best of our knowledge, Tusla has taken on board the fact that wraparound services always need to be provided.  The issue is not only about beds.  Perhaps that is a response to the Deputy's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021110300002#D00500"><p>That is important.  If we think about a man or woman and his or her children going into a refuge, the behaviour of those children could be challenging for good reason.  They have gone through a traumatic situation.  Having that trauma-based response at an early stage is important.</p> <p>  I will move to Ms Bentley.  It is important that she is here and her organisation is represented.  The more I learn, the more I realise how little I know, particularly about violence to men.  I do not, and never would, accept that abuse only happens in one direction or is only carried out by one gender.  Abuse by any gender to any gender is unacceptable.  The issues Ms Bentley highlighted around homelessness and suicide are important.  Coming up to Christmas, I want to ask about short-term plans on a practical basis.  Can she give the committee any information about anything that is going on in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.509" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kathrina Bentley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021110300002#D00600"><p>We have been getting more calls in recent weeks and we have reached out to a couple of our colleagues.  Sonas, in particular, has come forward.  We are speaking to Sonas about a short-term solution for Christmas.  It is in addition to its portfolio of housing and will be on a case-by-case basis.  It is not going to be a long-term answer, nor will it address the issue.  We know that men are not even asking for a space in a refuge because it does not exist yet.  We have dangerous cases where children are being left in the home in an abusive situation.  We want to help those dads and children in the run-up to Christmas.  We will work in the short term and on a case-by-case basis.  We will run a pilot scheme with Sonas in the coming weeks and months.  I hope we will be able to take learnings and roll the project over into 2022.</p> <p>  I have been helping a person in my constituency since Thursday.  He was made homeless on Sunday.  On paper, he is a millionaire but, as of Sunday, he is homeless.  We have live situations every day.  We are looking forward to working with Sonas.</p></speech>

I thank her organisation for allowing me to visit Saoirse Domestic Violence Services last November to see the work it is doing.  I particularly thank Ms Nadine O'Brien in particular, with whom I spent time.  I will ask Ms Graham about Tusla and the importance of multi-annual funding.  I have a sense that the service level agreements are being agreed very late in the year and I do not know if that is the experience of providers.  That would make it difficult to plan.  Ms Graham spoke about the spaces her organisation has and I know Saoirse has done some upgrades in recent years.  How does the situation work, for the benefit of committee members?  When is Saoirse sure about its budget?</p></speech>

That seems ridiculous.  It is now November 2021 and Ms Graham is telling me she does not have clarity on her organisation's 2022 budget and yet she has to plan staff, works and so on.</p></speech>

It makes it extremely difficult to plan.  To be honest, in some previous years, the confirmation has not come until towards the end of the year.  That happened last year.  Our budget was not confirmed, based on the service level agreement, until towards the end of 2020.</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, we have, for many years, been looking for a multi-annual budget confirmation and service level agreement.  Tusla has said it is looking at that but nothing concrete is coming down the line.  It makes it extremely difficult to plan anything.  As an agency, we are in the middle of doing a five-year strategic plan from 2022 onwards and it is impossible to plan because we do not know what is going to happen, year-on-year.  We do not know whether our core funding is going to be maintained, cut, or what is going to happen.  It is impossible to plan future services.</p></speech>

Is that something all the organisations represented here believe is important?  I urge them to speak out on that issue as the weeks progress.  That is more of a request in case I do not get back in during this meeting.</p></speech>

I am from the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and when we are talking about this issue, we cannot help but think of Ms Clodagh Hawe and her three beautiful boys who lost their lives in these exact circumstances.</p><p>In my constituency we have the Tearmann domestic abuse service with Siobh&aacute;n McKenna and her amazing team there.  If it were not for them we would have absolutely nothing.  Somebody mentioned in the presentation to the committee the fact there are only nine counties without refuges.  Two of them are in my constituency.  We know there is under-resourcing.  The Tearmann service could not possibly be in a position to respond adequately to all of the calls it receives.  While it does respond and makes the best of what it has, none of it provides adequate or protective accommodation, about which all of the witnesses have spoken so eloquently today.  I would like to get the views of the witnesses on this.</p><p> The witnesses have spoken about models of very good practice where this is being done in other counties.  They spoke about wraparound services.  Ms McDermott said something very concerning.  She said that domestic violence was completely erased from the national budget.  It is incumbent on those who are in parties that are members of the Government to address this.  I will certainly seek to do so.  Do local authorities have any role in this?  Do they come in with emergency accommodation?  Will the witnesses give me and other members an insight into constituencies such as mine that have absolutely no services whatsoever for protective safe accommodation?  What can we do?  I have to imagine it puts huge pressure on other refuges throughout the country.  These women and children have to go somewhere so it must be putting immense pressure on other refuges outside of the counties.</p></speech>

Cavan and Monaghan have very few resources.  If Deputy Smyth looks at our submission to the committee she will see the red block up the centre of the country in the Border and north-west region that is seriously underserviced.  It is a disgrace that we rely so much on charity and philanthropy.  The Community Foundation for Ireland is funding us to do a project which we hope will target Monaghan and Cavan.  It will be an innovative post-Covid response to domestic violence.  I am not sure whether this will raise the Deputy's heart.  We see the difficulties.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  Where counties have no services by definition it spreads pressure on an already very weak infrastructure.  I will ask Ms Marmion to step in.</p></speech>

We are aware that nine counties are completely without refuges.  For many years, I had the experience of working in County Louth.  Dundalk, Navan and Drogheda sought to address this deficit.  With regard to local authorities, our experience across the membership is that the capacity to respond varies.  As we are all too aware, we are still in a housing crisis.  We are not where we need to be in terms of available accommodation.  This also has an impact.  A number of years ago there was a little bit more flexibility but it has become increasingly difficult to find safe and suitable accommodation for women and children who need it.</p></speech>

I commend Tearmann domestic abuse service.  Siobh&aacute;n McKenna is always flying the flag to try to get something done.  Safe accommodation is one aspect to it.  As the witnesses said, and as Deputy Carroll MacNeill said, children and families are traumatised, as is the wider family circle.  What wraparound services do the witnesses advocate and champion having in refuges for women and families?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.527" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary McDermott" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021110300002#E00500"><p>We have developed very complex models on the provision of safe and transitional housing, emergency crisis housing, therapeutic supports, legal supports and welfare support.  This is a suite of supports that have to be provided at point of contact and along the journey.  I will speak very plainly for a moment.  Refuge is not the response to domestic violence.  Refuge is the crisis point where it comes up to the surface of society and where people are pushed <i>in extremis</i>to make contact and ask for help.  As Ms Graham said, the first refuges have been there for 20 years but there has been a response in communities for many decades.  Many of us grew up in communities where we knew some woman or some family who would take in a woman and her children, or a man if it was the case, where there was abuse.  We are talking about a response at a local level.  Since Covid we can really see that community-led responses are the way forward but they cannot happen on their own.  One of the reasons the response to domestic violence has been so effective, and we have had relatively low rates of femicide, for example, in this country relative to other jurisdictions, is because the community was there and the structural response was there.  The Garda was on the ball.  Operation Faoiseamh was successful.  This has to be maintained and fully supported.  It should be supported in this work.<br/><br/>To answer the Deputy on what are the needs, it is a specialist front-line response.  All of our members around the country provide these responses in various ways relative to their resources.  It is not that they do not know what to do or how to do it; it is a question of having the resources and support to do it.  This includes accreditation and training, proper professional supports and being recognised as specialists in their own work.  Ms Marmion or some of my colleagues will probably be well able to answer this question for the Deputy.</p></speech>

Many of us have heard the details of the crisis that exists but it is stark to hear from Ms Sherlock about a 43% increase in the number of people seeking help.  It is really striking that however bad the Covid experience has been for many of us it has been worse for some of us.  I am particularly struck by what Ms Graham said about having to refuse 369 requests.  This is a shocking figure.  I was not aware of how many counties were without refuges.  Coming from D&uacute;n Laoghaire I am aware it does not have one.  I would have thought we were the most populous area without one.  It is something I have raised with the Minister.  I know there was a review earlier this year and I am still not clear on what the outcome of it is.  I am conscious of what Ms Bentley said about men being one in three of the victims and not seeking refuge.  My question is for Ms Bentley.  There is no male refuge anywhere in the country.  Is this something we need to address?  Does she feel it would be a useful tool in dealing with the requests for help she receives?</p></speech>

He is correct that there is no refuge in Ireland for men.  There are zero beds.  It is a stark reality.  Men find it difficult to come forward because they know there are no supports.  They know there is no accommodation.  There is what we called "the invisible man".  It is like the hidden homeless.  Even in recent days, I did the key work with a gentleman since Thursday.  When he got in contact the situation was so dire and we are such a small team that I worked with him myself on Thursday and Friday.  We knew he would be made homeless on Sunday.  We also got him emergency counselling.</p><p>It is only somebody's good heart or a landlord's kindness that is stopping him from going to the streets.  The streets are not the answer because he is actually in the fog of domestic violence and fleeing an abusive relationship.  There are also other complexities.  This is why we are trying to find solutions.  As Ms McDermott just said, there is a crisis.  The man in question has been in his circumstances locally for two years.  It took him two years to come forward and ring our helpline.  There are also children and grandparents involved.  It is so catastrophic for the whole family.</p><p> It is disappointing that, as a country, we are approaching Christmas 2021 without accommodation and options for all victims.  It is shocking that there is nothing for men.  We are based in Navan and will be increasing our outreach services across Monaghan, Cavan, Navan, Trim and Dundalk between now and February because there was so much suicidal ideation in January of last year after Christmas.</p><p> We are where we are, and we can only go forward, but it is important to start giving confidence and encouragement to male victims to seek help and start the conversation.  We will work on a case-by-case basis and link in with our colleagues to see what is possible.  We are where we are but I remain hopeful.  I have to.</p></speech>

She talked about the invisible man.  It is an issue that has been highlighted here.</p> <p>  Ms Sherlock made a comment on the training of garda&iacute; and the Garda domestic abuse policy.  Does she feel there is sufficient training?  If a man or woman goes to a Garda station seeking assistance, what are the chances that he or she will meet a garda who is trained properly, understands his or her needs, will be sympathetic, and will take the matter seriously?  Is that still an issue?  Is investment in greater training for garda&iacute; needed?  How does Ms Sherlock regard the current position?</p></speech>

It brings me back to a conversation I had with somebody who said she was lucky she got the garda she did because she got so much support from that person and the best response, which supported her in her journey through the legal system to eventually becoming safe and free from her abuser.  It should not come down to somebody being lucky to get a garda who understands or gets it.  We certainly see a need for comprehensive training for all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At best, the system is <i>ad hoc</i>.  The pandemic has interrupted some of the training that may have been planned.  There is an urgent need to start the training again and fully resource it.  It should reach all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so everybody who rings the organisation will get the same response and receive the understanding and support they need.<br/><br/>There are issues with the Garda.  According to our national helpline figures for last year, two thirds of callers mentioned that they found the response of the Garda helpful, but one third said it was unhelpful.  An unhelpful response can be such a block to moving forward and becoming safe.  Everybody should feel that when he or she rings the Garda, the call will be answered and acted upon.  There have been stories recently of 999 calls not being responded to and logged properly as domestic violence calls.  There is a lot of work to be done in this regard still.<br/><br/>There was an enhanced response during the Covid-19 pandemic, which was heartening to front-line service providers.  We really felt the Garda, which is the first line of response in many cases, was there beside us responding.  This level of understanding and the treatment of the issue with such seriousness should feature as a matter of course.  We do not want to go back to the way it was.</p></speech>

The woman may be told she will receive a call-out but no one shows up.  Where there is a call-out, the perpetrator of the abuse might be taken into one room and the woman into another and they might be asked whether they can sort the matter out themselves.  The garda&iacute; might ask those involved to calm down and suggest that a garda take the man for a walk, thereby not treating the issue as the very serious issue it is.  An unhelpful approach might also be taken by not acting on breaches of the protective orders in place under the Domestic Violence Acts.  I refer to where breaches such as someone breaking the terms of his orders by showing up at a place he or she should not be, trying to gain access to the house or putting someone in fear of their safety are not treated as serious and as the criminal matters that they are.</p></speech>

This is one of the issues that comes up all the time.  I live in County Leitrim.  My constituency, Sligo&ndash;Leitrim, includes County Sligo, County Leitrim, north Roscommon and south Donegal.  I am very conscious of that red block on the map because I am right in the middle of it.  Organisations such as DVAS in Sligo do tremendous work and do their very best.  They have their own little network of people they can call on in an emergency.  They have a couple of B&amp;Bs and places where people can be assisted.  I am sure that is the same throughout the country.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses' reflections on the numbers because many of the people I have come across in the past 20 years who have experienced domestic violence have not gone to DVAS but to their family.  They kept the problem in-house.  They stayed with a sister or ran to their brother or brother-in-law.  The domestic violence problem is often covered up, meaning we do not see the full impact.</p> <p>  I would like a little more information on the need for a refuge or safe place to which people can go and that they know will be there for them.  What costs are involved in establishing a refuge of that nature based on the experience of counties that have one?  I imagine such a refuge is good value for money.  It is often crude to say it but, when it comes to government, we have to talk about the cost, where we are going to get the money and how we are going to use it.</p></speech>

In our submission, we said that in the event of further development, costs can be reduced, for example, by making public land available.</p> <p>  In reference to the Tusla accommodation review, our preview had pitched that the development of a single refuge would be between &euro;2 million and &euro;2.5 million.  There would also be running costs.  However, given the life-saving measure it can be and how it can change survivors' experiences and future, it would certainly be worth the investment.</p></speech>

That is fair.  One of the organisations I have come across, Lifeline (Inishowen) Domestic Violence Service, has received no funding whatsoever from the Government.  It depends solely on fundraising.  There are many similar organisations in various sectors throughout the country.  They do tremendous work.  Despite their lack of funding, we expect a service.  I have come across people who have gone with their difficulty to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE or State agencies but who have been pointed in the direction of the organisations to which I refer, which get no public funding whatsoever and must fundraise as a consequence.</p><p>There is a dilemma that we certainly need to address because the matter is urgent.</p><p> I refer to training when it comes to identifying and understanding coercive control, particularly from the perspective of Men's Aid.  I have come across situations where men find they cannot leave an abusive situation because they are controlled by the threat of self-harm or suicide by their partners.  They are tied to situations from which it is difficult to extract themselves.  How much training is required?  Garda personnel and the staff of Tusla and a range of other agencies require training to be able to make the correct interventions and deal with such situations.</p></speech>

We opened the Rathcoole refuge in south Dublin at the end of 2019.  The cost for building that came from the capital assistance scheme funding through the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  We had to approach to Tusla to fund the staffing and running costs of the refuge.  There is not a single pot of money that organisations can access in order to establish and run refuges.   That is the main problem that many refuges, particularly in rural areas, struggle with because of the nature of the system.  There is not one Department to which they can go for support that will help develop a refuge from scratch and help run it in the future.</p></speech>

It is a repeated call of Safe Ireland that there must be a central, local position in respect this problem.  Part of what is at stake is drawing up domestic violence from under the dark rock under which it lies.  It is a large-scale social problem in need of an integrated and central response from the Government.  As Ms Graham pointed out, we have relied on - this is worthy of much praise - local community activism that provides great learning, insight and expertise.  Nonetheless, if we rely on philanthropic support in the context of major cases, we often end up being guided by the wishes, ideology or ethos of the funders.  There is nothing wrong with that, but we need a State response to what is a large-scale social problem.  We need systematic, integrated, sustainable roll-on funding for all the services in this area.</p> <p>  In support of Ms Bentley's position, Safe Ireland believes that sex-gender and sexuality constitute the axis around which all of this revolves.  It needs close attention and resourcing for the training on the specifics of how it manifests itself across various lives.  It also needs an integrated State response and large-scale funding.  If domestic violence was put front and centre in social policy, an array of ancillary and what seem to be idiosyncratic social problems would be addressed in an integrated way.  These include: addiction; child protection; housing; difficulties in the context of welfare; justice; and social protection.  Putting this front and centre will unleash a lot of energy, imagination and creativity in erasing many of the problems we have as a society.  I do not mean to dominate the room here.</p></speech>

We have already covered a wide area.  I would like to focus on two separate issues.  Safe Ireland spoke about refuge design, which is an issue that been raised in a number of women's groups I have worked with recently.  I refer to the accessing of a refuge by women with disabilities, with additional needs and whose supports are local, and attend an outpatient clinic daily or a day service.  These different aspects come into play at that crisis point when the decision has to be made as to whether refuge is required.  It is also relevant for a mother with a child who has additional needs or intellectual disability etc.  Will our guests from Safe Ireland speak to the importance of being able to design refuges in a way that make them accessible for all types of women?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.545" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>Deputy Niamh Smyth took the Chair.</p></speech>

I will be straightforward: our network of refuges around the country, and other organisations represented here, often have a problem.  We are told we do not meet the needs of X, Y and Z cohort.  There is not a single refuge manager, CEO, or staff member who does not want to be able to respond to the layered vulnerabilities and the marginalised groups that are in need of this support across the axes mentioned.  However, we cannot do that without an integrated, sustained and developed infrastructure.  The infrastructure is completely Dickensian and is outdated, and staff are pushed to the limit in, for example, the cases of addictions that arise from being in an abusive situation.  That means there are complex and chaotic cases.  We do not want to get caught into a situation where people are further victim blamed because they are self-medicating to try to cope and the resources are not available to help them.  We encounter all of this.</p> <p>  I refer to the wider sense of design in terms of responding to domestic violence and refuge and support services.  We understand that there will be a recommendation that refuges are built to meet the standards under the Istanbul Convention.  The last thing we need is to throw up buildings and refuges that are not well designed for future proofing or that are not flexible buildings designed to become community engagement centres, where young people and children can come in and where all the vulnerabilities and layers are present.  As a cautionary warning, this is not simply a question of throwing up beds - I use that expression in a slightly caricatured fashion.  It is important that we sit down, design and plan it.  I note Deputy Niamh Smyth's comment on the Monaghan-Cavan area.  We hope to run a pilot project that will attend to some of these issues so that the architectural space is flexible and adaptable, that it contains a community development element and that best practice and robust understanding of the nature of domestic, sexual and gender based violence, and the skills that are needed to respond to it, are present.  My colleagues might have more to say on this.</p></speech>

Given the time constraints, I will move on.  The question has been well answered.  What Ms McDermott said earlier about refuge not being the answer to domestic violence is going around in my head.  I relied heavily on Saoirse in getting people refuge throughout Covid.  What came up a lot in that - and as referred to by Deputy Carroll MacNeill earlier - was the number of women who would stay in the home if they could get the partner to leave.  Are there any clear pathways or strategies for supporting women at that point in the context of the outreach piece?  Safe Ireland referred to the safe at home sanctuary scheme.</p><p>Perhaps it is something that can be developed as part of that.  Even if women temporarily leave the home and want to get back into the home, how do we get him out?  There does not seem to be any real way here.  It would have cost one of the women I was supporting hefty legal fees to challenge this situation, something she would not have access to as she became a lone parent, was out of work and was on social work welfare.  Will whoever feels best in answering this tell me how we begin to solve this so that we take the pressure off refuges and manage to keep women and their families within the home, even if they do leave it temporarily but then work towards getting back to it?  Do we need to fund free legal representation to be able to support women to return to the home?</p></speech>

As Ms McDermott put it very well earlier, it is the last port of call for women and children to have to leave their home.  Outreach services have been developing throughout the country.  We are trying to take a different focus to try to support women to stay safe in the home, where possible, until they can source alternative accommodation or a barring order can be obtained or whatever.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, things like lack of training for the Judiciary are big issues still where we have often heard women coming to us asking what is the point in getting a safety or barring order as it will not be respected or responded to and the person will be dead before someone from An Garda responds to it.  There is a very significant piece of work to be done across the Department of Justice in terms of the Judiciary and the courts, how perpetrators are held accountable and how all of that works.  The way things happen is that victims of domestic violence feel that the refuge is the only option, the perpetrator is left living in a three- or four-bedroomed house and the lady is left homeless with her children.  I hope I have answered that question in some way.</p></speech>

I thank them also for the work that they do in this area.  I am saddened and sickened by the lack of response from the State, and the manner in which the State is treating this problem is shameful.  It would appear that what seems to be the problem and what has been touched upon by a number of contributions is that there are so many facets to this particular issue and nobody seems to be taking control of it.  For that reason I would be one who would feel, as I believe was mentioned by Deputy Kenny in his earlier contribution, that we need one Department and one Minister to lead every aspect of this situation.</p><p>On the nine counties that were mentioned earlier, Deputy Smyth and I are from Monaghan and it is one of those counties where there is no service.  I have known this for many years as I live quite close to Siobh&aacute;n McKenna, former chair of Tearmann domestic violence abuse service, who has done Trojan work in this area for many years<b>.  </b>The Tusla<b></b>audit a number of members talked about earlier was due in the first quarter of this year, and here we are towards the end of the year and there is no word of it surfacing.  This is just another example of how everything relating to this subject is let drift because nobody is taking control of it.</p><p>I have a number of questions or matters I would like people to comment on, please, as they wish.  Ms Marmion has been rightly discussing symptoms to a problem and how those symptoms can manifest themselves across so many areas in a domestic violence situation, where someone who leaves the home can end up being homeless and socially isolated, leading to substance abuse in many instances.  The stress and the load that family has to carry is unimaginable.  I know we can talk about Covid-19 and how it has had an adverse effect on the numbers looking for help, but where are we going as a society when this problem seems to be getting worse year on year, ignoring Covid-19, if I may, for a moment?  It seems things are getting worse, so what do we have to do to educate our society on this issue?  Do we have to start in schools or where do we have to start the process of education on this issue?  That is one question I would ask for some comments on, please.</p></speech>

As we were all told to go home and stay safe from this pandemic, organisations like Women&rsquo;s Aid and Safe Ireland members were able to say that is all fine and well but what happens when home is not safe?  There was a light bulb moment then.  This was an issue that existed before Covid-19 and it will continue after it.</p> <p>  I return to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s comments a while back who talked about the prevalence and numbers.  We know that all of the figures we have talked about here, the calls to Women&rsquo;s Aid and the admissions to refuges, are only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the prevalence of this issue throughout the country.  Some research was done a good number of years ago, which is the case for most research in Ireland on this topic, which showed that approximately 7% of victims contacted a helpline and local service.  When I say it is tip of the iceberg, it really is.  The numbers we have presented to the committee are shocking.  It brings it back to one of our recommendations on the need to do some whole-scale prevalence research for Ireland.  From that will flow the information we need on the prevalence and types of abuse, including who perpetrates it and why.  This will help feed into both service provision and those education pieces that need to happen at a very early age.</p> <p>  For Women&rsquo;s Aid, we have been working on a campaign that was specifically targeting 18 to 25-year-olds around recognising the signs and the red flags of abusive relationships in the hope younger people, if they became aware earlier, might be able to leave those situations and not become embroiled in marriages or long-term partnerships with children etc. that can trap someone even further.</p> <p>  We know we need to go younger and this needs to be an integrated part of the curriculum in secondary schools and, perhaps, even in primary schools where we are talking about the issues of respect, equality, respecting consent and others.  If we do it right, it is to be hoped we will create a generation where there is not this inequality or attitude that allows domestic violence to be perpetrated.</p></speech>

Can I just step back for a moment in response to what Senator Gallagher is saying there, which is that from the point of view of Safe Ireland, this is a very dark subject and it can sometimes feel very heavy but we actually feel very hopeful because the first thing that needs to be done is that, as a society, we need to step away, as we have done in other domains around mental health.</p><p>We must step away from the shame, stigma, secrecy and silence that surrounds this subject.</p><p> The second point relates to fear and fatalism.  We do not believe in an oppressive home.  For most of us, sitting for two seconds and saying a person does not have to live in an oppressive home is a radical statement.  Perhaps I am too old and younger people in the meeting might not feel the same way but there is the idea that if you make your bed, you lie in it.  It is another tactic of blaming the victim so that victim stays in an abusive or coercive relationship.  On the question of what is best practice, we have decades of experience of front-line workers on helplines and in front-line services.  There are also garda&iacute;, social workers and teachers.  All that expertise is there.  To pick up on what Deputy Kenny said, there is a need to pull this together into a coherent whole.  We must pull together all the knowledge and expertise we have, along with the knowledge and expertise we have gained since Covid-19, as we have been able to speak about the matter.  As a country we have had an imaginative and positive response but we must not take our foot off the pedal.</p><p> For example, we appear to sense there is a waning of support for Operation Faoiseamh.  We must ensure this is not pushed back into oblivion.  One of the heartbreaking elements of why we are sitting here this evening is that in the budget there was no clear delineation or funding and political decisions have yet to be made on the subject.  It is a crucial matter.  The expertise is there and we know about it; it is scattered and we just need for it to be pulled together in a systematic way and made available for everyone.  I am getting a bit heated so my colleagues might step in and say something a little less rhetorical.</p></speech>

I thank each of the members for coming and Deputies Smith and Carroll MacNeill for suggesting this important module.</p> <p>  I agree with Ms McDermott about the State integrated response, which is definitely required.  It is depressing to read that with ancillary services, community care, health and hospital care, we seem to have a non-integrated and non-strategic model across a range of services.  I hope that can be changed.  Ms McDermott mentioned statistics in her opening statement.  It is the same with sexual assault and rape cases in that we find difficulty in obtaining up-to-date statistics through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for recent domestic violence offences.  It is easy to get them for public order and criminal damage-type offences but it can be difficult to get up-to-date statistics in this area.  We mentioned this in meeting members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Is that the case?</p> <p>  I have two questions for everybody but particularly for Ms McDermott.  How do the 2020 statistics, indicating 23,000 incidents or 500 incidents per week, compare with 2019 and 2018?  Of the 4,000 breaches, how many translated into prosecutions and convictions?  The statistics for that may not be available.  Do the witnesses have the same difficulty as we have in obtaining those types of statistics?</p></speech>

It is an open secret when it comes to domestic violence, sexual and gender-based violence that data is an absolute nightmare to obtain.  There is centralised CSO functioning work in the area.  That is across all domains of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; it is all along the long list of names we have for the problem itself.</p> <p>  To speak more generally about the statistics for 2019 and 2020, Covid-19 had a major impact.  For example, capacity in refuges was reduced by 25% and, at the same time, demand increased by approximately 23%.  We are not sure about the reliability of data relating to calls to 999.  This does not take away from the fact that the figures have risen consistently.</p> <p>  I do not want to give an impression comprising entirely of doom and gloom.  Some of this will bring a positive result because people will have vocabulary and will be able to speak about it.  If we look at the community and corporate response for example, Boots total health pharmacies offered safe spaces and Tesco put tag lines on its receipts.  There was an absolute outpouring of response from individuals, communities, the commercial and cultural sectors to say they know there is a problem and they wanted to do something.  From the data it is clear there were responses and surges from all kinds but they were not always entirely negative.</p> <p>  What is needed is a proper structure so that energy can be captured.  This will lead to robust responses at community level, as the community is where this happens.  We need the CSO to work on this at national level and we must create coherent definitions.  We must align vocabularies and have clear categories we can all agree and work for that to happen.  I am not sure if that gives the Deputy the response he wants but some of my colleagues may wish to comment.</p></speech>

This has been a very interesting and useful session.  Most of my questions have probably been answered.  Ms McDermott may have answered the question but she spoke about the need for a single Ministry to deal with domestic violence services.  It is more a signal that the Government has failed.  The Government is supposed to function with collective responsibility but we know everybody works in silos and tries to hold on to their budget.  As long as nobody draws from those budgets it is grand for people.  Any organisation that feels it is not getting a fair hearing or being dealt with properly looks for a single Ministry to deal with their matters.  It is the only way things can work in this country, which is bizarre.  Ms McDermott spoke about the need for a single Ministry so does she feel what I have said is true?  From what she has said, it appears to be true.</p></speech>

In our sector we are often set against each other, which is ridiculous nonsense when we are all trying to solve a single social problem.  This goes back to the requirement for a coherent single State response to the matter.</p> <p>  In the case of domestic violence, there is policy in one Department and services in a State agency outside central government.  We are not casting aspersions anywhere but this is simply about structure, governance and efficient running and response that will create coherent and co-ordinated responses across the country for all the needs presenting.  We are repeatedly calling for a coherent response.</p><p>International research shows that a single location in a single Ministry, and indeed sometimes a dedicated Ministry itself, may well be an efficient response to this.  It goes back to some of the questions about the history that came up earlier.  We are looking at an organic network of local community responses and independent organisations, often charity-based historically, and often community-based, that need support and need to be pulled in.  This is not an individualised problem; it is a large-scale social problem for which we need a large-scale social response.</p><p> I will stop speaking and ask my colleagues to come in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.567" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alison Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021110300002#K00200"><p>I thank Ms McDermott.  I wish to respond as well, if I may.  I spoke earlier about how domestic violence refuges have developed over the years from community activists fundraising and trying to find money.  There has not been a dedicated response from the Government or the Department.  Then, unfortunately, your service gets split out into different sections and so on and you are looking to this place for this and that place for that.  Several of us have reporting structures to different Departments, which is time-consuming, resource-intensive, etc.  It does not lead to a standard approach to the services provided.  Women go to refuges across the country and their experience of one refuge may be different from their experience of another because the policy and the service provision will be different, even down to how long they can stay.  That is a big challenge in how we provide those services.  A dedicated Department to look at this is what is needed; otherwise, we will continue as we are, a lot of the time trying to develop these services out of what is there and what we can scrape together.  That is not the future we want for the provision of domestic violence services.</p></speech>

I was going to add to what my colleagues have said both in their recent responses and previously.  Thinking about people being subjected to domestic violence and abuse, the systems and the journeys they have to take to try to become safe and free of the abuse and to overcome all the other issues that arise once they may even have left an abusive relationship, that does not mean that the abuse ends and that they are totally free from the impact of it.  Thinking about the need for housing, welfare and a statutory maintenance agency, a proper response from the courts, the Garda, the health service and Tusla is needed.  Thinking about all those people who need to be around the table to respond properly to this issue, we believe that locating that issue within a single Ministry, or indeed having a Minister with responsibility for it, will bring about the leadership and drive needed to create a proper, co-ordinated and effective response.  At the moment everything is siloed and you do not get a proper response.  As for agencies such as ours that provide front-line services but also try to effect system change, from the problems we are hearing on the ground from callers and people using our face-to-face services, we often find ourselves going to each of those places to try to improve responses from the ground up.  Sometimes you can be doing that for a very long time.  It would be fair to say that change comes slow in this country.  We have been doing that for a very long time.  We need something radical, and this is a radical but a very well thought-out suggestion.  I just hope that the couple of processes that are in train, with the third national strategy on gender-based violence due in the new year, the audit of responses that has been published already and the accommodation review, we are in a position where real change can happen.</p></speech>

In her submission there is no mention of children.  How many men leave abusive homes with children?  That is vitally important because it is stark that the Women's Aid submission is all about women and children but in the Men's Aid submission there is no mention of children.  Could Ms Bentley comment on that?</p></speech>

To date, they have found accommodation themselves with either family or friends.  We do have dads with children.  They took cover in hotels etc. during Covid if they could not sofa-surf.  It is not that they do not exist; they are hidden and invisible.  The dads and children have the same plight, experience and journey as the women and children, predominantly.  I think we are all gathered here tonight to emphasise that we are all holding back a social pandemic literally with Sellotape.  We are all trying our best but, because this is not all co-ordinated for all the reasons Ms McDermott, Ms Graham, Ms Sherlock and Ms Marmion have outlined, it really is a pandemic.  I would call this a national emergency because, for us, with Covid and the restrictions easing, we are seeing the increase only now, so I am not looking forward to 2022.  Likewise, we are looking at our three-year and five-year strategies now because we are really getting the heat of this only now because we have come out of lockdown.  Yes, the male victim is there; it is about encouraging him to come forward, breaking down those silences and finding solutions to stop the silence for all victims.</p></speech>

Perhaps any of the witnesses who wanted to come in on that who did not get to speak can come back a little on the points later.  I think all the members of the committee who are present and who wish to speak have now come in, so I will move on.  We have a great interest in this topic, which is very encouraging, and we have a number of Deputies who are not members of the committee who wish to come in.  I have noted the following in the following order: Deputies Cronin, Tully, Harkin and Murnane O'Connor.  If there are any other Members of the Oireachtas on the call who wish to come in but who have not yet indicated, I ask them to do so before the end in order that I can include them in the speaking order.</p> <p>  Now I move to Deputy Cronin.  You have seven minutes, Deputy.</p></speech>

I listened intently.  Unfortunately, I am not a member of the committee so I did not receive the opening addresses but I listened to their presentations, for which I thank them.  I am a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy in north Kildare.  My comrade in south Kildare wanted to join the meeting as well but, unfortunately, she had another meeting to attend.  We have a refuge in Kildare town, Teach Tearmainn, that has done excellent work and we are extremely lucky to have that service for our women and children, but we need vastly more.  We need more places, more services, more refuges and more accommodation.  Particularly with the pressures we all faced in the lockdown, and sufferers of domestic violence with abusive partners more than most, psychologically, it is critical that our women in north Kildare know they have a place to go to and that the service providers have the comfort of knowing they can respond to women in crisis.  I know that Teach Tearmainn has been working with the LEADER partnership in Kildare on a feasibility study for the additional stepdown beds it is looking for.  Is this a big problem the witnesses come across, that there is nowhere to go and that people are told when they have spent a certain length of time in a refuge that they are being sent into homeless services?</p> <p>  We also have a severe lack of refuges in the midlands.  Only last year I dealt with a woman who did not want to stay in Kildare.  She wanted to leave, so I put her in touch with somebody I know in Louth because she did not want to stay too close to where she was previously.</p><p>Is that a problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.578" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alison Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021110300002#L00200"><p>I will respond to that.  There are women throughout the country who cannot stay in their own areas.  Ms Marmion may have touched on this earlier.  Unfortunately, in recent years it has become increasingly difficult for women to leave their own areas and to go to a refuge in another area because trying to source follow-on accommodation in the new area is impossible as a result of local authority regulations, housing lists etc.  We have spoken about the lack of refuge spaces, but the problem then is the lack of accommodation after refuge.  Quite often, we in Saoirse find that women are staying longer in what is crisis refuge accommodation because there is no move on for them.  They are homeless.  They cannot go back to what had been their home for various reasons and then there is no move on.  We have come across families going into hotel accommodation from refuge because they have nowhere else to go.  It is a widespread problem.</p></speech>

Even as we speak, there are families in refuge accommodation who are ready to move forward but they are prevented from doing so by the lack of move-on options.  On their journey towards refuge, sometimes insecure tenancies, a lack of choice and a lack of available accommodation solutions propel them to refuge accommodation.  From pre-refuge experience to post-refuge experience, the lack of suitable, affordable, quality accommodation across various tenures is highly problematic.  If we were to remedy those, we could take the pressure off refuge to a certain degree.</p></speech>

Hence the real importance of an integrated cross-government response where we are all clear about the responsibilities and who leads which part, ensuring that we have a cohesive and coherent response to women and children across a variety of accommodation solutions.  We are always very conscious that each person has their own individual journey and they require different things at different parts of their journey.  We also need to have creative responses for them.  Our experience working on the front line with women and children is that their needs can change across decades even.  We need to ensure we have a fluid response that is tailored to their individual needs.  There are great opportunities to develop that.</p></speech>

The reason I wanted to attend is that I also represent the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and I am very aware of the lack of emergency accommodation available to at-risk women in this constituency.  It is a large rural constituency which does not have a single refuge.  Three staff are employed to assist vulnerable women.  Like other speakers, I commend the work they do in the domestic abuse services.  One of the main reasons that women or men do not leave abusive relationships is the lack of affordable available accommodation to enable them to be rehoused at short notice.  Is there any indication that a refuge will be provided in either Cavan or Monaghan?  It would be preferable if there were refuges in both counties.  I am conscious that a refuge is not the entire answer and other supports are also needed.  I welcome what Ms McDermott said about the initiative being taken in Cavan.  I would like to hear more about that.</p> <p>  As other speakers have mentioned, better co-ordination of services is required, preferably under one Department.  Do the witnesses have any indication that something like this is being considered?  Do they think it can be achieved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-03a.586" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary McDermott" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021110300002#L01000"><p>I might respond to that.  The simple answer to that is &quot;No&quot;.  There are many moving parts and policy responses involving the Garda, the Judiciary, the family courts and welfare.  We worked very positively with the Department of Social Protection on introducing the wonderful domestic violence rent supplement.  We have had major blocks with housing and accommodation.  It is just an absolute block.  We also have difficulties with health and education in terms of really taking on this subject at a very profound level and addressing it directly.<br/><br/>The building of refuges can only be done at central government level.  Some of the projects we are trying to support are philanthropically driven and as a result they are restricted according to the desires of the funders and so on.  We are fighting away to ensure that is as widespread as possible, trying to make our analysis as broad as possible, trying to make our responses as robust as possible.  However, the bottom line on this is even following the accommodation review by Tusla if Ireland is to meet its Istanbul Convention recommendations to have support for one in 10,000 of the population, we would need an extra 500 units.  That goes back to Senator Ruane's earlier question on design.  We need to sit down and plan what that means and not plan it based on a 19th century Dickensian model.<br/><br/>As everyone in the room has said this evening, there is before refuge, refuge and after refuge.  There are a range of responses.  It is all about prevention.  However, that does not happen in a hidden, secret, silent and stigmatised place.  That needs to be placed front and centre in the community.  The Covid pandemic has taught us that.  I am relatively new, although I am an old hippie hack for social justice.  I can see within the network of the extraordinary work that all these services provide, it actually provides at front-line community level a moment, a visible manifestation in the public arena where this issue can be spoken about.<br/><br/>At their best, these centres could provide the beds and so forth for people <i>in extremis</i>.  However, they can also be places for young people from violent and oppressive homes and children who need therapeutic intervention.  It is not only about parents; this happens to single men and single women who are in extreme distress in a coercive and controlling relationship and need support.  That is true of all sorts of beliefs and cultural mores within our system that we are slowly phasing out.  The mother and baby homes scandal is another remnant of this - to completely put the cat among the pigeons.  This is all part of a major cultural trend that we are trying to address.  We can do that, but it needs to be designed.</p></speech>

Previously, there was always a stigma attached to it and there was a sense that people had made their beds and needed to lie in them.  There is more knowledge now and more people are seeking help and not staying in abusive relationships.</p><p>Do our guests consider that the services provided overall are standing still or are they improving?  I do not mean that as a slight on the services.  Are the supports to the services improving or standing still?</p></speech>

From my perspective, the staff are exhausted and at the point of burnout.  They are put to the pin of their collars.  We must remember that during Covid they were not afforded the status of being front-line workers in the crisis.  They maintained refuges and stayed open in the face of threats to them at a time when we did not know what the impact of Covid would be.  All services stayed open and did their absolute best to continue to provide to meet this crisis and the terrible suffering that was exacerbated by Covid.  In terms of the responses of front-line workers, the staff and everyone sitting in this room and beyond, that is almost unassailable.</p> <p>  As regards the Deputy's question on the resourcing, sustainability and robustness of the resources, that is a much more serious matter.  Sorry, I am going off on a rant again.  I will allow my colleague to contribute.</p></speech>

She is absolutely right.  What came into sharp focus during Covid were the consecutive years of lack of investment in this issue and the infrastructure.  Ms McDermott often says it is 19th century infrastructure for a 21st century problem.  Even tonight, we have heard the uncertainty in respect of funding impacts the ability to plan.  This is a contemporary observation.  I have yet to come across a service that is 100% funded for everything it does.  The services often rely on philanthropic donations.  Some of them have generated income to address the gaps they have.  I am biased because I come from a practice background, but it is not the best use of managers' time for them to have to try to raise money to fill gaps.  We need to move forward on this issue.  We need to create and deliver these responses to women and children so that we can future-proof for those who are living with this issue now.  In summation, sufficient resources are not being allocated to this issue.</p></speech>

As the meeting has worn on, we are hearing more and more of the raw reality of domestic violence.  As Ms McDermott stated, it is a very dark subject.</p> <p>  Deputies Niamh Smyth and Tully referred to the fact there is no refuge in their constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  It gives me no satisfaction to say that, in the constituency I represent, there is no dedicated refuge.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice, asked me to pass on his apologies.  He is attending a meeting of the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine but wishes to express his support and the need for dedicated refuge centres.</p> <p>  My question, which has partly been answered, is what progress, if any, is being made in the provision of dedicated refuge spaces in the nine counties in question?  I am particularly interested in the situation in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, which includes north Roscommon and south Donegal.  I know there is support from the local authorities and the Domestic Violence Advocacy Service, DVAS, but as Ms Graham and Ms McDermott stated, there is no one pot of money to which one can go.  It often starts with community groups but we need an integrated State response, which is not happening.</p> <p>  I have a difficult question to ask.  In the absence of such an integrated response, what dots can we, as legislators, join right now to try to start integrating the dispersed services that exist?  I know that is an impossible question but we are dealing with what seems to be an impossible situation.  My apologies for asking such an impossible question.</p></speech>

However, it is not as simple as that because Tusla has had great difficulty in trying to take action in the context of housing along with the various bodies that control housing, such as the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and so on.  This is a large-scale problem that needs to be responded to structurally.  The simplest thing I can say in response to the Deputy's question is that there has to be a really deep commitment that is acted upon to integrate services and policy, allocate a budget and roll out a systematic response.  From our point of view, we favour a slowing down of the process to ensure the design is correct, rather than simply lashing up a load of white elephants that do not meet the demands of this problem in the 21st century.  The bottom line is that this is about political will.  We are afraid it is no deeper than that.  My colleagues may have more practical responses to make.</p></speech>

As I said, it is an impossible question, but I think Ms McDermott got it in one.  This is about political will to deal with this issue.</p> <p>  I will refer to some specifics.  Has there been any expansion or extension of the emergency rent supplement pilot programme?  How is it working?  Senator Ruane referred to the safe at home sanctuary scheme.  The idea is quite new to me.  Are there models of good practice in other countries in the context of this type of model?  As Ms McDermott stated, it is not just about refuge.</p></speech>

As regards the safe at home initiative, there are promising findings coming out of countries such as the UK, where they have been working with this measure for some time.  Essentially, it is about helping those who are experiencing abuse to stay in their current home, thus helping them to maintain some kind normality in terms of employment or children continuing to go to school, for example.  It is a principle that is well evidenced in human rights discourse.  In effect, it works through interweaving legal judiciary policy and, sometimes, extended safety measures to maximise safety.  Where it works, it works really well.  There is a cautionary note to be struck in that regard because it has been working really well for women - they tend to be older women and tend not to self-report a disability - but it does not work for every woman.  It depends on the individual needs of the woman.  There are clear reasons people are often safer to move on completely, such as the level of the threat.  There are several variables that determine the success or suitability of the initiative.</p></speech>

It is sad to see these cases in 2021.  It is something we have to rectify.  I raised this matter the week before last in the D&aacute;il with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  I am a proud Carlow woman, but Carlow does not have a women's refuge.  It is a concern.  The Minister told me that the review is being done.  Is there a timescale for the review?  Who is participating in the review?  I will give an example, and I am dealing with this regularly.  When somebody comes to me at the weekend I always find that I am caught.  Women's Aid is not open and the local authority is not open.  Where do I go?  This is becoming a serious issue for me.  There is nowhere to go if it happens at the weekend.  At least, during the week I can advise somebody to go to Carlow Women's Aid or we can go to the local authority and try to get the person emergency bed and breakfast accommodation for a few nights until the situation can be resolved.  How can we put some type of structure in place?</p> <p>  Local authorities can play a far bigger role.  There are 31 local authorities and they deal with housing.  Years ago, as the witnesses know, particularly those from Safe Ireland, it was always the local authority that would buy a house and it was always through housing that a refuge would be considered.  Now we have no structure and we do not know, as the witnesses said, who is responsible and who will get a house and who will try to get some type of building for a refuge.  That is an issue for me.  In defence of Carlow County Council, it leased a house which could accommodate two families but the problem is that during Covid it became a major issue because only one family could be accommodated.  We need to look at emergency services.  When something happens over the weekend, we do not have anywhere for people to go when we are trying to find some help for them.</p> <p>  The other issue, and this has been raised, is that we need to have greater awareness.  It has increased more with Covid.  I know women who are nervous.  I do not know whether it is that they do not want their friends to know or something else.  Do we need to consider an awareness campaign?  Can women in the Oireachtas play a bigger role in raising awareness and engaging in a campaign?  How can we make a difference?  I have to speak about men too.  The witnesses spoke about men, and I realise it is for men and women.  However, I think we are missing something here.  We should consider having a Minister with responsibility for this area and get a structure to ensure that when a man or woman needs that help, there is a service available.</p> <p>  Are all the different services, be it Women's Aid or others, fully staffed?  Are there sufficient staff for them?  Do we need to look at extra staffing?  I believe there could be staffing issues.  There is so much that has to be done here.  As Deputies and Senators stated, and I have been dealing with sad cases, including children, now is the time for change.  It is 2021 and we are approaching 2022 and we cannot have a society where a woman or a man has nowhere to go if he or she needs this help.  We cannot allow this to happen anymore.</p> <p>  I again thank the witnesses.  Now is the time for change and we need to make that change.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for her questions.  First, on whether we are fully staffed, in 2020 Men's Aid supported approximately 5,500 contacts with two full-time and four part-time staff and no refuge.  The Deputy spoke about meeting somebody on a weekend.  We never had the option of refuge in 2020.  I can only speak for our organisation with regard to staffing.  Our service level agreement is similar.  We do not know if our funding is guaranteed month to month so we will find out in January or February.  We do not know what the funding will be to hire and secure staff to join the team, so it is difficult to plan there as well.  Considering the pandemic and that it is such a social issue, our contracts are predominantly year on year and almost at minimum wage, yet the front-line teams are changing and saving the lives of the most vulnerable people and children in our society.  We are the third sector.  Certainly, none of us is in it because of our package or anything like that, and absolutely not in terms of staffing.  Men's Aid is not even staffed to do the key work with anyone even though we know those people are there and we support them daily and weekly.  We have a lot to do.</p></speech>

Perhaps Ms McDermott and Ms Marmion would have a greater insight into the plans for refuge provision in that county.  Women's Aid operates the national freephone helpline which is open 24 hours a day and seven days a week.  It offers some level of support outside office hours to people who are experiencing this type of abuse.  The male advice line run by the Men's Development Network also has opening hours over the weekend, as a point of information.</p> <p>  I will talk about the issue of stigma and shame.  It can prevent people from coming forward.  The all-too-prominent fear of people knowing one's business, treating the person in a different way or blaming the person for what is happening is very prevalent.  We hear that from women using our services and we heard it when we carried out a survey of service users a few years ago.  What is very worrying is that we heard it again from younger people when we carried out a survey of 18-year-olds to 25-year-olds last year.  That survey told us that one in five young women and one in five young men experience abuse from an intimate partner and in 50% of the cases involving women the abuse started before the age of 18 years.  We are talking about young people in their first romantic relationships experiencing this type of abuse at the same level as we know it exists in wider society.  Those fears - stigma, shame and fear of not being believed - are still there.  They are the top reasons that the majority of the people did not tell anyone, be it family members, general practitioners or helplines, what was happening to them.  They did not tell anyone.  It is an issue that still exists and is ongoing.  I do not wish to be too hopeless about it because we always try to provide hope, but it is an urgent issue that needs to be addressed.  It is not going away.</p></speech>

I was at another meeting so I missed most of the presentations.  I will generalise about my thinking.  I listened to Ms McDermott speak about the absolute right to have a home.  I agree with her.  Unfortunately, where I come from in south Kildare, there are many people who do not have that.  They are so beaten down and they are finding it difficult to access services.  That is not the fault of the service; it is just that it is very limited.  We also have to be aware that, as others said, the staff are absolutely exhausted.  I do not doubt that.  I am dealing with both males and females who come to my office.  They are really struggling.  It is extremely difficult to sustain housing after being in a situation like this.  What can we do within the local authorities?  Can we approach them to try to help?  Where can we go?  I am very aware of how difficult it is for people to move out of the situation.</p> <p>  I am rushing because I am due to be in the D&aacute;il Chamber in a few minutes.  I am also concerned about the education of children where they fall into that category.</p><p>When we talk about schools, we are not only talking about education.  Many children depend on schools for a warm breakfast or whatever is provided at lunchtime.  I want to see what I can do in south Kildare to help.  At the moment, we need more public housing to be built to sustain what needs to move forward from the refuges.</p></speech>

The Deputy should ask anyone to whom she speaks, regardless of the domain in which that person works, whether it is in housing, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, social work, education, health or anything else, if there is a dedicated line for domestic sexual and gender-based violence.

There is no national daily strategy in terms of how local authorities respond to victims of domestic violence, whether they are men or women.  It is unfortunate that is still the case.  There are many factors involved, including the lack of training for staff.  There is a lack of support and there is no strategy for local authorities that want to address these issues.  There is also a lack of passion and desire to address those issues.  In our experience, our refuge in Tallaght and our two safe houses are buildings that were given to us by the local authority, and we are thankful for that.  However, in this day and age, the services in many areas cannot get those resources from their local authorities.  They are fighting and up against a brick wall and, unfortunately, that is still the situation.</p></speech>

Ba ch&oacute;ir an t-athbhreithni&uacute; seo a bheith d&eacute;anta agus an t-aiseolas curtha ar f&aacute;il sular tugadh faoin m&uacute;nla c&eacute;anna a &uacute;s&aacute;id ag an tsraith shinsearach.<br/><br/>Baineann an dara pointe leis an gc&uacute;rsa bonnleibh&eacute;al.

I mBille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;), 2019, deirtear go mbeidh aitheantas &aacute; thabhairt don fhr&aacute;ma tagartha seo i bpr&oacute;iseas earca&iacute;ochta na hearn&aacute;la poibl&iacute; amach anseo.  D&aacute; r&eacute;ir sin, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh na sonra&iacute;ochta&iacute; ag leibh&eacute;al na sraithe sinseara&iacute; ail&iacute;nithe ar bhealach tr&eacute;dhearcach leis an bhfr&aacute;ma tagartha ionas go mbeidh comhlean&uacute;nachas ann idir na caighde&aacute;in sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais tr&iacute; ch&eacute;ile agus polasaithe earca&iacute;ochta an St&aacute;it.<br/><br/>Bunaithe ar an eolas seo agus an m&eacute;id at&aacute; sa phl&eacute;ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is, t&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir nach f&eacute;idir leis na dr&eacute;achtsonra&iacute;ochta&iacute; ardteistim&eacute;ireachta, mar at&aacute; siad leagtha amach faoi l&aacute;thair, freastal go s&aacute;s&uacute;il ar riachtanais na scol&aacute;ir&iacute; ar fad agus gur g&aacute; f&eacute;achaint ar an bhfr&aacute;ma T1 agus T2 ar&iacute;s agus ceist a chur faoina oiri&uacute;nacht don tsraith shinsearach.

T&aacute; sol&uacute;bthacht ag baint leis an ch&oacute;ras sa mh&eacute;id is gur f&eacute;idir le daoine tabhairt faoi l&aacute;nchreidi&uacute;int, is &eacute; sin na scileanna ar fad a dh&eacute;anamh, n&oacute; teastas a fh&aacute;il sa ph&aacute;irtchreidi&uacute;int, is &eacute; sin an scr&uacute;d&uacute; cainte amh&aacute;in.  Chomh maith leis sin, t&aacute; gr&aacute;dbhanda&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la laistigh de gach leibh&eacute;al.  Mar shampla, t&aacute; tr&iacute; ghr&aacute;dbhanda &eacute;ags&uacute;la laistigh de leibh&eacute;al B1 agus B2 &ndash; pas, tuillteanas agus gradam.  T&aacute; ionaid scr&uacute;duithe againn thar lear agus t&aacute; deich n-ionad againn in &aacute;iteanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la ar fud na t&iacute;re anseo in &Eacute;irinn.  Go d&aacute;ta, t&aacute; timpeall ar 10,000 iarrth&oacute;ir i ndiaidh tabhairt faoi na scr&uacute;duithe at&aacute; againn.<br/><br/>Is rud eile at&aacute; iontach t&aacute;bhachtach le aon ch&oacute;ras meas&uacute;naithe &eacute; n&aacute; go dtig le daoine brath ar na tortha&iacute; a eascra&iacute;onn as an gc&oacute;ras.  An bhfuil siad bail&iacute; agus iontaofa?  Le tac&uacute; leis sin, t&aacute; l&aacute;rionad na Gaeilge ina bhall d&rsquo;eagra&iacute;ocht ghairmi&uacute;il t&aacute;st&aacute;la, is &eacute; sin an Association of Language Testers in Europe, ALTE.  Cuireann an eagra&iacute;ocht sin treoir agus oili&uacute;int ar f&aacute;il d&uacute;inn maidir le gach gn&eacute; den t&aacute;st&aacute;il teanga le cinnti&uacute; go bhfuil na ruda&iacute; at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l againn ag teacht le dea-chleachtas idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus leis an taighde is d&eacute;ana&iacute; sa r&eacute;imse sin.  Chomh maith leis sin, t&aacute; c&uacute;ram eile ag ALTE a bhaineann le dearbh&uacute; c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta.  D&eacute;anann s&eacute; ini&uacute;chadh ioml&aacute;n ar gach gn&eacute; de na c&oacute;rais agus na pr&oacute;isis at&aacute; againn gach c&uacute;ig bliana le cinnti&uacute; go bhfuil siad ag teacht le dea-chleachtas.  T&aacute;imid iontach s&aacute;sta gur bhronn ALTE Q Mark orainn dh&aacute; uair, in 2015 agus ar&iacute;s anuraidh.<br/><br/>Cad iad, mar sin, na bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; a bhainfeadh le c&oacute;ras TEG a &uacute;s&aacute;id le haghaidh na hearca&iacute;ochta san earn&aacute;il phoibl&iacute;?  T&aacute; c&oacute;ras TEG bunaithe ar an taighde is d&eacute;ana&iacute; agus ar fhr&aacute;ma tagartha at&aacute; aitheanta go n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus go hidirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.  T&aacute; leibh&eacute;il an fhr&aacute;ma tagartha Eorpaigh luaite, mar shampla, i sonra&iacute;ochta&iacute; na sraithe s&oacute;iseara&iacute; don Ghaeilge agus in Languages Connect: Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for Foreign Languages in Education 20172026.  In &aacute;it t&eacute;arma&iacute; scaoilte ginear&aacute;lta ar n&oacute;s &ldquo;Gaeilge l&iacute;ofa&rdquo; n&oacute; &ldquo;Gaeilge mhaith&rdquo;, cuireann an fr&aacute;ma tagartha bonn eola&iacute;och faoin obair chun a chinnti&uacute; go mb&iacute;onn comhthuiscint ann maidir le br&iacute; na leibh&eacute;al &eacute;ags&uacute;il teanga.  Anuas air sin, t&aacute; an cur chuige ar a bhfuil TEG bunaithe ag teacht le cleachtais idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta i dtaca le riachtanais teanga de, mar shampla, sa Bhreatain Bheag.

D&uacute;irt na saineolaithe sin:</p><blockquote>	The Welsh Government should adopt a single national standard Welsh language proficiency framework to be used by the whole of the public sector in Wales.<br /><br />The framework should be based on the ALTE framework with clear definitions of the meaning of the different levels of proficiency that are consistent, for example, between a Health Board and a Local Authority.  This would ensure consistency across the various sectors and facilitate bilingual workforce planning. </blockquote><p>Chomh maith leis sin, is f&eacute;idir le TEG seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in a chur ar f&aacute;il i dtaca leis an leibh&eacute;al teanga a bheadh de dh&iacute;th i r&oacute;il agus i gcomhth&eacute;acsanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la, rud a chabhr&oacute;dh le heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; agus Ranna Rialtais saini&uacute; ceart a dh&eacute;anamh ar na riachtanais teanga at&aacute; acu.  I ndiaidh leibh&eacute;il &eacute;ags&uacute;la a leagan s&iacute;os ag brath ar riachtanais an phoist, is f&eacute;idir scr&uacute;duithe &eacute;ags&uacute;la a chur ar f&aacute;il d&aacute; r&eacute;ir sin, mar shampla, an scr&uacute;d&uacute; cainte amh&aacute;in n&oacute; scr&uacute;d&uacute; scr&iacute;ofa amh&aacute;in.<br/><br/>Is &eacute; an bunt&aacute;iste is m&oacute; a bhainfeadh le c&oacute;ras TEG a &uacute;s&aacute;id sa chomhth&eacute;acs seo n&aacute; gur deimhni&uacute; iontaofa, neamhsple&aacute;ch a bheadh ann ar chumas teanga gach oibr&iacute;.  Chinnteodh s&eacute; lean&uacute;nachas, tr&eacute;dhearcacht agus cothroma&iacute;ocht ar fud an ch&oacute;rais.  T&aacute; c&oacute;rais mhonat&oacute;ireachta agus caighde&aacute;naithe i bhfeidhm ag TEG sa tsl&iacute; is gur f&eacute;idir linn seasamh leis na tortha&iacute; agus na c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta&iacute; a bhronntar.<br/><br/>Is fi&uacute; a lua freisin go bhfuil maoini&uacute; &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il ag an Roinn Turas&oacute;ireachta, Cult&uacute;ir, Eala&iacute;on, Gaeltachta, Sp&oacute;irt agus Me&aacute;n do ch&oacute;ras TEG.

Chinnteodh s&eacute; go mbeadh na caighde&aacute;in ch&eacute;anna ag baint leis an sol&aacute;thar sin ar fud na hearn&aacute;la.  Is den dea-chleachtas &eacute; go mbeadh an c&oacute;ras meas&uacute;naithe neamhsple&aacute;ch sa mh&eacute;id is nach mbeadh s&eacute; ceangailte go d&iacute;reach le haon sol&aacute;thra&iacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; ach go bhfeidhmeodh s&eacute; mar shlat tomhais neodrach a thac&oacute;dh le hobair na ngr&uacute;pa&iacute; ar fad a chuireann oili&uacute;int ar f&aacute;il.

T&aacute; Conradh na Gaeilge chomh buartha sin go raibh air coiste oideachais a chur le ch&eacute;ile agus ansin an bheirt ollamh a tharraingt isteach - n&oacute; ollamh amh&aacute;in agus F&iacute;ona leis na teidil uilig at&aacute; aici - agus an pl&eacute;-ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is a chur le ch&eacute;ile.  Mar a d&uacute;irt F&iacute;ona, is liosta le h&aacute;ireamh at&aacute; sa liosta m&oacute;r bearna&iacute; at&aacute; i gceist.  T&aacute; s&eacute; deacair &eacute; sin a chloiste&aacute;il agus t&aacute; s&eacute; deacair d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis nuair at&aacute;imid ag caint faoi theanga at&aacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach sin, pr&iacute;omhtheanga na t&iacute;re.  B&iacute;onn muid ag caint faoin strait&eacute;is 20 bliain, an plean gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta agus an Bille nua.  T&aacute; s&eacute; deacair.  An f&eacute;idir leis na finn&eacute;ithe m&iacute;ni&uacute; dom c&eacute;n chaoi ar tharla s&eacute; seo?  T&aacute; pr&oacute;iseas comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in ar si&uacute;l agus spriocdh&aacute;ta i gceist i ndeireadh na m&iacute;osa seo agus de r&eacute;ir mar a thuigim, n&iacute;l aon duine ar an talamh s&aacute;sta.  An moladh m&oacute;r at&aacute; Conradh na Gaeilge ag cur os &aacute;r gcomhair n&aacute; &ldquo;go gcuirfidh an CNCM aon chinneadh ar shonra&iacute;ocht nua don Ghaeilge sa tsraith shinsearach ar leataobh go dt&iacute; go mbeidh an t-athbhreithni&uacute; ar an tsraith sh&oacute;isearach d&eacute;anta agus tortha&iacute; an athbhreithnithe curtha ar f&aacute;il.&rdquo;  C&eacute;n chaoi ar tharla s&eacute; sin, go h&aacute;irid agus &eacute; r&aacute;ite go soil&eacute;ir sa pholasa&iacute; don oideachas Gaeltachta go mba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an t-athbhreithni&uacute; agus na tortha&iacute; istigh roimh aon turas eile a dh&eacute;anamh le hathruithe?  Beidh ceist n&oacute; dh&oacute; eile agam ach t&aacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh m&iacute;ni&uacute; a fh&aacute;il ar c&eacute;n chaoi ar tharla s&eacute; seo ar dt&uacute;s.</p></speech>

Beidh orm labhairt ar bhealach beag&aacute;in&iacute;n n&iacute;os ginear&aacute;lta maidir leis an gcoiste a bh&iacute; muid ag d&eacute;anamh comhord&uacute; air.  Th&aacute;inig gr&uacute;pa&iacute; le ch&eacute;ile.  T&aacute; gr&uacute;pa oibre faoi leith curtha ar bun chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na sonra&iacute;ochta&iacute; ach t&aacute; an gr&uacute;pa oibre sin ag teacht &oacute;n m&oacute;r-ghr&uacute;pa at&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;anamh comhord&uacute; air a bhaineann le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais tr&iacute; ch&eacute;ile.  N&iacute; h&eacute; seo an ch&eacute;ad bhagairt don teanga agus t&aacute; an coiste sin ag iarraidh d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na ceisteanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la.  Mar shampla, bh&iacute; an tOllamh P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Duibhir os comhair an choiste seo n&iacute;os luaithe sa bhliain ag caint faoi ch&oacute;ras na nd&iacute;ol&uacute;int&iacute;.

T&aacute; s&eacute; sin le feice&aacute;il ar&iacute;s agus ar&iacute;s eile.  Mar shampla, t&aacute; comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n ar si&uacute;l faoi l&aacute;thair ag an CNCM maidir leis an gcuraclam bunscoile agus t&aacute; moladh ann go mbeadh an l&iacute;on ama a chuirtear ar f&aacute;il do mh&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge laghdaithe, gan aon anail&iacute;s d&eacute;anta ar an uair dheireanach a rinne siad laghd&uacute; ar an m&eacute;id ama at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il do mh&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge chun an tr&iacute;&uacute; teanga a thabhairt isteach.  T&aacute; na coincheapa seo ar fad go maith &oacute; thaobh oideachas a leathn&uacute; ach n&iacute;l siad ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il san &aacute;ireamh an m&oacute;r-phicti&uacute;r a luaigh F&iacute;ona maidir le i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; a bheith i gceist leis an teanga n&aacute; d&iacute;reach &aacute;bhar scoile.  T&aacute; an coiste sin ag feidhmi&uacute; agus ag breathn&uacute; ar na bagairt&iacute; n&oacute; na deiseanna a thagann chun cinn go rialta.  Thosaigh an gr&uacute;pa oibre ag obair ar an gceist seo, ag aithint go raibh m&oacute;r-fhadhbanna ag baint l&eacute;i.</p> <p>  N&iacute;l mise anseo mar shaineola&iacute; oideachais ach mar dhuine a bh&iacute;onn ag iarraidh daoine a thabhairt le ch&eacute;ile agus an cleachtas a chur chun cinn, ach t&aacute; mise buartha go dtiocfaidh molta&iacute; ar ais chun tweaking a dh&eacute;anamh ar na molta&iacute; at&aacute; istigh sa ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is T1 agus T2.  Mar shampla, t&aacute; comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n &eacute;igin ar si&uacute;l faoin liosta litr&iacute;ochta faoi l&aacute;thair agus t&aacute; siad tar &eacute;is tos&uacute; le rud &eacute;igin luath ar an tsraith sh&oacute;isearach fi&uacute;, mar a d&uacute;irt Shane, go bhfuil g&aacute; breathn&uacute; ar an rud ina ioml&aacute;ine.  T&aacute; baol ann go dtiocfaidh an CNCM ar ais agus go nd&eacute;arfaidh siad go ndearna siad iarracht anseo agus ansi&uacute;d, in ionad a r&aacute; go bhfuil fadhb mh&oacute;r ann.  Mar a luaigh an Teachta, t&aacute; gach duine ag r&aacute; n&aacute;r ch&oacute;ir dul ar aghaidh leis seo faoi l&aacute;thair.  Aon duine at&aacute; ag pl&eacute; leis na ceisteanna seo sa phobal, at&aacute; mise tar &eacute;is bualadh leo, t&aacute; siad ag r&aacute; gan dul ar aghaidh leis seo.  Sin r&aacute;ite, m&aacute; t&aacute; bu&iacute;ochas le gabh&aacute;il leis an CNCM ar rud amh&aacute;in, s&eacute; sin go bhfuil an cheist seo ardaithe anois.  T&aacute; s&iacute; os comhair an phobail agus t&aacute; deis faoi leith ann anois an rud a r&eacute;iteach agus T1 agus T2 a chur ar leataobh.  T&aacute; an oiread sin mearbhall faoi ghn&aacute;thleibh&eacute;al agus ardleibh&eacute;al T1, gn&aacute;thleibh&eacute;al agus ardleibh&eacute;al T2, agus gan bonnleibh&eacute;al a bheith ann.  Motha&iacute;m go bhfuil an strucht&uacute;r at&aacute; siad ag moladh go hioml&aacute;n m&iacute;cheart ach t&aacute; molta&iacute; eile ag teacht chun cinn.  N&iacute; molta&iacute; nua iad ar fad ach t&aacute; siad ann agus t&aacute; siad ar an mbord, agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur seo an deis is fearr a bheidh ann riamh chun breathn&uacute; ar an gc&oacute;ras agus &eacute; a cheangal leis an bhfr&aacute;ma tagartha, mar shampla, mar tagann sin leis an bpolasa&iacute; St&aacute;it.  Is f&eacute;idir breathn&uacute; air &oacute; thaobh an cur chuige a bheadh ann, b&iacute;odh sin an rogha le dh&aacute; &aacute;bhar don ardteistim&eacute;ireacht n&oacute; an ceann le point&iacute; b&oacute;nais.  Dar nd&oacute;igh, bheadh an rogha le point&iacute; b&oacute;nais n&iacute;os &eacute;asca &oacute; thaobh cl&aacute;r ama scoile agus gach rud a chur i bhfeidhm agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeadh an ceann eile beag&aacute;in&iacute;n n&iacute;os deacra.</p> <p>  Bh&iacute; pointe an-mhaith ag Shane go gcaithfimid breathn&uacute; ar an nGaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais ina ioml&aacute;ine.  Faoi l&aacute;thair, t&aacute;imid ag labhairt faoin ardteistim&eacute;ireacht agus t&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite ag c&uacute;pla duine cheana f&eacute;in nach f&eacute;idir linn labhairt faoin tsraith sh&oacute;isearach mar nach bhfuil an taighde d&eacute;anta air agus n&iacute;l a fhios againn faoi.  T&aacute; moladh &aacute; chur chun cinn le tamall anuas gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh muid ag breathn&uacute; air seo &oacute; th&uacute;s go deireadh.  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge difri&uacute;il &oacute; &aacute;bhair eile mar go bhfuil s&eacute; ann &oacute; th&uacute;s go deireadh.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach mbeadh muid ag breathn&uacute; ar rud &eacute;igin at&aacute; ceangailte le ch&eacute;ile &oacute; th&uacute;s go deireadh?  D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh leis an bhfr&aacute;ma tagartha.

Is &eacute; an moladh at&aacute; d&eacute;anta anseo n&aacute; go mbeadh c&uacute;rsa na hardteistim&eacute;ireachta bunaithe air freisin.
