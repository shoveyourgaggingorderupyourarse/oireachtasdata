He is joined by Ruth Foley, deputy director of audit.  We will have a private session in the afternoon to review a discussion document.  I propose that we use a relatively short period to deal with correspondence and then proceed to our engagement with the HSE and the Department of Health.  We have received apologies from Deputies Pat Deering and Alan Kelly.  We are holding over the minutes and will come back to them shortly.  The next item I want to get clearance from the committee in connection with is No. 3, a motion on the second periodic report relating to NAMA.  We discussed this at the last meeting.  It relates to the terminal surplus and possible consideration of NAMA's activities after its wind-down.  We agreed that we have to put a formal motion to the D&aacute;il to discuss this matter.  The clerk circulated wording last Friday regarding our recommendation for a D&aacute;il debate on the wind-down of NAMA.  The motion is:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann notes the report of the Committee of Public Accounts entitled Periodic Report No.2, November- December 2017, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 28 March 2018; and, in particular, the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations that the D&aacute;il should debate- the utilisation of NAMA&rsquo;s projected terminal surplus and<br /><br />- the orderly wind down of NAMA or the possible consideration of NAMA for other specific purposes</blockquote> <p>It is in my name as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Is it agreed to lay that before the D&aacute;il?  There will be a debate on it in the D&aacute;il on a Thursday afternoon in the weeks ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-22a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018112200002#B00300"><p>I am okay with that because it is neutral enough.  The Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il yesterday that all of the NAMA surplus will be used to pay Government debt.  That is the understanding of Government.  I do not think it should be spent that way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-22a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018112200002#B00400"><p>This goes back to the report that we issued on 28 March.  We recommended that there should be a D&aacute;il debate on the projected terminal surplus of NAMA on the basis that NAMA is so unique that there are no EU rules on it.  There is no requirement in EU rules to pay down Government debt.  It is a domestic political decision.  We cannot prevent the Government from having a view but we did not make a formal decision either way because there could be mixed views on the final surplus.  It could be used partially for debt and partially for investment, or whatever.  Let us have a debate and present the committee's point of view.  There is nothing preventing individual parties from coming back with their own motions but the committee, in our last report in March, did not say anything either way.  We said there should be a D&aacute;il debate because we feel that is lacking.  We have an announcement from the Taoiseach on his views but there are other views that have not been discussed in the D&aacute;il.  This has never been debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il and I think the committee-----</p></speech>

We included it in our report.  Let us have a D&aacute;il debate on it.  That is as far as the committee can put it.  We cannot decide policy.</p></speech>

It is an open discussion on that.  The thought that NAMA would be used for other purposes came from other sources.  I think it came from the Government.  We are not endorsing that but simply saying to discuss it.</p></speech>

I do not think one can amend the motion.  I am trying to visualise what direction will come from the D&aacute;il from that debate on either of those two things.</p></speech>

This is the wording we put in our report six months ago.  We are now saying we should discuss the wording.  It does not make a particular indication on the future use of NAMA's potential surplus because we have no authority to do so.  We are saying that what needs to happen, which has not happened in Irish public life to date, is a D&aacute;il debate on the matter.  I might have a different view from the Deputy in the D&aacute;il Chamber on the matter.</p></speech>

We are all free to table amendments to say it can be done in a different way.  There will then be a debate and an amendment will be agreed.  I imagine that is how it will play out.</p></speech>

I expect this motion will be debated in early January.  If the Government tables amendments, while it is going in as a Committee of Public Accounts document, it is a broader issue once it gets to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  We will have done our bit by initiating the debate.  That is as far as we can take it.  The outcome of the debate is for the D&aacute;il to decide, not the Committee of Public Accounts.  At least we are getting the matter in there and aired.  We will have no problems if different people have different views on it once we get it to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I will present it as is.  I might express a personal view or members might express personal views.  Is it agreed to present the motion to the D&aacute;il?  Agreed.  The clerk will send the motion to the Journal Office with a view to having it added to the Order Paper.</p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first is category A, briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  Nos. 1730A and 1732A are from the HSE, enclosing opening statements and briefing documents, which we will note and publish.  Nos. 1735A and 1736A are from the Department of Health for today's meeting and we will note and publish them.</p> <p>  We have a large pile of correspondence which we have been holding over for quite a while due to the sheer volume of it.  I want to run through some today.  We will not clear it all but I hope that, next week, we will clear anything we have not cleared today.  They will be on the screens if members have not brought hard copies.</p> <p>  The first is No. 1482B.  In our previous report we included the issue of prepayments and the risk associated with them arising from the lessons learned from the Dublin Institute of Technology which paid upfront for its library services and lost over &euro;700,000.  We asked the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to look at that.  It is now recommending that the Government accounting unit of the Department will work with the Office of Government Procurement to clarify the position on upfront payments for procured services as part of general procurement.  The current rules did not prevent the current problem from happening but the Department will clarify the position for the future.</p><p>I know that the issue of upfront payments will come up again.  We will note the correspondence and publish the response to it. </p><p> The next item is No. 1486 which is a brief note.  The correspondence which we will note and publish is from the Department of Education and Skills and concerns the Thorn report on Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board.  It was received during the summer.  It is the intention of the Minister, once he has had an opportunity to consider the report fully, to arrange for its publication.  While we have discussed the issue before, we have never noted it.  It is an old letter.</p></speech>

A file has been sent to the Garda or the Director of Public Prosecutions.  How do we separate the two things?  We will need to know.  Where does it come back in here?</p></speech>

It is not coming off our agenda, on which everybody is clear.  We will keep it in our work programme and probably check on progress in January.</p></speech>

There is huge learning and the issue should be given priority.  For example, somebody asked me a practical question.  I understood from the discussion that the minutes of education and training board meetings were to be made public.  Am I correct in saying that?</p></speech>

We will note and publish the correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 1502 is correspondence received from the Department of Rural and Community Development with a date at the end of July.  It concerns a statutory review of the Dormant Accounts Fund, an issue on which we made recommendations.  It is an internal review the Department carried out.  It was completed in July and covers the general policy in the years 2013 to 2016 and 2017 to 2019.  We will note and publish the correspondence in order that anybody who has not seen the document will see it on our website.  On page 47 there is a summary of the 15 recommendations made in the review.  I will not read all of them.  We have completed our review of the Dormant Accounts Fund.  There will be a follow-through.  We will receive the minutes from the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform concerning our periodic report.  It will make for interesting reading because it was one of the poorest areas in terms of the proper management of grant funding.</p></speech>

I tried, but I found it difficult to read.  I welcome the information provided and the review.  That is the first point.  It is important to try to understand it and explain it to people.  The bottom line is that a sum in the millions is sitting in an account.  Completely outside the obligation to hold onto a certain amount, there is other money that is not being used.  I do not like to use the word "scandal", but it is not acceptable.</p></speech>

It is an old letter that was received in August.  As we have discussed it, we will note and publish it.  According to the schedule, it was held over. </p> <p>  No. 1526 is correspondence received from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE providing follow-up information.  There is so much in it that I will deal with the items one by one.  We will note and publish the correspondence today.  It is a voluminous document and I want people to be aware of what is contained in it.  I will give a quick outline.  At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 5 July we asked a series of questions to which we have now received written responses.  Members should feel free to come back in on them.  We could spend a day on this issue, but we will note and publish the correspondence and people can respond to it.  I want them to know the issues about which we asked and on which we have received information.  They include the cost variation by staff type and the reason agency staff cannot be recruited into the HSE.  I will not get into the responses.  I am letting people know that the responses contained in the letter will be published.</p> <p>  There is a response to the Hannaway report on HSE properties.  Following completion of the Deloitte report on Government arrangements for section 38 and 39 agencies, the letter also includes a breakdown of how each agency was rated.  Deloitte stated it was expected that the report would be finished in October 2018, at which stage, it would compile a composite report on the external reviews.  We will ask the HSE for a copy as soon as it is available.  </p> <p>  There is a note providing up-to-date information on community health organisation 4, about which somebody asked individually.  There is also a note on psychiatric services in the south east and bed management and overcrowding in St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny.</p> <p>  The next question we asked concerned the contract entered into with Deloitte to conduct the review.  There is a note included on the matter.  We also asked about the staffing of the national compliance unit, which is relatively new.  There was a staff complement of 12.  </p> <p>  There is a note on the number of planned and random audits in HSE agencies in 2018 to date.  There were 11 planned audits and three random audits up to the date of receipt of the letter. </p> <p>  The next issue is important in the context of our ongoing work.  We asked for a note on the introduction of a mandatory system of retraining and supervision following legal settlements without an admission of liability.  It is very much what we are talking about today, that is, medical negligence, which will probably be the subject of a report of the committee in the spring.  The first sentence states there is no mandatory retraining and supervision following legal settlements without an admission of liability, although retraining and supervision takes place.  Enough has been said for now.  It is what we all suspected and has been confirmed in writing.</p> <p>  The correspondence includes a note on the different categories of consultant in non-specialist positions who are not on the specialist register.  There is a note on the process in respect of the cath lab at University Hospital Waterford.  </p> <p>  There is a note on the assessment of needs and the provision of healthcare and plans to take steps to address the issue.  Detailed information is given on a region by region basis.  There is a detailed breakdown of the &euro;50 million inpatient transport costs by area, including a breakdown of the type of transport used, including taxis, minibuses, private ambulances or other means.  </p> <p>  There is a note on whether matters related to procurement compliance were included in the risk register.  There is also a note on the section 38 and 39 agencies that have submitted their accounts.  Last year 100% of accounts were submitted.</p> <p>  There is a note on whether matters associated with CervicalCheck were placed on the risk register in previous years.  We know that they were not.  That is something that will come up in discussions on medical negligence.  There is a detailed history of the audit related to CervicalCheck with which we are dealing on an ongoing basis.</p><p>Then there is a note on the number of protected disclosures made to the HSE.  It is indicated that 78 were received in 2017 and there is breakdown of the categories of those on page 20 of this 26-page letter.  There is a note on the provision of a cardiac cath lab laboratory in Sligo; the figures and trends regarding moneys owed by health insurance companies, which is in the order of &euro;300 million at the end of each calendar year to which we can come back; the different categories of agency staff; and the contract awarded to the private operator in Mount Carmel.  I am reading out all these headings because people forget the volume of work we cover.  I am not reading to members the responses.  There are notes on the sale of a property in respect of Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross, which is the subject to a Garda investigation and is an item on our correspondence list; the position regarding high-risk dental treatment patients; the number of unfilled posts in the HSE; the prompt payment interest and compensation paid during the course of the year; and the patient private property retained interest and where the money goes.  We will not discuss the entire detail of this, Deputy Cullinane.  I have given a sample of the 29 detailed questions we asked on the day.  The responses are now on the public record, and they contain a lot of information.  If members want to come back next week on any aspect of this or use this information, they should feel free to do so.  They may choose to use it in any event because it is public now.</p></speech>

There is a lot of correspondence there, some of which concerns that issue.  Can the Chairman clarify where we are with this?  Two weeks ago we had a hearing on it.  We dealt with a number of issues, including negligence, so it was wrapped up in that issue.  Are we doing a separate report on CervicalCheck or will this be subsumed into a periodic report?  My understanding was that we would do a separate report-----</p></speech>

I also understood we would work with the health committee to work out lines of demarcation, that is, what the committee is dealing with and what we are dealing with.  I am just concerned this work is scattered at the moment.  There is no cohesion to what we are doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-22a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018112200002#D00500"><p>This would be up to the committee to decide, but we need to do a report on the issue of medical negligence, which involves a bill of &euro;2 billion facing the taxpayer.  This bill goes up every year and no one pays a blind bit of heed to it.  The Deputy will see in the correspondence that there is no mandatory training.  CervicalCheck could certainly be a significant chapter in that report.  We may do our own special report distinct from the periodic report on medical negligence after we complete-----</p></speech>

When the scandal first broke, we had three or four hearings, and then when the Scally report was published, we had one hearing but we did not get into the report and the issues within it that relate to our work.  I had sought a report or some sort of scoping exercise on what we will do and the areas of the Scally report we can deal with and then a comment from a process and procedural perspective or a systems failure perspective.  I am a little concerned that we are dealing with the matter here and there but there is no coherence to what we are doing.  I would prefer if we knew what we were doing, if there was a clear focus and if a report came through the other end of the process and was not subsumed into a periodic report or a report on negligence.  That is part, but only a small part, of the CervicalCheck issue.</p></speech>

We probably need an information note that pulls together precisely a suggested roadmap for us for completion of our work on the matter.  We will come back and discuss that.  I do not know the answer-----</p></speech>

Was that done?</p></speech>

We had touched on the issues previously.  The work will be done in consultation with the health committee in order that there is no duplication and everything is covered.  We will get that note for the members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-22a.59" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018112200002#D01000"><p>A couple of issues have been raised.  We had been talking about the large contingent liability before the CervicalCheck cancer scandal broke.  That was the work we were going to do.  In many ways the two issues have become conflated but it has been a useful example to tease out with the likes of the State Claims Agency, SCA, the Department of Health and the HSE in seeking to understand exactly what the process is when a scandal happens.  One of the areas we were going to examine was open disclosure and the possibility of reducing the liability by virtue of the fact that part of that liability is a legal cost liability and that if there were a different process, one could well end up with a smaller liability in some cases and still a reasonable outcome for people who have been damaged.  By conflating the two, we have taken the focus away from where it should be.  These are two very distinct issues.</p> <p>  There are many other issues, and we will deal with one later which is another example.  What is obvious - and we have not reached this point - is that if one is damaged and wants to pursue something, one is almost required to go through the SCA.  A mediated process is not available.  We will never get to the point of open disclosure if the systems are not in place to allow for an alternative dispute resolution to take place.  This is an aspect we must set apart from others and do something definitive about.  We have to come back to it with the SCA.  We have done some useful work on CervicalCheck.  Perhaps that should be pulled together so we can see what we have that is distinct from the health committee.</p> <p>  I refer to process and value for money.  We must put them into that category so we are properly within the remit of the committee.  We wrote to the SCA last week about the "lack of candour", to use the Chairman's term, regarding giving us correct information.  I have eight women telling me they still cannot get their slides. We have not received a reply yet.  Why would it take a week to reply?</p></speech>

One of the solicitors will go to the High Court and demand the slides, and that will put people through more torture and will do exactly the opposite of what we are trying to achieve, which is the resolution of these issues without having to go the courts for the want of giving us correct information when the SCA comes before this committee.  We should, therefore, make sure we receive a reply by next week, but it would not surprise me if the matter was dealt with in court before then.</p></speech>

Perhaps we need to have a discussion in private session next week.  Let us hope we have that reply in the meantime.  Both members are saying that perhaps we need to narrow our focus specifically on this matter.  We will discuss that in private session so we know precisely where we are going on this issue rather than it morphing into other issues.  The point is taken.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 1528B from Ray Mitchell which was held over from a previous meeting.  It is a note on the approach and the protocol in place for the return of the slides to the women affected.  This is an historic one, obviously.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-22a.63" nospeaker="true" time="09:00:00" ><p>Events have moved on since then and that will be very much part of our correspondence.  I am only publishing old correspondence whereas we have discussed the reality of it in the meantime.  We note that.</p></speech>

It was told by the HSE to stop providing slides.  There was then a dispute over the protocol.  We are not getting clear information.  A second protocol was to be considered after the engagement with the legal people.  When we are looking for the reply, we must note that not only is there a failure to provide slides, but even when they are being provided where there is an urgency - and it is only in those very urgent cases that it is happening - they are not being provided with the laboratory report that should accompany them.  It comes back to open disclosure and that piece of work and it will be important in that context.  This is an example of that.</p></speech>

The next correspondence is No. 1530, a follow-up from Mr. Ray Mitchell.  We note and publish that.</p> <p>  I refer back to No. 1528, attached to which is a letter dated 24 August 2018 in response to Committee of Public Accounts correspondence No. 1014 with the Department of Health seeking information following the appearance at the committee on 12 July 2018.  It deals with a note on the expansion to 7-7 for general adult mental health services, a note on the cost of hiring private investigators, the process and safeguards in place on consultant-compliance contracts.  Members might be interested in this.  They have asked about the cost of hiring the private investigators and it states on page 2 of that letter that surveillance was a proportionate exercise and not indiscriminate, that three of the lead cases were ultimately the subject of surveillance and that the HSE advised that the cost was &euro;117,853.  I am just putting that on the public record as people were interested in the cost.</p> <p>  We also asked for a note on the reasons for the non-disclosure of information in the accounts under No. 62 in respect of legal costs.  As a result of our letter and following consideration in the finalisation of the 2017 appropriation accounts in conjunction with the Comptroller and Auditor General in the context of the raising of the matter at the committee, the Department is now in a position to report in accordance with the relevant circular.  It was not publishing legal costs.  In the Department of Health in 2017, there were 70 cases totalling &euro;5.699 million and the total in the previous year was &euro;14.655 million for 138 cases.  That is in the accounts for 2017.  Following us pointing out the Government circular at the committee, information which was not clearly available is now there.</p> <p>  We asked for an explanatory note on the three different schemes available for treatment abroad and people will find that helpful.  There is also reference to the European health insurance card and the cross-border directive.  The public are a bit confused regarding the cross-border directive.  We will recirculate it.  I do not have the reference in front of me, but it was dated 24 August 2018 in reference to our correspondence No. 1014 or 1528, I am not sure.  It is good to separate the issues as people are confused between the cross-border directive and the treatment abroad scheme.  Table 6 is an up-to-date note on the national children's hospital funding and a review of the money owed by insurance companies, which I touched on earlier.  We note and publish that.</p> <p>  The next correspondence, No. 1538, is also from the HSE.  This is a short letter with a large appendix comprising hundreds of pages.  It is a copy of the records relating to the quality assurance visits, to include minutes of discussions and final reports submitted following the tests.  That relates to CervicalCheck.  We discussed this at our previous meetings but we note formally and publish that substantial document even though we have referred to it before.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1561, correspondence from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, regarding the famous retirement event for the former President of CIT and the fact that the HEA is considering the most appropriate means to recuperate the money from the college, which was not approved.  We have discussed this correspondence before but never noted and published it.  I have a note that it is held over.</p> <p>  Then there is No. 1672, which is correspondence from Professor O h&Oacute;gartaigh of the NUI on the non-competitive procurement of &euro;5.12 million.  There is a detailed scheduled on the back of that providing the breakdown.  For G4 security, it was &euro;373,000, which was probably a roll-over of a contract.  The full breakdown of the &euro;5.12 million is there.  There is an issue regarding the severance payment and out-of-office leave payroll costs of &euro;91,000.  We note and publish that and members will be free to use the information as best they can.</p> <p>  That is all I have from previous correspondence which we had not published to date and which has been sitting on our desks for the last while.  We will try to deal with the last of the unpublished correspondence next week.  I turn now to the correspondence received this week, of which there is not too much.</p></speech>

I welcome that we have a service level agreement finally, which was signed on 6 November 2018 between the Department and Galway 2020.  I need a little advice on this from the Comptroller and Auditor General, and there are many questions which I will follow up on separately.  I will not take up the committee's time on those as they are not relevant to this.  However, I will ask various questions about an Irish language officer and a rebranding which resulted in Irish being diminished.  I do not know whether the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General examined the service level agreement, but I have a specific question on monitoring.  I say this in a positive manner and welcome the agreement.  There is a proposal to have quarterly monitoring meetings, which is positive, but it is proposed that someone from the Department will be on the board of Galway 2020 and then that there will be monitoring of meetings by the Department.  How does that work?  Where does the loyalty lie for a departmental official on the board of Galway 2020, which is being monitored by the Department?  Can the Comptroller and Auditor General tease that out?</p></speech>

It came up in relation to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority where the Department had an assistant secretary on the board.  The same person was then overseeing the effective governance and control of the authority.  The relevant Department, which is now the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, made a change and the person representing it on the board was no longer involved in the oversight on behalf of the Department of the operation of the authority.</p><p>That has been established as a principle and it was accepted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that it was a better arrangement.  I do not have the detail of what has been put in place in respect of Galway 2020 but that is certainly a live issue and a matter of concern.</p></speech>

This is the performance level agreement.  It contains all sorts of conditions, which is to be welcomed.  I am not sure whether the board of directors is subject to freedom of information legislation.  I will have to check that.  If somebody here knows I would be grateful for an answer.</p></speech>

I have a difficulty around this.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General might have a chance to look at it.  I am not asking him to give a value judgment or anything in this regard but, having learned from the P&aacute;las debacle, this is the first time the Department is putting in place a procedure in Galway, which is welcome.  It is the time to do it right.  Can we have any input to improve that performance level agreement?</p><p>My last point on this is that, interestingly enough, there is a role for the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned on page 6.  I will read the paragraph:</p><blockquote>As the Department reports on all of its expenditure to the Public Accounts Committee and the Department's account is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, this agreement reserves the right and entitlement of the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine, query or audit the documentation of the expenditure of these funds at any time up to or after 2021.</blockquote> <p>That seems to be an open door up to and including 2021.  It does not involve looking at something retrospectively.  I invite Mr. McCarthy to look at that.</p></speech>

The principle that the Comptroller and Auditor General be given access to follow up on the expenditure of public funds if necessary was required in giving grants.  It is a general provision.  I welcome that it is in this agreement but it does not mean that I will be going down and vetting each decision as it is made.</p></speech>

I am raising the fact that we, as a committee, can have an input in due course.  I would like clarification on the monitoring arrangement and on where one's loyalty or duty lies as a representative on the board of Galway 2020 and a member of the Department.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General is mentioned in this performance delivery agreement.

Does he have that right in the service level agreements between the HSE and section 38 and section 39 bodies?</p></speech>

If the Comptroller and Auditor General does have access it is within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts to go there.  If he goes there, we can go there.  I am asking for a note because there has been a certain view generally.  It looks as if he can reach into several organisations if he chooses and feels there is a need to do so.  Does he know how many service level agreements give his office this right of access?  Would he be made aware of each and every one of these as they arise?</p></speech>

The Deputy has sent us a letter, No. 1733 C.  We were coming to it shortly.  It is specifically about seeking a detailed note regarding the removal of the gates in the Phoenix Park and their repair, restoration and re-erection.  It asks whether it had been discussed before it was known that there would be a papal visit.  The correspondence also says "in view of the spreadsheet of costs supplied by the OPW, the Deputy wishes to explore the way in which some companies were selected to provide services and infrastructure, were correct tender protocols and procedures adhered to, was the competitiveness of the tendering robust and so on."  We will inquire about all of that at the Deputy's request.</p><p>I will come to the letter in a moment.  We will note and publish No. 1700B.  We will also note and follow up on Deputy Murphy's request, No. 1733C.</p><p> No. 1715B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, Health Service Executive, and is dated 12 November 2018.  It deals with the transfer of properties from religious congregations to the HSE under the various agreements from 2002 and 2009.  We are on the case.  The Committee of Public Accounts will ensure progress is made.  Progress was not made for years.  Some of the properties fall under the remit of the HSE, which states that of the 2002 offers, there were two remaining properties, namely, the Sacred Heart centre in Waterford and a property in Cappoquin.  The closing documents for the property in Cappoquin were received last week from the congregation's solicitor and similar documentation for the centre in Waterford is expected soon.  It is hoped the transfers will be finalised in the next couple of months.  We will ask the HSE to provide an update in January.</p><p> In 2009, six properties were offered, of which five were accepted by the HSE, only one of which has transferred.  Four properties are outstanding.  One is the St. Bernard's Group Homes in Fethard.  The correspondence states that the transfer document has been competed and the consent of the Minister and the Charities Regulatory Authority have been received.  The property is now being registered.  That is fine.  The contract documents for the Catherine McAuley centre in Kells have been received and signed, the Minister's consent has been requested and is awaited.  The committee will write to the Minister asking that he give that consent as quickly as possible to allow this transfer to proceed.</p><p> With regard to a property on Gracepark Road, on 14 June last, the solicitors were advised by the congregation's solicitor that the contracts and title documents would issue shortly.  The documents are awaited.  The committee will write to the HSE to ask its solicitors to contact the congregation's solicitors forthwith in order that this can proceed.</p><p> On the National Rehabilitation Hospital property, the position appears a little complicated.  HSE estates say it will reach a transfer and lease-back arrangement for the National Rehabilitation Hospital lands.  This will result in a change to the National Rehabilitation Hospital Trust.  The original trust owns the land and the new trust will be involved in the sale and lease-back.  A due diligence process on the new trust has commenced and will have to be completed before the lands can be transferred.  The target date for the completion of this process is the end of 2018.  The committee will ask for a note to be provided on this issue in January.  We will keep on top of that issue.</p><p> No. 1717B is from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment regarding electricity interconnectors, the need for windmills or wind farms to produce surplus energy and what happens to this surplus.  Some of it can be exported and the Department advises that in 2017 the rate of curtailment of available wind energy was 4%.  The committee will send this detailed response on the utilisation and export of excess wind energy to the correspondent.  It has been suggested that this excess is dumped at an uneconomic price to the UK.  The reply will be of interest to many. </p><p> No. 1718B is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 12 November 201.  It relates to seeking information on the powers of the Minister and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to carry out different types of investigations.  We can note and publish this correspondence, which makes some interesting points.   It is the Department's view that the HEA has the power to review compliance with conditions when it is granting funding.  The Department states it has received the advice of the Attorney General on this issue and it is being assessed by Department officials.  A further update will be provided to the committee members as soon as possible, once the Department has finalised its assessment of the legal advice.  That is important and we will monitor that.  The letter refers to a timeline for a review of the HEA legislation and the results of a public consultation.  The consultation took place during the summer and 14 submissions were received.  A consultation forum will be held tomorrow in the Department to provide an update on the HEA legislation.  All of those who made submissions are invited.  This process will ultimately lead to heads of a Bill.</p></speech>

It is fine that there will be a review of the 1971 Act.  That was discussed when the witnesses were before the committee.  Mr. Love was concerned about the Act and its limitations in the context of the HEA carrying out reviews.  A review of that legislation would be welcome.  It seems the Attorney General's advice has been received but we do not know what it is.  The WIT report is wrapped up in all of this.  There are a number of different options.  I was not so much looking for information on what the HEA will do in respect of future reports, examinations and investigations.  All future examinations may change as a result of the review of the legislation.  There are options regarding the WIT draft report, which is in legal limbo.  One option is to modify the existing report.  Mr. Love told us it was his intention to publish the report but it may need to be modified.  There were concerns as to whether that was possible given the Attorney General's advice and the limitations of the HEA's role in doing these reviews.  The other option was a ministerial appointment.  It could be the case that the Department would have to wait for an amendment to the Act, before starting again.  My question was not less about where the process was that about what would be done with the WIT report.  I want to get a response for once and for all because this issue has dragged on.  At some point, somebody has to call it and decide what will happen with the draft report.  Will the report be modified in some way or will we start again?  If the latter is the case, what is the process for starting again?  Can we get an answer to that once and for all?</p></speech>

While that is all well and good, it does not answer the fundamental question before us.  A draft report has been in legal limbo for a year.  Separate from that, we have the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which deals with one element of what would have been contained in the HEA report.  This committee cannot follow up on that until we have some clarity on this matter.</p> <p>  I asked a question of the clerk, which I also raised at our previous meeting.  It is fine that we now have clarity that the Attorney General's advice has been received and the Government intends to change the legislation.  That is policy but what is happening with the WIT report?</p></speech>

We will note and publish this correspondence, which provides very good information.  I thank the agency for supplying it.  It gives details, by local authority, of the provision of social housing, the number of offers made by NAMA and the 2,475 housing units that were taken up by local authorities as a result.  It also provides details on the &euro;70 million funding the agency has been provided with in respect of local authorities.  It sets out details, by local authority, of the 818 houses and apartments that have been completed and bids that are in the process of being accepted.  It gives specific information on the 478 units that have been acquired and completed as part of that process, broken down between two, three, four and five bedroom houses and one, two and three bedroom apartments.</p></speech>

The Housing Agency has provided a good information note on the regulation of approved housing bodies, which is not statutory.  It has also provided a good note on land management on the 600 acres and 83 sites it owns.  It gives information on sites transferred and sites progressing where agreement to transfer is in place, and details on the various capital funding schemes to approved housing bodies and local authorities, such as the capital assistance scheme and the capital loan and subsidy scheme.  It has technical information on payment and availability agreements to purchase, lease and construct properties and the capital advance leasing facility.  For people who are following the housing debate, this is very good information.</p></speech>

However, it is a pity the agency did not provide information on the one substantive, negative issue that we raised on the day and that I raised in particular.  I asked for the locations and breakdown of the properties that had been offered to local authorities but not taken up.  The Chairman alluded to section 2 and the 2,475 units that have been delivered, which is included in the breakdown in tabular form by county.  It is a pity the Housing Agency did not provide in tabular form the location of the 2,424 properties which were deemed unsuitable by reference to location or sustainability issues.  I consistently pressed the agency on the day on the so-called, to use its word, over-concentration of certain amounts of property which made them unsuitable.  What is going on at the moment is a national scandal.  It is something for all of us to press with our local authorities.  On the day we had representatives of the Housing Agency and the Department here, I had answers from the Minister to parliamentary questions.  They were all blaming each other.  The Department jumped in to bail out the Housing Agency as well.  It is unfortunate that although we have plenty of good information, we do not have it on the issue of the 2,424 properties that the Housing Agency considered unsuitable by reference to location or sustainability based on what it calls "an over-concentration".  In some cases it was claimed there was no demand.  There are 10,000 homeless but supposedly according to the Housing Agency there is no demand in some of these areas.  It is a pity we do not have a table setting out the areas of "no demand" because it would be highly informative.  It still rankles with me in terms of the ideological debate that certain phraseology and terms can be used.  While I am on that issue, did the committee receive a response from the County and City Managers Association, CCMA, on when it will appear?</p></speech>

In respect of the Deputy's point about the 2,224 houses referred to under schedule 2, the Housing Agency did not give a breakdown by local authority of those that were considered unsuitable by reference to location and sustainability.  We will write back to the agency requesting that list.  In addition, when we get that list we will write to the Department for a breakdown by local authority as to the reasons.  In my local authority I have gone through the units that were not accepted and there were various issues.  The issue could have been financial, for example, the price, or it may have been that it would have taken too long or there was an over-concentration in an area where there was already social housing.  There may have been an offer of 50 houses in a local authority area where there was demand for only five houses.  Those are the types of issues.  We will get the list by local authority from the Housing Agency.  We will ask it to send the list to the Department simultaneously and we want the Department to give us a breakdown.  If it is a case of a local authority refusing 47 houses, we want to know where each of them was -  there would probably be four or five different locations - and why each offer was rejected.  That information is readily available in every local authority and should be readily available in the Department.  I have seen it in my local authority and we will get it.</p></speech>

We should have got that information.  I have read and I welcome the documentation, which was very helpful apart from that.  When we get that information we will be able to compare it with the existing policy of local authorities.  For instance, in Galway there is a major housing crisis so the council is going back to local authority schemes and building infill houses.  It does not see a difficulty with that.  I want to see where the inconsistency is in terms of policies. It would be very helpful to have that information.</p></speech>

It is only one page.  NAMA had given us a breakdown of where the purchasers of NAMA property sold in Ireland were from and we asked for the breakdown of all secured assets worldwide.  The letter indicates that the jurisdiction of the purchasers in respect of the &euro;24 billion of secured assets, both Irish and foreign, is as follows: 33% of the purchasers were in Great Britain; 31% were in Ireland; 9% were in the USA; 5% were in Germany; and 22% were from "other", which figure relates to 45 individual purchasers in other countries.  We will write back.  What surprised me was the figure of only 9% for US companies.  We want to know who was the ultimate owner.  A US company might have set up a company in Ireland to buy assets.  NAMA is telling us 31% of these assets were sold to Irish-based companies.  I want to know if they were part of a group.  This does not make sense to me.  NAMA is playing games with the committee.  It knows what we were looking for.  We wanted to know the ultimate owner.  The information provided does not tally with anybody's knowledge of these matters.  We know many of these companies are controlled by American vulture funds.  NAMA says only 9% of its sales are to US companies.  There is a lack of candour in the answer and we want a full answer.  We want to know the ultimate owners and NAMA has to know that.  I am sure Cerberus alone accounts for more than 9% of NAMA sales.  We want the full picture of the ultimate owners of the &euro;24 billion of secured assets purchased from NAMA.  I am finding that NAMA is not giving full answers.  It probably hopes if we give it some information, we will accept that and move on but we will not.  We have other correspondence on this. </p></speech>

People will find this very interesting.</p><p>It is very detailed information on those schools that have been examined, those that have been reopened and those on which work remains to be done.  A second schedule is provided regarding the schools delivered by that company and the overall procurement note.  That is helpful.  There is a third information note on the oversight and design and build programme, including Western Building Systems projects.</p><p> Most interestingly, we asked whether the company that got the projects was always the lowest bidder.  I will give credit to the Department for providing us the full information.  NAMA could follow its example.  We will note and publish this interesting schedule.  There are 42 schools.  The note lists the top five or six tender prices, with the winning tender highlighted in red on the chart.  People can print it off themselves, but it will be noted and published.  In many cases, it is clear that the lowest bidder did not get the contract.  A second ranking is called "Ranking of winning tenders following an EAT analysis".  "EAT" means most economically advantageous tender, which is not necessarily the cheapest tender.  It incorporates wider issues such as ability to deliver, track record and access to resources.  According to this document, price accounted for approximately 40% of the score, not 60%.  Some companies forfeited the job even though they were the lowest tender.  Perhaps they had been granted four or five projects but, because they were unable to handle them all, the project fell to the next company on the list.  Some companies had tendered for more than they were capable of handling.</p><p> We could discuss the 42 schools forever.  Everyone has an interest in those in their own constituencies.  For example, there is information relating to Portlaoise.  We will note and publish the response, which contains good information on the issue.  People are free to use the documentation as they see fit.</p></speech>

The annexes that it attached are also helpful.  We sought this information because so many schools had been affected.  The impact on children was the main concern, but process was also an issue.  The tendering process was one element of that, with oversight of the design and build programme another.  Annex 3 is important from our perspective.  It sets out who had oversight of what.  It seems that responsibility for compliance with the projects rested with the contractor.  Departmental personnel are involved in the pre-oversight arrangements.  That is where we wanted to get under the bonnet.  We requested this document in order to establish whether we would pursue and examine this matter.  It was not just to get, publish and note the document.  We wanted to get the information and then make a decision on whether to examine the tendering process, the design and build process, what compliance checks were in place and so on in order to learn from any mistake that was made.  Was that not the reason?  Now that we have the document, are we going to make that decision?</p></speech>

The committee can discuss it, but I advise people to make their comments.  The committee has done its job by getting this amount of information.

This is connected with the correspondence from the HSE, which we did not take at the time.  This gives a detailed report up to 17 October.

A letter has been received from Deputy Wallace with a further query regarding Project Nantes.  We forwarded correspondence received from NAMA to Deputy Wallace and he has reverted with queries.  We decided last week to request further details from NAMA and we will include these queries in our request.  This is about section 172, which the Deputy says should deal with associated directors of the company.  Essentially, he is saying that NAMA's response to us was not broad enough and was too tight.  The section requires no debtor involvement, but Deputy Wallace is saying that directors of the purchasing company were associated with the debtor.  He believed that the situation should have come under the section 172 declaration.  We will forward Deputy Wallace's correspondence to NAMA and ask for specific clarification on the matter.</p></speech>

We are getting information.  We cannot take all of it at face value, but many questions are being raised.</p> <p>  We were able to examine Project Eagle because the Comptroller and Auditor General did a special report.  What was the genesis of that report?  Why was Project Eagle picked out?</p><p>I would also like to ask about the Comptroller and Auditor General's work in terms of his engagement with NAMA, which he audits.  Is Project Nantes something that he has on his radar for future work?  We are getting bits and pieces here and there.  We do not really know how to handle it.  We are going over and back with NAMA.  Then we have other people almost acting in between that by telling us we should not believe something else over here.  I am trying to work out how we deal with it or do not deal with it.  Is the Comptroller and Auditor General across some of these issues?</p></speech>

Obviously, we audit the financial statements of NAMA each year.  We did not examine Project Nantes in the course of the 2012 audit.  However, it is certainly on my radar given the issues that have been raised.  I have sought information from NAMA.  I have not yet got all the information I sought.  When I have it, I will consider whether any further work, including a section 9 value for money report, might be done in relation to Project Nantes.</p></speech>

The more we examined it, the more it seemed that there were concerns that needed to be looked at in further detail.  I decided to concentrate on that by doing a value for money report on Project Eagle first.  It was intended that the process we used in that case would subsequently be used to inform our examination of other loan sales.</p></speech>

When we looked at Project Eagle, we found that many issues arose with deviations from sales practices and the management of conflicts of interest, etc.  It would be a bit naive of us to think that such issues did not arise in other loan sales.  We are now getting information on a significant loan sale.  If it is the case that the Comptroller and Auditor General is across it, that is where it needs to be done and I am happy enough that we may see something coming from that.</p></speech>

The committee can certainly have a role.  NAMA was set up arising from a failure of governance and of regulation.  When representatives of NAMA have come before us, we have expressed the most serious concerns about the lack of governance and so on in some instances.  Is it not ironic that we are here in this position all over again now?  We are struggling with an organisation that was ostensibly set up to deal with the outfall of the lack of governance, regulation, consensus and thought about things that were being done in a very wrong way.  We are back struggling in a David and Goliath position.  I have used that phrase fairly often.  We are trying to deal with little bits of information.  I do not know anything about Project Nantes other than what we have been told in the correspondence we have received.  We are struggling to get something as basic as a section 172 declaration.  Then it turns out that what we do get is not relevant and we are left in that position.  I will finish on a point that relates to disclosure and upfrontness.  There is a duty on NAMA to help us.  It was set up as a public body with public duties.  There is a bigger issue here for us.</p></speech>

There will be a debate on NAMA's expected terminal surplus.  The members of this committee will be able to raise those points in the Chamber as well as at this committee.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is seeking information.  We have gone back for further information.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has raised the whole issue of the section 172 declarations.  It does not seem to have been very well policed by NAMA.  I will put it as gently as that.

We will also be looking at the HSE's efforts to prevent medical negligence cases.  We had a meeting with the State Claims Agency on the management of medical negligence costs and open disclosure.  We have teased out many of the associated issues, to which we should not return today.  This meeting is important as it gives us an opportunity to review hepatitis C treatment, its implications and whether lessons have been learned.  What, if anything, has been learned by the HSE from hepatitis C cases?  The State Claims Agency has told us that there is an estimated liability of &euro;2.4 billion arising from active clinical claims and this figure is growing each year.  We have discussed with the agency how the figure could be reduced through open disclosure and mediation.  However, to quote the old saying, prevention is better than cure.  If costs are to be meaningfully reduced, it will only be done by ensuring there is a reduction in the number of serious medical incidents in the first place.  We need to focus on what institutional learning has taken place in the HSE and understand the changes that have been implemented as a result of cases such as those involving hepatitis C and CervicalCheck.  We need to hear what the HSE has been doing in general to reduce the risk of cases of medical negligence.  </p><p>I hope what I have said serves to frame the discussion in order that we will not move beyond that issue today with the Department of Health and the HSE.  We can come back to other broader HSE-related issues on another day.  We are here to discuss hepatitis C treatment, in particular.  We are joined by Mr. John Connaghan, director general of the HSE, who is accompanied by Dr. Colm Henry, Ms Michele Tait, Professor Aiden McCormack and Mr. Ray Mitchell.  The Department of Health is represented by the Secretary General, Mr. Jim Breslin, and his colleagues, Mr. Michael Conroy, Mr. Finian Judge and Ms Pamela Carter.  </p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee should refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.  </p><p> We will take the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement and then we will have statements from Mr. Breslin and Mr. Connaghan.  I understand that Mr. Breslin cannot attend the committee meeting this afternoon.</p></speech>

If we keep the meeting to the precise topic at hand today, we will try to complete it before the vote in order that we can do our private business in the afternoon.</p> <p>  I call Mr. McCarthy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The Health Service Executive estimates that between 20,000 and 30,000 people in Ireland may have the hepatitis C virus, many of whom may go on to have significant medical needs if they are not successfully treated.  Recent advances in the drugs used to treat hepatitis C have resulted in significantly improved treatment outcomes and the Health Service Executive has set a target to make hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026.  Each course of treatment is expensive, however, and varies between &euro;23,000 and &euro;92,000 per patient, depending on the strain of the disease.</p> <p>  Approximately 1,700 people, most of whom were women, were infected with the hepatitis C virus through the administration of contaminated blood and blood products during periods in the late 1970s and again in the early 1990s.  A number of schemes put in place to compensate and support those affected were subsequently extended to include persons similarly infected with HIV.  Expenditure on these schemes is accounted for in a variety of ways.  In undertaking this review, I wanted to compile an overview of the expenditure already incurred as a result of the contamination.  I also wanted to assess the progress being made by the HSE on its current strategies and plans for treatment of hepatitis C.</p> <p>  The expenditure in 2017 under the schemes to compensate or assist those who contracted diseases due to contaminated blood or blood products totalled &euro;36.4 million.  Between 1996 and 2017, a total of just over &euro;1.5 billion was spent.  Compensation schemes, including insurance subsidy payments, accounted for &euro;1.18 billion of that total.  Almost &euro;300 million has been spent on the provision of hospital and primary care services for those affected.</p> <p>  The HSE published a comprehensive national strategy for dealing with hepatitis C in 2012.  It included 36 recommendations covering the areas of surveillance and data collection; education, prevention and communications; screening and testing; and treatment.  The implementation of the recommendations has been mixed, with just ten considered to have been fully implemented and most partly implemented.  The national strategy noted that a comprehensive programme had been put in place for patients who had acquired hepatitis C through contaminated blood products, but recognised that the needs of those who had acquired the disease through other means had not yet been adequately addressed.  The Department of Health published a plan in 2014 for the establishment of a multi-year national hepatitis C treatment programme, which commenced in 2015.  It aims to prioritise treatment for those at greatest clinical risk.</p> <p>  Since 2015, the Department has allocated &euro;30 million a year to fund delivery of the treatment programme.  In the period 2015 to 2017, more than 2,100 patients completed treatment.  As my report was being compiled, information about treatment outcomes was available for 90% of those treated in those years.  This indicated that the treatment was successful in clearing the hepatitis C virus in approximately 94% of cases.  The majority of the annual budget allocation is used to purchase treatment drugs.  Under the terms negotiated with the drug suppliers, a percentage of the purchase price for a course of treatment is subsequently refunded in the form of a rebate.  The average cost of treatment, net of the rebate, was just under &euro;28,000 per patient in 2017.</p> <p>  It is a complex challenge to ensure treatment delivery to the maximum number of highest-priority patients in eight main treatment centres, with varying drug costs per virus strain, within a set budget, and this is further complicated by the price rebate arrangement.  In 2017, the HSE envisaged the smooth utilisation over the year of the available budget of &euro;30 million.  Payments for treatment accelerated ahead of planned levels in the second quarter, however, resulting in the majority of the available budget having been spent by the end of July.  This led to the suspension of the programme in the middle of the year and uncertainty about what would happen thereafter.  As indicated in figure 15.7 in the report, significant rebate receipts in the third quarter brought the net spending level back into line.  Figure 15.8 indicates the impact this had on treatment delivery, with significant front-loading in the first half of the year and a stop-start pattern in the second half.</p> <p>  The chapter makes a number of recommendations for management of the treatment programme.  The HSE indicated it accepted all the recommendations and I am sure the director general will be able to update the committee in this regard.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Michael Conroy of the Department&rsquo;s blood policy unit and Mr. Finian Judge of the community pharmacy policy unit, as well as the HSE director general, Mr. John Connaghan, and colleagues.<br/><br/>The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s review of hepatitis C treatment in Ireland, set out in chapter 15 of the report, provides a comprehensive overview of this issue.  I do not propose to go over that ground in detail, but I will speak to some of the issues examined in it and in particular, the compensation tribunal established for people infected by blood and blood products and the national programme for treatment of people with the hepatitis C virus.  <br/><br/>Infection of people through the blood supply was a tragedy of immense proportions, causing great pain and suffering to many people.  Approximately 1,700 people in Ireland became infected with hepatitis C or HIV through infected blood products over the period up to 1994.  These included women who received anti-D immunoglobulin, people with haemophilia, people who received blood transfusions and people being treated for renal disease.  The hepatitis C and HIV compensation tribunal was set up to compensate these individuals.  It was established on a non-statutory basis in December 1995 and on a statutory basis in 1997.  In 2002, the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act was amended to extend the tribunal&rsquo;s remit to include HIV and allow for claims by dependants of people who had been infected.  <br/><br/>The tribunal is made up of six ordinary members, all of whom are barristers and solicitors, and is chaired by Ms Karen O&rsquo;Driscoll, who is a senior counsel specialising in medical law and employment law.  The compensation tribunal is independent of both the Minister and the Department of Health.  It considers cases and makes awards in line with the legislation.  Claims are dealt with by an<i>in camera</i>oral hearing before at least two members of the tribunal or by an offer of settlement.  Claimants are entitled to be legally represented at the hearings.  The Department&rsquo;s role is to make payments in line with awards made by the tribunal.  The tribunal has heard claims continually since 1996, and it made 3,569 awards up to the end of 2017.  Expenditure is approximately &euro;25 million per year and, to the end of 2017, the tribunal had cost a total of &euro;1.18 billion, covering awards, legal fees and administrative costs.  <br/><br/>In the years since these infections were discovered, a wide range of actions were taken, based on the recommendations of the Finlay and Lindsay tribunals, to ensure the safety of the blood supply.  The Consultative Council on Hepatitis C was established in 1996, while the National Haemophilia Council was established in 2004.  Both bodies ensure those most concerned have a say in matters involving hepatitis C and the care of patients with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, documented a range of policies and procedures covering all aspects of blood transfusion screening and the implementation of these is reviewed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.</p><p>Ireland has a sophisticated testing regime for screening blood donations, which is kept under continuing review as science and technology develops.  The annual HPRA, inspection of the IBTS, a key recommendation of the Finlay tribunal, addresses compliance of its blood-related operations with relevant EU and national legislation.  The latest report, from 2017, found that the IBTS was in compliance with legislation.  No critical deficiencies which represent a risk to patients and the safety of the blood supply were identified.</p><p> On the national hepatitis C treatment programme, hepatitis C is a very serious disease.  The public health risk involved is much wider than that pertaining to those who were infected through the blood supply.  It is estimated, in line with international data, that more than 30,000 people in Ireland are infected with the hepatitis C virus, with over half of those cases undiagnosed.  It is also estimated that over 70% of people with hepatitis C are or were intravenous drug users.  In line with the recommendations of a Department of Health advisory group established by the chief medical officer, in 2015 the HSE established a national treatment programme for people with hepatitis C.  Although treatment was in place for patients before 2015, it tended to be local and without consistency of approach and outcome measurement was fragmented.  The national hepatitis C treatment programme is a multi-annual public health plan to treat all people with hepatitis C in Ireland, irrespective of the source of infection.  It is delivered in a range of healthcare settings with a view to making hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026 and eventually eliminating it.</p><p> The programme has received &euro;30 million in annual funding since 2015.  This structured, programmatic clinical approach allowed for the early and timely introduction of very expensive but cost-effective direct-acting anti-viral treatments for very seriously ill citizens, which were new treatments at that time.  The treatments are capable of effecting a cure in over 90% of cases.  The programme has a programme manager and a clinical lead who are supported by a clinical advisory group and an overall advisory committee.  As well as access to anti-viral treatment, it provides a national register to measure treatment plan outcomes; access to treatment based upon agreed clinical prioritisation in line with international criteria; a clear decision pathway for treatment access, involving patient prioritisation, registration and reimbursement approval; treatment for both State-infected and other patients; and that all State-infected patients, clinically prioritised or not, were to be offered treatment by the end of 2017 in conjunction with clinically prioritised patients being treated.  I am pleased to state that the latter goal has been met.  All State-infected patients identified as suitable for treatment have commenced or been offered treatment.  The HSE has advised a 98% success rate in this group of patients.</p><p> The HSE has consistently driven down the net cost of treatment per patient and as a result it expects to treat four times as many patients in 2018 within the existing annual budget as it did in 2015.  Among the programme's achievements are that nearly 3,000 people have been successfully provided with treatment for hepatitis C since 2015 and hepatitis C was eradicated in the Irish haemophilia population by the end of 2016.  Treatment commenced in paediatric patients in 2017.  More patients are being treated each year, up from 350 in 2015 to an expected 1,800 in 2018, as the programme achieves better value in drug procurement.  Treatment is available to all patients who are clinically prioritised, with no restrictions on availability other than treatment capacity.  Treatment is provided outside the hospital setting through HSE addiction treatment centres.  This began on a pilot basis in 2017, with plans for additional sites, including prison and homeless services.  A treatment registry has been established with the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  The current virus clearance rate at 12 weeks after treatment is over 95%.</p><p> The Irish health service is a vast undertaking delivered by people for people.  The Department recognises the overriding importance of patient safety and quality in the delivery of health services.  By any measure, the planned and programmatic treatment of hepatitis C has been very successful.  However, it is time to move to a new phase of identifying and treating at-risk individuals and populations.  The Department has received a proposal from the HSE to use some of the savings in the annual &euro;30 million budget to develop treatment capacity, which would enable more people to access services.  The Minister has given his agreement in principle to the proposed broadening of the model of care into community-based programmes, subject to details on the deployment of resources being worked out with the HSE.  This should lead to an even more comprehensive programme which will include all elements of care including screening, testing and treatment.  It will be a significant step forward in realising Irish, European and World Health Organization goals of making hepatitis C a rare disease and eventually eliminating it.  When I was before this committee in October 2015, I noted that &euro;30 million had been made available by Government to roll out the hepatitis C treatment programme and that, although we could not undo the damage of the past, it was expected that this would represent a very good use of the State&rsquo;s resources.  I am glad that the results have confirmed this to be so and that by any measure the programme has been very successful.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleagues Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer, Ms Michele Tait, programme manager of the hepatitis C programme, and Professor Aiden McCormick, clinical lead to the national hepatitis C treatment programme.</p> <p>  With the permission of the Chair, I will begin part of the way through the provided opening statement in order to avoid repetition.  The national hepatitis C treatment programme is led by a clinical lead and a full-time programme manager.  It is supported by a programme advisory group which provides oversight and strategic advice.  The group is representative of key internal and external stakeholders including researchers, public health specialists, clinicians, pharmacists and service planners and aims to ensure successful implementation of the multi-annual public health plan for the treatment of hepatitis C in Ireland over the coming years.</p> <p>  Since 2015, the national hepatitis C treatment programme has provided treatment to some 3,600 patients, beginning with those most in critical need.  The programme has commenced the extension of hepatitis C treatment away from the traditional hospital-based model where appropriate and integrating it into community-based healthcare within a number of HSE addiction treatment centres.  The initial outcomes from these programmes are extremely positive, with each patient engaging fully with his or her treatment.  Those who have completed their treatment have each received a sustained virological response, that is, a cure.  The programme is planning a further extension of treatment availability within the community setting outside of these clinics.</p> <p>  The programme has established a treatment registry, which records anonymised data relating to patients provided with treatment.  The registry monitors treatment uptake, activity, prescribing trends and patient outcomes.  It provides a platform for clinicians to register patients they intend commencing on treatment.  The Comptroller and Auditor General examination of the treatment of hepatitis C in Ireland recommended the linking of data collected through the notifications of hepatitis C under infectious diseases regulations to the national hepatitis C treatment registry.  The HSE agrees that linking these data is beneficial in planning treatment.  However, it presents a range of difficulties in terms of patient consent, data privacy and feasibility.  Our division of public health is examining the barriers that need to be overcome in relation to linkage.  The HSE is continuing to develop its existing treatment registry to ensure any patients diagnosed with hepatitis C are registered with the national treatment registry.  The Comptroller and Auditor General report also makes recommendations regarding the continued planning of treatment and monitoring uptake to ensure patients continue to be identified for treatment and linked to care in order to make hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026.  </p> <p>  On the management of and learning from serious incidents, it is the policy of the Health Service Executive that all incidents are identified, reported and reviewed in order that learning from events can be shared.  In support of this policy and based on us learning from incidents across the health service, in 2018 the HSE published its incident management framework.  It sets out elements of the systems required for a responsive and proportionate approach to the prevention of incidents and the management of and learning from incidents which have occurred.  It places considerable emphasis on the importance of learning and the sharing of this learning at all levels in the organisation, including nationally and at hospital and community levels.  When an incident occurs, services are required to carry out a rapid risk assessment and take any immediate actions required to ensure that no other person is harmed.  Following a formal review, the findings and the recommendations must then form the basis of the development of an action plan with a focus on the improvements required to reduce the risk of recurrence.  The framework stresses the importance of sharing the outcome and findings of the review with other services.  Cognisant of the criticism that some incidents recur, step 1 of the incident management process focuses on incident prevention.  There are six steps in total in the framework.</p><p>We know that there is a strong link between the need to proactively manage risks and the occurrence of incidents.  An example would be where a service puts in place a fall prevention strategy and monitors the occurrence of preventable falls against it.</p><p> The HSE recently established a project team to develop a mechanism in order that the learning from local reviews could be considered alongside information from a number of other sources, for example, closed claims and complaints related to the provision of clinical care.  Since 2013, the HSE has undertaken an annual review of completed incident reports.  The analysis focuses on both the quality of reports and the analysis of findings.  The findings are themed to identify key areas of weakness.</p><p> The national incident management system, NIMS, hosted by the State Claims Agency enables services across the HSE and relevant funded agencies to report and manage all safety incidents.  As an end to end risk management system, it facilitates the management of a safety incident though its life cycle, from initial reporting through the review process to the tracking of implementation of recommendations, while also fulfilling the legal requirement to report incidents to the State Claims Agency.  A range of reports are produced by the NIMS at each level of the organisation.  They allow services to monitor trends in levels of reporting, the timeliness of reporting, the severity of incidents reported, active claims and outstanding liabilities.  The reports are used as part of the performance management processes and in conjunction with other measures at local patient safety and quality forums to disseminate information and set out objectives for improvement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-22a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018112200002#O00300"><p>I thank all of the witnesses for coming.  I will focus on where we are as opposed to the tragedy of people being infected with blood products.</p><p>The United Nations has a target to eliminate hepatitis C by 2030.  Our aim is do so by 2026.  I am concerned that the low hanging fruit have been targeted in the initial phases, by which I mean people who are more likely to adhere to a medical regime or are easier to reach.  Let us estimate that the number of patients is 30,000 and we say we will deal with 18,000 a year.  The HSE will not achieve its target of eliminating the disease by 2026 unless we double resources or the HSE doubles its efforts to eliminate it.  Hepatitis C is a communicable disease.  The medical treatment emerged in 2014 and was licensed for use in Ireland in 2015.  There has been a significant price reduction.  I compliment the people who negotiated the price reduction.  However, I would not give them too much credit as most countries negotiated a significant price reduction.</p><p>Do the witnesses know whether tests on students have been conducted or whether the disease burden or load has been eliminated for 3,000 people?  Do they have data to show how many more have been infected, either through intravenous drug use or the exchange of bodily fluids or whatever else?  </p><p>I assume that the lead agency is in charge of reaching targets, but I did not see an annual target included in any of the reports.  Therefore, it looks as if the can has been kicked down the road to 2026.  The view seems to be that everything will be fixed by then, but I am concerned that no annual targets have been set.</p><p>Intravenous drug users are the cohort of patients who are the hardest to reach and make up probably half of the estimated number of patients.  They tend to be hard to engage with because they have chaotic lifestyles.  In my experience, as a community pharmacist who worked in a methadone service ten years ago, usually one finds when one engages with people such as these - I do not mean to paint everybody with the same brush - that they tend to adhere to regimes and turn up at their community pharmacy.  The relationship tends to be strongest between a community pharmacist and the person receiving the methadone treatment.  I very much welcome the suggestion treatment be moved to a community setting because I do not see how else we can target that portion of the population.  Obviously, the service will involve prescribing doctors.  I am sure pharmacists will be anxious to negotiate a very good price for the provision of such treatment.</p><p>It was stated each course of treatment cost between &euro;23,000 and &euro;92,000 per patient.  I understand the negotiated drug cost is around &euro;10,000 per patient.  Can whoever knows the answer explain the difference between the figures of &euro;23,000 and &euro;92,000?  Is it the price of administration or doctors' fees?  Have I missed something?  </p><p>I have seen evidence from other countries that there have been deals done with the drug companies whereby &euro;100 million, for example, would be given to treat whatever number of patients, but if we find another 2,000, they must be treated.  Have the witnesses come up with innovative actions to get the best value from the drug companies when it comes to dealing with this issue?</p><p>I am concerned about the database and confidentiality issues.  It seems completely unacceptable that one does not know how many people have hepatitis C, who they are or where they are.  As hepatitis C is a communicable disease, it is very important to know the dataset and who has the disease.  The approach seems to be <i>ad hoc</i>.  To tackle an infectious disease one must go at it and include every strain.  It looks like the easiest people have been dealt with and that the hardest ones to reach have been left until the end.  I find that concerning and do not think we will reach our target.</p><p>With reference to intravenous drug users, apparently one out of every three homeless people is hepatitis C positive.  That is a big concern if people are living in communal hubs or hostels because I imagine the risk of transmission is extremely high.  Do the witnesses have any idea of how many have been reinfected?</p></speech>

This finding is very consistent with the findings of the most recent study published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, which also calculated a figure of about 20,000.  Part of the confusion is caused by the notified results.  Up until 2012 people who were antibody positive were notified.  They included those who had the virus and had cleared it.  That gives a figure of 15,000 which includes about 4,000 who have cleared the virus.</p> <p>  I agree entirely with Deputy O'Connell that we have targeted the low hanging fruit, the people who will come to clinics.  We have to target people who are in the community and that is exactly what we are doing.  We now have four treatment programmes linked with methadone.  I share the Deputy's observation that the patients who are on a methadone treatment programme are extremely good and compliant.  As the one thing they know about is drugs, they know when to take them and we have had a very positive uptake.</p><p>We are expanding out to the community and we hope to expand it to level 1 and level 2 GPs and to community pharmacies so the process is ongoing.  I do not know if I have answered all the questions.</p></speech>

We can forecast numbers but we want to find as many people as possible and treat them as quickly as possible.  We are telling centres that they do not have a number they have to treat - they should treat as many as they can.  If they run into a roadblock, we will give them more resources to treat them.  Spending a lot of time on detailed plans is not the right thing to do.  These patients are difficult to find and we do not know the exact numbers.</p> <p>  A study was done recently by the Safetynet group into 700 people who were homeless or in hostels.  They agreed to be tested for hepatitis C and only 2% tested positive.  There is a suggestion that one third of homeless people are positive but it is not fully based on fact.  There are a lot but not as many as that. </p></speech>

It is the list price of the medications we use to treat patients and is the price before we apply any rebate we receive from the drug companies.  We procure drugs with a public tender, of which there have been two so far.  The figure is the cost to the hospital providing the treatment but the HSE has rebate arrangements which we negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies as part of the procurement process.</p></speech>

The primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, is responsible for reimbursing the cost of the drug the hospital purchases to treat the patient and for negotiating the collection of rebates from each of the suppliers based on the commercial terms we that have been agreed.  The commercial terms with each supplier are in confidence but we expect the average cost of treatment in 2018 to be below &euro;15,000 per patient.</p></speech>

The hospital will always pay the full list price of the drug directly to the supplier but will have the full cost reimbursed by the PCRS, which will negotiate a rebate from the supplier to get the saving.  The &euro;30 million in the PCRS pot is expenditure out of the figure arranged with the suppliers.</p></speech>

Australia is heading towards eradicating cervical cancer within ten years.  This started in 2004 and we are now in 2018.  While the HSE has made good steps, it has been with the low-hanging fruit and good advances in drug treatment.  I do not see the same people being successful in eradicating cervical cancer with this approach.  If we only deal with the low-hanging fruit and take the easiest options it will not work.  If we do not actually know how many people have it or where they are located, it is as if we are making it up as we go along rather than a serious attempt to eliminate the disease.</p></speech>

The programme was established on the basis that we would begin with the patients who were most sick and in most critical need, as well as those infected through State-contaminated products.  I cannot comment on the trajectory as regards cervical treatment but the cost of the hepatitis drugs in the first three years was phenomenal and no rebate arrangements were in place.  The programme has now reduced the costs, as other countries have done.</p> <p>  It is difficult to capture the number of patients who have hepatitis C and where they are in the system, but our data are getting much better and there are far more opportunities for people who are infected to be tested and treated.  We will have another ten years of treating patients before we get to the eradication of the disease in the Irish setting but we have done what we have set out to do so far.  I agree that eradication will not come about if we just set a target for the number of patients to treat every year.</p> <p>  I am pleased that we are moving into settings other than the hospital setting and we will improve screening, which will give us the opportunity to diagnose more of our population.  We will also be able to know who they are so that we can link them to care. </p></speech>

The recommendations are not overly complicated and do not ask for too much.  Why is there inertia in this area?</p></speech>

The development of medications to treat hepatitis C has only happened in the past few years.  We did not have access to these treatments at the time the strategy was written.  The recommendations, which are in the process of being implemented, are in areas across the entire addiction services, such as in education and prevention, and they have to be implemented in tandem with providing the treatment.  The work is ongoing and the full implementation of all the recommendations is a work in progress.</p></speech>

I do not buy the idea that the report is out-of-date, in the sense that it was published before the drug was available, because one could have layered the treatment on top of the existing content and added it as another page.  It seems strange that for something that is costing so much money - I do not know the cost of a hospital admission for somebody who is not treated, but I imagine it is significant - not to treat an individual who will end up in an acute hospital with cirrhosis, liver cancer or whatever complications one might have from untreated hepatitis.  It seems great value for money, even if it costs between &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 per patient because of the impact of treatment on the patient versus hospitalisation.</p></speech>

When the &euro;30 million was made available the mandate was to do State infected clients.  We have done all that and have achieved a 98% success rate.  There was a particular rationale for that decision because these people were infected by the negligence of the State and the State owed an extra responsibility to them to get this new drug to them in the first instance.  That was the decision at the time.</p> <p>  The second element was based on clinical prioritisation to move beyond that group into the general population, so the priority was to give the drug to those who were sickest first.  This was at a time when the drug was at its most expensive level.  In fairness people have done that but they have also come back to say that with the drop in the price of the drug they could expand the programme and bring it to the community and mobilise the community to get more and more people involved, which is exactly what Deputy O'Connell is arguing for and where we are now and where we need to be to get to 2026.</p></speech>

The individuals had to consent to their clinical data being used in a research-type database.  The data is anonymised and it tracks the disease progression.  We capture data such as age, gender and other conditions that they live with as well.  I think somewhere between 75% to 78% of patients have consented to their data going into the database.  The average age of patients who have consented to the database is 68 years of age and predominately there are more females than males because of the anti-D administration.  We publish reports and we have a report that we will publish before the end of this year that details the clinical position of those patients.  There are also demographics relating to age and the route of infection would be part of the data we collect.</p></speech>

I know he has worked with Mr. Breslin and the HSE.  The Irish Haemophilia Society has done major work for the people who suffered as a consequence of this medical negligence scandal.  I spoke to a number of people who have been through the process and have been compensated, which is the reason I am concerned about those who are still going through the process.  It can be complex and difficult to determine a liability because one has to determine loss of earnings, whether there was a loss in terms of a career path.  Is that still an issue and part of the complexities of arriving at a settlement for an individual?</p></speech>

I know I am taking up the Deputy's time, but may I agree with his comments on Dr. Brian O'Mahony and the Irish Haemophilia Society and the hepatitis C communities.  A key learning from this case come from an absolutely horrendous place for the country and for the groups affected.  We have managed to work with them on the redesign of services, with patients at the heart of them.  I refer to the National Haemophilia Council.  I first worked with Dr. Brian O'Mahony on the product selection group, where the haemophilia community discusses the procurement process to procure the blood products that are used in Ireland and mostly used by the haemophilia community.  That tells the committee members the ownership that they have of this issue.  There is a learning for us in all of what we have been through over recent months as to how we involve patients in the work of the health service as a core partner in its service delivery and not after the fact, when things go wrong.  We have to do that too, obviously.</p></speech>

We do not expect that the costs will be &euro;90 million over the duration of the scheme.

That is just taking published material from across the European Union and saying, "This is what it is in this country and that is what it is in that country."  It is not using our individual data.  The study that is published is the one on European epidemiology produced by Dr. Garvey from the HPSC in 2017.  That is the most up-to-date one on the basis of virus reference laboratory data.  That gives almost exactly the same figure we have come up with.  I think it was 20,200 or something.</p></speech>

So they had thousands of samples to try and figure out who were the undiagnosed proportion in the country, and using that with the people who have actually been reported giving an estimate in a country.  Their figure was 20,000.  Our internal figure is 20,000.  We think 30,000 is an overestimate.</p></speech>

The national screening guideline that the HSE published in 2017 sets out a process whereby anybody who works in any part of the health service and beyond - within the prison service, for example - works to a set of guidelines under which patients are identified on a risk basis and are tested for hepatitis C based on risk.  The screening guideline sets out the criteria where patients who may be at risk or who may be identified as having previously been at risk are recommended to be tested for hepatitis C.  So there is a national guidance in the form of our national screening guideline that we have produced and published since 2017.</p></speech>

The audit was conducted over the period to the end of 2017.  At that stage and for quite a significant amount of time prior to us publishing a national screening guideline on hepatitis C, while we had a lot of hepatitis C screening taking place, we did not have a national guideline.  The point that is being made in the chapter is that we did not have a national approach to screening, though screening was taking place.  Now we do have a national guideline for screening in the form of a screening guideline that was published in 2017.</p></speech>

The strategy that is referred to is a strategy that was written for the Eastern Regional Health Authority area; so it was confined to that region.  I suppose with the move in 2004 for quite a lot of our services moving on to a national basis, that strategy was then developed into a national strategy.</p></speech>

It was for one region of the country.  However, it was a report that was done.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has compiled a special report and he notes and observes a number of issues, one of which is that this report was compiled in 2004 but was never published and no implementation followed.  It is an obvious question that was going to be asked.  We are following through on his observations.  Why was it not published?  If Ms Tait cannot answer, surely somebody else, perhaps Mr. Breslin, can do so.</p></speech>

That organisation was wound up and became part of the HSE.  People's responsibilities then moved into national responsibilities.  Rather than implementing something in one region, which should be implemented nationally, it then formed the basis of a national approach and a national strategy.</p></speech>

I think what we were trying to do in this part of the report was to give an overview of how the service had developed and that to a certain extent there was stopping and starting for whatever reason.  If one looks at the diagram, there was the Eastern Regional Health Authority report in 2004.  The next significant development in terms of a strategy was in 2012.  Obviously, there were many reasons that there might have been delays including structural reasons.  Probably that is not the only one.  I would imagine that other priorities, perhaps, got in the way as the HSE was developing national strategies across many fronts.</p></speech>

Our approach is to treat everybody we can who is in the clinic.  That is what we told the institutions.  By the end of this year, 1,700 will have been treated.  Hopefully it will be more but it will probably be 1,700.  There are approximately 1,000 on the books in the hospital.  We are probably going to treat 1,800 to 2,500 next year.  If they are not around we have to go out and find them.  There is no point in us setting a target of 300 for Beaumont Hospital when it only has 200 patients.  Our approach has been to treat as many as we can as quickly as we can and to get to the end.  Certainly, we can put targets there, but they will be wrong.  Is that a useful thing to do?  Clinicians just want to eradicate this as quickly as we can.  With a bit of luck, the tools the Department has given us and the fact that we are now implementing Sl&aacute;intecare where we are moving treatment out of the hospitals into the community I believe we will eradicate this before 2026.</p></speech>

That appears to be a reasonable response.  I assume it was communicated to the Comptroller and Auditor General but it is still stated in the report that there was a weakness.  Was it not accepted?</p></speech>

For me, it is important that targets are set in strategies and plans, particularly where budgets are involved, so one can establish whether one is hitting them.  I accept that there has been better performance.  If they had set targets they would probably have set them lower.  With regard to the delivery of the programme in 2017, my understanding was that the treatment target was 1,600 but that was not achieved in 2017.  Everything has changed.  The drug type has changed and the cost has dropped so it is time to reset the target.  We do not need to have a disagreement about what is important for clinicians as opposed to for accountants.  Both perspectives are valuable.</p></speech>

One has to create the demand, whereas in many schemes people will apply.  The issue here is that we must get out in the community, tell people about it and create awareness that we have a treatment.  In doing that we will get more people into the programme.  I believe it is possible to construct a middle ground between the two perspectives.  The thing is to continually review the targets.  This is changing so much so quickly we could set a target that turned out to be under-ambitious and then only meet that target.</p></speech>

It was a similar crisis to the one we have had with CervicalCheck.  People were very scared.  I was one of the lucky ones who got a negative result but some of my contemporaries got positive results and the prognosis was awful at the time.  There was worry about contamination.  Some people were infected in the late 1970s and would have subsequently had more children.  They were worried about the children being infected, as well as partners and husbands.  It was a crisis at the time.  I remember it well because when something affects one personally one does not forget it.  When one looked at others who were not as lucky and got a positive result to the test one could see the challenges they faced with fatigue and so forth.  The changes as a result of the drug advances are incredibly important from that point of view because it is an awful infection if one does not have the ability to manage it.  We have the drug and there are people in that position.  Deputy O'Connell made the point that a person will have to be managed in a hospital if the infection is not managed.  There is a quantum in that regard if permanent damage is done so one must consider it in terms of how efficient it is to manage this by way of not trying to row back on damage that is already done.</p> <p>  A few things jumped out from the opening statement by Mr. Breslin regarding the people who were infected through the infected blood in the 1970s and 1990s.</p><p>Obviously, the crisis resulted from infected anti-D serum being administered in transfusions.  Haemophiliacs were a particularly badly affected group.  The statement notes that some 1,700 people in Ireland were infected, but further on it states that the tribunal had been hearing claims continually since 1996 and made 3,569 awards.

We have a habit of creating problems or crises in the healthcare system and elsewhere and then resolving them.  It is something of a national pastime.  We do not always learn from the experiences of the past.  Was a review conducted to consider what would be done differently if such a problem emerged now and what could have been done to avoid the problem?</p></speech>

Two tribunals separate to the compensation tribunal tried to identify the learning from this case and that has informed subsequent approaches.  One learning identified is that while the issue is being considered in terms of how it happened and so on, people will have been affected and need supports.  Generally in such situations the first response is to tackle the problem from a patient safety perspective.  That did not happen in this case.  There was contaminated blood in the blood supply and that continued after the service gained knowledge of it.  There is an absolute understanding across the health service of the need for immediate intervention to prevent further harm resulting from a patient safety issue which has an ongoing implication.  Another learning is that one must look back to see who was potentially affected by the issue.  Another is that while legal processes and other things take their course, those affected will require supports and one should work proactively to put such supports in place.  We have recently tried to work with and support affected people on an individual basis.  That has been done in various circumstances, including in dealing with women who underwent symphisiotomies in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and those affected by CervicalCheck.</p></speech>

It is very welcome that learnings have been identified.  There would be something wrong if they had not.  As I stated at the committee last week and on a couple of occasions in the D&aacute;il, some things have not been learned.That women are still seeking copies of their CervicalCheck slides indicates that the system is still very legalistic and that the affected person seems secondary, at least in regard to getting medical information.</p><p>There was a recent article in <i>The Sunday Times</i>on genetic testing in Crumlin hospital.  The Minister for Health or his Department has initiated a review of 335 positive BRCA genetic tests.  Some 3,500 negative tests remain to be reviewed.  This goes back to the issue of problems being foreseen or earlier identified.  The 2014 Donnai and Newman report initiated by the HSE showed serious dysfunctionality in this area.  However, a review is now being initiated based on claims published in a Sunday newspaper.  This appears to be a very serious issue which may be on a par with Cervical Check and the blood contamination scandal.  It strikes me that the early identification of issues, as referenced by Mr. Breslin, is not happening.  If serious dysfunctionality was identified in 2014, but now in 2018 no root and branch review on how to deal with that has been carried out, a lot remains to be learned.  Some recommendations of the report were never implemented, for example.  It falls into the same category as many major issues.</p></speech>

I know work is under way on that and on international involvement in that service to bring about improvement.  On the specific question about the BRCA test, that was identified as a transcription error and the 300 or so positive tests are being worked through, and that will be completed.  As of today, no further errors have been identified.  That fits with the principle whereby, as I said, if a single issue is identified, we look to find other cases that might be relevant to that and we do a look-back process through those.  It is in line with good practice.  There is a serious incident team managing this in Crumlin through the children's hospital.  Again, even in a situation where something like this has happened and, again, it is truly wrong and tragic in the individual circumstances, the incident management approach is to look beyond the individual circumstances into any wider risk there might be and to do a look-back through that.  That is exactly what is being done in this situation.  The findings to date are that it is an isolated error.</p></speech>

In regard to CervicalCheck, what was the learning from the blood contamination issue in regard to CervicalCheck and working with the person who has been the subject of the problem?  Why are we still waiting for these women to get their slides?</p></speech>

We have been requested to provide, on a slide-by-slide basis, the history of when that slide was requested, where it was dispatched to and what the turnaround time was.  At a previous evidence session, Mr. McCallion intimated that the average turnaround time was 22 days and the maximum was something of the order of 70-plus days.  We are in the process of drawing that together and the committee will get that very shortly.  It will show the exact timetable requested.  However, perhaps the most recent issue at hand is the one about the observance of a protocol that we have.  It is a very simple protocol, which simply asks what is the transport method, where is it going and who is going to be responsible for receipt of those slides.  Most requesters of the slides through legal representatives have observed that and are happy to do so.  We have had an issue with perhaps one or two latterly, and we are seeking to overcome these issues.  However, the committee will very shortly get a full report on the timetable associated with this.</p></speech>

We now have the capacity to treat people and we have taken away barriers, so we do not biopsy people any more and we do not have barriers in terms of alcohol use or drug use.  Basically, when someone comes into hospital, it is about the ability to turn up for the appointments.  If people turn up for two appointments, they can be treated.  For most people who come into the system now, treatment starts within two months.</p></speech>

The difficulty in the Prison Service is blood testing.  The prison nurses are not trained in phlebotomy and, for the hepatitis C nurses who go into the Prison Service, it can be very difficult to get access to the patients because the place can be in lockdown or there are no prison officers to bring them up.  We have a major difficulty in that regard.  There is now up to a six-week delay in some prisons to get a blood test for hepatitis C.  We are working to overcome that and we will have a meeting about it with the Irish Prison Service in two weeks' time.  Fifty patients have been initiated into treatment for hepatitis C within the prisons so far this year.</p></speech>

I presume it is through drug addiction centres but very few intravenous drug users will get to the stage where they are in addiction centres, and some will end up in prison.  Therefore, there is a cohort of people who may not engage with services.  Are we actively trying to target that group and, if so, how are we doing it and what methods are we using?</p></speech>

Ireland is pretty good in terms of opiate substitution therapy, OST, and recent data from across Europe suggest that some 54% of people with active opiate use in Ireland are undergoing OST, which is higher than in most European countries.  However, it is very difficult to target the people who are not in opiate substitution, not in hostels and not in prison, and we are trying to target those three areas.  Outside of those areas it is very difficult.  One could go on the soup run with the Simon Community as a possibility but it is difficult if people are not somehow linked in with therapy.  The advantage of opiate substitution is that people will come for their methadone but, if they are chaotic and will not do that, how are we going to treat them with antiviral therapy for eight weeks or 12 weeks?  It is very expensive medication and if they take it for a few days and then stop it for a week, there will be resistance and we will not be able to treat them subsequently.  The Deputy is right.  It is very difficult to see how we are going to get to this very hard-to-reach community when we do not have a good idea of it.</p></speech>

What is the issue?  I know, not from personal experience but from family experience, that those individuals share needles.  How prevalent is that and how are we trying to address the issue?  We have the needle exchange programme running in 120 or 130 pharmacies throughout the State.  Although Professor McCormick cannot comment on policy, one of the policy areas that could really bring benefit in this area is in regard to safe injecting centres, which are being proposed for Dublin as a pilot project.  While I will not ask him to comment on the policy, I would ask him to share his experience of the international experience of how safe injecting centres can form part of the overall health policy on preventing hepatitis C, particularly for intravenous drug users who are sharing needles.</p></speech>

It is safer for the drug users and safer for the community, certainly if people are using clean needles.  I would go further and say that one should give these people the opiates rather than having them buy them on the streets and giving the money to criminals, but that is a different area.  If they are in the injecting centres, we have access to them and can go and talk to them and treat them.</p></speech>

There are 90 drug consumption rooms operating around the world.  We have looked at them.  Undoubtedly, there is a reduction in blood-borne transmission of diseases in them.  It also presents an opportunity to get a public health message across to people, including those who have hepatitis C, about how they could deal with it.  It is one of the core rationales for using supervised injection facilities.</p></speech>

There are other health benefits such as preventing hepatitis C from spreading.  I want to put that on the record.</p> <p>  My understanding is there is almost a screening process within the Prison Service when it comes to hepatitis C.  Although it is not a statutory screening process, it is as good as one.  Is it based on voluntary buy-in by prisoners?  Is it, in effect, a screening process within the prison service?  </p></speech>

What I am told by the nurses who work there and by the Irish Prison Service is that prisoners are offered the option for testing but they have to accept it.  It is a civil liberties issue.  Getting the blood sample is the problem with that.  There have been studies done using saliva or blood spot but getting a blood sample is the way to go.</p></speech>

In cases where a diagnosis has been made, do we have figures for how many people contracted hepatitis C outside the State?

I obviously did not do my homework.</p> <p>  I will turn to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  I am not being critical in any way.  I am being genuine because I have an interest in the area.  In terms of the amber recommendations - there is only one red one, which is positive - which are only partially implemented, most are in the education area.  Many concern the provision of resources for addiction centres and residential beds.  If we look at the past number of years, we have been through a really tough time economically and have not seen a significant increase in the number of treatment centres.  We have seen a bit of an increase in terms of residential beds mainly from the private sector.  One issue I keep raising is the adolescent scene; we only have four residential beds for adolescents in the State.  Could Mr. Breslin give us a brief comment on where we are in terms of the education recommendations?  Are we confident that any of the amber recommendations will turn to green in the next 12, 24 or 36 months?  What partnership is there with the HSE on treatment and addiction centres?</p></speech>

Some of them are specific to hepatitis C.  With regard to the drugs and addiction service and the role it has to play, we have produced the new national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery.  We have refreshed the governance and interdepartmental involvement in it.  All of the relevant Departments and agencies meet.  It is chaired by the Minister of State.  Much inter-agency work is under way.  The allocation of resources has started in line with that strategy.  I am not here to make a case that we have completed it.  We have started it.  In 2018, &euro;9 million was made available for a range of initiatives including the supervised injecting room and for addiction services for under 18s.  The Deputy spoke about treatment places and beds but it also is about getting people into communities to work on a multidisciplinary basis with children who have addiction and putting in place young people's counsellors, clinical nurse specialists and so on.  We have a range of initiatives under way.  We could supply details to the committee.  They play into making services more accessible but also into prevention and harm reduction.  Much of what we are talking about here is harm reduction in order that people who are engaged in a harmful activity understand the implications.  We work with them to try to limit it and to try to get them away from behaviour that is harmful to them.  That is the core of the national drugs strategy.</p></speech>

The community provision of services, particularly post release from prison where somebody may have gone through an addiction programme, or from an addiction centre is on a voluntary basis.  We give people information on where and how to engage with community-based services.  Do we have a register of, or statistics on, the people who engage with those services?  Do we have statistics on the people who disengage from the services following an addiction programme?  Do we have statistics on how many people relapse in both settings?  What is the relapse rate for people who disengage from the service and for people who engage with the service?  That kind of information is good information for drug users in particular.  When people come out of addiction, those who disengage from the services are far more likely to relapse than those who do not.  That is a message we need to be pushing out to that particular community.</p></speech>

The Health Research Board, which conduct a drug prevalence study, goes to great lengths because we are trying to establish rates of illicit use.  If we just ask people in a shopping centre, they are not going to tell us the answer.  A lot of methodology was put behind that in the prevalence study.  I do not have them to hand but we can supply them to the Deputy.  The biggest drugs that come through that study do not involve the use of needles; they are cannabis, cocaine and so on.  We can try to extract out of that relevant information the Deputy might be interested in and supply it to him.</p></speech>

The period of the strategy has passed and the recommendations have not been complied with.  At that time, it was recognised that people's lives were chaotic, although I do not like the use of that word.  They suffered very chaotic experiences that led them into that.  The importance of community was recognised at the start of that strategy.  What specific progress has been made in respect of community outreach, given that this was identified back in 2012?  There was a pilot project in 2017.  Where are we with this?  Has it been completed?  Have we learned from it?  What will we roll out next year?</p></speech>

The therapies are being prescribed and dispensed in the drug treatment centres.  They are our community projects.  There is also a project in the Mater Hospital where they link with Safetynet.  A patient comes to the hospital once and it is then dispensed in the community.  There are five community-based projects and one in the Prison Service - in Mountjoy, Wheatfield and another prison.  We are trying to ramp up all of these and we are also trying to establish a service in Limerick.  We have difficulties in engaging with University Hospital Limerick because it has many challenges, but we are trying to establish a treatment programme in the drug treatment service directly in Limerick and, if necessary, to send a hepatologist down once weekly to see these patients.  We are getting mobile fibre scans which will allow us to go out in the community.</p></speech>

The treatment programme has been using the new directly acting antivirals, with the new curative treatment that has been up and running since 2015.  Prior to that, an older treatment was available mostly through the hospital setting.  Very few patients went on that treatment but some did get that treatment in drug treatment centres.  One or two programmes were running but they had very small numbers of patients and the outcomes for those patients were not great.  It was not a good course of treatment.  The pilots for the new, recent curative treatments for hepatitis C were set up to look at the feasibility, accessibility, sustainability and safety of using those treatments in that setting.  In the first 15 or 16 months of those pilot programmes, where we have commenced approximately 150 patients, we have learned that it is safe, feasible and acceptable to the people who work in those clinics and their patients and also that the outcomes are the same if not better than for patients in a hospital setting.</p></speech>

We reckon that is where the patients who have hepatitis C are distributed around the country.  We have reasonably good data on that.  We will roll that out through the big opiate substitution therapy clinics that have a pharmacy on site and then secondarily into the community pharmacies.  That is how we are basing our figures for how to spread it out.</p></speech>

I spoke to our head of public health on this recommendation fairly recently.  I have asked him to examine it with a reasonable degree of urgency.  I expect a report in the early part of 2019 on how we can implement this and what the barriers are.  When I say "the early part of 2019", I mean within the first quarter of the year.</p></speech>

One will be for Mr. Connaghan.

We have gone to great effort and people's lives have been affected.  Generally, we sit here every week and try to prevent events from happening and to get our heads around liability.  Everyone has a right to go to court, but various incidents lead up to such situations.  Coincidentally, we were to discuss and learn from the report on Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, that was published this year, but I understand that it has been adjourned to another day.  What jumped out were the failures to learn and the opportunities to learn that were repeatedly missed.  The lack of staff also put them under tremendous pressure.</p> <p>  Is tuberculosis a notifiable disease?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-22a.471" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018112200002#X01600"><p>I am being specific and parochial, but this has major implications for learning.  If there is a notifiable disease in Galway, as I have been informed, and staff contract it, and if I then ask a question about it, I will be told that a review will be carried out in the future.  I have read the opening statements from Mr. Connaghan and the Department.  When an event happens, it should be a case of stopping immediately, protecting people, learning from it and carrying out a review.  However, the answer to me is that a review will be carried out.  We are now in November, but the event in question happened months ago.</p> <p>  I asked what reviews generally have been carried out in Galway.  I made the question simple by only referring to external reviews.  What was the cost of those reviews and who carried them out over the past ten years?  Extraordinarily, I was told that the HSE did not have that information.  Following a search for the information I had requested, I was told that the HSE did not have a system to record the number and cost of all external reviews or investigations of patient care at University Hospital Galway.  I do not expect Mr. Connaghan to have an answer for me now.  I am just drawing his attention to this.  There is no database of reviews or their cost even though the matters in question lead to litigation.  Regarding my question on a notifiable disease, here we are about to have another review.  If Mr. Connaghan could comment, I would appreciate it.  If he does not have the details, that is fine.</p></speech>

The Deputy's points about prevention rather than cure are enormously important.  I started my working career in a quality control department at a point in time when the fashion was to inspect the product as it came off the end of the line and, if found to be defective or the like, reject it.</p></speech>

I need to send the committee something on what we have introduced in 2018 as regards our incident management framework.  Claims and safety issues arise through the incidents that occur.

I have read so many documents with my colleagues, I cannot go on half the time.  I want to know about implementation.  I have cited two specific examples where there are large gaps.

I know we were to focus on the HPV vaccine today but while Mr. Connaghan is here, I have a related question.  I asked him a few times previously about claims that are settled without admission of liability.  We established that there is not a mandatory monitoring or retraining period for the health professionals involved.  I asked the SCA officials as well.  They seemed to be agnostic about it.  We toed and froed a little bit but the bottom line was that there is no process and we depend on the regulatory bodies.  The bottom line is that there is nothing.  Have any moves been made in that direction?</p></speech>

It is called the National Clinical Assessment Service, NCAS, and was established in recognition of the fact that the approach to regulation is binary.  One is referred and either found guilty or not and fit to practise or not.  The focus of the NCAS is on remediation and approaches that can be made short of censuring a doctor.  That approach in the UK has been successful in re-educating or retraining doctors on whatever deficits are identified and returning them to the delivery system, bearing in mind our significant recruitment difficulties.  We have a recent arrangement with the NCAS to use its services regularly for a small number of cases.  We are now going to enter a more substantive agreement with the service to allow for a dedicated Irish phone line assessment service and remediation where appropriate in recognition of the fact that the UK service has been up and running for many years and has developed skills and expertise.</p></speech>

The discussion depends on each case and would take place at a hospital level between the clinical director and the clinician concerned.

The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, hospitals, for example, examines all incidents reported and it feeds into their own quality performance.  It does not just publish the incidence of complaints, since most pertained at a lower level to falls, though I am not taking away from the seriousness of it, right up to more serious incidents, but hospital groups and CHOs deal with these by recording them through the national incident management system, NIMS, hosted by the SCA.  The reports go through to hospital boards and group executives.</p></speech>

We do not know how many people have hepatitis or how many more new cases there are, so we do not know if we are running at a standstill.  There is no database but there are data-sharing issues which the witnesses hope to have dealt with by the first quarter of 2019.  As one of my colleagues said, this has been going on since 2004.  It appears as if nothing happened until 2017.  I refer to the Eastern Health Board report that was never published.  I understand that it fed into the national strategy.  I found a graph somewhere last night which I cannot find now.  The highest number of cases was in the eastern region under the old health board.  Those data would still be useful.</p> <p>  The strategy from 2011 to 2014 is out of date because it is from before the drug came into use.  I do not see why it cannot be updated.  There are no annual targets.  A comment was made about accountancy and clinicians but it all comes down to money at the end of the day and when the money runs out.  A clinical decision was made in the frame of accountancy when everything stopped in mid-2017.  The two go hand-in-hand.  I welcome the move to community care.  It is in line with Sl&aacute;intecare but there is not much connection there apart from it being a good idea.</p><p>No guidelines were published until 2017, when the pilots started.  There was another issue in the report, and I am not sure if someone brought it up when I was outside, which is the treatment centres did not notify the national treatment registry in 2017.  What was that breakdown in communication?  The drugs cost so much.  If the doctors prescribing them are, for whatever reason, whether it is paperwork or because they do not have to, not notifying that they have started person X on it, it does not seem possible to audit outcomes if the centres were not telling us how many people started on the drugs.

In his opening statement, Mr. Breslin said that in the years since these infections were discovered, a wide range of actions were taken, based on the recommendations of the Finlay and Lindsay tribunals, to ensure the safety of the blood supply.  That encapsulates the problem.  A problem arises and it is examined to make sure it does not reoccur but I would have liked wider lessons to have been learned from what happened with the blood supply.  This is the undercurrent of today's meeting.  The issue is dealt with but in a way that is totally divorced from everything else.  I do not get the connection in this regard.</p> <p>  At a meeting with the HSE on 5 July this year, we asked a series of questions and we got a reply back dated 16 August 2018, which we read into the record today.  The State Claims Agency was before us recently and we asked if it was possible that there were clinicians who were involved in multiple cases.  The agency said that if a clinician was listed in legal proceedings, the agency wrote back to say the name of the clinician did not need to be given, on account of the fact that it was the enterprise which was defending the case.  It seems the system is geared not to identify cases where learning is needed.  The letter we received said the HSE asked for a note on the introduction of a mandatory system of retraining and supervision following legal settlements without admission of liability.  It said there was no mandatory retraining and supervision following legal settlements without admission of liability, although retraining and supervision takes place.  The letter stated that the HSE talks to the State Claims Agency and looks at the trends the agency has identified but it seems to me that this is not just acting after the horse has bolted - it is acting after the horse is dead and buried.  The identification of these issues should be the role of the HSE, not the insurance company which is writing the cheque, which may be years after the event.  The last line in the reply states that the office of Dr. Colm Henry, the interim chief clinical officer in the HSE, will have the ultimate responsibility for implementing any necessary retraining and supervision of medical practitioners.  We are told that the State Claims Agency sends a report back to each of the institutions but these are landing all over the place.  Whose job is it to identify these needs?  The State Claims Agency is not picking up on them.  The report states that cases can be brought to the medical council but that is not what we are talking about.  That is for cases when somebody is judged not fit to be a doctor but that does not solve the problems where a practice is not up to scratch in some way.</p> <p>  This is why we are here.  The medical negligence bill is increasing every year.  The taxpayers have to pay it and that means less money for everything else.  The figure has gone up every year for the past ten years and before that, but we did not get any indication that anyone was really worried about it.  There is a demarcation between the HSE and the State Claims Agency.  Once a case goes into the latter, the HSE is out of the picture.  All it wants to know is what it owes at the end of the quarter.  This demarcation does not help the learning process.  The HSE should not have to learn anything from the State Claims Agency as the problems happened in the HSE to start with.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. Connaghan said the HSE had recently established a project team to develop a mechanism so that the learning from local reviews could be considered.  He might give us details of that and send them on to us.  He went on to say that, since 2013, the HSE had undertaken an annual review of completed incident reports.  Are they published?  Who is tasked with reducing medical negligence in the organisation when they come into work on a Monday morning?  Without this being addressed, it will mean less for patients and lower budgets for the HSE as a whole.</p></speech>

The first question was about what we learned from things going wrong in the blood service.  The Finlay and Lindsay tribunals identified a range of specific quality control issues within the blood service.  It was vitally important that we re-established confidence in the Irish blood service and a programme of work has been put in place to bring the service to a quality level that compares with international standards.</p> <p>  What the Chairman says, however, is correct.  The consequences of what happened in the blood service were defining moments for the Irish health service.  Internationally, all health services are dealing with the importance of prevention in achieving patient safety as the complexity of services has increased over the years.  At both policy level and operationally within the HSE, we have tried to move that agenda forward.  There is nobody saying our work is over and all of us are strong advocates for patient safety because we know the importance of it.</p><p>The actions that have been taken since then include the establishment of HIQA and the Mental Health Commission to put people who are not in the operating line or the hierarchical structure in to examine services and see how they are operating.</p></speech>

We have put in place the National Patient Safety Office.  We have a surveillance programme and a legislative programme.  The committee will be aware from our previous engagements of the legislation that is under way in this area.  The HSE has put in place a quality and patient safety directorate.  There is very much a focus on this at the provider level.  Mr. Connaghan has spoken about the serious incident management protocol, which started with maternity hospitals publishing monthly patient safety statements that set out the levels of safety within our hospitals and explain how the risks that exist are managed.  All hospitals are now doing that.  There is lots of learning.</p> <p>  I would like to mention another learning from the blood service.  There is a need for patient involvement and patient advocacy.  I have spoken about how the haemophilia and hepatitis C community has come into the design of the service.  That is a critical aspect of how we need to operate as a health service in general.  In the coming weeks, we will award a national patient advocacy service.  When something goes wrong, people lose trust in the health service and need someone to work with them to find answers to their questions.  We are going to put in a national patient advocacy service involving skilled people who understand the health service, but are not employees of it, to work with people in such circumstances.  I am not telling the committee that we have cracked patient safety in Ireland.  It has not been cracked in any healthcare system.  We have to work each day to try to improve this.  We also have to improve our processes for mediation and engaging with people when things go wrong.  I was in Northern Ireland three or four weeks ago for a conference with colleagues there.  They spent &euro;117 million on medical negligence and they have every single issue we have here.  We are going to work together on those issues.  Dr. Henry has spoken about the work that has been done in England, particularly with regard to mediation.  We can learn from others.  We have done a lot in this space.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-22a.667" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018112200002#BB00800"><p>At the committee's hearing with the SCA weeks ago, we learned that the number of claims is steady but the amounts are going up.  We heard that this is just one element of quality, whether it is of doctors or of services themselves.  Some services, such as obstetrics, are more complex and more prone to claims than others.  Approximately half of all claims pertain to catastrophic birth injuries, the consequences of which sometimes do not become apparent for many years.  I assure the Deputy that there is a great deal of learning going on.  The national women and infants health programme is examining the introduction of proxies for catastrophic birth injury.  That would involve doing immediate incident reports in cases of neonatal cooling, which happens when there is hypoxia, and also in cases of perinatal events.  It is absolutely the case that we want to learn.  We do not want to wait for claims to come through four years down the line when cerebral palsy becomes evident.  We want to learn from the at-risk cases as they happen.  We want to apply that learning to all 19 maternity units in their safety statements and the measurements we provide to them through the Irish maternity indicator system, which is a quality report we give to all 19 units.  It is absolutely the case that there is learning.</p></speech>

We will conclude shortly.  Mr. Breslin gets the point I am making.  I am not just talking about things that have happened while I have been Chairman of this committee.  I was a member of the committee in the previous D&aacute;il as well.  The feeling I got from the HSE at that time was that when these matters go to the SCA, they are dealt with by the agency.  The demarcation line is a bit too strong.  There needs to be more collaboration and earlier learning.  I know about the costs.  We know about mediation.  We know all that.  I am just saying we are back to prevention and learning.  That is the best way of reducing anything.</p></speech>

It introduced the national incident management system to ensure it is upstream when something goes wrong in order to learn from it immediately rather than having to wait for the claim to be lodged.  The HSE has a lot of work to do on risk management and patient safety.  The claims that are lodged are one element of that.  They are a bigger piece of the jigsaw that needs to be done.  I would like to mention a statistic that will probably cause the Chairman to take an intake of breath.  According to the OECD, 15% of hospital expenditure internationally goes on correcting preventable errors or infections people catch in hospitals.</p></speech>

I would like to make a final comment.  Mr. Breslin will understand why I am saying this.  As Deputy Connolly said, even though this is substantially an historic matter, one of the specific reasons we are here today is the case of the late Brigid McCole.  It was just a few weeks ago that we spoke about the case of Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na in the context of the cervical cancer issue.  The public sees a connection when these cases of medical negligence arise.  The State had a responsibility 15 years ago and following a tribunal, &euro;1.5 billion in compensation was rightly due to those affected.  Fifteen years later, it looks as if we are starting down the exact same road again.  All of our successors who are here in 15 years' will talk about the cost of that.  I am worried that some other case will come up at that stage and the wheel will start turning again.  That is where broader learning is needed.  Every time there is a problem, we try to solve it.  We cannot foresee everything that might happen.  People have a sense of "Here we go again".  I ask Mr. Breslin to make an observation on that.  He can understand people feeling that they are not totally disconnected from these issues, even though medically they are.  I am sure Mr. Breslin understands the point I am making.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-22a.673" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018112200002#BB01400"><p>Yes.  There are substantial differences between what has happened in this instance and the infection of people through the blood supply at a time it was known that an issue was live and present.  The overall challenge and comment is exactly correct.  Patients have to be at the centre of the patient safety culture within healthcare.  There are many other things we need to do, but that must be the primary focus of all health service practitioners.  We need to build systems that support people to make safe decisions as they go about their duties and we need intelligence that spots things before they become a problem.  I will give some examples of the scale of this.  Every year, we have 3.3 million outpatient attendances, 1.3 million emergency department attendances, 1.6 million admissions to hospital and 20 million GP attendances.  It is not enough to get 99% of those right.  If we get 1% of them wrong, that has significant implications.  That is the culture we need.  A great deal of work will be needed in the health service.  We will have to bring the community with us as we to try to break down the old-fashioned "doctor knows best" approach and replace it with a partnership with patients.</p></speech>

I merely tabled them to highlight the fact that there was a basic inequity in that the budget provided for tax reductions and concessions and increases in social welfare payments.  The tax concessions will kick in in January, while the social welfare increases will not kick in until March.  That seems to be inequitable.  I know that the Minister will probably respond by saying the last increase provided for of &euro;5 will only run out in March, but the increases in social welfare payments come into the reckoning for 2020.  Therefore, the Government is holding back an increase for persons in receipt of social protection payments until March, but it will have to be counted in the Estimates for next year in any event.  It is simply deferring the cost.  We have arrived at a stage where tax concessions and increases in social welfare payments should kick in at the same time.</p></speech>

However, the Social Welfare Act 2017 provides that claimants who have paid at least 260 but less than 520 full rate social insurance contributions and who have also paid modified rate contributions may be assessed for what is known as a mixed insurance pension.  Modified rate social insurance contributions are PRSI contributions at classes B, C and D and typically paid by public servants.</p><p>In practical terms, the mixed insurance contributory State pension will typically enable people who have worked in both the public sector and the private sector or in self-employment to secure a reduced rate contributory State pension to supplement their public sector pension.  The amendments I am introducing have been designed to ensure the wider provisions of section 9 which provide for the introduction of aggregated contribution methods will be extended to pensioners who receive the contributory State pension based on mixed insurance records.  Consequently, such pensioners will also be in a position to benefit in those instances where they can demonstrate an entitlement to home caring periods.</p></speech>

This needs to be carried out because we know the impact these cuts are having.  The Minister repeatedly denies it has any impact.  All the evidence, however, from all of the organisations representing young people, cites the poverty levels these cuts are imposing on young people.  I refer also to the homeless statistics.  All of the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, are pointing out that these discriminatory cuts are adding to all of those problems.  It is about time that these cuts were reversed.  </p><p>I have called repeatedly on the Minister to do that.  My hands, unfortunately, are tied.  We cannot bring forward any amendments that will have a cost to the State.  We need a report because I believe it will show that these cuts are not having the impact that the Minister frequently cites.  These cuts were brought in when youth unemployment was about 24% and it is down now to about 12%.  The Minister stated in the D&aacute;il last week that she does not want to see our young unemployed people sitting at home watching &quot;Judge Judy&quot;.  I do not think any young people watch that programme, by the way, and they do not want to sit at home either.  The impact these cuts are having on young unemployed people is real.  </p><p>I welcome Deputy O'Dea now also starting to raise concerns on this issue, although we know it was Fianna F&aacute;il that instituted these discriminatory cuts which are affecting young unemployed people.  I hope I will have the full support of the committee in requesting this report to examine all of the core issues, such as poverty and homelessness, on which these discriminatory cuts have an impact.  They are adding to the difficulties of young unemployed people.  </p></speech>

As members are aware, in line with other EU and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, countries, reduced rates for jobseeker's allowance were introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in 2009 to tackle high unemployment.  The measures were to guard against the development of long-term welfare dependency by providing jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education, training or employment opportunities.  The Department is already finalising a report examining the impact of the reduced payment rates on jobseekers between the ages of 18 and 25, as we already committed to in the Pathways to Work 2016-2020 initiative.</p><p>As part of this process, the Department is also considering the contents of research undertaken by the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.  I understand this research will be published shortly in <i>The Journal of Human Resources</i>.  The research examined the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging jobseekers to avail of education, training and employment opportunities and programmes.  The university examined the data for 18 and 19 year olds, as the reduced rates were first introduced for those age categories.  </p><p>The findings reported positive results and noted an overall reduction in unemployment durations.  The ambition of Fianna F&aacute;il and the continued ambition of the Government to assist unemployed young people into education, training and employment opportunities is working.  The reduced percentage rates of our young people on long-term unemployment backs that up.  I am minded to not put this in legislation but to point out that a report has already been committed to and is being prepared.  It does not need to be restated in legislation. </p></speech>

As far as I am aware, in many countries throughout the OECD there is a differential between the rates of pay to people under a certain age and those over a certain age.  That is a fact.  In 2010, when these changes were made in Ireland, we were just coming into line with international practice.  That includes practice in the UK, including Northern Ireland, where Deputy Brady's party presided over that system when they condescended to sign up to government for a number of years.  In any case, the fact of the matter was that the initial differential was introduced by a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in 2009.  I cannot recall the figures at the time but the difference was marginal.  It has been widened considerably since.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the rationale for it.  There was robust debate on the matter at the time.  That will be shown in time when Cabinet minutes are released etc.  The Minister has said that the wisdom of the policy is proven by the results.  I do not think this is necessarily a case of cause and effect.  The question must be asked as to whether, had this change not been introduced, we would be in roughly the same position in respect to youth employment as we are today.  There is no definite proof of that and as far as I know, that is what Deputy Brady is trying to ascertain in his amendment.  </p> <p>  He wants the study to see if the differential rates of pay have had the desired impact and what type of downside consequence it has had.  There are always going to be downside consequences when one cuts social welfare benefits to whomever.  I am not totally convinced, being mindful of the arguments made at the time, that the policy actually achieved the results it was brought in to achieve.  We have a record low rate of youth unemployment now but I do not know whether that policy has anything to do with it.  While I am open to correction, my understanding from the Minister's reply, to bring the matter up to date, is that she is doing this anyway.</p></speech>

The Minister said a report is being carried out.  Maynooth University is carrying out a report which is not, however, looking at the issues in the areas I want looked at.  I refer to the financial impacts, the poverty impact and the issues with homelessness.  We know that in August this year, youth homelessness increased again.  There were 893 people between the ages of 18 and 24 who were homeless.  The organisations representing young people and the homeless have stated that these discriminatory cuts are adding to that.  I am asking for something specific.  Pathways to Work clearly stated that such a report would be carried out in the second quarter of 2016.</p></speech>

It is being carried out by Maynooth University but it is not specific to the areas I am talking about.  The report being carried out by Maynooth University - we have seen the drafts - is looking at the impact these measures have had on unemployment levels.</p><p>When Deputy O'Dea is explaining the rationale of bringing in discriminatory cuts he is losing.  The right thing to do is to do now is to reverse these discriminatory cuts and this report will be the evidence that we need.  All the evidence is out there from the organisations but our hands are tied because we cannot bring amendments which will have a cost on the State.  A report is needed and I will be pressing this amendment.</p></speech>

It has nothing to do with the Department.  </p> <p>  The Department's document and commitment has already been made on numerous occasions in public, in private and in writing.  We are ready, practically, for the finalisation of our report that was committed to under the Pathways to Work programme 2016-2020, which will examine exactly what the Deputy is looking for today.  I have no problem committing to that as the report is very nearly ready to be published.  I am very happy, Chairman, that this committee be the first place that we have a conversation about it.  I do not need to recommit in legislation to something that is already practically completed.  I can assure the Deputy that at the earliest date after it is completed, we will come back here and have a conversation about it.  I am not against the report.  We do not need to provide in new legislation today for something that is already practically completed.</p></speech>

We cannot allow this to drag on.  Unfortunately, that appears to be the <i>modus operandi </i>of the Department.  This was committed to and was supposed to be published in the second quarter of 2016.  That date was missed and in the meantime youth homelessness and poverty is increasing.  The impact of these discriminatory cuts is devastating.  Six months will tie the hands of the Department and ensure that this report is commissioned, carried out, produced and brought before the House.</p></speech>

The Deputy, however, needs to check his language.  The comment that the <i>modus operandi</i>of the Department is to delay and its aim is to tie people's hands is not the way the Department works.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw the comments that he has just made about 6,000 hard-working people who week-in week-out to serve the State.  It is not on.  This is not about political cheap shots.</p></speech>

Sometimes parents, in accordance with the terms of the custody agreement, have equal time with their child.  In order to qualify for the domiciliary care allowance, the relevant legislation and regulations provide that one of the parents, or the applicant for the domiciliary care allowance, must spend not less than five nights per week with the child.  In practice, and in some cases, this does not happen so I have designed my amendment to deal with the anomaly.  Let me outline a particular case.  Two people have joint custody and each spends exactly half of his or her time with the child.  Therefore, neither can claim the domiciliary care allowance, which is very unfair in the circumstances.</p></speech>

I thank him for raising the issue a second time.  He raised it in the D&aacute;il the other day.  I agree with him that there is an anomaly in the system.  The domiciliary care allowance, DCA, scheme works incredibly well, particularly after the reformation of the application form a number of years ago with the DCA Warriors.  I acknowledge the tremendous work done by the DCA Warriors to simplify the scheme.  As a result it now only takes five weeks from the time an application is made to when a person receives the award.  The scheme is working and is very positive but the Deputy is right that there is an anomaly.</p> <p>  Under the conditions of the scheme a parent needs to satisfy that he or she has a continuous period of five days caring for his or her child over and above what normal parents do with normal, healthy and happy children.  Unfortunately, we are all aware that family life today differs from what it was heretofore.  I ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing his amendment with a view to working with us over the next couple of days to provide a formula of words to do exactly what his amendment seeks to do so that we can recognise the caring arrangements of week-on, week-off, a three or four weeks revolving rota, etc.  We must ensure that if a child has care needs then, regardless of who provides the care on a rota basis, that the DCA is awarded.  I want to put in a proper formula of words that will make it simple for us to administer.</p></speech>

Deputy Broughan is not here and I know his amendment has not been moved.  I want to assure the committee that the legislation never contained the word "unforeseen".  A number of years ago the word was inserted in departmental guidelines for practical purposes.  Due to a particular case, and I think we all know the case, the word or set of words were removed from the guidelines by myself and my Department in January of this year and we now have reverted to the spirit of the legislation.  Deputy Broughan's amendment was attempting to do something but there is no need for it as the words have been removed from the guidelines and the practice has reverted to individual deciding officers making individual assessments on somebody's presentable needs.</p></speech>

In particular, it relates to priorities set out by Family Carers Ireland in its pre-budget submission, which I am sure the Minister received and read.  The Minister will be well aware of the issues facing full-time carers across the country who provide a phenomenal service and enable the State to save millions, if not billions, of euro on an annual basis through their caring duties.  There are significant issues for carers, including financial constraints.  They have to provide full-time care for a minimum of 35 hours per week but receive a mere &euro;16 in addition to social welfare rates so they are providing a service for little or nothing.  They are prevented from working or studying for more than 15 hours per week so they are unable to even complement the money they get to provide that care.  </p><p>The report will be in line with what Family Carers Ireland have asked for.  It would be beneficial if it was produced and brought before this committee so that we can see what we can do to address the issues carers have raised continually.  The Minister needs to acknowledge the concerns of carers and can do so by accepting this amendment and carrying out this review.</p></speech>

It would be a useful report for us to have in general.  I do not have the figures in front of me but carers provide significant service to the State by providing full-time care at home.  If we treated them better and took them more seriously, we would get a lot more out of the population in terms of minding those who need to be minded.  It is far better to be minded at home than to be minded in a healthcare facility or hospital.  I cared for my mother for a couple of years and was able to work 15 hours per week.  I was doing some part-time work for my union at the time in the form of tutoring.  It all worked well for me.  My mother has since died but, following the care I provided, my sister cared for her for 15 years.  My sister is now in her early sixties and has nowhere to go in the labour market.  She has been discarded, which is depressing for her.  A report could tell us a great deal about the role of women in society as well.  It could have a more holistic vision of what we want to do for women and family carers.  I worry that people like my sister could suffer ill-health because of the sense that having sacrificed so much of their lives doing something that is valuable to society, they are now useless and nobody cares about them.  I am sure the Minister recognises the value of the work they, as do all of us, but the consequences of not having the facts, figures and an insight into it are that we will miss out on something.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-22a.778" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018112200002#E00400"><p>I am supportive of the final point made by Deputy Smith because one in 20 people in Ireland is a carer.  The projections are that by 2030, that figure will increase to one in five.  A significant volume of unpaid caring work is provided free to the State.  Various figures have been bandied around but the volume of unpaid caring carried out is a significant boon to the State.  Only 25% of carers are in receipt of the carer's allowance, which means that 75% of carers do not get any payment for it or any recognition from the State.  It is a rapidly growing phenomenon with which we must come to grips.  A report like this would certainly be useful in formulating policy in that direction.</p> <p>  A number of points have been made to me and a number of points have been made by Family Carers Ireland in its various submissions, which we all read.  First, carers, many of whom I know, and many of whom are working literally around the clock and hardly have time to go to mass, are only paid &euro;16 per week more.  I know they are paid the annual allowance of &euro;1,700, which would enable them to take a break for a short time.  I assure members that this break is badly needed in every case.  </p> <p>  Second, there are concerns regarding the rigidity of the rules surrounding carers' ability to work.  I have come across cases where somebody is working on a flexible basis.  For example, they might work 12 or 13 hours per week, which means they are within the requirements for carer's allowance, but some weeks, they might work 17 hours.  When one adds it up over the year, the person comes in with an average of less than 15 hours, yet because he or she worked more than 15 hours on one or two weeks, he or she is barred.  That is wrong.  I understand that if somebody is judged by the Department to be a full-time carer, there must be restrictions on his or her ability to work.  Few people have the stamina, energy and time to be full-time carers and work at the same time but there is a need for flexibility and discretion.  A report, as suggested by the amendment, could explore that.  I have come across a number of case studies where poverty traps are beginning to emerge because of the rigidity of the 15-hour rule.  I have one person in mind but I am sure I have several others on my books.  This person came to me last week.  She is a very active woman in her thirties who works as a special needs assistant, SNA.  She is getting the carer's allowance for her disabled child and taking on SNA positions as they are offered to her.  She has had to turn down work even though she badly needs the money and could work because she is young and wants to work as much as she can.  She would be able to work more and thereby increase the family income, which is badly needed, but she is prevented from doing so by the rules.  </p> <p>  Another point averted to in the amendment is the fact that sometimes when a middle-aged or elderly person is caring for somebody else and the caree dies, an easy and recognisable pathway back into the workforce is not there.  On balance, a report along the lines suggested in the amendment would be useful.  We must formulate policy because of demographics, etc., and we need all the help we can get.  I do not know if a report along the lines suggested in the amendment could be done in three months.  I would be flexible about that.  However, such a report would be useful and we should have one.</p></speech>

Everybody in the D&aacute;il or Seanad recognises and appreciates the caring that is provided by friends, family members and people in our communities up and down the country.  All Members recognise that the country's common good could not survive without the thousands, if not millions, of hours given by those people to other neighbours, friends and family members every week of the year.  The carer's payment is unique insofar it is an allowance towards an income; it is not a payment.  Since arriving in this Department, I have often wondered how it ever came about over and above the provision of services on behalf of the State because that is the only reason it is in existence.  It is not a payment because if it was, we would be paying pretty poorly for the volume of work that is being done.  That needs to be stated and recognised.</p> <p>  My Department has made changes in the past number of years.  The income disregards have been increased.  Deputy O'Dea mentioned the rules but there must be rules.  If the rule did not involve 15 hours, it would involve 14 or 17 hours.  There is a reason for rules.  I know what he is saying and I agree with it.</p><p>We have tried to move in the last number of years to provide different supports.  We now have health and safety training so we spend a couple of million euro every year trying to provide training courses and specific supports for carers so they can improve their safety, health and well-being during their caring years.  We provide bereavement counselling after the person who is being cared for passes away.  They are only small things but it is an effort to appreciate and recognise that wraparound support is needed for these people.  There is also special training in our Intreo service for people who have been caring for a number of years and then, as Deputy Smith said, find themselves isolated or removed from the workforce.  The training will help to integrate them back into the workforce.</p><p> I do not have a problem doing the report but it might not be exactly what the Deputy is seeking.  When we do the report the Deputy might then say that the Department is doing X, Y and Z and the Department of Health is doing A, B and C, which will not look at where the gaps are.  Rather than the Department doing a report in isolation, would the Deputy consider us having a series of hearings and perhaps have a body of work done, to which I will contribute, by the joint Oireachtas committee?  The committee could have oral hearings and invite not only carers' associations and advocates but also carers themselves to hear at first hand what they are experiencing daily and what they would like us to do for them.  It is not always just about increasing the payment each week.  There are many more complexities involved.  However, I do not have a problem doing a report.  Deputy O'Dea is right that three months is probably pushing it a little given that there are other reports to be done.  This might not work exactly the way we want it to in isolation and I believe there is value in opening it further if that is possible.</p></speech>

I have been struck over the last number of years by the number of young people who are providing a caring service for family members.  The restrictions there are affecting them over the long term as well because they cannot study for more than 15 hours a week.  There are also long-time carers who might be caring for over 20 years.  That has an impact in terms of their pension entitlements.  The impact of all that must be examined.  Deputy O'Dea is correct that there is the carer's support grant but that amounts to only approximately &euro;4.65 per day.  It is welcome but when one boils it down it is not even half of the minimum wage per day, although I realise the intent of the grant was not to provide a wage but to give carers some respite.</p> <p>  The Minister said the committee could do a piece of work on it by inviting carers to appear before it and by examining this in a holistic way.  That would be welcome.  However, the difficulty is that we have done that already in numerous areas.  The committee went through an exhaustive process in the case of lone parents.  We invited in all the groups representing lone parents and we produced a comprehensive report which made clear recommendations on how to address the issues facing lone parents.  The report had cross-committee support but, unfortunately, the vast majority of the recommendations have fallen on deaf ears.  While that approach would be welcome, the difficulty is not having it in the legislation.  I will press this amendment because enshrining it in the Bill will ensure the report is carried out.  That does not preclude the committee carrying out work in parallel with that.  The timeframe of three months might be a little tight but we can look at that.</p></speech>

It provided a platform for lone parents to talk about the difficulties they have and particularly the prejudices they face in society.  I disagree with the Deputy because the recommendations in the report were heard and heeded by the Department, particularly since I took office a couple of years ago.  In every speech I have made in the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and this committee I have spoken of the difficulties lone parents and their children face arising from the changes that were made in 2012.  There are significant financial differences in the disregards as a result of changes in the last number of years, as recommended by the committee, and the qualified child increases warranted the improvements in the financial circumstances of lone parents, as recognised by the committee.  The Deputy should not put himself down-----</p></speech>

I am not sure what the Deputy wants.  We will do the report but three months is not feasible given that there are other reports to be done.  There are only so many people who can do reports in the Department.  Is the Deputy concerned that if the committee does a report we will not heed it?  If that is the case, there is the same concern if the Department does the report.  What does the Deputy think will be different if the Department does the report or the joint committee carries out that exercise?  I am not sure where his concern lies.</p></speech>

Every year we seem to get to a point where certain rates are a political football.  The approach is a fiver for all.</p><p>It does not look at how adequate the payments are and is not based on evidence.  It is a political football, as we have seen over recent years.  It must be evidence-based.  As the Minister is aware, I have produced a Social Welfare Commission Bill 2018 which would remove the setting of rates from the Department and give them to the a social welfare commission which would oversee the whole area, engage with the key stakeholders and ensure any increases are evidence-based and are based in their adequacy for recipients.  The amendment asks that the Minister meets with the key stakeholders so we can ensure that happens.</p></speech>

They discuss their priorities and wishes for the budget the following year.  The priorities that emerged in this year&rsquo;s consultation included a higher rate of payment for dependent children aged 12 years and over.  That message came through loud and clear and we were happy to examine it.  Establishing a benchmarking of social welfare rates was an area that emerged from several people at that meeting.  The budget 2019 &euro;5 increase in the maximum weekly rate of social welfare payments to pensioners, lone parents, people with disabilities, workers on maternity or paternity leave and jobseekers are all above an inflation-rate increase, which is for the third year in a row.</p> <p>  As I said in my speech on budget day, now that the core rates have been restored in the main, it is time to fundamentally examine how we approach how they are set annually.  The Deputy might be surprised, therefore, to find that I very much agree with him.</p> <p>  Other countries have shown that by doing this and instituting a process of benchmarking welfare rates typically use a system where the core rates are fixed each year, with reference to either market earnings, particular prices levels and indices, and this works very well.  On a very snowy day in March this year, we launched the roadmap for pension reform.  The Government had already committed to adopted benchmarking for pensions.  I indicated that day that we would develop proposals to develop this commitment before the end of this year and we are on target to do this.  My view, as I said on budget day, is that we should extend this to all core welfare rates.  If a system was implemented, it would provide the context and the framework and it would be informed, measurable and evidence-based as to why a determination is reached on what a new social welfare rate should look like.</p> <p>  There are some concerns that we would have both an evidence-based determination of welfare rates and an additional political input, and that rather than having one new system there might be an amalgamation of the two.  However, the system of the Low Pay Commission which was established several years ago works very well.  I refer to its establishment and its composition of employers, employees and independent people.  How the Oireachtas respects and carries out its wishes each year is a very good model that we could use in the future.  I am very happy to say that while this amendment does not fulfil what I think the Deputy wants me to do, namely, to consult, which we already do.  I do not need to be told in legislation to do what I already do, but it would be very worthwhile if we moved towards establishing a body which would do a proper analysis annually on what welfare rates should be and to be mindful of it.  Therefore, I am happy to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

One cannot do this because many studies have shown that for people who are wholly or mainly reliant on social welfare, a different rate of inflation applies.  They spend their money on the necessities of life, such as heating and food, where the inflation rate has far exceeded the overall inflation rate which includes the cost of yachts and Ferraris.  Some formula must be worked out and I am glad that the Minster is thinking in that direction.</p></speech>

We need to move away from that system for all the reasons I outlined.  All the organisations and, more importantly, the people who are in receipt of any type of payments, not simply pensions, want certainty.  Phenomenal work is being undertaken by groups such as the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice to examine minimum essential standards.  All that must be taken on board by the Minister.  I am heartened to hear her reference the Low Pay Commission.  She will be aware that the legislation I brought forward for a social welfare commission is based on the Low Pay Commission.  Its composition is similar and it would consist of nine members who would take account of all the evidence and research by all the organisations.  We need to move to that system.  Has the Minister looked at this legislation?  I think it would provide the basis to move forward.  I must take her at her word that she wants this to be put in place and make the changes.  She needs to give serious consideration to the legislation that is already there.  Exhaustive work has been undertaken on it.</p></speech>

Firstly, the Department does not distinguish between child maintenance and adult maintenance generally.  The purpose of means testing social welfare payments is to ensure that when resources are targeted, they hit the targets at whom they are aimed, that is, the people who need them most.  Social welfare legislation provides for the means testing of social assistance schemes to take into account all income into households and all assets belonging to the people who seek support from the State.  Any income into a household must be seen as income, therefore, we do not differentiate between child and adult maintenance.  However, we very much recognise that there is a cost associated with providing accommodation which is why there is an income disregard of &euro;95 weekly towards housing.</p><p> We do not differentiate between child maintenance and adult maintenance but what we very much recognise is that there is a cost associated with providing a roof over one's head.  That is why there is an income disregard of &euro;95 per week towards housing.  Whatever is left in the maintenance payment is divided by 50% before we take the remaining portion as reckonable income into that household.  Ironically, Deputy Brady has a later amendment relating to errant people who are not paying financially towards their children.  We want to ensure that we have a system that is easier and more efficient for parents and we want to place it on a legal footing.  In the main, it is women who have to chase the other parent for maintenance payments.  I know other people in this chamber have an interest in that.  At the same time, when somebody makes a payment towards his or her child's welfare, Deputy Brady thinks the State should disregard that payment as if it is not being made and thereby diminish and discount the value of the parent who is contributing towards their child's upbringing support, care and maintenance.  The Revenue Commissioners, the State and the laws of the land indicate that income is income.  We have tried to be as flexible as we possibly can when determining disregards of that maintenance income into a household.  We have what the Department believes is a fair system that recognises the contribution of both parents towards the upkeep of their children.</p></speech>

Surely the amendment just seeks to commission a report.  Deputy Brady is not entitled to propose a disregard of maintenance payments.  He is simply proposing that there would be a report.  I do not see why there would be any great difficulty with that.  He has a fairly ambitious timeframe but, nevertheless, it is a problem that has been ongoing for some time.  There seems to be a misunderstanding.  I think the Minister misunderstood what I said as well on Second Stage.  There is a disregard in place for a certain amount.  I think it is &euro;97.</p></speech>

I have a few questions on that.  The point I was trying to convey, perhaps badly, on Second Stage is that the rates of poverty among lone parents are dramatic, with deprivation levels of more than 50%.  If one had a situation whereby maintenance was disregarded in the calculations for lone parent allowance, that would mean a family would be &euro;95 a week better off.  Surely that is the sort of targeting we are talking about.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-22a.821" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018112200002#H00800"><p>Their net income would be more because the maintenance would be entirely disregarded.  Is that not the sort of targeting we are talking about to lift that sector?  If one wants to focus on poverty, then one should look at people with disabilities and lone parents.  They are the two groups that especially stand out in terms of the statistics.  By disregarding maintenance payments entirely one would increase the level of income of those very low income families.  That would be a very good targeting measure.  I do not know what it would cost but I imagine it would be very little in the overall context.</p> <p>  I do not know whether it is still official policy but some people in the Department seem to be of the view that if a woman - it is usually a woman - goes to court and goes through all the hassle and confrontation involved in getting a maintenance order, yet the order is not obeyed and the maintenance is not paid, why does the Department insist on assessing that as income?  In practice, it only deters and discourages people from seeking maintenance.  If one seeks maintenance, one's lone parent allowance is either not payable at all or payable in a diminished form and one might not be getting the compensating payment.  Sometimes it can be very difficult to get money from some of those people.  Surely that is a deterrent to seeking maintenance in the first instance.</p> <p>  What is the situation with maintenance recovery?  Leaving politics out of it, all independent observers are of the view that some sort of independent maintenance recovery agency is necessary.  What is the exact position in that regard?</p></speech>

When one looks at the statistics, it is evident that Deputy O'Dea is correct.  People on disability payments and those in lone parent families are two of the categories where we have the highest poverty levels.  It is difficult for a one-parent family to even try to get maintenance in the first instance.  I will deal with that in due course.  I take issue with the fact that maintenance is taken as income.  Difficulties arise when maintenance is awarded and then not paid yet it is still taken as income even though the lone parent does not receive it.  Significant issues arise in that regard and it would be helpful to have a report carried out which would set out clearly the impact that is having on parents and children in those situations.  I acknowledge that the timeframe might be a bit tight but I will push the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-22a.823" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018112200002#H01000"><p>I will answer two questions from Deputy O'Dea.  First, that used to be the case but the practice was changed earlier this year for a number of reasons.  We started looking at lone-parent families and the conditionality that was set and some of the precarious situations some women were put in and we addressed that.  We also looked at the practice, which was not universally applied around the country, where some people were including the promise of a payment of maintenance in the overall assessment of means of the income of a household.  Promise my eye.  We only deal in hard facts so if there is no payment, there is no disregard.  One cannot have a disregard that is not coming into a household so the practice has changed.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea and I had a conversation last week about our own involvement with the Department in maintenance recovery.  I am conducting a review, which is very close to being finalised, as to what our input should be and what the conditionalities should be in particular for one-parent family payments.  I expect that to be ready early in the new year and then to make determinations on it.  If we are in, we should be all in.  If we are not in, then we should be all out.  I would value Deputy O'Dea's advice on that when we come back with the report, perhaps after Christmas.</p> <p>  I am not in a position to accept the amendment for two reasons.  First, there is no such thing as child maintenance.  When court orders are made for maintenance they do not apportion X amount for children.  If a maintenance order is made for &euro;200 a week, it is not stated that &euro;27 is for the mammy and the remainder is for the children.  A maintenance order is made against the parent that is not living with the children.  It would be very difficult for me to determine the impact on child maintenance of what the Deputy is trying to do when there are no data on that.</p></speech>

As somebody who practices in the courts, I am a bit taken aback by what was said about maintenance.  The payment has to be child related because if a spouse seeks individual support, it will amount to &euro;80 or &euro;90 and then the court will look at the children.  That is what we have to do.  I recall doing that when working on a judicial separation.  That is what is involved in making proper provision.  One would argue for &euro;30 or &euro;35 for a child.  The maintenance payment is severable.</p><p>The argument I have is about even getting a court order when everything is in place.  The judge orders someone to pay a certain amount, but that collapses after a month or six weeks.  If the man does not pay the money, the judge then tells his spouse to come back in.  The process starts all over again but in four months' time, the person will still not have a penny.  The Minister should grab the ball now.  She is innovative; I will say that for her.  She should grab this ball and maybe in this review, she should make sure that is incorporated.  They would say in Westmeath, which is not too far away from where she is from, that the head is not worth the wash in terms of going after this.</p><p> If we do this, it will cut out this nonsense and will keep this away from courts.  The Minister is dealing with a social protection system.  People in this position are vulnerable and are struggling, so this is important.  If Deputy Brady wants to bring it even closer to home, he can leave out the word "child" and just include the "maintenance" and change it to six months.  This would be a valuable report.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Doherty, spoke to me in the D&aacute;il about an issue I brought to her attention about pensions, that is, that persons born after 1 September 1946 would have a review of pension entitlements.  The changes brought in under this Bill are welcome.  The review will take place for people born after 6 April 1946 and not from 1 September 1946.  I asked the Minister take cognisance of this and to come back to me and, in fairness to her, she always does so.  The issue is 6 April 1946 versus 1 September 1946.  That will only affect a small number of people.</p></speech>

The only reason I did not table an amendment is that I am not 100% sure of the dates yet.  If what the Deputy said is true, we will bring in an amendment on Report Stage.  The Deputies do not have to worry.  If it needs to be fixed, it will be fixed.</p></speech>
