Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk to the committee, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the place Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or in the Convention Centre.  I ask Members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure we are adhering to the constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and he is joining us remotely.</p> <p>  Before we begin our public engagement, we considered the minutes of our meetings of 23, 24 and 30 March at our private meeting last Wednesday, 21 April.  Standing Order 107(3) requires that the minutes be agreed in a public session.  Are those minutes agreed to?  Agreed.  As previously agreed, the minutes will be published on the committee's website.</p></speech>

We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department: Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill, principal officer, and Mr. Donal Crowley, head of human resources.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from RT&Eacute;: Ms Dee Forbes, director general; Ms Eimear Cusack, director of human resources; and Ms Fiona O'Shea, group financial controller.  We are also joined by Ms Anne Louise O'Donovan, senior manager, BAI.  I warmly welcome all the witnesses to the meeting.  I thank them and their staff for the briefing material they prepared for the committee.  </p> <p>  I note that this is the first time the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and the Media - a big Department - has appeared before this committee.  I wish Mr. Healy and his staff every success with their diverse and important brief.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up background noise or feedback and, as usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, several of today&rsquo;s witnesses are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  To assist our broadcasting service and the staff of the Debates Office, I ask Members to direct their questions to specific witnesses.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, whether that is RT&Eacute; or the Department, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time they contribute.</p> <p>  I am informed that there is a technical issue with the Comptroller and Auditor General's connection so I invite Ms Forbes to make her opening statement.  She has five minutes and I will give her a reminder after four minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021042700002#A00700"><p>I thank the Chairman and all the members for inviting us here today.  The invitation comes at a very important time.  We sent the committee some notes last night which I hope the members will find useful to engage today.</p> <p>  The questions the members have regarding employment in RT&Eacute; are important.  Over the past few years, we in RT&Eacute; have reviewed, and changed as appropriate, the basis of engagement for a number of people whose working relationship with RT&Eacute; had evolved over time.  The Eversheds Sutherland review has been thorough and I and my colleagues are happy to answer questions on that across the next couple of hours.</p> <p>  At the outset, however, I thought it would be useful to give the committee some context of what is going on in our sector and within RT&Eacute; at present.  While terms and conditions of employment in RT&Eacute; and the sector are certainly important, the broader challenges facing the sector have caused many to lose their jobs and are threatening the future of many more.</p> <p>  Decisions soon to be made by the Government on the future of media in Ireland will have far-reaching consequences not just for RT&Eacute; and all who work here but the broader sector and, crucially, Irish audiences into the future.  Much is at stake.</p> <p>  Public service media now exists in a very different world from when RT&Eacute; was established.  Audiences in Ireland now live in a transformed media and communications landscape.  With unlimited choice and every interest and taste catered for, audiences enjoy a digital world - always on, accessible across multiple devices and, increasingly, delivered or mediated by global companies.  Audiences today exercise much more control over when and how they consume information, journalism and programming.</p> <p>  RT&Eacute; has evolved with these developments and still occupies a unique place at the heart of Irish public life.  Over the past 15 years RT&Eacute; has embraced the opportunities of digital technology.  Today, while continuing to deliver the country&rsquo;s leading broadcast channels, RT&Eacute; has extended its public value with market-leading online and mobile media services, offering all of its journalism and programming on the smartphone, tablet and desktop.  </p> <p>  These investments have ensured that RT&Eacute; remains at the centre of Irish public life, accessed in any given week by 94% of the people living in Ireland, and many more around the world.  This has never been more important than in the past year when RT&Eacute; underpinned a shared national narrative and was a consistent and trusted source of information, analysis and news that people could rely on every day to keep themselves, their families and their communities safer.  As independently tracked by Am&aacute;rach every week, 90% of the Irish people are choosing RT&Eacute; as their main source of information, news and analysis on Covid-19.</p> <p>  Over the next decade, as broadband speeds increase and coverage extends fully into rural areas and as digital devices become smarter and global competition becomes even greater, the effects of digital disruption on media are likely to become even more fast-moving and profound, particularly for a small country such as Ireland.</p> <p>  The members will see from our annual report in 2019 that RT&Eacute; carried a deficit for the year of &euro;7.2 million, a deficit that underscores a structural funding problem at RT&Eacute; that has emerged in the past decade.</p> <p>  The financial crash of 2008-09 devastated the economy and many sectors, including media.  In 2008, RT&Eacute; had total revenues of &euro;444 million; in 2019, RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s total revenues were &euro;342 million.</p><p>The result has been a significant contraction in investment in Irish broadcast journalism and programming over the past decade.  Investment by RT&Eacute; in the independent production sector has reduced from over &euro;75 million per annum in 2008 to &euro;40 million now.  RT&Eacute;'s investment in drama and children's programming has more than halved and its investment in factual programming has reduced by a third.  This is not good for RT&Eacute;, audiences in Ireland or the Irish creative media sectors.  </p><p> Reform and cost-cutting has been a necessary theme in RT&Eacute; throughout this period.  RT&Eacute; has reduced its annual operating costs by over 20%, approximately &euro;100 million, in line with a total fall in income of the same level.  Staff numbers have reduced by 22% from 2,351 in 2008 to 1,831 by the end of 2019.  That is a reduction of 520 people.  RT&Eacute; has also reduced its remuneration of top talent by over 30% on the 2008 levels.  </p><p> Due to ongoing financial constraints over the past decade, RT&Eacute; has only been able to invest half of what we should in capital.  In 2017, underutilised land in Donnybrook was sold to raise funds for essential capital investment in digital technology, studio infrastructure and to reduce debt and fund restructuring.  In late 2019, RT&Eacute; committed to further reducing its operating costs by &euro;60 million between 2020 and 2022.  RT&Eacute; is on track to deliver these reductions, which include a further reduction of 15% of our top talent fees and a 10% cut to the pay of the executive board, as well as a waiving of fees by the RT&Eacute; board.  However, cuts and asset disposals cannot sustain RT&Eacute;, let alone allow RT&Eacute; to invest to meet the needs of future generations.  Just when RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s income has sharply contracted, changing audience needs and increasing global competition demands that RT&Eacute; increase its investment in its journalism, programming and key technology so that we can retain distinctiveness and connection with our audiences.  Quite simply, RT&Eacute; does not have adequate revenues to deliver against our remit or fulfil our prescribed role.  Numerous independent reviews, including the review of the funding of public service broadcasting conducted by the joint Oireachtas committee in 2017, have identified the need for increased public funding for RT&Eacute; and structural reform to the TV licence system.  </p><p> As noted above, 94% of Irish people access one or more of RT&Eacute;'s services each week using multiple devices, yet the law still only stipulates ownership of a television as the basis for paying the TV licence.  In 2019, 11% of households therefore were ineligible to pay the TV licence.  The cost of collection is higher in Ireland than the European average, more than double that in the UK, and evasion levels in 2019 were also among the highest in Europe, at 12.6% of eligible households.  Both the levels of evasion and the numbers of ineligible homes have significantly increased since 2019.  By our estimates the evasion level rose to over 15% of homes in 2020, with the level of ineligible homes rising to 13%.  As a consequence, every year the current TV licence system is now losing over &euro;50 million.  To put that in context, that is the equivalent to the annual cost of all programming on RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s radio stations and orchestra.  It is more than RT&Eacute; spends annually on news and current affairs programming on RT&Eacute; 1 and RT&Eacute; Radio 1.  It is more than double what RT&Eacute; currently spends on TV drama.  It is more than three times the current Broadcasting Association of Ireland, BAI, sound and vision scheme, which supports independent producers.  That is the amount being lost every year.  The system is also unfair on those who pay.  It should be a universal fee to which all households contribute and benefit, but over a quarter of households now do not pay at all.  The TV licence fee system is now by some distance the most unreformed part of the public media in Ireland.  Fixing this is the responsibility of Government.  Persistent failures to do so have already cost jobs, both within RT&Eacute; and the broader audiovisual sector, and hundreds of hours of journalism, creative and cultural programming.  </p><p> Key decisions are now essential to secure the future of public service media in Ireland and those who work in it.  Inaction will mean a decline in RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s relevance, financial sustainability and the level of services it can provide.  Those who gain from this decline will not be Irish-owned media organisations but, in the main, large international media providers who invest little or nothing in Irish-focused programming or journalism or create or sustain jobs here.  </p><p> Much is at risk beyond RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s own future, from Irish investigative broadcast journalism, comprehensive election and political coverage, international broadcast news coverage, to in-depth coverage of Northern Ireland and national regional coverage, a vibrant Irish TV drama sector, a viable independent production sector, distinctively Irish children&rsquo;s programming, cultural and arts programming, significant investment in Irish sport and Irish-language news, current affairs and radio services.  None of these services or activities is sustainable on any scale in this country without a strong and viable RT&Eacute;.  I thank the Chair.  We look forward to the discussion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021042700002#B00300"><p>One of the programmes under the 2019 Vote for Communications, Climate Action and Environment funded a range of expenditures related to broadcasting.  As a result of changes in departmental responsibilities following the formation of the Government in 2020, responsibility for broadcasting expenditure transferred to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and will, from 2020 on, be accounted for in the Vote for that Department.</p> <p>  Broadcasting expenditure in 2019 totalled &euro;260.4 million.  The largest element of the expenditure was annual grant funding provided to RT&Eacute;, totalling &euro;196.5 million.  Grant funding to Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge amounted to &euro;36.2 million.  The broadcasting fund, which is used mainly to grant assist the development and production of programmes for radio and television, received a contribution from the Vote of &euro;14.8 million in 2019.  The fund is managed by the BAI.   </p> <p>  A substantial part of the Vote expenditure on broadcasting is funded by appropriations-in-aid in the form of broadcasting licence fee income.  Receipts of licence fees in 2019 totalled &euro;222.7 million, an increase of around 1.6% from the 2018 level.  Payments to An Post to cover the costs of collection of the licence fees totalled &euro;11.4 million in 2019.  The vote contribution to the broadcasting fund is equivalent to 7% of the net licence fee receipts, after the payment to An Post.  RT&Eacute; receives grant funding equivalent to the balance of the fee receipts. </p> <p>  Committee members may wish to note that while I audit the financial statements of Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge and the BAI, I do not have responsibility for the audit of the financial statements of RT&Eacute;, which is classified as a commercial State body.  Consequently, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s financial statements.</p></speech>

In particular, I thank the representatives of RT&Eacute; for "Home School Hub" which has been a lifesaver for many people.</p> <p>  I take from Ms Forbes's opening remarks that we have a big structural funding problem with RT&Eacute;, which is accessed by 94% of people and 90% of people choose RT&Eacute; as their main news source.  It is clearly in a dominant market position but experiencing a structural funding problem.  Ms Forbes is suggesting the solution to that is a need for increased public funding and reform to the TV licence, which I know has formed a strong part of RT&Eacute;'s communications for many years.</p><p>I have broader concerns on the structural funding problem that I want to go through with Ms Forbes in some detail.  I feel there is an over focus on the licence fee as a possible solution to RT&Eacute;'s financial difficulties.  I have some questions to pose that might help me to better understand the situation.  At what stage did RT&Eacute; cease to be on the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS?</p></speech>

I thank Ms Forbes.  What I am curious about is that from a consumer's perspective, television has changed considerably.  The licence fee is one of many fees that are available for accessing content.  People might have some combination of Sky, Virgin, Eir, sports channels or Netflix.  The cost of television is much higher from a consumer's perspective if one has a Sky package and pays the TV licence.  How much does RT&Eacute; get from Sky for me to watch its content on Sky's platform?</p></speech>

We do not get paid anything by Sky or Virgin for the provision of our channels in that environment.  That has been the case forever.  We do get a fee for our player, because the player is a new way of viewing, but it is a small amount compared to what the value of the channels would be to Sky and Virgin.  We have had many conversations with the joint Oireachtas committee and with Sky and Virgin about this.  The provision of funds to public service broadcasters by cable and satellite providers is a subject that is being discussed in many countries at the moment, but that is not the case in most countries.

One would be able to get select broadcasts.  Typically, what one would see most of all on Facebook or Twitter would be news.  If there is a broadcast from the Taoiseach or something happens election-wise, we will put our broadcast out.  Again, there is no funding from any of those platforms for RT&Eacute;.  The Deputy is probably aware of the groundbreaking changes that happened recently in Australia.  Google was the first to receive payment for its news services from News Corporation in that territory.  What we are seeing is possibly a shift coming from the online providers and we will begin conversations shortly on that, but that was the first time for an online provider to be paid by a news outlet for its content.  That is a global deal, which will apply to News Corporation's content everywhere in the world.</p></speech>

It is more than selective; it is all of this week's major political stories, for example.  I presume there is a feed through, because what RT&Eacute; wants from Facebook is deriving the advertising from billions of eyeballs.  Facebook is deriving information from people to better target them.  It is profiting from this advertising model by people going on Facebook and watching RT&Eacute;'s public service content in large part.</p></speech>

Obviously, our content does help Facebook.  As we expand and appeal to the users of Facebook and Twitter, it is important that the demographic is also getting access to public service content, because as the Deputy knows, many of the younger generation are accessing TV content through their devices, which is their chosen mode.  It does help us in terms of awareness building, but we do not benefit from any cash coming the other way.  It benefits their awareness and it is helping the younger generation see news, current affairs or discussions that we are having, in particular on a national level.</p></speech>

It is our remit to attract as many people as possible, hence us being on as many platforms as possible.  That is good from a public service objective, but also getting to the audience.  What we are seeing more and more is that audiences, in particular in the younger demographic, are choosing to watch when and where they watch.  We have seen time spent on our own player increase significantly this year, for example, as audiences go there to watch more and more content.  I accept we have to monetise that content because we are public service and commercial.  The more people that know they can watch "The Young Offenders" or the latest drama and the more people that know it is on, the greater chance we have of attracting them and getting a wider reach.</p></speech>

I pay the TV licence fee for that public service content, but it is coming out for nothing.  Last night, for example, I went on Facebook.  I went into the news app.  Ms Forbes referred in her opening statement to being a market leader in its use of digital technology.  I presume I have been driven to the news app so that RT&Eacute; can derive further advertising revenue from me watching the content I seek and I ended up with it broken.  Ms Forbes is welcome to check, but the date stamp for last night was not working.  If I go through to the RT&Eacute; website now, I see some advertising from which it can derive revenue, but there is so much available on the RT&Eacute; 1 channel.  I can see last week's "Prime Time" interview and a link to "The Week in Politics".  It is not just selective content concerning elections, it is a continual stream of content.  We pay for it by way of the TV licence and RT&Eacute; is creating good content, but it is essentially being given away on Facebook for no return.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in the sense that while all these platforms provide awareness building, they are getting bigger and bigger.  The discussions have started in Australia where for the first time there is payment coming the other way and we will probably see more of that.  It is certainly something that we are very keen to progress because it is incumbent on the newer providers in the market to be fair and decent and to pay for some of that content.  I think we will see more on that in the months ahead.</p></speech>

The land was sold at a moment in the market at a one-off price.  How did RT&Eacute; originally acquire the land?  Was it part of a public service transfer, and if so, when?  I just do not know the answer to that.</p><p>What was the original source of the land RT&Eacute; has?</p></speech>

I do not know if the Deputy is aware, but it was a piece of unused land.  There was nothing on it apart from a sports and social club.  When we were looking at the sale of this land, it was examined mainly through the lens of where the money would go if the asset was sold.  Due to the years of underinvestment, particularly in capital, we really felt the need to release some money for capital.  We had to go through the various checks and balances.  We had to get approval and then-----</p></speech>

What I am curious about is whether consideration was given to alternative options to a single once-off moment-in-time sale.  Were any long-term revenue raising options considered?  I ask that because of the long-term difficulties that RT&Eacute;, especially with structural funding and pension funds.  A moment-in-time sale only represents one option.  For example, was consideration given to a model such as that used by Transport for London, where rental properties are built over their stations, etc., and a long-term income is derived from that revenue source, or was it a case of option A being a sale, and option B being to look at option A?  What other strategies were considered?</p></speech>

The advice at the time was pretty clear that a sale would generate the best return.  As the Deputy probably knows, it did generate a large amount of cash and the money has since been put to various uses.  We had advisers working with us on this decision to ensure that this was not just a one-option only situation.  We looked at various options, and this was deemed to be the best one at the time, given the market was particularly buoyant as well then.  That is how that happened.</p></speech>

I will move on to ask Ms Forbes about the Eversheds Sutherland report and this question regarding competition and competitive talent in particular.  It is of interest because it is very visible.  I appreciate that it is a very small part of RT&Eacute;'s employment profile generally, but it is a visible one in which people are interested and also an aspect that I think frustrates people.  I suggest that what frustrates people in particular is the idea that there is this huge competitive broadcasting market where top talent would be snaffled up in a second but for the pay those people get.</p> <p>  I was concerned to see reports from Virgin Media referring to aggression by RT&Eacute; in respect of outbidding on talent, on production staff or on sports' rights, for example.  Given RT&Eacute;'s position in the market as reflected in Ms Forbes's opening statement, does she really think it is credible that the top talent would fly, as it were, but for the fees they are paid and the structure through which those fees are paid?</p></speech>

First, all the world over in the media and entertainment sector there is a requirement for skilled staff to present shows.  Those people command a certain value.  It is a value that is higher than the average salary in any organisation.  It is the same right around the world.  I regularly compare notes with other public service broadcasters in Europe, for example.  It is a factor of the entertainment and media industry that people who present programmes and shows command a market.  It is also important to state that certainly-----</p></speech>

The market, though, is necessarily local or linguistic.  There is not a competitive European market for talent.  It is not as though an RT&Eacute; presenter is going to go off and land a gig presenting in France because there are obvious language barriers.  There is even the very local nature of language, linguistics and familiarity, so the market is much more local in this regard.  There is the possibility of the UK and that is about it.</p></speech>

The market is local.  What I am saying is that it is a feature of the overall media market that the talent are paid various rates above normal salaries in other broadcasters.  The important thing to note here is that these people fulfil a particular role and they have a particular skill set.  They fulfil a public service remit and, I suppose, a commercial role for us which attracts advertisers etc..  Having said that, I appreciate that this causes concern among the population and the members of the committee.  Since 2008, however, those salaries have reduced by 30%.  In 2019, we committed to those salaries reducing by a further 15%.  Our annual report for 2020 is not out yet, but when it is available it will be evident that the top talent group has been reduced by a further 15%.  I am very conscious of this aspect, as is RT&Eacute; as an organisation.</p> <p>However, we must also recognise that these people play a very important role for us as a broadcaster, commercially and in doing their job.  It is something we are keeping under constant review.  I hope the Deputy sees and hears our presenters every day and what we ask them to do.  It is not that simple to put together a two-hour show or to be on camera for two hours.  Here we are and it is hard enough for one hour.  These presenters are skilled and they have a particular set of skills.  Having said that, however, the reductions have come about, namely, of 30% since 2008 and a further 15% last year.</p></speech>

It was really beneficial for many primary school students during that time.  It was well done and well produced.  Well done on that.  Turning to the reduction in the deficit run by RT&Eacute;, it was &euro;13 million in 2018 and that was down to &euro;7 million in 2019.

Concerning the changes in finances during 2019, there was an overall increase of &euro;3 million in our revenue, which was largely due to an increase in licence fee income in the year.  There was also the reversal of prior year emergency cuts which were reinstated.  We had an increase of &euro;7.2 million in our licence fee income.  Our commercial revenue, however, declined in that year, largely due to the impact of Brexit on the media sector across Ireland.  Our declines in commercial revenue are broadly in line with the experience across the media sector.  Our operating costs declined in the year, and again that was probably a factor of the change in content and events.  We had a reduction in the cost of special events between 2018 and 2019 as well, so that gave rise to a net deficit improvement of &euro;5.8 million in the year.</p></speech>

I note that public funding in 2016, for instance, was &euro;179.3 million, while commercial revenue stood at &euro;158.2 million.  Where do those figures stand today compared to 2016?  Has RT&Eacute;'s commercial revenue improved since 2016 or has the licence fee income improved?  I ask that because I note that Ms Forbes stated in her opening remarks that the evasion rate for the licence fee was in and around 15% for 2020.  Back in 2018, it was similar enough at about 15% as well.  Is that the average percentage of evasion?  I ask Ms Forbes to deal with the issue of the comparison between commercial revenue and licence fee income first, please.</p></speech>

In 2015, for example, television licence revenue was &euro;178.9 million and commercial revenue was &euro;155.4 million.  In 2019, our most recently audited set of accounts, television licence revenue was &euro;196.248 million and commercial revenue was &euro;145.837 million.  It can be seen from those figures that commercial revenue has declined and that licence fee revenue has increased.  There are a number of things here.  During the recession, there was an amount of money taken away from RT&Eacute;.  In the years from 2016 onwards, a lot of that money was put back into the licence fee, if you like.  It was replenishing moneys that were taken away.  In the main, that is what we are seeing here.  Ms O'Shea can comment on this.  That is what has happened really with the licence fee.  The licence fee revenue has increased but it has increased because there was a move to make up for moneys that were taken away.</p></speech>

If I can turn to the task RT&Eacute; has ahead of itself in the context of digital content, when she was last before the committee in May 2018, Ms Forbes recognised that this is a major challenge for RT&Eacute; in this regard.

As I informed the previous speaker, the younger generation are now consuming their media through digital devices.  Part of the reason for the land sale we did in 2017 was to generate some capital in order that we could improve our infrastructure.  We have put a lot of money into improving our digital infrastructure, whether it be studios, cameras or equipment, to enable us to do all of that.  The RT&Eacute; Player is the choice now for many people to come to first and we have had to invest substantially in the player in order to make it fit for purpose because, of course, we are being compared with Netflix, Amazon, etc.  It is something that we are continuing to do.</p> <p>  A digital first strategy in news has been prevalent for the past couple of years.  Whereas people will recall a time when they would hear a news break at 6 p.m. or 9 p.m., as news stories break now people get them immediately because that is what they want.  We have been adjusting our technology, on the one hand, but we have also been adjusting our content and how we deliver it, whether it is news, whether it is podcasts or whether it is the ability to hear and see content where and when one wants.  A key aspect is that digital audiences are strong but we still have some way to go in maximising the revenue generated from that because, as everybody says in the media, there is not an equivalence in that one euro in the linear world does not equate to what is on offer in the digital world.  That is the challenge the organisation faces.</p></speech>

In terms of the evasion rate and the collection for the licence fee, Ms Forbes has been a big advocate of reforming the licence fee and what it is charged for.  She mentioned that we have one of the highest average rates of collection in Europe.  Can she explain why the cost of collection and the evasion rate are higher here than in other jurisdictions across Europe?</p></speech>

RT&Eacute;, as the Deputy will be aware, is not responsible for the collection of the fee.  There are a number of things involved.  There is a need to invest in the database that is being used and, I suppose, the penalties for non-payment probably need to be looked at as well.  I am sure the Department would have further comment on that.</p></speech>

Some of that content is international and some of it may be Irish.  I will have to go and get the figure.</p></speech>

The majority of our money goes on local.  That is, I suppose, our differentiator.  We are here to tell Ireland's story.  We are here to support the industry.  Of course, we do acquire content, whether from US studios or UK studios, but the majority of our content is indigenous Irish programmes.  I will get the Deputy the exact percentage so that he has it.</p></speech>

Maybe we would look into that for Ms Forbes, given that there are probably 500 televisions in Leinster House alone.  It seems that there are some anomalies.</p> <p>  Another issue I would like to bring up is that earlier in the year there was a charitable payout based on a defamatory claim made against RT&Eacute; - a libel action.

What we have seen in recent years is a significant increase in the number of households that do not have TVs.  That goes back to the changing way in which individuals consume media.  Over the last ten years we have seen an increase in what we call no-TV homes.  Our latest figures from January 2021 show an increase in the number of such homes from about 2% to 13%.  There is a significant increase in that number and those people are not eligible to purchase a television licence.</p></speech>

We have to take those statistics on face value.  There is a change in how people consume media so it is credible that there has been an increase in no-TV homes.  A lot of this boils down to the definition under which one must purchase a television licence.  That is something we have had a lot of discussions about and it is well documented that the device definition for purchasing a TV licence is narrow.  That is of concern to us and we would hope that would be reformed.</p></speech>

I acknowledge Ms Forbes and the staff in RT&Eacute;, who have demonstrated a clear public purpose during the Covid-19 crisis as an essential service bringing our nation together.  RT&Eacute; did a tremendous job across all services in continuing with live broadcasts, and as Deputy Devlin said, in bringing new programmes forward, especially "Home School Hub", "Ireland on Call" and "RT&Eacute; Investigates".  Well done on that and I am sure these achievements were not easy, especially against the backdrop of extreme financial uncertainty.</p> <p>  Ms Forbes mentioned the deficit of &euro;7.2 million in 2018 from the annual accounts in her opening statements.  It was recorded as &euro;12.6 million.  Can Ms Forbes give us some information on the expected deficit for 2020?</p></speech>

They are much appreciated.  On 2020, as the Deputy is probably aware our accounts have not yet been audited or signed off by our board.  Having said that, to give the Deputy an indication I can say that last year was an incredible year on many levels, whether it was simply keeping everything going and keeping the country going or the huge shifts we saw in how we work as an organisation.  On the one hand, our expenditure was less than expected.  Why was that?  Some of the big sporting events did not happen.  The Olympics and the UEFA European Championship were cancelled and the GAA season, along with a huge amount of other sporting activity, was curtailed.  However, some of those events were deferred and were not cancelled completely and we are hoping some of them will happen this year.  Likewise, a lot of production could not happen.  We had to stand down &quot;Fair City&quot; for many months while we physically could not produce it.  The sector, particularly in the first lockdown, was not able to produce.  We did not fulfil our commitment to the independent sector last year because it was not possible as it was not able to produce.  Our expenditure was lower than expected but our revenue was also lower than expected, even though as the country opened up we got a bounce and revenue improved.  All in all, when our accounts come to pass - and it was reported recently in <i>The Irish Times</i>- we will report a surplus in 2020.  That was an unreal year, however, and we have to look at Covid over a two-year cycle because a lot of the reason we were able to do better than was anticipated was the deferral of a lot of cost but that cost will come back in.</p></speech>

I know so many actions on this were linked to a new reporting template that was introduced with a focus on monthly meetings.  Are these meetings still taking place?  Can Ms Forbes give us an indication of RT&Eacute;'s most recent meeting with the officials in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and NewERA on how RT&Eacute; can become more sustainable in the months ahead?  What actions is RT&Eacute; looking to implement?  I note NewERA is looking to publish a report.  When will that be published?</p></speech>

In the revised strategy, we committed to reducing our operating costs by a further &euro;60 million over a period of time.  We are still committed to doing that but the make-up of how we do it will be different from when the strategy was published because 2019 seems like forever ago and the world has changed completely.  There are a number of things we had planned to do that did not happen for whatever reason and there are a number of things that have simply been delayed or were not possible.  However, we are committed to saving that money in that period.  The important thing to bear in mind that we mentioned all the way through is that three things need to happen for there to be a sustainable RT&Eacute;.  First, public funding needs to be rectified.  Second, our costs need to reduce.  Third, our commercial revenue needs to stabilise.  Those three things are all important in the mix for us to get to that place.  I ask Ms O'Shea to talk about the engagement with NewERA, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

We have regular engagement and meetings with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and NewERA on tracking those initiatives.  The savings under those have been built into RT&Eacute;'s budget for 2021 and we engage directly with the Department on tracking the delivery of those initiatives.  That is an ongoing process.</p></speech>

She said something earlier that we should not let pass, namely that RT&Eacute; is a trusted source of news, a place of robust journalism and it supports the cultural life of Ireland.  Increasingly, RT&Eacute; is competing with operators that do not fulfil those categories.  While RT&Eacute; might receive public money, it is worth championing that work at the same time.  Equally, that is the reason RT&Eacute; comes before us.  It does so to be accountable and answer questions.</p> <p>  In that vein, I will turn to the Eversheds Sutherland report on contractors.  The report recommended that there were 157 contractors that it believed would be better placed as being directly employed.  Could Ms Forbes say whether she believes that RT&Eacute; has robustly responded to that and whether that response is complete?  Of those people who were offered contracts and declined them, are they still in RT&Eacute;'s employment?  What measures has RT&Eacute; taken to ensure it is correctly complying with the Revenue guidelines and so on?</p></speech>

To answer the Deputy's questions, we engaged in a thorough process with Eversheds Sutherland in the reviewing of all contractors back in 2018 and 2019.  Part of that was an engagement with our trade union group on setting up governing principles which directed the course of travel on how we would carry out the process.  It was inclusive and transparent.</p><p>Of the contractors who were under review, 82 were offered contracts of employment, of whom 79 accepted.  The three who did not accept are no longer with us.  As part of the Eversheds review we engaged in a complete revamp and reformulation of our policy regarding how we engage services and employees.  We carried out training for both managers and staff, and anybody involved in the recruitment process, to make sure we are compliant going forward.  In that vein, we have a cross-division group that meets every second Monday.  Every request for engagement comes through that group where it is scrutinised for compliance. </p></speech>

However, I receive negative reports from people north of the Border who find themselves geo-blocked from content on the player or access to GAA content.  In negotiations with international providers, does RT&Eacute; seek to have an all-island usage?  With regard to sporting organisations, does RT&Eacute; seek to provide that coverage on an all-island basis?  It does not seem consistent with what is otherwise a very all-Ireland based approach by the broadcaster.</p></speech>

Let us take sport first of all.  It is the sporting bodies that dictate the break-up.  Quite often sports discussions are held for the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland discussion is had as part of the UK negotiation.  That is the way the bodies work.  It is nothing to do with the broadcasters.  Some bodies are obviously different but that is the way they carve it up.  We often get questions from our viewers as well but it is not something we decide.  It is decided by the federations.</p></speech>

The vast majority are shown in the Thirty-two Counties.</p></speech>

With the GAA, there is ourselves, BBC Northern Ireland and Sky.  Depending on who has what match, one might not always get the player rights.  As I say, it is on a case-by-case or sport right by sport right basis.  It is likewise with the acquisition of media when dealing with companies like Disney or Warner.  They typically see Northern Ireland as part of the UK so the rights are discussed on that basis and that is why people will sometimes not get a programme.  Where possible when we are commissioning programmes we will typically buy 32-county rights.  We will always commission for the Thirty-two Counties but there are occasions where for some reason we cannot.  Music rights also have to be taken into consideration.  It is not a simple issue.  Of course we would have an all-island approach if we could because that is our remit.  Our news, current affairs, Irish drama and factual content are all 32-county and that is a very important piece for us.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work RT&Eacute; has done throughout the pandemic as part of its public broadcasting remit, particularly in reassuring people and relieving their anxiety over the past 12 months or so and imparting information based on science and fact.</p> <p>  I only have a few minutes.  There are so many things I would like to talk about but I will focus on the independent sector.  As I understand it, the independent production sector is protected under the Broadcasting Act 2009.  I want to delve a little deeper into how Ms Forbes proposes to increase that funding as we open up society and the economy.  What reassurances can she give to that sector that it will be the beneficiary of increased funding for output for the next 12 to 24 months?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021042700002#G00900"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  The independent sector is hugely important to us.  We are a partner in the production and provision of Irish content to our audiences.  That is the first thing.  Last year was a particularly tough year for the sector because practically no production was possible during the first lockdown.  We were producing here as an essential service but everybody was still getting to grips with protocols and how to produce in a safe environment, so the first lockdown was very difficult.  As I said, we underspent our commitment so we have commissioned excess programming this year to try to make up for that shortfall.  We have regular contact and dialogue with the sector and have commissioned significant content this year.  We talk with Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, on a regular basis and constantly update it on where we are at.  This year will be a challenge - it already is - and we are seeing some issues come our way even with mandatory hotel quarantine, for example.  We have a production crew coming in from Belgium on an important Irish drama in June and it is proving a huge issue in terms of both cost and availability.  We are not out of the woods yet but the important thing is our commitment to absolutely honour what we should be spending.  It is also important to state that under the Broadcasting Act 2009 it is a requirement of RT&Eacute; to spend that money and we have two years after the year in which we did not spend it to do so.  If production reduces again this year we have to keep commissioning until we get to that level.</p></speech>

She has hit the nail on the head.  There is an obligation on RT&Eacute; as per the legislation and she has confirmed that it will fulfil that commitment.  That is where I was going with my point so I welcome that reply.  I wholeheartedly agree about how people procure their content now and the multiplicity of devices that are available to people.  We have not been strong enough politically in acknowledging that content is not free.  There is a price to be paid and a cost incurred in creating content.  We will all watch with interest what happens in Australia and Ms Forbes made a point about how that might permeate through to Ireland.</p> <p>  I am interested in whether RT&Eacute; is now thinking about 5G and things like the roll-out of enhanced fibre broadband.  Donnybrook and the citadel that is RT&Eacute; was a place where there was a lot of production going on but surely to goodness with the advent of 5G, and people are already talking about 6G, there is a mechanism to use more geographical locations to produce content and give voice to the regions in how we produce content in this country, because the technology would allow us to do that.</p></speech>

One could say that Covid has enhanced that even more.  The speed of adoption of things like online viewing or listening has catapulted in the last year.</p> <p>  Production is a complex business in many regards.  Yes, in theory production can happen anywhere but having said that, there has to be infrastructure around it.  The Deputy rightly pointed out that we produce a lot of content in Donnybrook.  We also do so in Cork, as he knows.  The studio in Cork produces "The Today Show" while John Creedon broadcasts from there on a regular basis and "Nationwide" comes out of there as well.</p><p>What is really interesting coming out of Covid is how we will work in the future.  We are currently assessing this.  It is fair to say that going back to a full Donnybrook, for example, will probably not happen for some time, so we are currently engaging with our staff with regard to the desire for a blended work week going forward and what that will look like.  Will everybody be on site fully five days per week?  They probably will not because of how we are doing this.</p><p> We must consider what that will do to our content production.  Unless one has the infrastructure, it is not as easy as simply saying production can happen anywhere.  However, it is certainly the case that technology enables us to be anywhere, as can be seen in the context of news reporting in particular.  There was a time when one had to have a big outside broadcast unit on the road with the local correspondents.  That is no longer the case.  They have a small piece of equipment and can broadcast live and the signal comes to wherever it is needed.</p><p> That is probably a long-winded way of saying that all this is being reviewed to simply see what is the best way forward.  I think it will be a mix, including what we have now, but technology will certainly enable us to build a new phase in our broadcasting.</p></speech>

I will try to focus on one issue.  I would love to have more time to go across the spectrum on this but I will focus on the Eversheds report.  The vast majority of people who ended up being on the payroll as opposed to contractors were not the top earners but, rather, were on between &euro;30,000 and probably &euro;70,000.  I am wondering whether, in terms of retrospection, they were misclassified to begin with.  They are still doing the same jobs but they have now been classified as employees.  Is it not self-evident that retrospection should be automatic and that there is a duty of care to the staff in that regard?  Where is that at this point in terms of consideration of retrospection?</p></speech>

That answers where RT&Eacute; is with the process at the moment.  Eversheds went back two years.  Is it not self-evident that there is a degree of retrospection when there was a look-back?  That is an observation.  In the UK, they are referred to as counterparts because it is not entirely set up on the same basis.  The BBC ran into some significant high-profile difficulties with the same type of scenario some years back and the UK HM Revenue and Customs was brought in front of the Committee of Public Accounts of the House of Commons on foot of that.  Was a Revenue audit ever carried out?  Was this issue ever picked up in the past ten years?  Did the auditors of RT&Eacute; pick this up as an issue?  I know it was raised continuously by some of the unions representing the staff.</p></speech>

When I came into RT&Eacute; in 2016, I undertook to do a role and gender review and it was made clear to me at the time by union officials and some staff that we needed to look at the area of contractors.  I committed that we would do so as an organisation.  As Ms Cusack pointed out, the review is done and there are still pieces to be done on that.  I do not know whether Ms O'Shea has awareness of a previous Revenue audit.  We have such an audit going on currently.</p></speech>

We are currently in the process of a Revenue audit,.  That process is ongoing on foot of the Eversheds review and we have had specific audits throughout the year on other matters as they have arisen.  We are fully transparent in our dealings with Revenue in respect of all these inquiries.</p></speech>

That is very important.  In many ways, RT&Eacute; is an example of things at which we need to look in other organisations with regard to self-employment because the Social Insurance Fund has to be put on a firm footing, just as RT&Eacute; obviously has to be put on a firm financial footing.  Essentially, it is Revenue as well as the scope section.  Was it just a triggered audit by Revenue on foot of the Eversheds report or did it specifically relate to this matter?</p> <p>  How much has been spent on the Eversheds report to date, including legal fees?</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners on initial publication of our Eversheds review initiated an aspect query which subsequently became a Revenue audit notification to us.  We have been fully co-operating with them and with regard to the findings and the detailed individual analysis post the initial Eversheds Sutherland report publication.</p> <p>  As regards the specific expenditure on the Eversheds report, I do not have that information to hand.  We will provide that information after the meeting.</p></speech>

I totally get that RT&Eacute; needs more money and that the licence fee is inadequate in terms of how it is currently administered.  I also get that RT&Eacute; has to pay large salaries to presenters.  As much as all present would like to think that we could present a television programme, the reality is that nobody would tune in to watch it.  However, bearing in mind that we will all retire at some stage, I would like to ask Ms Forbes what sort of fee I can look forward to charging RT&Eacute; for "Iarnr&oacute;d Marc", which I am going to make when I finish being a Deputy?</p></speech>

I ask Ms Forbes to email the name of that company to all Oireachtas Members in order that the also-rans after the next election will know where to send a few CVs with their production ideas.  It is a very enjoyable programme.  Unfortunately, I am not blessed with Irish.  I did not study hard enough.   Nevertheless, I found the programme immensely entertaining.

The net return to RT&Eacute; was approximately &euro;78 million.  RT&Eacute; distributed that appropriately in terms of capital expenditure and some other things it had to do.  It reduced the debt by &euro;10 million and did several other things.  The net price per acre was pretty good.  It is a very sought after part of Dublin.  At approximately &euro;10 million an acre, the remaining land would fetch in the region of &euro;200 million.  Going back to the time of the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Alex White, one of the considerations was whether RT&Eacute; should leave Montrose altogether and relocate to another location.</p><p>Of course, the broadcaster's original home was in Athlone, even before it was at the GPO.</p><p> Would it be a consideration that, aside from retaining modest and essential studio facilities in an expensive part of Dublin, be it city or county, RT&Eacute; could, from a production perspective, cash in the chips for &euro;200 million and relocate to somewhere in counties Kildare, Meath, Wicklow or wherever?  Is there an opportunity for independent production facilities whereby RT&Eacute; could supply the infrastructure to be used by independent companies, movie makers or whatever, instead of them having to go to Ardmore, the studio in Limerick, Shepperton or one of the other studios in the UK?  If RT&Eacute; were to sell everything, bank a proposal whereby &euro;200 million would come in, clear its remaining debt and, it would be hoped, be left with something like &euro;170 million, would that be something worth considering?  Notwithstanding that we have to get the structure of funding correct in any event, would that be a viable option?  Has it been considered?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021042700002#J00200"><p>It is a really interesting point.  As the Deputy said, the land we sold went for a very lucrative price.  I think it was the highest price per acre ever in this market.  The value has now reduced but that does not mean it may not rise again.  The thing we have to think about, and we have done a lot of work on this over the years, is that it is quite a complex matter simply to lift and shift RT&Eacute; because of the infrastructure needed for broadcast.  While the Deputy is correct to say that, if we were starting again, we would probably not need all the studio infrastructure we have right now, we have to look at the feasibility of that because the last time we looked at this, which was a couple of years ago, the amount of money we would get from a land sale and then to be able to build would not add up.  We simply would not have enough money.  If we take, for example, what the BBC has done and what the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is doing, they are availing of significant other cash to move from where they are to where they are going to be.  Typically, they are part of renewed areas or media city developments, so they are becoming anchor tenants in a creative space.  They are getting preferential rates and everything else to be part of this.</p> <p>  This is something we have to keep on the agenda and keep looking at, but the maths, the last time we did them, did not add up in terms of being able to afford to move and build what is needed.  Right now, there is no media city in Ireland like that in the UK, for example.  Having said that, plans are afoot and it is great to hear that studios are coming in and setting up sound stages in the years ahead in and around Dublin, Wicklow, Wexford and so on.  That is something we keep a close eye on but, as I said, the maths just do not add up at this point.  The interesting thing about the land we sold is that it was greenfield; there was nothing on it.  It was a ready-made field that did not have any complex infrastructure.  That made it very attractive to the buyer.</p></speech>

As my colleague, Ms Cusack, outlined, the purpose of the Eversheds Sutherland report was to look at a number of people whose conditions changed over time.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021042700002#J02600"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  To return to the issue of the licence fee, commitments were made in 2019 by the then Minister with responsibility for communications to examine the device-based model, which I am under the impression RT&Eacute; would support.  Has there been any significant communication or development between RT&Eacute; and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on that issue, and will the witnesses give an update on it?  We are not the only country that is struggling with public funding through a device-based model.  In the UK, there has been a great deal of unhappiness since March at the fact the BBC did not manage to adopt a more progressive funding model.</p><p>One of the things that was pointed out during that back and forth was that the Government had a concern that due to a failure to roll out broadband, a device-based model of funding for the licence fee would disenfranchise a certain section of the population.  A device-based licence fee would be based on access to broadband, with regard to the public broadcasting aspect of it.  I am interested in Ms Forbes's thoughts on that.  Is a device-based model for the licence fee directly linked to or dependent on our roll-out of broadband?</p><p> My second question is around RT&Eacute; Player.  It is probably not news to RT&Eacute; to say that sometimes there is criticism of RT&Eacute; Player and its efficacy.  I would like to understand a little bit more about how RT&Eacute; is going to update that and keep it as live and relevant to users as it can possibly be.  Before Christmas there was a significant issue around access to the Irish Sign Language, ISL, element of the RT&Eacute; Player.  For how long did that happen?  When it was rectified was there follow up to see how we can ensure that it does not happen again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.157" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021042700002#K00200"><p>I will take the RT&Eacute; Player question first.  As the Deputy has pointed out, there have been some technical issues.  It is worth saying, at the outset, that the nature of the RT&Eacute; Player is complex because it is a combination of live and streamed content, unlike Netflix and unlike Amazon, but Amazon does have some live sport.  When one thinks about it, one is getting a stream from Netflix but if a person is watching RT&Eacute; Player live it is a very different entity.  Having said that, we have spent a lot of time and money in the last couple of years trying to upgrade it to the best product we can do.  In the last eight to 12 months it has improved and, for example, we are seeing that time spent on RT&Eacute; Player at the moment up by about 43%.  The amount of content has increased and the quality of the player has improved.  We have to develop and enhance it constantly.  As the technology improves, so too will our process.  I am not aware of the ISL issue but I will come back to the Deputy on it and get her an answer.</p> <p>  On the licence fee and the model to be decided on, there are a couple of things.  First of all, in Ireland right now if a person is watching RT&Eacute; on RT&Eacute; Player he or she does not need a licence fee.  That is the loophole in the current legislation.  We had been talking a lot with the Department about closing that loophole.  The UK closed it a number of years ago.  If a person is watching the BBC iPlayer in the UK it automatically asks if the viewer has paid the licence fee.  If not, it directs the person to the licence fee payment method.  The licence fee in Ireland is now the subject of a media commission investigation.  Part of that remit is to come up with a model that is best for this country, whether it is device-based or one of the other models.  A number of countries around Europe are grappling with this, but there are also many successes such as in Germany, Italy and the Nordic countries.  Other countries have managed to solve this.  At this stage it is being discussed by the media commission and we hope it will recommend a model in the months ahead.</p></speech>

Some of what I will ask may have been covered.  I thank the witnesses for the documentation we received on the presentation.</p> <p>  The commercial income for RT&Eacute; has, over the past number of years, experienced a downturn in certain areas and a lot more competition.  How does Ms Forbes see commercial income progressing over the next four to five years?  Is there any area that Ms Forbes believes needs investment in order to generate a larger portion of that income, which is currently going to competitors?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.159" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021042700002#K00400"><p>Commercial revenue or advertising revenue is really all about demand and supply.  Over the years, when there was only terrestrial television, advertising revenue increased.  Since the advent of digital players, such as Google, Facebook and others, the number of platforms available to the advertisers has grown.  In the main, the money involved in advertising has reduced and the number of players having to fight for that has also increased.  There is less money with more players.  Having said that, we are working at the moment on really trying to maximise our linear advertising, which has seen declines in line with the overall market, and on trying to maximise our digital offering.  This is where we are seeing a progression of viewing going to digital.  As I said earlier, &euro;1 on linear television does not equate to the same on digital.  We must work with the industry and our advertisers on maximising the digital offering.  There is no doubt that digital advertising is taking money away from linear, but we have strong Irish content and strong programming, and Irish advertisers want to be seen in that light.  We need to do more of what we are doing.  We need to diversify more into digital areas, and we also need to come up with new revenue streams, which we had certainly planned for last year.  Of course, Covid stopped a lot of our plans.  We had a lot of plans to create events, to do more with the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra and to take some of our programmes on the road to have immersive experiences for the audiences, such as by taking "The Sunday Game" on the road.  We had plans to do a lot of that last year as another way of diversifying our revenue as an organisation.  A combination of all of those things will help us to get revenue to a more stable place.</p></speech>

While linear advertising may reduce, we would see increases in digital and other lines.  I spoke earlier about events and the whole area of diversification.  It is a given that we need to increase the overall pot.  It is an important part of our revenue but in the last couple of years we have seen that it has been reducing as the markets have reduced because the digital offering was not keeping up to pace with the way money was being spent.</p></speech>

It has been tasked with a very wide remit to come up with a funding model and to look at the viability of the future of Irish media.  It is a very important point in time for the media industry.  We all would argue that having a strong, independent Irish voice is vital but it is all in the mix and all there right now.  Whatever decisions come from that are going to have an impact.  That is what we are waiting to hear from.</p></speech>

I will return to the issue of contractors.  A lot of people will still be surprised to learn that some of the familiar faces they see on their television screens are not direct employees of RT&Eacute; and are, in fact, contractors.  Seven of the ten top earners in RT&Eacute;, according to its 2019 reports, were contractors.  Will Ms Forbes explain why somebody who essentially works full time for RT&Eacute; would have become a contractor in the first place and the historical basis for it?</p></speech>

It is important to say first of all that those seven contractors Deputy Carthy speaks about are brands in their own right and they also have the ability to earn money outside of RT&Eacute;.  They are contracted by RT&Eacute; to provide a particular service for a particular programme on a particular day.  They are not full-time employees of RT&Eacute;, and as a result, they are contractors as opposed to being employees.  That is how it was deemed.  Perhaps Ms Cusack might want to elaborate a bit more.</p></speech>

Is there a differential in that regard?</p></speech>

If a member of staff wants to publish a book, again provided that it is agreed with his or her manager, the person can do that, but it is probably the only area I am aware of where we have done that.  Ms Cusack might correct me.</p></speech>

I will try to allow people in for a second round of just one question each because we are tied for time.  Unfortunately, the two hours go too quickly.  I thank members for the questions they have asked so far and the witnesses for their replies.</p> <p>  I wish to ask Ms Forbes about the 433 contractors.  Some 157 were found to be in the medium to high category of having the attributes of employees.  Of those, 81 were offered employment, 78 accepted and three did not.  Thankfully, one of the witnesses clarified that those three are no longer with RT&Eacute;.  According to the information in the summary of the Eversheds Sutherland report, 106 were assessed as being more like employees.  What happened to the 25 and why were they not offered employee status?  Will the witnesses please keep the answers brief?</p></speech>

To make sure there was absolute transparency, as part of the process we put in place an appeals process both for those who were offered employment contracts and those who were not.  At the end of the day it was deemed that 82 would be offered contracts, which translated into 79 acceptances.</p></speech>

Ms Forbes said earlier that the money is spent is to attract talent.  How often does RT&Eacute; interview for those positions?  I am sure there are many people in local radio stations here or regional stations in Britain who might like to apply.  How often are they advertised and how are they assessed?  The money seems to be extraordinary in a State with 4.7 million or 4.8 million people.  How often are they advertised and what is the process?</p></speech>

What is looked at first is what is required for the schedule, whether it is television or radio.  Typically contracts last for different periods.  Each discussion is very individual.  Each discussion is based on what is happening at the time.  If during the period of a contract something changes, of course, that must be reflected.  That is the premise of this.  In terms of these roles and if somebody new is to be considered, again this is done on a very confidential basis because it is a small market and we tend to know who is in the market for these sorts of roles.  Again, every case is very different as we go through this.</p></speech>

It is incumbent on us, as the media, to optimise other opportunities.  As we were saying earlier, the fact that the big digital players are now looking at payment for content - we have a precedent in Australia - it is incumbent on us now to speak to them as well.  It is very underdeveloped at the moment and I think it will happen on a case-by-case basis with the individual platforms.

She may not be aware of this, but I would be surprised if she were not.  <i>The Connacht Tribune</i>recently reported that Irish-speaking workers at Raid&iacute;o na Gaeltachta felt that they were treated as the poor relation in comparison with their counterparts.  I am not sure if she managed to garner that information since we spoke earlier.  If she knows nothing about it or is totally unaware, which would be incredible, can she give us an undertaking that she will review the remuneration of Irish-language workers at Raid&iacute;o na Gaeltachta in comparison with their colleagues and furnish the committee with the findings of that review?</p></speech>

I said I would come back to the issue of the licence fee.  I know there was a talk of a renewal or a rejig of the fee.  A working group was set up in the previous D&aacute;il.  What status does that have at present?  Why is the cost for the collection of the licence fee so high in Ireland in comparison with our European counterparts?  I will not say the Department's full name because that would take up more time than I have.</p></speech>

It is looking at a range of issues, including the future funding model that will be used to fund public service media into the future.  Among the options it will consider will be a replacement of the licence fee.  It is important to have that in context when looking at the current evasion rate.</p> <p>  Regarding why it costs so much to collect the licence fee in Ireland, it is true that a system that is based on television licence inspectors going from house to house is quite an expensive model.  It is the right thing for us to look to the future to see if alternatives to the licence fee are available.  There is no doubt that An Post has made changes in recent years around working weekends, working evenings and so on, to try to improve the evasion rate.  Realistically, looking to the future, any model that is based on door-to-door inspections will never be the optimum or most efficient model available.</p></speech>

These provide orchestral music for the country.  As the Chairman may recall, back in 2018, we instigated a report on the future of the orchestras, given our ongoing financial situation.  At the time, the Government and the Opposition deemed it important and absolutely essential that the country have two orchestras.  It was then decided that the National Symphony Orchestra should be assigned to the National Concert Hall.  That transfer process has been going on for some time.  I am sure the Department will have some other points to make in this regard.  That figure relates to the cost of providing these two orchestras, one of which we expect to be transferred to the National Concert Hall at some point this year.

Some analysis has been conducted in recent years regarding positive and negative stories in different news outlets.  A fairly high percentage, 70% or more, of the coverage of certain political parties may be favourable.  I refer to positive stories about the political organisation covered.  The other 30% or so of coverage may be deemed negative.  The flip side of this is that 70% of coverage of other political organisations would be on what would be perceived as negative stories and that such stories would be focused on while very little coverage is given to positive stories.  Who monitors that?  Is that also just internal?</p></speech>

Before we begin, I remind members that in the context of the current Covid-19 restrictions, only the Chairman and staff are present in the committee room and all members must join remotely from elsewhere in the parliamentary precincts.  The secretariat issues invitations to join the meeting on MS Teams and members may not participate from outside the parliamentary precincts.  I ask members to mute their microphones when they are not making a contribution and to use the raise hand function to indicate.  Members should note that messages sent in the meeting chat are visible to all participants.  Speaking slots will be prioritised for members of the committee.</p> <p>  The topic for today's meeting is the regulation of veterinary medicines, including the EU regulation of veterinary medicinal products 2019/6, a topic we have put a lot of time and effort into over the past couple of months.  The meeting is in two sessions.  The first session, from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m., will be an engagement with representatives of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, while the second, from 7.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., will be an engagement with representatives of the Veterinary Council of Ireland.</p></speech>

Gabriel Beechinor, director of veterinary sciences, and Dr. David Murphy, manager, committee for medicinal products for veterinary use, CVMP.  Both are joining remotely and are welcome.  We have received their opening statement and briefing material, which has already been circulated to members.  As we are limited in our time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions, the committee has agreed that the opening statements will be taken as read so that we can use the full session for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and publicly available.</p> <p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants who are in locations outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I now invite questions from members.

I must apologise as I have to go to another meeting shortly and I will not be able to stay for the entire meeting.  In reflecting on the statements from the witnesses and where all of this debate is going, I have given this issue some consideration.  When I stand back from this, it strikes me that at the core of this debate, which we must never lose sight of, is human health, the human food chain, animal health and animal welfare.  That has to be paramount above anything else, and the link between those is critical.  On the one hand, we are familiar with routine warmers and doses, and the fact people can go into distributors and buy those.  It is similar to the analogy of going in to get a cough bottle in the supermarket.  That is the reality.  I can go and get a cough bottle, although I will not consume it, which is the only difference.  It is very important we do not lose sight of the importance of the human food chain, responsible animal husbandry and animal welfare.  That is the point I wanted to make.</p> <p>  While I will not be present for all of the meeting, and I again apologise for that, I have a question I want to ask of the witnesses on the FETAC level 6 training, of which many of us are aware.  What is their understanding of the FETAC level 6 professional qualification, which is applicable to responsible persons, RPs.?  I think it is at a very high level and of a very high standard.  I know people who have done this training and who can administer these antiparasitic drugs, and so on.  That is the issue.  I am conscious that we cannot be seen to be held up in terms of vested interests, be they veterinarians, distributors or otherwise.  It is important we give a range of options.  I do not believe veterinary prescriptions are needed for the administration of certain drugs but there are clearly serious implications for other types of ministrations or medications.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' view on that.</p> <p>  I thank those who have engaged in what really is a very difficult debate, to which there are different aspects.  As I said, it is important that human health and animal health and welfare are primary in any decision we take in regard to these matters.</p></speech>

I should point out that, as Senator Boyhan mentioned, our job as regulator is to ensure the safety and efficacy of the products and to ensure they comply with the legislation.  That is really the nub here.  When we look at the development of products, we could talk about antiparasitic drugs.  Perhaps the Senator remembers tiabendazole.  It came out in 1961 and resistance emerged in 1964.  Levamisole came out in 1970 and resistance emerged in 1979, ivermectin came out in 1981 and resistance emerged in 1988, and moxidectin came out in 1991 and resistance emerged in 1995.  Basically, we are dealing with precious commodities.  We do not have a pipeline of new drugs to effectively deal with resistance.  Therefore, I agree with the Senator that we must place animal health centre-stage in this debate.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about the professional qualifications at FETAC level 6.  That is not an area for the HPRA and we do not regulate licensed merchants.  However, we would acknowledge that licensed merchants have made, continue to make and, we expect, will continue to make a valuable contribution to the supply of anthelmintics into the future.</p></speech>

I have one question which is a kind of "Do you believe?" or "Do you not believe?" question regarding what is happening.  Do they believe that relegating the role of the RP, the farm vet and the veterinary nurse to the role of stockist, and excluding them from the European Platform for the Responsible Using of Medicines in Animals, EPRUMA, advice is demoralising and alienates those with substantial experience and the professional stakeholder groups?  Do they or do they not believe that?</p></speech>

I am aware of the interest of licensed merchants in this area and, as I said, of their contribution over many years.  For us, this is not around that.  The Department regulates how the system operates on the ground.  The issue for us is that the products have to comply.  We regulate the products and the products have to comply with the requirements.  That is the EU regulation and, because it is the EU regulation, we, as regulator, would be negligent if we did not do that.  We have had evidence of resistance building for a number of years.</p><p>If I appeared before the committee this evening, members may well ask: "What in God's name, were you doing?  Were you asleep at the wheel?  How much evidence do you need, for God's sake?"  The criteria are as plain as night and day.  Basically, our job as a regulator is to ensure that the products are regulated in accordance with the legislation, because otherwise, the future of our food products would be in jeopardy.</p></speech>

We do not have a role in regulating the licensed merchants.  We believe that all actors currently employed in the system ought to have a future in the system, but we do not regulate them and we are aware that the Department has created a multi-stakeholder group.  It has done that in the last year.  We expect that initiatives, and so on, will be rolled out to ensure that the licensed merchants have a future.  However, it is not our role to do this.</p></speech>

I am with the witnesses and I see where the HPRA is coming from in that its role in the whole system is really the product demarcation or whatever, in conjunction with the EMA.  The Department has to look at the issue at hand, which, from an anti-parasitic point of view, has boiled down to the question of whether medicines are prescription or non-prescription.  If medicines require a vet prescription, then where do the licensed merchants, etc., fit into the equation?  There has been an outcry from the farm organisations, the merchants and others in respect of where we are going with this.  The witnesses' deliberations this evening will help to inform those who will make the decision or formulate the policy, whereas it may not be their definitive role.</p> <p>  With that in mind, I ask Dr. Beechinor to elaborate a little bit more on the findings on the task force report.  I will cite some sections of the report and he can confirm whether what I say is true and elaborate on my points.  Would it be true to say that in the HPRA's assessment, 28 farms were assessed out of a total of 140,000 farms in Ireland, where some limited anti-parasitic resistance was found?  I ask Dr. Beechinor to elaborate on that.</p> <p>  It is also stated in the report that while there is anti-parasitic resistance on a European-wide basis, the only place that the actions taken have resulted in a reduction of resistance is in Scandinavia, where the action taken was a decoupling of prescribing and providing.  Perhaps Dr. Beechinor could comment on that.  In the other parts of Europe, where the policy adopted was veterinary prescription, the anti-parasitic resistance has actually remained on an upward curve.  I would like a comment on that also.</p> <p>  In conclusion, based on the task force report, it was recommended that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine consider elaborating the system for veterinary prescription of anti-parasitic medicines where support for evidence-based prescribing is available.  It was asserted that professionals who are able to offer an evidence-based assessment should be prescribers.  Would that not include suitably qualified persons in a licensed merchant situation?</p> <p>  I am aware that I am concentrating specifically on the anti-parasitic resistance element.  I acknowledge what Senator Boyhan has said.  I am aware of the one-health approach, but I am also aware of the fact that an anti-parasitic resistance is not going to affect human beings.  I do not want to sound flippant.  However, it is vitally important for good husbandry and animal care of the farmer and those who are responsible for animals.  I would appreciate it if Dr. Beechinor would elaborate more on the points I have raised, which are nearly all taken from the task force report.</p></speech>

Beechinor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042700002#B00500"><p>The HPRA monitors medicines.  We do that for human and veterinary medicines.  As the Senator is aware, in the context of Covid, we are monitoring adverse reactions to medicines, and so on.  We have been doing such work on the veterinary side for years.</p> <p>  There are spontaneous reports of a lack of effectiveness.  The odd report does not mean that much until it is scientifically investigated.  Our role as regulator is to ensure that we do not just have a little cluster of reports here and there on an annual basis, but that we are able to stand back and see the bigger picture.  The bigger picture for us is filled not just with what happens on the ground in Ireland, but throughout the EU and indeed the wider world.</p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question, there is research.  The research is not done by the HPRA.  It is done by organisations such as Teagasc or published in peer-reviewed journals, demonstrating that the research is scientifically valid.  Teagasc started producing reports from around 2006.  It first produced reports on sheep, including many thousands of them.  Therefore, I am not talking about a few sheep; it is thousands of sheep.  Data on cattle followed.  The first report containing data on cattle was produced by a Department of Agriculture inspector in 2014.  It was a confirmed case in which he effectively managed it, treated the animals, took faecal egg counts and so on, confirmed it and wrote it up.  In 2018, Teagasc came in on the back of that and did a study on 16 farms throughout Ireland.  It found that there is resistance in every farm.  Not only did it find that there is resistance in every farm, but multiple resistance.</p> <p>  That is the evidence from Ireland.  I acknowledge that some farmers may not even know that they have a problem.  Indeed, some farmers may not have a problem.  However, the majority of farmers do.  Resistance is ubiquitous; it is everywhere.  It is a natural process.  We have seen, in the context of Covid in places such as India, how resistant strains emerge.  It is genetic.  As soon as parasites multiply, they exchange genetics and throw up resistant genes.  That is what then leads to resistance on the farm.  As products are used, resistance emerges.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned Scandinavia.  Notwithstanding that products are prescription-only medicines, they still get resistance.  The Senator is absolutely right that making products prescription-only medicines is not the silver bullet that is going to cure things.  What it is, is a step in the right direction.  It is our job to ensure that the products comply with the legislation.  If we do not do that, the European Commission, which is aware of this report, will find out.  The European Commission audits our national residue plan every four, five or six years.  It is a risk-based approach.  If it comes knocking on our door to ask how we are implementing the requirements for the authorisation of medicines and the residue controls and so on, it will know that the products do not comply.  The regulation is crystal-clear - if resistance occurs, the products cannot be regulated other than by prescription.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about the specially qualified person, SQP.  The SQP term is a UK one.  As I understand it, in the UK the SQPs have been given rights to prescribe.  However, we do not have that system in Ireland.  That system is unique to the UK, as far as I know.  Everywhere else in Europe, and indeed in the UK, these products are prescription-only medicines.  Basically, we must bring Ireland into compliance because we are not, currently.</p></speech>

I thank the representatives of the HPRA for being here this evening.</p><p>Could our guests outline the interactions that have taken place between their organisation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in respect of the implementation of the directive?  Does the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, have a position on whether the current duties performed by those in the licensed merchants sector amount to prescribing?  That would be important for the committee to know.  </p><p> Could the HPRA give its position on how e-prescriptions work in practice whereby farmers and those in the licensed merchant sector only get prescriptions five days after a vet would have offered them on the farm?  Is it the case that by allowing that wait period of, potentially, up to five days before they can access medicines from a licensed merchant, then animal welfare could be at risk, that is, if farmers do not immediately source the product from a vet.  Is it equally the case that e-prescriptions are essentially worthless if animals have been dosed five days prior?</p></speech>

The regulation, as Deputy Carthy knows, is directly applicable but within that is the current SI 786 of 2007 which is the national legislation involved in transposing the current Directive 2001/82/EC dealing with veterinary medicines.  I apologise; I know this is highly technical.  The statutory instrument has to be revised in national legislation.</p> <p>  In doing that, the new regulation provides choices for member states as to how they want to enact certain features.  For example, we can decide if we want to have an electronic package leaflet with the product, a paper copy or both.  That is a matter for the Department to decide because that is its territory.</p> <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, regulates the products.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regulates downstream in terms of the licensed merchants, wholesalers, retailers, vets and so on.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland also has a role and will be coming in later this evening-----</p></speech>

That is for the Department.  We have no role in there.  Questions which refer to the validity of prescriptions and so on are probably more appropriate for the Veterinary Council of Ireland and the Department.  They are not for us.  Our job is around the safety and efficacy of the products and ensuring they comply with the legislation.  It is no more and no less.</p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. Murphy, is available to the committee as well.  He is chairman of the committee for veterinary medicinal products at the European Medicines Agency.  I think he may want say a few words.</p></speech>

I will answer Deputy Carthy's question around whether the activity the licensed merchants are engaged in amounts to prescribing.  As Dr. Beechinor indicated, based on the finding of the HPRA report, the conditions for continuing to authorise these products outside of prescription control is not an option open to us.  Given the conclusions of the HPRA report, it follows that these substances or products should come under prescription control.</p> <p>  The regulation sees that prescription control comes under the remit of a veterinarian or the veterinary profession.  That, again, is in the regulation.  In terms of what licensed merchants have been doing to date, they have been dispensing anti-parasitic substances, but up to this point the majority of those substances have not subject to prescription.  In that sense, I would suggest that they are not prescribing.</p> <p>  Under Irish legislation, prescribing is a function for veterinary practitioners, as I understand it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042700002#C00800"><p>I welcome Dr. Murphy and Dr. Beechinor to this evening's meeting.  May I ask about the packaging pertaining to the products?  I have noticed in recent weeks that there has been a major change in packaging among some suppliers.  I think they have moved ahead of the regulations and have begun doing packaging.  Has the packaging been agreed by the witnesses?  Is it a project they have been aware about, that the packaging has moved forward before the legislation?</p> <p>  Regarding food safety and the anti-parasitic drugs being used and the two-tier system we have on the island due to Northern Ireland regulations and southern Ireland regulations,  I ask the witnesses to comment on the fact we have major quantities of food or product moving from the North to South which have different regimes regarding anti-parasitic drugs.  How will that affect our food product going forward?</p> <p>  Large quantities of milk come South and large numbers of live animals go North.  I am not too concerned about the large numbers of live animals going North but rather about the large quantities of milk coming South.  They are under a different regime regarding how they deal with the parasitic issue even though we are on the same island.  How will that impact on food safety issues?  Will there be issues regarding licensing and the all-island  approach to food?  Will the witnesses comment on those issues?</p> <p>  What do the witnesses believe should happen regarding those regulations?  Are they applicable in terms of working in an all-island scenario regarding the food products?</p></speech>

We have engaged with them to ensure that the products comply by January 2022, which is when the new regulation becomes applicable.</p> <p>  In terms of labelling of packages, a company may produce a product for Ireland once or twice a year, so it needs to get it right.  It needs to sequence the change with other changes.  For example, we update the warnings on products.  We may decide it needs a new environmental warning, so in order to avoid companies having to destroy labelling and waste money, we try to sequence our time of changes to try to make it easier on the companies.  That is why we wanted to announce it well in advance.</p> <p>  There is a certain wash through time from products in the current cycle, that is, in the distribution chain.  Depending on the product, that might take six months or longer to wash through.  We are trying to work with companies through that process.</p> <p>  I accept Senator Lombard has probably, at this point in time, seen products on the market change because this change process has started and products have issued with the approval of the HPRA.  Companies cannot make this change without submitting a variation application the HPRA.  We have incentivised that, so they do not pay any money for it.  It is not of their making, so they should not be out of pocket for it.  We have incentivised that.  That change process is happening and that is to ensure everybody is aware of the next steps and to minimise the costs on the industry.</p> <p>  In terms of Northern Ireland and the different regimes, it is a valid question but it is really for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>It is my understanding that this may still be a live issue with the Department through the Northern Ireland protocol.  It is not my area.  I believe that it is the expertise of the Department, which would be best placed to comment on it.  From our discussions with the Department it has said that a suitably qualified person, SQP, in Northern Ireland can only prescribe in respect of herds in Northern Ireland.  They cannot do otherwise.  I do not know whether, in the fullness of time, this regime will continue.  Prompted by a European Commission audit they may say there is laxity in the system, for example.  None of us around this table wanted to see what we saw on a recent  "Prime Time" programme.  Again, I would expect the European Commission to be alive to that.  It is not our area, however, and I do not believe we should comment.</p></speech>

What is the Health Products Regulatory Authority's, HPRA, overall view on the use of the licensed merchants?  Could the HPRA foresee a way, whether it is through upskilling or attaining additional qualifications, that they could continue to keep hold of their corner of the market.  The HPRA opening statement says "Anthelmintic resistance in parasites ... has been demonstrated in European countries which have similar farming and animal husbandry conditions to those in Ireland".  Yet, a briefing document that we got from the Department says that it is not aware of any member state that permits anthelmintic veterinary medicines to be supplied for food producing animals in the absence of veterinary prescriptions issued by a veterinary practitioner.  Does this indicate that the responsible persons in the licensed merchants are not the root of the problem here?  Dr. Beechinor referred to the "Prime Time" programme.  Given the recent report that we saw on "Prime Time", which showed the ease with which people can improperly acquire the antimicrobial products North and South, does Dr. Beechinor believe that these new regulations may increase the level of demand for these products on the black market or through unscrupulous practices?</p></speech>

Beechinor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042700002#D00400"><p>I will take that question.  I qualified as a vet in 1982.  The reason I bring it up is that the principles we learned at the time were quite different from what is in place now.  Basically, back then our goal was a parasite-free animal or a parasite-free herd.  The idea was to blanket treat the cohort of animals with an effective product and nuke the parasites.  Unfortunately, the parasites have become resistant.  Nuking the parasites only give the fellas that are resistant an open field, so that is no longer the rule book.  The difficulty is that science evolves and we are now looking at a goal for sustainable parasite control based on diluting the effects of resistant parasites with bio-security, quarantine, new treatment protocols for purchased animals and building resilience into the animals, possibly through genetic programmes and building resilience into the animals by gradually exposing them to parasite challenge so it is not an overwhelming challenge.  This is what the science says.  As a veterinarian there are probably others who are more expert than I to speak about how to treat.  Those people, and maybe the Veterinary Council of Ireland or Teagasc, might want to add comment to that.  My point is that the science is changing.  I would agree with the Deputy that licensed merchants are not the root of the problem.  The root of the problem is parasite resistance.  We must preserve the efficacy of these products into the future.  As I said earlier, my colleague Dr. Murphy, who is involved in the EU committee, can speak from experience but we are not seeing new products coming around the corner every five or ten years.  The lack of new compounds is a problem, and not just with anti-parasitic products but also with antibiotics.  Perhaps Dr. Murphy will join in on that please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.273" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042700002#D00500"><p>On Dr. Beechinor's point, the anti-parasitic compounds are a precious commodity.  The last new broad spectrum anti-parasitic wormer product for cattle and sheep was authorised ten years ago.  That product contains the active substance derquantel.  In 2009 we had a product called Zolvix, containing monepantel.  They are the two substances that were most recently authorised.  There has been nothing new in the broad spectrum anti-parasitic anthelmintic field since then.  I emphasise that these compounds are a precious commodity.  If one considers the major worm species of cattle and sheep, essentially there are just five classes or wormers available to treat these.  These five can be used in sheep but only three of the classes can be used in cattle.  Within those classes of substances there are multiple different substances.  If there is resistance to one substance within a class then typically there will be resistance to all substances in that class.  We are talking about a very small pool of products, so we do need to take steps to preserve them.  It is clear that anti-parasitic resistance is an issue.  That is not just a conclusion of the HPRA report.  Within Ireland bodies such as Animal Health Ireland and Teagasc would also agree on this, as do the European Medicines Agency and other animal health bodies outside of Ireland.  Everybody agrees that anthelmintic resistance and anti-parasitic resistance generally is a serious issue and that it needs to be tackled.  The issue is not so much about providing access to these products.  In fact, as Dr. Beechinor has said, one of the principal goals or objectives in order to maintain the efficacy of these products into the future is to restrict access, in some respects, and to preserve them and only use them when they are required.  This is why the legislation is framed the way it is.  Basically, it requires that these substances are subject to prescription control.  It is important to make the point that this is a step in the right direction, as Dr. Beechinor has said.  It is a step, along with other steps, that needs to be taken to preserve the long-term efficacy of these products.  This is in everybody's interests and especially in the interests of the animals that we treat, from the point of view of animal health and animal welfare.  It is also in the interests of the farming community more generally in promoting animal productivity and farm sustainability.  It is an important issue but, as Dr. Beechinor has said, the move to prescription control is not in itself a silver bullet.  There are other measures that need to be taken.</p><p>On the question of the licensed merchants and where they fit into the equation, that is largely an issue for the Department to consider and I understand that it is engaged with licence purchasers and other stakeholders at this moment in time to ensure that in any new system there will be competition in the dispensing regime.</p></speech>

Some of my questions have been covered already.  The Department told us that it had engaged extensively with stakeholders over the past two years, with in excess of 12 meetings on the regulations with various regulatory bodies, including the HPRA and the Veterinary Council of Ireland, VCI.  I assume that covers the meetings referred to earlier in response to Deputy Carthy.  The Department specifically referenced bilateral meetings with its Northern Ireland and UK counterparts.  Have the witnesses had any discussions with their UK counterparts?  I appreciate that the witnesses are keen to delineate their role in this and to stress that their concern is solely to look after the product and not the sale or distribution of same but have they had any discussions with their UK counterparts?  Have they conducted any risk assessment of the likely outcome of the changes to how products are sold here?  The anti-parasitic resistance challenge has been a real eye-opener.  It is great to get an insight into that and to get that knowledge today.  It is fair to say that it demonstrates a real tug of war between nature and science.  I ask for the witnesses' personal view on what is at issue here.  Has there been a lack of investment by companies?  Do companies not see an opportunity for business here?  Why are new products not coming on stream as we would wish?  Dr. Beechinor mentioned a number of household names in his opening statement, well-known brands that suddenly lost their efficacy in a matter of five to nine years.  I am interested to hear if there is a lack of research and development, a lack of investment or if it purely comes down to capacity issues.</p></speech>

That deals with what could be described as common issues.  The HPRA plays a supportive role in those meetings to assist the Department in terms of issues that may affect the availability or monitoring of veterinary medicines.  We have had excellent relations with the UK over the years, particularly in the period when it was a member of the EU.  We used to meet our UK counterparts very regularly at different fora.  They were part of the European Medicines Agency committees, so we met them on a monthly basis there.  We also had regular meetings outside of that, at the heads of medicines agencies committee, which meets on average four times a year.  Obviously since Brexit the UK has dropped out of that network but to answer the Deputy's question, we have side-bar meetings in place with the UK, separately.  The HPRA and the regulatory authorities in the UK have put in place systems to make sure that we can deal with common areas.  About 50% of the veterinary medicines on the market today have a common label with the UK.  The Irish market is smaller than the UK market, relatively speaking, but what we would like to do is to keep those products with a common label because that will help with availability, to the benefit of everyone in Ireland.  The short answer to the question is yes, we have regular meetings.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Dr. Murphy, to speak about the issue of investment.  There are incentives in the new legislation which might be of interest to the committee.</p></speech>

Coming up with a new molecule that has an anti-parasitic effect and is safe for administration in animals adds a further challenge.  One must also consider consumer and environmental safety issues.  I am pretty sure that companies are screening molecules all of the time in terms of their potential for development but the number of molecules that make it through are very few and far between.  We have evidence of that, given that the newest molecule to the market in Ireland was introduced approximately ten years ago.  As was pointed out at the start of this meeting, what is paramount in terms of the use of veterinary medicinal products is that while efficacious, they are also safe.  Again, that is safe for the target animal, the person using the products, the consumer who is consuming food produce and the environment.  In Europe in particular, as well as in other parts of the world, the requirement threshold for new substances is very substantial so the investment required to meet that threshold will be very significant.  I repeat the point that coming up with a molecule that is both effective and safe is a challenge and is one of the issues limiting the pipeline.</p></speech>

What Dr. Beechinor laid out in his opening remarks is quite alarming.  It is good that we are receiving this information from the HPRA now because it will help us in our deliberations.  I invite the witnesses to give their opinion on the effect of stocking rates and agricultural intensification on parasitic resistance.  Is it a factor?  Is it something that we should be addressing or that the HPRA, in its dealings with the Department, has raised as a relevant issue?</p></speech>

These include parasitic factors and management factors like too-frequent dosing or under-dosing, cloud factors, sub-therapeutic drug levels after initial dosing and so on.  Our understanding of some of these issues has increased over the years.  We believe that this is the time to deal with it and we welcome the fact that the Department has set up this coalition of interested parties because ultimately we all have to work together.  We are all pretty much on the same side here in understanding that we must respond to the scientific evidence that has emerged.  None of us has a monopoly on wisdom.  Farming is changing, climate change is happening and so the way in which the parasite expresses itself is changing.  Is it the parasite?  Is it the change in management?</p><p>Is it the fact herd sizes have increased?  All of these put pressure on the resources we have.  In some cases maybe we do not need a chemotherapy agent at all.  Maybe the investment in the next generation of chemotherapy agents will be in the vaccines area.  We currently have a vaccine for hoose and, to respond to an earlier question on incentivisation, there is research ongoing and the new regulation puts in data protection provisions to incentivise the development of new molecules.  There is not one single factor in this but rather a multitude of factors.  This is the best chance we have to get it right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.281" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1592" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042700002#F00200"><p>My first question relates to a multi-stakeholder approach.  I notice the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, report makes it clear that tackling antiparasitic resistance needs a multi-stakeholder approach.  Currently, 75% of antiparasitic medicines are dispensed with advice from the responsible persons and vet pharmacists but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine refuses to include these professionals in providing advice and prescribing.  Does the HPRA support this strategy?  If responsible persons have not caused the resistance, why not include them in prescribing?</p> <p>  There are 1,600 responsible persons and 300 vet pharmacists, all of whom are keen to address antiparasitic resistance recommendations in the report.  This presents an irresistible opportunity to unite all prescribers with common training and uniform knowledge transfer to farmers.  However, what incentive is there to commit to the training expense and time if they cannot prescribe or advise on antiparasitic resistance?</p> <p>  All antiparasitic medicine prescribers will have to apply best practice, which includes a regulatory body, a code of practice, qualification in chosen species, training in antiparasitic resistance, sole prescribing supervision over the counter, an annually updated register and a prescribing protocol involving compulsory antiparasitic resistance questioning and disciplinary powers.  Does the HPRA support these requirements?</p></speech>

Page 38 of the report deals with this topic.  Basically, neither licensed merchants nor prescription control on its own can prevent resistance.  These are a step in the direction of ensuring the products we use comply with legislation.  If we do not do this properly, there is a cost to everybody.  Most farmers recognise this and realise it does them no favours to use products they do not need to.  By turning this around, we can preserve the efficacy of the products and it will end up putting money in farmers' pockets because they will not have to spend money unnecessarily.  In some cases we do not even need to rely on medicines and we can work through quarantine and other tools.</p> <p>  The literature indicates that anybody intending to deliver an antiparasitic should look at which species of parasite are the most important to consider for the age and type of animal, what stages of the parasite are likely to be present, which drugs provide the proper spectrum of activity, what host dynamic properties exist and how they will play out, which animals require treatment, and whether drugs that are intended for use are still effective against the parasite species.  What will be needed in future is evidence-based prescribing, with knowledge of the farm, the system and the parasites.</p> <p>  As I mentioned earlier, we should also include factors such as whether we are having a dry summer or weather conditions that have changed such that another parasite could be responsible for the scour, slow growth or whatever.  It is about using a range of diagnostics, supported by farmer and farm knowledge.</p> <p>  With regard to access to medicine, we have no issue with licensed merchants and we do not regulate them.  We agree that knowledge of this matter is still in its infancy.  There are many people, including me as a veterinarian, who know the science has moved on.  Upgrading our skills is as much a challenge for veterinarians as it is for licensed merchants.  Perhaps the witnesses from the Veterinary Council of Ireland will be able to assist the committee on the questions around best practice because it is an area downstream of the HPRA.</p></speech>

They arise from the submission to the committee.</p> <p>  I will follow up a very interesting deliberation we had in the past hour with the HPRA.</p><p>Something came through very loud and clear on the issue of antiparasitic resistance.  I am conscious that the VCI submission is very much based on the antibiotics side.  On the antiparasitic side, based on what I have been listening to for the last hour, I wonder whether the product is the problem here, irrespective of whether it is prescribed and administered by a vet, or prescribed and sold by a responsible person or suitably qualified person and administered by the farmer himself?  We are engaged in a box-ticking exercise with regard to the EU regulation.  We are not going to solve the problem, if there is a problem with antiparasitic resistance, with the products we have available.  As I said, it will make absolutely no difference who is or is not prescribing it or administering it if there is not a broader range of product.  Based on their submission to us and what we have heard in the last hour, will the VCI representatives comment on that?  What do they say about the HPRA task force report, which found, on a Europe-wide basis, that the only area and the only action which had a positive effect in reducing antiparasitic resistance was in Scandinavia, where the action taken was the decoupling of prescribing and dispensing?  In other words, the vets prescribed and another agency dispensed.  I would like a comment on that because in the other areas that introduced the policy of vet prescription that is proposed here, it did not have the desired effect.  In fact, an increase in antiparasitic resistance was recorded.</p><p> I was on the previous agriculture committee when the council came before us.  We had a lot of debate and deliberation on the veterinary practice ownership issue.  The council stood firm on allowing multinationals to buy up and amalgamate small practices.  We are where we are on that but with that in mind, if this regulation goes through as currently proposed and we do not take the derogation, are there enough vets in the country to prescribe what is required?  Do we have enough vets, veterinary practices and services in rural areas to be able to meet the needs of the farming community, assuming we do not take the derogation?</p><p> I wish to give the witnesses, as professionals and as vets, a brief example.  It says in the regulation that a veterinary prescription is valid for five days only and also that a veterinary prescription is "limited to the amount required for the treatment concerned".  I am using the example of a farmer who thinks he has an issue and calls out the vet.  Dung sampling and observation is done.  It is a rather large herd and parasites are identified in it, but not in the entire herd.  In the VCI representatives' opinion, what does the vet do then, under the new system?  Does he give the farmer a prescription to dose all the cattle or does he start doing a full test, so that what he prescribes is limited to the amount required for the treatments concerned?  I would like council representatives' professional opinions on that.</p></speech>

My name is Niamh Muldoon and I am registrar of the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  I am joined this evening by Mr. Joe Moffitt, who is the president of the council, and Dr. Ailis N&iacute; Riain, who is the deputy president.  I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it today.  We hope to be of assistance to it in its deliberations on the matters at hand.</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked whether antiparasitic resistance will remain regardless of who prescribes the product.  Ultimately, the HPRA task force report of December 2019 dealt with much of that issue.  The VCI is the independent statutory body charged with regulating the veterinary professions.  Therefore, we are not best placed to comment on issues related to the products.  Our role in assisting and offering definitions to some of these veterinary medicine regulations is to ensure that when a prescription is given by a veterinary practitioner, it is given based on a strong threshold of knowledge and given for the appropriate use of any individual product.</p> <p>  The council adopts no policy on the decoupling of veterinary medicines.  Ultimately, it is a policy matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We are the regulatory body so market forces are not a matter on which we can comment.  Our role concerns the public interest, the best interests of animal health and welfare and public health.</p> <p>  The Senator raised ownership and referenced our previous appearances before the committee.  He queried whether there are enough vets in the country to offer the services required in relation to both antimicrobial products and antiparasitic products.  We have 3,015 registrants on our register of veterinary practitioners.  We believe there are enough vets in the country to service all the nation's requirements.  Vets are woven into the fabric of every community across the country.  We do not foresee any of these regulations being a difficulty or posing any threat to services or the treatment and care available for animals.</p> <p>  The Senator's final point related to the five-day validity period for a prescription referenced in the veterinary medicine regulations.  That five-day validity period relates only to prescriptions of antimicrobial products and as such would not be relevant for antiparasitic products.  I think the concern related to dosing with antiparasitics.  That five-day limit, as specified under the veterinary medicine regulations which we know will be imposed on all European countries, relates only to antimicrobial products such as antibiotics and not to antiparasitics.</p></speech>

Animal welfare will suffer following this.  The Department knows that costs to farmers will also increase.  Vets already charge for prescriptions if they do not supply the veterinary medicines.  My worry is that in some instances in rural Ireland, animals that are of low value will not be given the treatment.  It is obvious, unfortunately, what is going to happen here.  Essential antiparasitic treatments will be avoided and parasitic diseases will be left to run their course, causing untold levels of animal suffering.  That is the view of many people out there, sadly.  It is going to happen and I would like the council representatives' views on those matters.</p></speech>

The intention of this regulation is to improve both animal health and welfare and human health and offer some protections in that regard.  It offers an opportunity for Ireland and other European countries to advance the standards in practice in relation to medicines.  It also affords an opportunity for a Europe-wide standard to be adopted.  Ultimately, that is going to benefit animal health and welfare, and indeed public health.</p> <p>  On the concerns about low-value animals, farmers across the country are the first guardians of the welfare of animals.  I believe we are very fortunate in this country in terms of the level of experience and expertise we have among our farmers and indeed our veterinary practitioners.  I do not believe these regulations should pose a difficulty in animal welfare terms or otherwise.  Mr. Moffitt, who, in addition to being the president of the council is also a veterinary practitioner, may have some comments to add.</p></speech>

On the suggestion that the product is the problem and that it really does not matter who prescribes or dispenses it because it is essentially a box-ticking exercise, the whole area of antiparasitic resistance is a dynamic between the animal, the parasite and the environment.  We are in a situation where our products are losing their usefulness and efficacy.</p><p>What the veterinary medicine regulations envisage is proper management of the products where they are applied, using the least amount of product to get the best and most targeted amount of response such that the usefulness of these products can be prolonged.  As regards the decoupling, we are the regulatory authority and we regulate the veterinary profession so that prescribing is done with due diligence and whatever dispensing is also done with due diligence.</p><p> With regard to multinationals buying small practices, every year there is an increasing number of veterinary surgeons on the register and a significant proportion of those coming onto our register are interested in pursuing a career in farm animal and rural practice.  We do not at present envisage any deficiency.</p><p> With regard to Senator Daly's point on prescriptions being valid for five days and the animal welfare concerns of Deputy Collins, these regulations foresee a common-sense attitude and a reasonable response, and a relationship between farmers and vets such that products are prescribed or dispensed on the basis of clinical examination or proper assessment, which we have helped the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to define, such that animals are properly cared for by their owners supported by the veterinarians.  We hope to ensure this continues.  These regulations may give a somewhat more structured approach in this regard.  Animals will continue to be cared for properly, possibly with better disease control and outcomes for the animals and less expense for their owners in the longer term.</p></speech>

The only addition I will make is it is a matter of focus for the Veterinary Council that all of our registrants practise and prescribe ethically.  On the rare occasions this does not occur, there are other remedies or sanctions available to us.</p></speech>

It is dead right to say animal welfare is of huge importance to farmers but, sadly, they will be massively out of pocket.  They cannot afford the new rules and regulations that are coming in and, unfortunately, something has to give.  Either the farmers will pack up or the animals will be left to suffer.  I am not making up the story.  I know what will happen because farmers are struggling desperately as it is at present.  They do not see any light at the end of the tunnel.  I cannot see how it will be less expensive.  I can see how it will be extremely costly to get prescriptions from vets.  Perhaps the witnesses can explain to me how it will be less expensive.</p></speech>

These changes are recommended and required by Europe on the basis of improving animal health and welfare and public health.  It is very plausible there will be an increased or additional cost at the outset.  I am aware some speakers who appeared before the committee referenced the potential opportunities and savings in the long run through minimising the use of medicines, potentially better outcomes for animals, minimising disease and offering a greater return in terms of the productivity of the animal.  We cannot shy away from the fact there is the potential for some additional costs to be associated with these regulations.  The role of the Veterinary Council is veterinary regulation and it is probably a matter more appropriate for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which may deem fit to invest in public health in matters such as this.  This is a matter on which the Veterinary Council cannot comment.</p></speech>

Given we are seeing new regulations coming in that will have an impact on licensed merchant businesses with qualified persons throughout rural Ireland, are the witnesses saying it is their belief licensed merchants and their qualified persons have been issuing too much of these medicines?  We have also heard the concerns of some farmers that vets will possibly corner the market on issuing prescriptions for the products in question.  Now we hear about a new web-based national veterinary prescribing system.  If this is the future, why were promises made some time ago that a framework would be implemented that would give farmers greater choice in sourcing their veterinary medicinal products from a vet or a licensed merchant?  It never actually happened.  Why has the Veterinary Council of Ireland not acted to ensure farmers and licensed merchants have prompt access to prescriptions as opposed to relying on e-prescriptions, which we all know can take up to five days to arrive?  Granted vets have no Internet out in the fields but a delay of five days does not seem a reasonable turnaround time.  It is not in the interests of farmers, animal welfare and the sector generally and indicates an issue with competitiveness more than anything else.</p></speech>

Regarding reference to the impact on rural businesses, the Veterinary Council, in considering some of the definitions of the terms contained in the veterinary medicines regulations, has engaged very broadly with many stakeholders to the antiparasitic stakeholder group.  We have met licensed merchants and their representatives.  We have met the co-operatives, farming bodies, veterinary representatives, Teagasc, Animal Health Ireland and agricultural consultants.  We are very much aware there are differing approaches to these regulations from various stakeholders.  We accept there may be some impact on business, but ultimately these regulations require veterinary prescriptions for certain products.</p> <p>  The route of supply of all of these medicines will remain unchanged.  While, for example, antiparasitic medicines will now require a veterinary prescription, the same option in terms of choice of supplier will remain to any individual farmer or animal owner.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is looking at the introduction of an electronic prescribing system in an effort to ease access to the range of suppliers for these medicines so that if and when farmers or individual animal owners obtain a prescription, they have freedom of choice regarding where they will source or obtain the medicine product.</p> <p>  The Deputy queried whether the Veterinary Council can comment on whether qualified persons have been supplying excessive quantities of medicines.  We can make no comment in this regard.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority produced a task force report in December 2019 which recommended that some of these products have veterinary prescription requirements.  As the regulator and independent statutory body regulating vets, veterinary nurses and veterinary premises, we cannot make a comment on matters in the past.  Our role, in the public interest, is to offer some of these definitions in supporting the introduction and implementation of these regulations.</p></speech>

This cuts down the farmer's options, and he must then go to a vet.</p><p>He may have been using the merchant all his life, but now, with the new system and a five-day delay, it does not give him an option because he needs the medicine for his animals as soon as possible and not wait five days for it to come through on the e-prescriptions system.</p></speech>

Does the Deputy's reference to five days relate to the validity period of a prescription for an antimicrobial product?  For example, if a vet issues a prescription for an antimicrobial or antibiotic product, that prescription will only be valid for five days so can only be filled for a period of five days.  As I understand it, however, the intention in the development of this electronic prescribing system is that the prescription would be available immediately, so there should be no such delay.  Ultimately, however, that electronic prescribing system sits under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, so it would be better informed in that regard.</p></speech>

I will be very brief.  Regarding the practice of practitioners giving out prescriptions where complaints are made, does the Veterinary Council of Ireland investigate those complaints?  If it does, have any of these people been prosecuted or lost their veterinary licences over recent years?</p> <p>  Is it really necessary to have just veterinary people making these prescriptions?  As the witnesses know and as Ms Muldoon herself said, to be fair to her, there will be a cost factor for farmers and it will be very hard on them.  As other speakers have said, they are already in difficulty with regard to profit, and this will put a further regulation on them.  I believe farmers are over-regulated.  No matter what is prescribed, doctors and veterinary surgeons and people such as the witnesses will always say there is an overprescribing of these products.</p> <p>  Like other people, what I am worried about is competition.  I know that is not the Veterinary Council of Ireland's problem.  Its problem is to make sure these people are prescribing what they are prescribing as they should be prescribing it.  People have said this one is prescribing too much and that one is prescribing too much.  I have not seen many prosecutions over the years.  The witnesses might fill me in on that, please.</p></speech>

The Veterinary Council has a number of regulatory tools open to it in respect of disciplinary action.  We issue a code of professional conduct to all our registrants.  It is binding on every registrant, so every individual, veterinary nurse or vet, is bound by the terms of that code of conduct.  Equally, we have a role in education, supervising different programmes of continuing veterinary education and making sure all vets and vet nurses on our register maintain their competence throughout the journey of their careers.  There are also the disciplinary aspects.</p> <p>  Deputy Ring referred specifically to complaints.  Yes, the Veterinary Council will deal with somewhere between 30 and 40, and sometimes up to 50, complaints a year about various matters.  There are very extreme sanctions available to the council if and when there is a finding of professional misconduct of any individual whereby he or she has been found to fall below the expected standards.  As for specific examples, I can tell the Deputy that last year, in 2020, four vets were suspended from practice, that is, not allowed to practise for a period ranging from two months to six months.  We had three vets suspended for six months and one vet suspended from practice, suspended from our register, for a period of two months.  That is the most extreme of sanctions if you consider that, in effect, an individual's livelihood is being taken away.  The High Court supervises and endorses the sanctions imposed by the Veterinary Council.  Suffice it to say, the council will always act in the public interest in making sure the highest standards are imposed on and expected of all our registrants.  It is, in part, one of the elements of ensuring we have such high standards of practice throughout the country.</p></speech>

In practice, out there on farms, especially, say, from the last week of January to now, there is lambing going on, an awful lot of calving going on and cows with mastitis.  On a dairy farm, at seven or eight o'clock in the evening, the farmer will be milking his cows under an awful lot of pressure for labour.  How will the service be provided such that when an animal wants an antibiotic, it will get it within a very short time?  I would like the witnesses to elaborate a little more on that.  No matter how well managed a farm is, there will, unfortunately, be problems at various stages.  A cow can get mastitis for any variety of reasons.  It is perfectly understandable and obvious that in the case of a difficult calving, the vet has to be called, but then there are treatments that are fairly routine for farmers but which have to be done in the interest of the animal's health.  If not done quickly, the animal's health will deteriorate very quickly.  I see the vets around my part of the country for those three or four months of the spring.  They are under maximum pressure.  The only ones who look as tired as the farmer after the spring are the vets.</p> <p>  How will it work in practice that the call will be able to be taken and the proper treatment will be available quickly for the animal, first, from an animal welfare point of view and, second, from an economic point of view and to avoid unnecessary losses?  Will the witnesses again go through how they think this will work in practice?  I think it will bring significant extra cost to the administration of drugs but I would like to see how it could work physically.</p></speech>

We at the Veterinary Council regulate for a 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week service, so it is a particularly onerous expectation on all our vets, but the truth is that that requirement is there.  The Chairman referred to the need to call vets out at different hours of the day and to different times of the year being particularly busy periods.</p> <p>  As for some of the terms contained in the veterinary medicine regulations, there are some terms the Veterinary Council intends to include in our code of professional conduct.  Some of those terms refer to either a clinical examination, which may be required in some circumstances, or, in the alternative, a proper assessment of the health status of an animal.  Ultimately, the guidance and the code the Veterinary Council issues will require a threshold of knowledge to be held by any veterinary practitioner before he or she discharges the privilege of prescribing.  Once that threshold of knowledge is met, that threshold being a true and accurate knowledge of the farm, the animal, the herd, the husbandry, the conditions and the history, there is a very strong knowledge base on which to rely before issuing any diagnosis or prescription.  A vet is not required to go out on every single occasion to the animal or to the yard.  What the Veterinary Council, in terms of the definitions, is saying is that once a threshold of knowledge has been reached, there is a safe basis on which to provide a diagnosis and-or prescription.</p> <p>  The veterinary medicine regulations refer to risk in the recitals.  We talk about the avoidance or minimising of the use of antimicrobial medicines in particular but also all medicines.  The rule of the Veterinary Council is to offer some guidance in our code to ensure sufficient knowledge of the circumstance and input to seek to offer strong disease control.  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Moffitt, who may be able to make some further comments.</p></speech>

From what I hear her saying, the farmer would have to be able to converse with his vet to get the product he needs.  Let us take a Sunday evening or Sunday night, at eight or nine o'clock.  In the vast majority of practice, vets operate on a rota and only one will be on call.  A lot of the time he will be out physically doing a call.  In practice, I hear what Ms Muldoon is saying clearly to me, that it is from his knowledge he will have to prescribe.  From what she is saying, however, the farmer will have to have a direct conversation with the vet to get the drug prescribed.</p><p>Coming from a farm, I see that will be very difficult and problematic during a busy spring period.  I can imagine a lot of tempers getting very frayed while farmers try to make sure they are able to get what they need as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It is something that goes on now anyway where the farmers and the vets have an ongoing relationship, and when difficulties crop up, they are able to manage to sort them out between them.</p> <p>  On the licensed merchants and the pharmacists, we hope their expertise would be retained at the dispensing end.  No real change to the supply routes is envisaged in the regulations and we would expect the knowledge which they have built up and the relationship they have built with farmers over the years will be retained and would feed into the whole knowledge base.</p> <p>  Deputy Ring said regulations bring cost.  That is a reasonable assumption in this situation where there is an increased expectation on prescribing that there be increased cost at the beginning.  We feel there is a large public interest section in this on antimicrobial resistance.  The antiparasitic resistance goes to the heart of the sustainability of agriculture in the country.  Most players in this situation would hope there would be some mitigation towards the costs at the beginning but that the requirement for them would reduce as time goes on and further savings were achieved through less use of drugs, better disease control and less ultimate expense on the farmers.</p> <p>  If there are any other unanswered questions, I ask members please to come back to us because we are trying our best to answer them all as we go along.</p></speech>

There is serious unease about how it will work in practice on farms.  As Deputy Ring said, there is a financial worry but we also have a welfare worry about how more regulation will benefit.  We are very concerned about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042700002#K00400"><p>I want to follow on from the point the Chair made.  It is well known that I am a suckler farmer and the Chair is a dairy farmer.  The Chair highlighted the business of a dairy farm in the months of February, March and even into April.  That is the very time the suckler farmer will be considering putting out his or her cattle and will want them treated for parasites before putting them out.  It will double up the workload at that particular time.  Based on what was said here, when vets are under pressure, we have been led to believe here that a consultation over the phone will suffice for the provision of a prescription.  I fail to see why a consultation with the responsible person is not identical.  If it is basically the farmer making the observation, giving his or her observed diagnosis over the phone to a veterinary surgeon, then I do not see the difference in the farmer doing the same to a person behind the counter at the merchants, who is a responsible person and is recognised as a responsible person by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and is suitably qualified as per the definition and restrictions of the Department.  What Mr. Moffitt has just said is basically that when under pressure, when time constraints are of the essence, his people will give a prescription for product over the phone to a farmer based on the farmer's own observation and diagnosis.  Will the witnesses please tell me then what is the difference in a responsible, suitably qualified person doing the same when it is in essence the farmer who will be making the diagnosis?</p></speech>

We know the veterinary medicine regulations offer much stricter controls in relation to antimicrobial products.  The validity of the prescription will be for five days only, individual animal data are required, and there is a greater threshold for prescription of those antimicrobial products.  Separately, we have the antiparasitic medicines.  The HPRA task force report recommended that those products would require a veterinary prescription.  That is a very significant change in the practice and approach we had previously seen coming into force next January.  How do we approach that?  It might be that there is potential for a herd health parasite control programme to be put in place.  Maybe a vet would offer some analysis on the husbandry, conditions, grazing, pasture management and all the factors that would feed in to a control programme relating to parasite contro,l after which a prescription could be offered for treatments as appropriate in the circumstances in the opinion of the veterinary practitioner, the only person who can offer a diagnosis and the only person who can offer a veterinary prescription.</p> <p>  It is not that we are saying a phone call to the vet is going to fix every ailment.  Equally, it is not that the Veterinary Council will make any comment on the role of the licensed merchants or suitably qualified or authorised persons.  Our role, as regulator, is to regulate the practice of veterinary medicine.  It is in that context we will ultimately issue the code of professional conduct.  What is being proposed is a very different practice from that which the country has enjoyed to date.  We know the recommendations are coming in the best interests of maintaining efficacy of products, as the committee heard earlier from the HPRA, and the basis for its recommendation that the antiparasitic medicines would require a veterinary prescription.  Equally, the veterinary medicine regulations require a much more stringent approach Europe-wide in the use of antimicrobial products, all of which is done in the best interests of animal health and welfare and, indeed, public health.</p></speech>

I remind them that apart from me and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and all members are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex only.</p> <p>  Today we will give consideration to the draft Protection of Young Persons (Employment) (Exclusion of Workers in the Fishing and Shipping Sectors) Regulations 2021.  These draft regulations are required to complement the full transposition of EU Directive 2017/159 on the implementation of the social partners agreement on the Work in Fishing Convention.  The directive is primarily a matter for the Department of Transport.  However, certain requirements of the directive require sectoral amendments to the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 to ensure full implementation of said directive.  The draft regulations have been referred to the committee for consideration, after which the committee is required to report back to the D&aacute;il and to the Seanad.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, to assist the committee in consideration in this matter today.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and to the practice of the Houses as regards reference the Minister of State may make to other persons in his evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  Today's witness, however, is giving his evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.</p><p>Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> The opening statement has already been circulated to all the members.  We will commence our consideration of this matter now.  I invite the Minister of State, Deputy English, to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

The draft regulations are before the committee by virtue of the procedural requirements of section 28 of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996.  This provides that a draft of every regulation proposed to be made under the Act shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that the proposed regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.</p> <p>  The draft regulations amend the Protection of Young Persons in Employment Act 1996, providing for additional protections for young people engaged in the fishing sector.  The Act must be amended by these regulations to complement the full transposition of EU Directive 2017/159 on the implementation of the social partners' agreement on the Work in Fishing Convention.  This directive is primarily a matter for the Department of Transport but certain requirements of the directive require sectoral amendments to the Protection of Young Persons in Employment Act 1996, which falls under my Department.  These will ensure that the directive is fully implemented in Irish law.  It is important to emphasise that the protections offered by the directive are already applicable to all young persons in employment under EU law but that Ireland is required to fully transpose the directive to ensure its protections are carried over into our national law.</p> <p>  These short draft regulations are solely concerned with enhancing protections for young persons who are employed in the fishing sector, including by restricting night-time work, working hours and holiday work.  They are not connected to general working conditions on fishing vessels and do not have an impact beyond young persons aged between 16 and 17.</p> <p>  The draft regulations will need to be read in conjunction with SI 179 of 2020, entitled European Union (International Labour Organisation Work in Fishing Convention) (Minimum Age) Regulations 2020.  This statutory instruction, which was introduced by the Minister for Transport, sets out the enhanced protections introduced by the EU directive that apply to young persons aged between 16 and 17 who are employed in the fishing industry.  These are now included in the draft regulations for consideration by the committee today.</p> <p>  These regulations provide that a young person may be in engaged in night-time work in the fishing industry only if it is required for essential training purposes and provides for appropriate rest periods.  The regulations also mean that a person aged 15 may only do light work on board a fishing vessel during school holidays provided that the hours of work do not exceed seven in any day or 35 in any week.</p></speech>

I just have two very quick questions.  I have high hopes that it is very unusual for people of 16 and 17 years to be requested to work overnight or engage in heavy-duty work.  It is probably unfortunate that we are in the space where that requires regulation.  If my understanding is correct, this is about the transposition of a directive so there is no, or very little, wriggle room for the Minister of State.  Has there been consultation with the National Inshore Fisherman's Association?  If not, can there be?  The association would have a particular view.  How many young people are we talking about?  I am deeply uncomfortable about regulating a work environment for people aged 16.  To be honest, I worked at 16 but it was not what would be considered hard work.  The work we are talking about could be very hard.  It shocks me a little.  How many people are we talking about?  Although they probably should not be doing any work at all, how will the light work they are only supposed to be doing be regulated and policed?  How will potential breaches be dealt with?  I suspect some of the workers may not have English as their first language but I do not know.  Is there a system in place to provide information for them in appropriate languages?</p></speech>

I agree with her in that we hope it is not overly common that young people are working in this sector.  I do not have the number but I will try to get the Deputy some figures.  We believe there are very few involved but it is important that the legislation be in place and very clear.  We can communicate that.  The directive is from the EU, so I guess we have to transpose it into international law as it stands.  We consulted all the various players, including those mentioned by the Deputy, as part of the process.  I believe it started in January 2020 under a previous Minister in my position.  We went through the procedure to invite submissions and engage in consultation.  There is a procedure set down to introduce these regulations, and we will follow that completely.</p> <p>  As with all our legislation in this space, this measure is communicated in the various languages to make sure it reaches the sectors it needs to reach.  Three Departments are involved, namely, the Department of Justice, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, along with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, the main agency for us in this space.</p> <p>  We will monitor what the Deputy has described but I do not believe it is very common.  It is important, however, that we be very clear on it.  I believe the Deputy would agree with that.</p></speech>

We have heard of horrific cases.  It would be worrying if some of the cases we hear about involved young persons in the way described so every effort needs to be made to ensure the information on the regulation is accessible and that there is a very clear definition of what constitutes light work.  If the young people in question are to be engaged in any work at all, it needs to be tightly defined and heavily regulated.  I honestly do not know how that can be done.  I do not know a great deal about fishing but, since I live in a coastal community, I know some fishers.  I do not know how regulation can be achieved when a ship is out at sea.  I do not know whether there are mechanisms.  The Minister of State referred to the WRC.  Do those engaged in policing have the right to board a ship?  How would it work in ensuring the regulations are adhered to?</p></speech>

We reckon that more than 98% of the ships and boats involved in the sector are checked regularly through our various agencies.</p> <p>  The definition of light work is in the regulation but we will make every effort to make sure it is communicated clearly in the various languages concerned.  We always try to do that anyway.  The lead Minister in this area is the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, but my Department has representatives on the group to which I referred.  Several agencies follow up and investigate and their officials absolutely can board ships and deal with the matter, as in any other working environment.</p></speech>

Deputy Louise O'Reilly asked about the number of people employed in the age category in question and the Minister of State said he will revert to us on that.  It might be an interesting figure.</p> <p>  With regard to the young people employed, the regulations are about the protection of young people.  Are we correct in saying the majority of them are Irish nationals?  Could the Minister of State indicate whether there are any contracts of employment for those in the age category?  The work is more or less part-time, involving short hours and summer work when school is not in session.</p><p>I take it that it does not involve people who are involved in the atypical scheme, which is another area.  There were some reports in 2015 of abuses of the scheme and I know quite a lot of fishermen who were very annoyed because they were all painted with the same brush.  Many fishermen I know are very careful and look after their employees very well.  They are very anxious to ensure everything is done correctly.  Will the Minister of State give us a profile of these young people?  He does not know how many are involved at this stage but he might tell us later.</p></speech>

I agree the majority that we are aware of are Irish.  Again, I do not have the numbers in the sector but I can discuss it with the lead Minister.  It generally reflects family situations and people working for families but it is still important that we have a very clear directive.  People might want to bring forward cases to us and this will strengthen the national law to deal with them.  I will raise it with the Minister to see whether there is data on the numbers.  We do not think they are large.  It is generally family situations.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanton mentioned the atypical scheme and a number of Departments are involved in it.  As the Deputy did, I picked up the frustration among some in the sector who run a very tight ship and follow the letter of the law and look after everybody.  In any sector there will always be some who try to abuse the law or regulations.  As I said in reply to Deputy O'Reilly earlier, this is a very strong area for investigation and follow up, and every boat in the situation is investigated and checked quite regularly.  We reckon the figure gets close to 100% quite regularly and, naturally, any information we receive is dealt with as well.  The scheme has been put in place because we understand and to make sure the Departments of Justice, Agriculture, Food and the Marine and ourselves try to police this.  In the majority of cases, employers are responsible and work within the law with regard to their staff.  We have to keep monitoring this, of course, because there will always be cases, and this is why the protections through the various agencies are there.</p></speech>

Can they build up recognised accreditation or training skills?  Will he give us an idea of what is involved in this area?</p></speech>

Work at night-time has been on very rare occasions.  Some part of the training might involve night-time activity but we believe it should be extremely limited.  Again, this is dealt with in the regulations.</p> <p>  The area of skill development falls among numerous Departments.  We are looking at how we can enhance and accredit skills in various sectors and recognise service over the years, not so much for someone aged 16 or 17 but in general in a sector to see whether we can build on it.  We have had a discussion on this in all Departments with regard to various sectors.  I am informed that in this sector credentials can be built up at a young age.</p></speech>

In my area there are places such as Ballycotton, where there is a tradition of family members going to sea on the boats so I can understand what happens.  With respect to training and safety, which are paramount, is there a requirement that young people who go out take part in safety training?</p></speech>

I suspect anybody involved in working on a boat has to go through such training.  I can get the Deputy a note to clarify it.  I assume it is the case because there is a lot of legislation and guidance to protect everybody operating a boat, no matter what age they are and certainly those in employment.  It does not fall to the Department so I do not have the information to hand but I am happy to forward it to the Deputy.</p></speech>

With regard to the exemption proposed with regard to engagement in night-time work for essential training purposes, is it possible to define and set out in detail an appropriate rest period?  This is important in the context of night-time work.  Perhaps this question is a reflection of my lack of knowledge of the work that goes into regulations.  I know that rest periods are set out in the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 but it would be very useful in this specific instance to be able to set out an appropriate rest period for these young workers.</p> <p>  It is suggested that the exemption from the prohibition on night-time work will be permitted for essential training purposes.  Is it possible to put in place notification procedures so that when an employer proposes to have a young worker on board at night-time for essential training purposes there is a log and a record is kept?  This would be specific to young persons.  I have significant concerns about enforcement in this area.  Obviously there has been a long history of difficulties with regard to enforcement in the sector.  While record-keeping is only as good as people's honesty, it is important that it is set down, and perhaps sent to the Department or another relevant authority to seek an exemption for training purposes.</p></speech>

There is a definition in the Act and the directive and I can send her a full copy.  It is important to read the regulations in the context of the overall Act, where definitions of rest periods and night-time work are dealt with.  It is notifiable and there must be notification before a young person engages in night-time work.  It is also enforced through investigation.  The Senator's questions and concerns are right and they are dealt with in the legislation.</p></speech>

How widespread is that?  How many fishers working in boats here should be under the atypical working scheme but are not?</p></speech>

Officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Justice administer the atypical scheme.  Officials in my Department sit on the relevant group.  The case referenced by the Deputy is being investigated and has kicked off a number of other investigations.</p> <p>  On the sector generally, this is not an area in which I am an expert, but I understand from my engagement with my officials and the Workplace Relations Commission that it is heavily investigated and regulated, with the majority having been investigated regularly over the past couple of years.  Up to 98% of those involved have been reached.  Some of the Deputy's questions are for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  What we are doing here today is trying to strengthen the legislation to give more protections to this cohort of young workers.</p> <p>  The Deputy has raised many cases over the years.  There is legislation in place.  Some people will try to abuse it or find a way around it.  Our job is to address that when it happens.  There are a number of agencies in this sector and they carry out a high number of investigations.  I cannot comment as to how prevalent the abuse is because I am not involved in the sector.  As mentioned by Deputy Stanton, it is assumed that in most sectors the majority of employers are good.  We have laws in place to deal with those who are not.  It is vital we get that information.  The agencies would react to information brought forward.  When cases of the type identified by the Deputy are brought to their attention they are investigated immediately.  Once a notification is received, staff are deployed within hours to investigate it.</p></speech>

In light of his comments, it might make sense for the committee to invite in the Minister for Transport to come before to discuss this issue.  It seems that there is a mathematical problem which points to widespread abuse of the scheme.  The Minister of State indicated that there are 227 individuals on the scheme currently.  I understand that there are 210 boats that are eligible for the scheme.  Each boat employs substantially more than one person, which begs the question as to who is crewing these boats.  The most obvious answer would be that people are being employed outside the terms of the atypical working scheme, without the relevant protections and in an illegal way.</p></speech>

My understanding is that there are approximately 170 boats in the scheme.  The Deputy may have more up-to-date information, but that is the information in my possession.  My understanding is that those boats generally are not operated by non-EEA officials.  There are regulations in place and they are enforced.  If members have concerns, they can bring them forward and I will have them checked out.  I have no issue with doing that.  In terms of a greater in-depth knowledge around this, it is probably best to discuss it with either the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of Transport.  Whenever we have a role in this area, the Workplace Relations Commission and our officials usually react to deal with it.  On occasion, they have, as would be the case with any sector, reacted within an hour or hour and a half of a situation having been brought to their attention.</p> <p>  As already stated, this is not a sector with which I am overly familiar.  I know many people in the business and I know they are honourable.  It is fair to say that there will always be individuals in every sector who will not be honourable, but that does not mean that we should paint everyone with the same brush.  Hopefully, we are not doing that.  The legislation and all of the transposed directives are there to protect employees and employers and to encourage everybody to follow best practice and the regulations to ensure the protection of employees.  As referenced by the Deputy, there are sectors that are particularly vulnerable and we are seeking to ensure that this does not happen.</p></speech>

I have one final question.  As mentioned by him, a number of investigations have kicked off as a result of the whistleblowing by the workers on the <i>Ellie Adhamh</i>, two of whom almost drowned and the other who was not out on the vessel that day.  The situation may have changed, but as I understand those workers are in limbo in that they have no access to social protection or the right to work as they do not have a stamp 4.  As the investigations are ongoing, they have done a very brave thing in speaking out.  I accept that the Minister of State will not be able to commit to this today, but I ask that the Government seek to ensure that these people get access to a stamp 4 so that they can survive while they are here and the investigations are ongoing.</p></speech>

When there is a an investigation ongoing, a stamp 4 is issued while the issues are being dealt with.  In regard to the other protections, it is the job of various Departments to protect and look after people in this situation.  I am not speaking about any particular case because it would be wrong to do so, particularly in the absence of all of the facts and details of the case.  In general, that is what would happen.</p></speech>

I also welcome the legislation.  Anything that provides additional worker protection and regulation is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  As we are discussing the fishing sector, I would like to point out to the Minister of State that Dunmore East is not included as a harbour where catches can be landed under the Brexit regulations.  This means that fishermen have to land their catches at Howth or Castletownbere.  This is an issue on which I and a number of Deputies are pressing the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We would appreciate the support of the Minister of State in seeking to have Dunmore East included as an approved harbour for the landing of catches by Northern Ireland and UK boats.</p> <p>  In terms of this provision, has the Department considered what affects it might have on casual work take-up in the sector by people in the designated age group?  The Minister of State pointed out that the protection is in place largely to give support to family members.  It is important, however, that we do not criminalise fisherfolk because they are bringing their children out on trawlers, particularly those who may have to be out at sea overnight, as many do.  We need a balance there.</p> <p>  How is this scheme regulated?  The Minister of State and other Deputies mentioned the Workplace Relations Commission a number of times.  In essence, is it that a complaint has to be filed by an adolescent to the effect that he or she has been mistreated in the context of the scheme?  I ask the Minister of State to respond to that question.  As already stated, we do not want to be criminalising fishing operations, particularly the smaller ones.  It may be that some of the worker rights issues that have been spoken about occur on much larger vessels that are fishing very far offshore and are away from port for a number of days, but I do not think that is the case in the context of small fishing vessels.  I would not like to see any tainting of our indigenous fishing sector.</p></speech>

He asked if this regulation will have any affect on or be a deterrent to casual labour take-up.  It already exists within EU law.  In terms of what we are doing today, we are transposing it into Irish law to strengthen the position of workers and to provide clarity.  The protections we are bringing in today are already in place and, I hope, are being honoured and respected by most people.  I do not think it will have an impact on casual labour or family work practices.  Rather, it should enhance it and protect all involved.</p> <p>  The main body in respect of raising cases is the Marine Survey Office.  The Deputy is correct that an investigation can be brought about by way of complaint or issue raised by a member or somebody representing him or her, such as a union or other body, but investigations are also commenced as a result of targeted inspections.  There have been a number of high-profile inspections involving all of the State agencies on a number of occasions in the past.</p> <p>  On access to ports and Brexit, again, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the lead and decision-making body in that regard.  My understanding is that a number of ports were picked at the start to deal with Brexit, with a view to the figure being increased over time.  The Deputy will need to engage in a conversation on that issue with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p> <p>  The timeline is not a matter for my Department.</p><p>I will certainly raise the issue with colleagues.  I will also the Deputy's concerns back to our Brexit working committee.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I thank them for coming before us to share their expertise.</p> <p>  I will first read a note on privilege.  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue your remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their contributions, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I call on Mr. Cunniffe to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I acknowledge and commend its recent work in helping to produce and strengthen a climate Bill which puts Ireland on a path to net-zero emissions and mandates a 51% reduction in emissions over the next decade.</p> <p>  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Justin Moran, who is our head of public affairs, and Paul Blount, who is the portfolio director at Coillte and who is here in his capacity as chairperson of our 70by30 policy committee.</p> <p>  Wind Energy Ireland is Ireland&rsquo;s largest representative body for renewable energy, with more than 150 members.  Wind energy has transformed Ireland&rsquo;s electricity system over the past ten years, cutting millions of tonnes of CO2 emissions every year &ndash; 4 million tonnes in 2019 alone &ndash; and steadily reducing our dependency on imported fossil fuels.  We are proud of the contribution our members have made but it was only possible by the work of EirGrid, ESB Networks and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, in developing the grid and integrating renewable energy.</p> <p>  It is to the credit of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Rya&rsquo;s, that the policies he put in place when last in government enabled us to develop the onshore wind sector, which last year produced 38% of our electricity.  This makes us number one in the world for the share of electricity demand met by onshore wind and it ensured we exceeded our 2020 renewable electricity target.  We are also a major contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  The recent Economic Impact of Onshore Wind in Ireland report from KPMG showed that onshore wind energy is supporting more than 5,000 jobs and is worth more than  &euro;400 million annually to our economy.  Both of these figures will rise.</p> <p>  As we develop onshore wind, it will be alongside an entirely new industry.  Offshore wind energy has the potential to transform our energy system and our economy.  It is a multibillion euro opportunity for coastal communities and will deliver unprecedented savings in carbon emissions.  This achievement puts us in a strong position to meet our 2030 ambitions.  The 2019 climate action plan and the programme for Government set out ambitious goals of developing 5 GW of offshore wind and doubling our onshore wind capacity to 8.2 GW by 2030.  I wish to take the opportunity this morning to commend Deputy Bruton on his work in developing and delivering the 2019 climate action plan.</p> <p>  We know we have the pipeline of projects to achieve these targets but the most significant challenge we face is whether the grid will be strong enough to integrate this renewable energy.  Last year, Wind Energy Ireland published a series of four reports known as the 70by30 implementation plan, which set out what needs to happen across planning, grid and market policy to decarbonise our electricity supply.  Implementing those four reports gives us our best chance of reaching our 2030 targets.  I want to focus today on the Saving Power report, which sets out how to integrate more renewable energy onto the grid.</p> <p>  Last year, more than 10% of renewable generation was lost because the grid could not accommodate it.  In the first six months of last year alone, enough renewable energy was lost to power all of Galway city for a year.  We need a complete redesign and reinforcement of the transmission system, with a focus on parts of the country where large volumes of renewable energy will be developed.  Our fossil fuel back-up generation must be replaced with zero-carbon solutions such as demand response and energy storage.</p> <p>  An electricity grid and market designed for fossil fuel generators are not suitable for a future where most of our electricity comes from wind and solar.  We must reform the market to ensure the new system we are building is efficient and cost-effective.</p> <p>  Implementing these reports and developing the electricity grid will not be easy.  We must work with and listen to communities who will be hosting new wind farms or new grid infrastructure.  We must ensure they are empowered to be part of our energy transition and we must find ways to adapt, where we can, to meet their concerns.  The reality, however, is that we will not decarbonise our electricity system without new overhead lines, underground cables, substations, battery projects, wind farms and solar farms.  The public and political support must be there to enable EirGrid and ESB Networks to deliver the infrastructure we need to decarbonise Ireland.  Without it, we will fail.</p> <p>  We look forward to playing our part in EirGrid&rsquo;s Shaping Our Electricity Future consultation and the Government&rsquo;s consultation on the 2021 climate action plan.  To inform our contributions, we engaged energy consultants, Baringa Partners, to analyse how the electricity sector could deliver even more CO2 savings.  Initial results show it is possible to reduce power sector emissions to at least below two million tonnes of CO2 by 2030, which is less than half that envisaged by the climate action plan.  This will require EirGrid and ESB Networks to deliver essential grid reinforcements and to continue their world-leading success in integrating renewables onto the power system, thus enabling us to go beyond 70% renewable electricity by 2030.</p><p>We look forward to engaging with EirGrid, the committee and the Department when the analysis is complete.  Finally, I note that we recently published our Our Climate Neutral Future: Zero by 50 report, developed for us by UCC MaREI.  This is a call to action for every level of Irish society.  The report sets out our pathway to becoming energy independent and delivering warmer homes, cleaner air and tens of thousands of new jobs.  We can decarbonise our energy system while building a foundation for the Irish economy and our society based on zero carbon energy.  Delivering this future will require unprecedented leadership and it will not happen unless we can bring people with us by showing them the benefits of a truly just transition.  Our members can and will rise to the challenge.  </p></speech>

As this meeting is confined to a maximum of two hours and representatives from EirGrid will be presenting in the second hour, I propose each member be given two minutes to address his or her questions to the witnesses.  This is to ensure that all members get an opportunity to pose their queries.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I will call members in the order in which they raise their hands.  I call Deputy O'Rourke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021042700002#B00300"><p>I have a few questions for whoever might like to take them.  On future development for communities around the country, how many additional onshore wind farms might we expect to see across the Twenty-six Counties before 2030?  I would just like some sense of that situation.  Turning to public acceptance, I would like to hear the perspective of the witnesses regarding that aspect.  We had the planning regulator in with us some weeks ago and he talked about the possibility of designated areas for renewable energy.  He also referred to there almost being an effective ban in policy in some counties.</p> <p>  From my experience, I know the great public resistance there can be concerning what is seen as opportunistic development that is not well thought through and not well connected with communities.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that point about public acceptance.  The wind energy guidelines are still outstanding as well and I ask if the witnesses have opinions on that aspect from their experience.</p> <p>  Representatives from EirGrid will be appearing before the committee in the next hour.  There is some sense that EirGrid's ambition is not what it should be.  I note the wide range of proposals that Wind Energy Ireland has in respect of policy development which would have to change to meet our 2030 targets.  Will the witnesses comment on the ongoing EirGrid public consultation and the type of submission Wind Energy Ireland will be making to that consultation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Cunniffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021042700002#B00400"><p>I will take a few of those questions and then I will pass the question on public acceptance to my colleague, Justin Moran, who leads much of our public engagement work.  Starting with the number of onshore wind farms that can be expected across the country, it is safe to say that onshore wind farms are getting more efficient.  Turbine technology is always progressing well.  This means that to deliver the equivalent amount of onshore wind energy to that we already have in the system will require far fewer wind farms and turbines.  That is because they are more effective and efficient and can deliver more energy for the same number of turbines.  I do not have an exact figure for how many wind farms can be expected.  They range, quite dramatically, in size from perhaps 5 MW up to more than 100 MW, and the exact number will depend on how successful various wind farms are at auctions.  It is safe to say, however, that meeting the capacity needed will require fewer wind farms and turbines than we have today.</p> <p>  Turning to the planning aspect which was mentioned by the Deputy regarding the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, I think that is definitely an issue.  Much planning of renewable developments today is done on a county-by-county level and often one county might designate a certain portion of its area as suitable for wind energy development, whereas a neighbouring county might have ruled out the area right on the other side of the border for renewable development.  What we are looking for, therefore, is a more regional approach to planning, which is led by the three regional assemblies where there is an overarching renewable policy framework for developing renewable energy across the country, rather than on a county-by-county level.  </p> <p>  Moving to the wind energy guidelines, those are still outstanding.  We are very keen to see them, and I imagine we want to see them more than anyone else.  For us, there are several issues in the draft wind energy guidelines, especially related to the noise element.  We want the final guidelines to be based on scientifically robust and implementable solutions.  Whatever is published in the wind energy guidelines from a noise perspective, therefore, needs to be deliverable and implementable.  </p> <p>  I refer also to several other areas of the wind energy guidelines, such as set-back distance being increased to four times the tip height of turbines.  That is a change from the current set-back distance of about 500 m.  It is likely to go out to 750 m or 800 m, which will reduce the land area available for onshore wind energy generation by about 40% compared to today.  However, we recognise this is necessary and it is something we are absolutely willing to work with.  There is also a point in the wind energy guidelines on reducing shadow flicker, which is an issue.  We again absolutely accept that is something that needs to happen.  For us, therefore, we want to see those guidelines published quickly and they must be based on scientific evidence, especially concerning the aspect of noise, and they also need to be implementable. </p> <p>  The last point I will mention concerns EirGrid's consultation, and then I will pass over to Mr. Moran to comment on the public acceptance issue.  This is the biggest consultation I have ever seen EirGrid do.  Its level of engagement has been exceptional and it is reaching out to all parts of society.  The consultation proposals regarding the future of the electricity grid, the markets and how the system is operated are well considered.  There are four options for grid and network development.  We will be asking for a blend of those four options.  We do not believe that any one option will be the solution and I think EirGrid acknowledges this point as well.  Our focus is on trying to deliver the capacity targets set out in the Climate Action Plan and the programme for Government, and we would like to see an electricity grid developed which can help to meet those capacity targets.  I will pass over to Mr. Moran now to respond to the aspect of public acceptance.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.368" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021042700002#B00500"><p>I will pick up on one point Mr. Cunniffe mentioned about the number of turbines and give a practical example.  We have a wind farm at Barnesmore in County Donegal that one of our members is repowering.  This example will give the committee members an idea of how the change in technology is occurring.  That wind farm has 25 turbines and a generating capacity of 15 MW.  We are going to take down those 25 turbines and 13 will be put up instead, halving the total number.  However, the generating capacity will go from 15 MW to approximately 60 MW to 70 MW.  That gives an idea of how rapidly the technology is changing, to the point where we now need fewer turbines to get the same amount of power.</p> <p>  Turning to the issue of public acceptance, opinion polling consistently shows substantial levels of support, 70% to 80%, for wind energy in Ireland.  Even when people are asked a question about a wind farm near them, we still see majority support even in rural Ireland.  On our end, we need to engage with those people who have questions and concerns about projects.  Frankly, we must be improving that aspect continually and always doing a better job.  One of the ways we do that is by listening and then changing projects as they are ongoing.  It would be very rare today for an onshore wind farm project to finish as it started.  The project will change as the concerns of people are listened to and adjustments are made accordingly.  </p> <p>  For example, one project in the midlands started out with either 27 or 29 turbines and it is now going to be built with 23 turbines.  The substation has also been moved to a different location.  Those changes have all been based on the feedback that came from people in the community.  I think the Deputy is right, therefore, and this issue touches on the point made by Mr. Cunniffe at the end of his contribution.  The only way we are going to develop wind farms and grid infrastructure is through enhanced public engagement as early as possible.  We must not just listen to people, which is obviously valuable, but also take their views into account and adjust accordingly wherever that is possible.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Blount" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021042700002#B00700"><p>I reiterate and emphasise the point that Mr. Cunniffe was making about the importance of a blend to enable the installed capacity targets to be met.</p><p>In many respects, the grid is a key enabler of competition.  If we are to deliver this transition at the least cost to consumers, the grid is what will enable competition.  By going for a blend of the options that EirGrid has put forward, we enable the competition that will allow transition to be delivered at least cost and with the ability to flex to the higher levels of ambition that I expect will inevitably come.  I really want to emphasise that point.  EirGrid has done the work and analysis on this and it is a case now of making the right decisions.</p><p> There can be a tendency to focus on the cost of providing the grid infrastructure.  We need to start thinking of it as an investment that will enable cheaper forms of renewable energy to come onto the system.  We must approach it with the kind of mindset that if there is underinvestment, the transition may become more expensive.  We need to invest the right amount in order to create capacity and enable competition.  The analogy I like to use is that failing to do this would be like investing huge sums of money in trains but investing nothing in the railway lines.  That is where we are at on this issue.  I thank the Deputy for his questions.</p></speech>

There is some concern at this time regarding the development of wind energy, which is happening apace.  That development is needed because we have our targets to meet.  However, there are concerns as to whether the environmental considerations are being taken fully into account when we are planning where the farms will go.  The provisions relating to the marine planning framework are going through the D&aacute;il this week.  My understanding is that there will be a very limited consultation on those proposals, with only a 50-minute debate scheduled in the D&aacute;il.  Even that discussion had to be campaigned for quite strongly.  Mr. Moran spoke about bringing communities on board, having full discussions and consultation and making sure everyone knows what is happening.  That is really important and I am very glad to hear it is a priority for Wind Energy Ireland.  Does Mr. Moran have any concerns that rushing through the proposals for the marine planning framework without having a full debate in the D&aacute;il could undermine that community engagement and set a scene whereby communities will already feel disadvantaged coming into the process?</p> <p>  My other question follows on from the point raised by Deputy O'Rourke.  In my constituency of Wicklow, there are three major wind farms planned for the coastline.  I cannot find a map showing those three farms and indicating the capacity or target relating to each.  That is the kind of information communities need.  Will providing that information be something Wind Energy Ireland can either facilitate or seek to get done, perhaps through the Department?  It is important that people understand and can see exactly what the impact of these farms will be.  What is the witnesses' opinion on that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.373" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021042700002#C00300"><p>Any of the projects we are developing will need to go through an environmental impact assessment process to identify whether they will have impacts on the local environment and, if so, the efforts that can be made to minimise or mitigate those impacts.  We are really conscious of the responsibility we have to do that effectively and in such a way that we can be held to account by the planning authorities.</p> <p>  One of the areas in which it would be great to see some additional support or investment is in terms of ensuring that other actors in the environmental space are able to participate in the process.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, for example, is drastically underfunded.  It really needs to have the resources available to look not just at onshore wind farm development but also at offshore development in the years to come.  The same can be said of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We are going to see the development of offshore wind farms, including those the Deputy mentioned, and we will need to ensure they are adequately resourced.  We must ensure not only that the planning process is carried out in a responsible, transparent and accountable way but that it is seen by the communities involved to be carried out in that way and that they are able to participate in the process.</p> <p>  Regarding the national marine planning framework, I am not sure what the D&aacute;il schedule is for discussing it this week.  I see it as a document that is critical to the development of renewable energy and putting in place an effective planning framework.  There has been quite a long consultation on the national planning framework.  I understand the Government extended the consultation period to give people an opportunity to have an input into the proposals.  We need to ensure the document is properly scrutinised.  Whether that is done by allocating time for debate in the Oireachtas is a decision for members of the committee and the people who are responsible for scheduling.  It is really important to ensure that what we put in place is robust, will last five, ten or 15 years, and will provide a system that enables us to develop the offshore renewable energy production which, as the Deputy mentioned, is absolutely critical.  It must do so in a way that enables communities to participate in that process, both through the framework system and through submissions, which many communities have made, and also in respect of decisions on individual projects.</p> <p>  Mapping offshore wind farms can be quite a challenge.  At this point, many of those involved in the projects are simply carrying out surveys of specific locations on the seabed.  They might be carrying out a survey on a much wider space than they plan to use for the development of the wind farm infrastructure.  We need to find ways of getting that information collated better and making it more available and transparent.  If there is something we can do to work with the relevant authorities to achieve that, we would be very happy to take it on board.</p></speech>

We all recognise the importance of renewable energy as a significant part of meeting our electricity generation needs and the increased demand in that regard over the coming years.  Where it gets a little more difficult is in the perception, or perhaps the reality in many cases, of the saturation point having been reached for onshore wind in many of the most attractive areas from a wind capture point of view, and the significant impact that is having on communities.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on how they intend to engage more effectively in this regard and to the broader benefit of communities.</p> <p>  Heretofore, wind energy developers tended to do deals with community enterprises, namely, the local GAA club, a community council or similar, and provide some funding in that way.  This model, in my view, does not work and does not address the impact on some of the communities involved.  A decision can be made to go for the setback distance and put the farm out to 1 km, but there still will be people who feel impacted by the intrusion of a wind farm.  Let us be honest about this.  Some people are concerned about noise and some are concerned about flicker.  If one drills down into their real concerns, some people will talk about health issues, which are certainly not proven and probably not real.  They are also concerned about the visually intrusive nature of wind farms.  Are the witnesses considering a greater level of involvement for communities in discussions on matters of this nature?  I am not referring to situations where people are participating with their own equity.  Is Wind Energy Ireland going to share the profit or gain with a wider cohort of the community than just the community groups, local GAA clubs or landholders?  That is critical in getting some of the areas to a point where they can be developed.  There are certain areas in which I expect the witnesses will never get the support of people for development.  That will have to be taken into account.</p> <p>  I am concerned that there has been a lack of engagement through the Covid period.  Mr. Blount might be able to tell us more about the wind farm that Coillte is developing on the shores of Lough Derg near Killaloe.  I have been a public representative for that area for 18 years-----</p></speech>

Then I will pass over to Mr. Moran to talk about the community benefit and some of our work there.  Then I will pass over to Mr. Blount to talk about the engagement during Covid.</p><p> On the saturation issue mentioned, there was a very interesting presentation last week by the planning consultants MKO at the Wind Energy Ireland conference.  That showed that delivering the 4 GW of additional onshore wind energy we need between now and 2030 would require 0.3% of the land area in Ireland.  The amount of land area that is required to develop 4 GW is getting smaller all the time because the turbines are getting more efficient and fewer are needed, effectively.  When that 0.3% is dispersed across multiple counties, it should not lead to an oversaturation in particular parts of the country.</p><p> In terms of how we see development with communities over time, Wind Energy Ireland carries out a pipeline survey of its members every nine months to understand how the onshore and offshore wind pipeline is progressing in the country.  If you look back over the pipeline surveys over the past two years, it has been very interesting to see projects at very early stages of development go from one survey to another and, very often, get smaller over time.  That is because they have engaged with communities in the early stages of development.  They have optimised the placement of turbines and removed them in certain instances, like Mr. Moran mentioned earlier.  We really are trying to bring communities with us and have those discussions at the earliest possible opportunities we can.  I might let Mr. Moran and Mr. Blount talk a little bit more about that separately.</p><p> The potential for offshore wind energy in Ireland is enormous.  We have a challenge of getting to 5 GW by 2030.  That challenge is not set by a lack of projects being developed or the developers that are there to deliver it.  The challenge is ensuring we get a planning system up and running as quickly as possible, we have a grid system up and running so that projects can be connected to the grid, and we have a route to market so that we have auctions available to deliver 5 GW.</p><p> It was a fantastic announcement by the ESB a couple of weeks ago and it is real evidence of the just transition happening from coal to the future of offshore wind energy.  The vast majority of offshore projects developed this decade will likely be fixed bottom offshore facilities, predominantly located off the east coast, but certainly some will be required off the south and west coast, most likely, to hit the 5 GW target.  We can see floating offshore wind projects playing a role towards the latter half of this decade and certainly into the future.</p><p> The programme for Government set a target of 30 GW of floating offshore wind potential.  What we saw in our recent UCC report, which looked at getting to a zero carbon economy by 2050, was that we need about 25 GW of renewable energy between now and 2050 purely for our own domestic demand.  That is not even taking into account the export potential that was referenced in the programme for Government.  I have no doubt we need to continue developing onshore and progressing our offshore development, especially floating technology, as we go out into the 2030s and 2040s, and we need to develop solar energy because we need diversity across the renewables portfolio.</p><p> I will pass over to Mr. Moran on the community benefit and he will be followed by Mr. Blount.</p></speech>

As members may be familiar, under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, that was launched last year, every wind farm participating in that scheme will need to put in a payment to the community benefit fund of &euro;2 a megawatt hour.  That works out at roughly between &euro;4,000 and &euro;5,000 for a megawatt of installed capacity.  For a 20 MW farm, it will cost somewhere between &euro;80,000 and &euro;100,000 a year for 15 years going into a local community.  The really impressive part about the renewable electricity support scheme is that it has put community control and influence over where the money goes at the heart of how it is being developed.</p> <p>  The reason I said there is an opportunity here for members is because the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is running a consultation asking people to provide input on how community committees should be structured, set up, the powers they should have, and the supports and resources that should be available.  We are very keen to see communities empowered and enabled as much as possible to ensure the SEAI provides them with the resources that enable them to take best advantage of this.  A wind farm, for example, could be a transformative opportunity for a small rural community or a coastal community when offshore wind farms come together.  Let us think about how we can use this money over ten or 15 years to leave a real lasting legacy in that community.  It is not just investment in small pockets.  It is actually investing in capital in that community and making a difference over the long run.  I will share with the members of the committee details of the consultation because the issue is quite live.  Certainly, the principle of ensuring maximum community control over the community benefit fund is one we absolutely support and it is one that is embedded in the renewable electricity support scheme.</p></speech>

It is about getting the design right.  As you develop your design, you need to engage with communities to give them the confidence that the design is being done correctly.</p> <p>  A big challenge for us, and I would say we are similar to many other sectors, is the advent of social media and the ease with which misinformation can be spread on social media, and that is something that creates huge challenges for us.  In our engagement processes we have to seek to tackle some of that misinformation.  That is very challenging but we work incredibly hard to do that.</p> <p>  Covid is an unprecedented public health crisis and it created difficulties in implementing the type of engagement model we would ordinarily have sought to do.  We have a team who work incredibly hard to reinvent our approach to engagement in that type of an environment.  We are similar to many other developers in this respect.  In terms of building virtual tours, we made our project team available to respond to queries.  We did a lot in the circumstances to try to adapt to a very difficult situation when the Covid crisis landed.</p></speech>

The committee has been very strong in wanting to double the ambition we set out in the climate action plan, which is welcome.  I see the witnesses are talking about moving to in excess of 85% capacity for wind on the grid.  There is a dilemma for both politicians and the witnesses.  We all want more but, as we have seen with housing, it is often politicians themselves who, having declared a housing emergency, want to block each individual case and want every piece of a case heard.  We need to find a better way of doing this, and that is not to criticise politicians who feel frustrated, because I know that happens.  If we find that every case is going to be pursued by a group of politicians or judicial reviews, we will never get this done and we are wasting our time declaring an ambition of 51%.  Are there international examples of how this is being done better that we could draw upon?  Who has done this work very quickly, as we now need to do?</p> <p>  Did the witnesses comment on the backup they need for wind energy generation?  I know the wind does not always blow.  What is their view of the backup in the short and medium term?  Are they considering battery technology as an integral part of some of their investment?</p> <p>  What is the scale of capital, do the witnesses reckon, that needs to be mobilised to get the grid infrastructure and wind capacity built?</p><p>How much capital do we need to mobilise?  Can we find a better way to mobilise that quickly for the grid?  Are there obstacles in the way of wind energy in Ireland?  I have heard some criticism that there is a bit of gold-plating on the type of infrastructure being put in which is making it more expensive to deliver wind energy projects quickly.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.390" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Cunniffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021042700002#E00200"><p>I agree with the Deputy that we need to do things better and quicker.  We need public and political support to deliver what we are trying to do here.  It is not just wind energy, but also grid infrastructure.  If we really want to deliver a net zero-carbon economy, we need renewable energy because the electricity grid will be the backbone of not just our electricity supply but of our heating and transport sectors and all our services.  We need to start looking at things through the lens of an investment rather than as a cost.<br/><br/>Regarding international best practice, many European countries are trying to double their wind energy resource.  This is a challenge faced throughout Europe and across the world based on some of the announcements in other jurisdictions.  We work with partners in Wind Europe, our trade association body at European level, to try to identify best practices of engaging with communities.  The Deputy is right that we need to do more by going into communities and explaining the benefits not just of wind energy but of infrastructure in general, be that transmission grid, distribution grid, broadband, transport networks, etc.  It is a challenge for all of us.  <br/><br/>The Deputy asked about the backup capacity.  Security of supply is paramount, and we need to ensure that the supply of electricity can remain secure and reliable as we transition to a zero-carbon portfolio.  The diversity of renewable energy will certainly help with that.  Onshore wind, offshore wind and solar generation have diverse availability patterns.  At times when solar might not be available, wind might be available and <i>vice versa</i>.<br/><br/>We need to look further at interconnection and how it works.  We need to see the Greenlink interconnector delivered in 2023.  We need to see the Celtic interconnector delivered by 2026.  This will diversify our security of supply to other jurisdictions and will allow the efficient trade in power so that when we have excess power we can export it and when we do not have power, we can bring it in from other jurisdictions.<br/><br/>In the short to medium term we need to look at long-duration storage.  Several technologies today provide multi-hour battery storage, for example.  Very often our issues when it comes to security of supply are of a multi-hour timeframe, for four to five hours over the evening peak, as we saw during the wintertime just gone.  Multi-hour storage devices charged with renewable energy ideally during other times can be used to provide cover at those evening peaks.  They represent one zero-carbon solution that does not depend on fossil fuels.  <br/><br/>In the longer term we need market incentives in order to drive a transition towards a carbon-free molecule to combust, be it hydrogen or something else.  We really need to think about how we evolve the thermal portfolio of our system away from one that is focused on coal and gas more towards clean carbon source.<br/><br/>The Deputy asked if there were any obstacles to delivering this.  The biggest obstacle for both onshore and offshore wind energy is grid infrastructure.  We need the grid to be capable of exporting the available power to where it is needed.  There are several examples of wind farm projects on the onshore side which have planning permission but are not progressing because the grid infrastructure to deliver the power to where it needs to be is not there.  <br/><br/>Similarly, the EirGrid consultation has shown that significant investment is required on the east coast in order to deliver our ambitions there for the 5 GW capacity.  We will also need to look at the south coast and west coast in that regard.  <br/><br/>Mr. Moran may wish to make comments about the investment in the recent KPMG report that we used.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.391" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021042700002#E00300"><p>An investment of approximately &euro;2.6 billion or &euro;2.7 billion will be required for developing the electricity system and developing onshore wind farms and solar farms over the next few years.  Obviously, there will also be need for investment in offshore wind farms.  Much of that money will stay in Ireland and we can build a stronger Irish supply chain.  There is real opportunity for Irish coastal communities and Irish ports to play a role in the development of offshore wind energy.  The sooner we can move forward and support those projects the better.</p></speech>

I believe Mr. Blount spoke about how projects can change dramatically from when they start planning to the end.  That is part of the problem.  I know it is good to have that community engagement.  When the community does not accept a bad proposal and it does not go ahead, it sets back the other good projects in an area.  I can think of a poor project in Galway now and contrast it with the Galway Wind Park which got great support.  Do we need to look at best practice from the outset and not to make a proposal that is likely not to get support because it does not always change over time and then negativity has set in at a very early point?</p> <p>  I do not believe the witnesses talked about opportunities for Ireland on the manufacturing and maintenance side.  We are talking about energy generation and exporting excess energy, but perhaps there is an opportunity for Ireland to get involved even though we are coming to it later than other countries, such as Germany.  What opportunities might exist in that regard?  </p> <p>  Why do we need to make more investment in the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS?  How does that impact on planning for the wind energy industry?</p> <p>  Quite apart from the grid what other infrastructure is required in order to get the west and north west from bottom of the heap to being more advanced?  Again, communities are likely to come on board when they see investment in their area, including other types of infrastructural investment that go hand in hand with the investment in energy.  </p></speech>

Witnesses may answer briefly now, but we would be very happy to receive written answers if they would like to follow up later.  I will forgo my own question because of the limited time we have left.  I am quite interested in hearing the response to Senator O'Reilly's question on the potential for manufacturing in Ireland.  She said that we probably missed the boat 20 or 30 years ago in respect of manufacturing wind energy technology in Ireland.  Given the major resource we have here, there may be manufacturing potential here.  I would appreciate hearing the witnesses' comments on that.</p></speech>

Last year we published a report, entitled Harnessing Our Potential, which looked at the investment opportunities for offshore renewable energy.  It found that there is a commercial opportunity for port infrastructure off the west coast and east coast which can help become a supply base and create an indigenous supply chain to support the offshore wind energy industry in Ireland.  It is certainly something that is worth looking into.  We believe we could have a commercial opportunity for a staging port which would be worth about &euro;70 million.  There would be a commercial opportunity for an operations and maintenance port worth about &euro;350 million.</p> <p>  This report was based on the climate action plan target of 3.5 GW rather than the increased target of 5 GW.  Between now and 2030 we will need an investment in offshore wind energy of approximately &euro;18 billion.  Looking forward to post-2030 potential, we believe an additional &euro;42 billion is on the table.  It is all about how much of that opportunity Irish companies can tap into and harness.  We are very much minded of that and we have a very active supply chain working group looking at those opportunities.</p><p> One of the final comments was on the west and north west.  To return to the grid infrastructure, one of EirGrid's current options, as part of its consultation, concerns the savings that can be made in grid infrastructural requirements if some large energy users can be moved from the Dublin region to other parts of the country, and it is examining the west and north west as options in that regard.  Delivering that will require public policy support to achieve the transition and infrastructural development in things such as fibre broadband that are very important to the large information-driven industries developing around the Dublin region at the moment because of their broadband infrastructures.  That will be vital for bringing not just investment in renewable energy but also the demand out of Dublin and towards the other regions.</p><p> Mr. Moran or Mr. Blount might wish to comment on the NPWS or the other issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.396" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021042700002#F00200"><p>To take the operations and maintenance opportunity, for example, it is worth mentioning that a number of people are already working in operations and maintenance in Ireland.  One company, off the top of my head, is Enercon, a turbine manufacture from Germany whose Irish national headquarters is located in Tralee.  It employs about 150 people across the country, most of whom are turbine technicians who travel throughout the country.  These are jobs in rural Ireland for engineers and technicians who, in many cases, have come back from other countries.  When we move to offshore, a typical 500 MW or 600 MW offshore wind farm would have between 80 and 100 operations and maintenance jobs once it is up and running in whatever port or harbour is identified as its support.</p> <p>  On the point about public engagement, we need to get out there as early as possible and constantly try to find ways to improve.  It is fair to say that as an industry, the approach and the investment of time, money and resources we put into community and public engagement today is very different from what it would have been, say, ten years ago, and we are getting better and stronger in that regard.  I accept the point that it can be confusing if a project changes or is amended.  There is a communications task in being able to explain to people that a project has changed because they asked us to change it.  It is about giving them a sense of empowerment and control over the decisions being made in their area.  We need to explain that we have moved a particular substation because we were asked to, or that we are constructing it differently because we were asked to.  That is work we need to do.</p> <p>  On the NPWS, when we are developing onshore wind farms and, in the future, offshore wind farms, we need to do so in such a way that allows us to protect Ireland's biodiversity and to ensure that what we are developing will mitigate environmental impacts where possible.  The earlier we can engage with the NPWS about projects, the better and stronger not just we will be but also the projects themselves.  There are steps we can take as an industry.  I take this opportunity to plug that we have just launched our all-Ireland pollinator plan with the National Biodiversity Data Centre.  Wind farms increasingly take up a specific geographic location or space.  We need to examine what we can do to build, operate, maintain and manage them in a way that enhances Ireland's biodiversity.  There are many such interesting and exciting projects at individual wind farms throughout the country.</p></speech>

They mentioned that onshore wind accounted for about 38% of our electricity last year.  What percentage do our guests estimate offshore to account for, given the number of projects in the pipeline over the coming years?  In my constituency, there is the Kish Bank basin proposal, which is a rehash of a previous plan that did not get very far, thankfully.  I note what our guests said about wind turbines and all the technological advancements.  There are now fewer turbines and the plan has changed somewhat.  Nevertheless, after the public consultation, things have gone quiet and people are unsure as to what the next stage is.  Mr. Moran spoke about communication.  It is important that the public are aware of the next phase when the consultation is complete.</p> <p>  Mr. Cunniffe stated "more than 10% of renewable generation was lost because the grid could not accommodate it."  What measures could prevent that loss of energy?  Does the technology exist?  One issue I have come across relates to the energy cloud.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage recently launched a scheme with Cl&uacute;id Housing.  To me, it seems to be a really good and efficient use of potentially lost energy in the grid.</p> <p>  Mr. Cunniffe stated that we will not decarbonise our electricity system without new overhead lines or underground cables.  Is the preference of Wind Energy Ireland's members for overhead or underground?  It is a controversial issue and I am interested in hearing our guests' views.</p></speech>

I share Mr. Cunniffe's excitement about the potential for offshore wind in the context of meeting our 2030 targets, but my concern is that if we fast-track marine planning but do not have the designated zones in place, it will only lead to more judicial reviews and planning objections.  While Deputy Bruton stated that politicians and communities are objecting, in general judicial reviews arise because we do not screen out the bad applications in the first instance.  The way in which we could do that is by having the marine protected areas zoned before dealing with the marine planning, or by having the two go hand in hand.  I would like to hear our guests' perspective on that.  Surely the industry, too, wants that type of certainty in regard to the marine protection zones.</p></speech>

It seems there have been better outcomes from better engagement by the industry, and that should allow it to navigate the planning process rather than being in any sense seen as a substitute for the planning process.  Will our guests comment specifically on the use of environmental impact assessments, that is, not appropriate assessments for Natura 2000 sites but environmental impact assessments and social impact assessments?  Is there an acknowledgment that many community concerns early on have improved the industry?  We saw that in terms of noise.  A significant aspect of offshore relates to seismic activity and its impact.  That is another really important area where there is a precautionary principle.</p> <p>  I heard a reference to "science based".  To be clear, the European principles are a precautionary principle that does not mean that nothing is done but rather that an attempt is made to be even ahead of where the research is headed.  Specifically on the issue of the marine protected areas, do our guests anticipate that the industry will contest the zoning of marine protected areas, based on any planning applications that may have been granted or are pending?  That is a concern.  We want to make the marine protection area zoning be heavily driven by the protection of our marine environment.</p> <p>  Will our guests follow up with written comments on the just transition and learning from the good and the bad of what has happened in Scotland, and on Wind Energy Ireland's role in that?  Do they agree that gas is not a transition fuel?  Should there be a greater emphasis on investment in storage technology versus carbon capture?</p></speech>

One issue I will take now, because I know it is the topic of the meeting, relates to the grid.  Deputy Devlin asked about the measures we need in order to reduce the number of dispatch-down instructions, given that that is a grid challenge with EirGrid coming in.  There are two elements to dispatch-down, namely, constraints, which are a local area problem, and curtailment, which is a system-wide problem that deals with the inability of the system to manage securely the level of wind energy on the grid.  To take the system-wide issue first, the main step we need to take over the next ten years is to substitute fossil fuel generators with clean, zero-carbon sources of providing services to the grid.</p><p>These services relate not only to energy but to stability as well.  Examples include things like demand side response, battery storage and some of the newer technologies involved.  The ESB announcement some weeks ago is relevant too.  These factors will be really important.  We see this as the primary way to make space on the grid for renewable energy.</p><p> We carried out some work with Baringa last year.  It showed that if we can transition to these zero-carbon services, then we can remove 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the power sector.  That is approximately one fifth of our emissions today.  That does not require any new large-scale grid infrastructure.  It can be done.</p><p> Another point is that we absolutely need investment in our grid infrastructure.  We need to use the existing grid better.  There are ways to do this and new technologies that can better utilise existing lines.  One area in particular is hybrid connections.  This was referenced in the 2019 climate action plan but it is not in the 2021 climate action plan goals for this year.  We would like to see this improved.  The idea is to better utilise hybrid connections and have existing grid connections with technologies like onshore, offshore and solar energy as well as battery storage all from the same part of the grid.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome all of you to today's meeting and thank you for appearing before the committee to share your expertise.</p> <p>  I wish to remind you of the long-standing parliamentary practice that you should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if your statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, you will be directed to discontinue your remarks.  It is imperative that you comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  I call on Mr. Foley to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Suzanne Collins, our head of public relations, and Mr. Liam Ryan, our chief innovation and planning officer.</p> <p>  The climate action plan, underpinned by the recently published Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, will set out a pathway to reduce carbon emissions across society and the economy by 50% between now and 2030.</p> <p>  EirGrid operates the power system on a 24-7 basis across two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland, thus ensuring people have electricity at all times.  EirGrid is also responsible for planning the power system of the future.  Our planning horizon runs for decades.</p> <p>  Ireland is a world leader in renewable energy integration, namely, onshore wind.  Last week, we reported the fact that Ireland achieved 43% of all electricity from renewable sources in 2020.  This was an extraordinary achievement and ahead of the 40% target set back in 2008.</p> <p>  As recently as March of this year we signed off on our capability to operate the power system at 70% renewables on the system on an instantaneous basis.  We are the only island country in the world operating at this level.  We expect to be able to operate at 75% by the end of the year.</p> <p>  Ireland has exceptional untapped wind resources, particularly offshore.  They equate to approximately ten times what is currently installed on the island of Ireland, namely, 5,000 MW.  As we look to 2030 targets and ultimately to net zero emissions in 2050, offshore wind has a key role to play.</p> <p>  The forthcoming climate action plan seeks to transition the electricity system from the aforementioned 43% from renewable sources last year to at least 70% by 2030.  We are among an elite group in the world with such ambition.</p> <p>  I will set out some context.  The task of meeting the target of 70% of electricity from renewable sources in 2030 represents a whole-of-system challenge, one that has to be dealt with across three dimensions.  I will elaborate on these three dimensions.  First, the total system demand for electricity is going to increase by as much as 50% in the coming ten years due primarily to data centres, electric vehicles for transportation and heat pumps for homes.  Second, the generation portfolio is changing dramatically as fossil fuel plant exit the system and the fleet of renewable generators increases by between 100% and 200% through continuing investment in onshore wind - something Ireland is excellent at - new solar generation and a major new industry centred around offshore wind generation.  Third, EirGrid occupies the space in the middle, completing the jigsaw and delivering the balancing act across the three dimensions, including operations, the market and the network, more commonly referred to as the grid.</p> <p>  While operations and markets are fundamental to achieving the renewable energy target of 70% by 2030 I will focus on the role of the grid in this discussion because it tends to attract the most attention and is the most controversial.  Let us consider demand and generation of electricity.</p><p>To understand the grid, one must understand generation and demand.  Today, we have a mixture of fossil fuel generation, including coal, peat and oil, as well as onshore wind spread across the country.  In fact, we have onshore wind in 80% of counties in the Republic of Ireland.  As we transition to 2030, more onshore wind will be required in most counties, solar generation will be developed in the southern half of the country and offshore wind will be developed in the Irish sea on the east coast.  The following questions have to be answered: where is demand going to be located?  What is the optimum balance of renewables technologies?  Where should generation of renewables be located when looked at through the lens of the necessary supporting grid infrastructure?  The grid is what holds the system together.  Our Shaping our Electricity Future programme, which we are discussing, is designed to answer these questions and thus provide a clear picture of our power system in 2030, including setting out the optimum pathway to delivering this future of a power system with 70% of electricity coming from renewable sources.</p><p> To find the optimum grid solution we have distilled a major body of work, which we have been engaged in over the past year and a half, into four fundamental approaches, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.  Before I speak to the four approaches, I stress a number of points.  First, the approaches are not mutually exclusive; it is not about picking one option at the expense of all others.  The issue is more complex than that.  Second, all approaches require significant grid infrastructure &ndash; there are no easy options.  Third, almost every county in Ireland will see some level of impact.  Fourth, the objective of the process we have designed is to find the best solution in consultation with a vast array of stakeholders.  What I mean by the best solution is that it delivers the objective of 70% by 2030, and it does so at an acceptable cost.</p><p> I will briefly go through the four options.  The first option is called "generation-led" and the concept is that Government policy would inform where electricity generation will be located, particularly with reference to where demand for electricity is high and where the grid network is strong.  The second option is called "developer-led", which is the current approach.  I must emphasise that the current approach has served us well in getting us to in excess of 40% renewables on the power system last year.  The third option is called "technology-led".  It is somewhat more radical, using technology that is deployed on offshore wind farms to move large volumes of electricity across the country to high demand regions.  The fourth option is called "demand-led" and involves Government policy informing where large demand users might be located, particularly with reference to strong grid infrastructure and adjoining renewables generation, thus moving away from a Dublin-centric emphasis, which is the way things have developed in the past.</p><p> I refer to engagement.  We cannot achieve this ambition on our own.  We need support across a vast range of stakeholders, but particularly in the community and political domains.  We launched Shaping our Electricity Future on 8 March last and so far the response has been positive and very measured.  It has been genuinely inquiring as people seek to understand what the future will look like and what voice they can have in that future.  This all-island engagement programme will do four things.  It is reaching deep and wide, both at national and regional levels, involving more than 20 set piece events.  It is highly transparent.  The high-level document in plain English runs to 20 pages and the detailed technical document runs to approximately 200 pages.  It is backed up by a major communications programme, national, regional, local, radio, newspapers and social media.  It is be underpinned by a real commitment on the part of EirGrid to listen to all views.</p><p> I will summarise my message.  Enhanced electricity generation using renewables is at the centre of EirGrid's approach.  This transformation will have a significant impact across the country and will impact every county.  Our engagement process will reach into all levels of society and business across the country, North and South.  We have options, but all options include unpopular choices.  Shaping our Electricity Future will provide the roadmap to deliver the policy objective of 70% renewables by 2030.</p><p> I and my colleagues will be delighted to take questions from the members.</p></speech>

While we are figuring out the order of the members raising their hands, I will ask about the North-South interconnector, which is a critical piece in EirGrid's plans.  It will link the Northern Ireland grid with the grid in the Republic.  My understanding is that unless we push through with this we cannot achieve the level of renewables penetration we would like on the grid either in the North or South.  Perhaps you will discuss that, the method of delivery and how you see the project progressing.</p> <p>  Second, I refer to the consultation EirGrid is running until the middle of June, which Mr. Foley mentioned in his statement.  I must praise it for its clarity.  It deserves a wide audience.  I have read the high-level document and I am looking into the technical document now.  I commend him and EirGrid on their efforts to bring this difficult and challenging subject to the wider public.  What type of engagement has taken place so far and how does Mr. Foley envisage engagement continuing through to the end of the consultation in June, as well as beyond?  He mentioned it in his statement, but he might elaborate on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.410" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021042700002#H00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for his acknowledgement of Shaping our Electricity Future because it is probably the most ambitious consultation programme ever undertaken by a State company.  I will ask Ms Collins to speak to that shortly but, first, I will deal comprehensively with the North-South interconnector project.  It has attracted a great deal of controversy and I have been involved in engagements on it as recently as last week.</p> <p>  First, all four approaches in Shaping our Electricity Future assume that the North-South interconnector will be built.  I will frame my answer about this project in three questions.  First, why is this project needed?  Ours is an all-island integrated system, not two systems.  Long before me, people worked very hard to create the exemplar of North-South co-operation, the integrated single electricity market.  We look at the system as an integrated, all-island system.  Second, the current link between Northern Ireland and Ireland is very basic and might best be described in lay language as a modest, single-lane carriageway, to use the analogy of a road network.  It is a line that runs up through County Louth and into County Down.  This very constrained link threatens security of supply, makes the overall system much more expensive and inhibits greater integration of renewables across the island.  Frankly, we are currently moving inexorably towards a two-tier electricity system on the island if we do not address the constraints that are currently in play.  To use the roads analogy, in essence, we need a motorway to link Ireland and Northern Ireland.  This motorway would function like the spine of a body, transmitting very large volumes of electricity traffic between the North and the South and, essentially, enable the island to be truly one and fully integrated as a power system.</p> <p>  The second question is: why is it proposed to be overground?  Alternating current, AC, using overhead lines has been around since electricity was invented 100 years ago.  It is safe and reliable.  It is the universal network approach in every developed country across the world.  Unfortunately, AC lines are very restricted in terms of the extent to which they can be deployed safely and reliably underground.  That limit is currently at approximately 50 km and only when there is real strength in the system at both ends.  This is an undisputed technical fact.  It is a function of physics.  The 50 km is at the absolute upper boundary of what can be achieved.  The North-South interconnector cannot be delivered using an underground AC cable today.  It is close to 140 km long and the enabling infrastructure at both ends is very weak.  It is unlikely that such a length of underground AC cable will be possible for decades to come, if ever.</p> <p>  That brings me to the third question: what about using high voltage direct current, HVDC, underground?  This question is continuously asked of me and my colleagues in respect of a possible alternative to the North-South interconnector.  HVDC involves converting the AC form of electricity into high voltage direct current, transferring it as direct current and converting it back again at the other end.</p><p>This technology is available in many parts of the world.  In fact, it is used by EirGrid on our east-west interconnector with the UK, it is used extensively on offshore wind farms, and it will be used in EirGrid's proposed Celtic interconnector with France, which is to be commissioned around 2026.  This is established technology.  The big "but" is that it is not used anywhere in the world in what I would call the central nervous system of a synchronous power system.  It is always used on the periphery, where the consequences of failure can be managed.  It does fail because of its complexity.  It will fail and, therefore, it cannot be relied on in the mission critical environment of our all-island power system.  To be clear - when I speak about failure and the consequences of same, such a failure is inevitable.  We would see a system collapse in both jurisdictions worse than what happened in Texas recently.</p><p> Speaking as someone with no history with this project - I only took up my office with EirGrid in June 2018 - but who has personally investigated the options, the project is only viable as an overhead AC cable.  There is no viable alternative.  The consequence of not delivering it is that we will effectively end up with two systems across the island with a limited link on the current line.  That will drive cost increases in both jurisdictions, send us backwards in terms of the vision that those who came before us had of an all-island integrated system, and make the job of achieving 70% renewables more difficult because we will almost be doing it as two separate projects in two separate jurisdictions.  These are the honest facts about the North-South interconnector.  There is a great deal of noise about the project and many people are suggesting that A, B and C are possible, but these are the facts.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for indulging me.  It was a long answer, but it had to be that full.  I will pass over to Ms Collins to address the second part of the question on how Shaping our Electricity Future is going, what have we done and what is to come.</p></speech>

We are aware that we are putting a great deal of complex information in front of people, but the outcome will affect communities across the country.  As such, it is critical that we have meaningful engagement.  It is an ambitious all-island engagement programme and we want to make it as inclusive as possible.  It is amplified by media - traditional print and broadcast with a focus on regional media, and social and digital media to increase our reach.<br/><br/>We have been holding a series of workshops and meetings across the country.  They have been online due to Covid restrictions.  We have leveraged our stakeholder partners in the delivery of this consultation.  It has had a positive and powerful impact.  For example, Irish Rural Link is hosting workshops for us with communities across the country.  Chambers Ireland is doing the same with its business membership.  We present at these workshops and answer questions.  The National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, held a series of workshops, culminating in a youth assembly last Wednesday evening that Mr. Foley and Mr. Robbie Aherne from the project team attended.  It was fantastic and well moderated by the NYCI.  The challenge and questions coming back from the group of young people who were assembled were interesting and gave us much to think about.  We had an industry forum the same week.  It was for generation companies, developers and large energy users.  There were approximately 250 attendees.  Over the coming weeks, we will hold a civic society forum that brings together NGOs, academia and agricultural, community and environmental bodies.  We will also hold a public forum that is modelled on the Citizens' Assembly to consider issues of recruitment, demographics, geographical balance and so on.  There has been a great deal of political engagement in the form of meeting local authorities, sometimes before whole councils, sometimes before smaller groups depending on what they request.<br/><br/>We have had more than 80 dedicated stakeholder events at the midpoint of the campaign, covering business, civil society, statutory bodies, farming organisations and various other groups, and there have been more than 100 consultation submissions so far.  We have tried to meet people where they are and give them the kind of information and level of engagement that they want and need.  As Mr. Foley outlined, a great deal of work was done to make the information as accessible as possible.  We worked with our partners in the National Adult Literacy Agency on the language to ensure that it was accessible.  We also have a dedicated consultation portal, <i>consult.eirgrid.ie</i>.  People can go to it and answer a series of questions.  It tries to break down the technical information and make it as accessible as possible.<br/><br/>We are halfway through the campaign and open to whatever suggestions committee members might have about different forms of engagement or other groups that we need to meet.  At the moment, however, we are happy with the level of engagement and response we are getting from groups.  They are really engaged and have given us a great deal of interesting feedback.</p></speech>

We have heard that projects of common interest in the EU would have preferential access to the grid.  Is that the witnesses' understanding?  What measures will ensure that renewable energy will have preferential access?</p> <p>  I am concerned about the context of the four options.  I read the detail of the consultation.  The witnesses have told us that the options are not set against one another, but they seem to be in the way the consultation is framed.  We are told that one option will lead a certain way but that it will not be available if another option is chosen.  There might be a sense of playing different elements against one another.  Will the witnesses give us a reassurance in this regard?  I am particularly concerned that policy is one of the four options.  While this relates to demand and policy driving where projects are situated, it would be good to provide a stronger understanding of the fact that policy is the context within which whatever we do will operate, for example, our environmental protections and so forth.  Marine protected areas are due to be designated.  Do the witnesses anticipate that the part of their map that maps out where they expect energy will be produced in 2030 will change as a consequence of that designation?  Will their planning respond positively to that or could the two be at odds?  It is positive that there is consultation, but the policy elements that will exist regardless of what drives the locations are important, as are our planning infrastructure and the importance of access to justice.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on the issue of storage?  Are we hitting the right balance currently between investing in storage versus focusing on potential carbon capture technologies?  How can we scale that up?  Do the witnesses anticipate Ireland having a national renewable energy reserve at some future point, perhaps by 2030, to replace our national oil reserve?  Could that happen?</p> <p>  I wish to comment on the question of large energy users.</p><p>Specifically, we are talking about data centres and that is clear from the graphics.  Is there a concern that, if we have heavy demand from data centres, that could affect us reaching the target of 70% by 2030?  What are EirGrid's plans if the requirement moves up?  We have seen the scaling up.  The exit from peat and coal is happening more quickly.  How will EirGrid scale up past 70% if that is required?</p></speech>

I will have to keep them to short answers because quite a number of members are indicating to come in.  I will go to Deputy Carthy before we revert to Mr. Foley and Ms Collins.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021042700002#K00300"><p>I turn back to the North-South interconnector.  As Mr. Foley and the Chair have indicated, it is a piece of infrastructure of critical importance.  I have followed this since 2006, read every publication by EirGrid and engaged in numerous meetings with them.  The assertion in Mr. Foley's opening statement that the engagement approach is underpinned by a real commitment to listening to all views is not the experience of people living alongside the North-South interconnector.  I would go so far as to say that EirGrid's approach to the communities in that region has been driven by arrogance and a refusal to acknowledge that there are any valid concerns or alternatives to their own, despite the fact that the rationale outlined by Mr. Foley as to why this project cannot be undergrounded has changed on a number of occasions since the mid-2000s.</p> <p>  EirGrid has learned some of the lessons on the consultation and engagement process, and we see that in the outcome of the Kildare-Meath line and the consultation process there.  The problem is that it has not learned it in the region of the North-South interconnector.  Why is there a different approach to consultation and engagement for the North-South interconnector line than for other lines?</p> <p>  Second, is Mr. Foley aware of the 2007 independent expert group appointed by the then Minister?  Is he aware that report described the undergrounding using DC technology as "a credible option"?  Does Mr. Foley accept that statement or does he think the expert group was wrong?  Its strongest argument against using underground technology was that it had not been used before to this extent.  If we were to apply that logic, we would never implement or try new technologies.</p> <p>  The third question I have is in respect of the review announced by the Taoiseach into the North-South interconnector.  Am I correct in reading from what Mr. Foley has said that his expectation is that the review will mean essentially nothing, he will carry on regardless and it is a box-ticking exercise?  Does he think there is any potential that the review will lead to a change in tack by EirGrid?</p> <p>  Finally-----</p></speech>

If we accept that this is a critical piece of infrastructure, accept on the other hand that there is unprecedented opposition from landowners, communities and farmers across the length of the route and consider that EirGrid has not yet got planning permission to enter these lands, what will EirGrid do and how far is it willing to go to enter these communities against the wishes of the local populations?  Does Mr. Foley envisage and is he willing to engage in protracted legal battles and enforcing the imprisonment of some of those landowners and communities I have mentioned?</p></speech>

I reassure the Senator that the final roadmap for shaping our electricity future will be a blend of the four options.  The options were laid out to allow the debate and discussion to happen so that we are looking at the potential extremities that will get us to the 70% renewables target by 2030.  We are out and engaging, taking the feedback necessary and listening to ensure the final roadmap we are looking at producing in the autumn will be considered in relation to a blend of the four approaches, which would give us the most economic solution in the timeframe we are looking at.</p> <p>  Storage is part of the solutions we are bringing in, in particular in the operation of the power system.  We have been bringing on storage and looking to connect storage on to the system to give us flexibility in how we operate the system with 70% of our electricity coming from renewable sources.  We are trialling 75% of our instantaneous electricity coming from renewable sources.  That kicked off over the past week or so.</p> <p>  Data centres are part of the ecosystem we have.  In one of the options, Senator Higgins called out that we are looking to move large energy users outside of the Dublin region to help in connecting renewable sources and meeting the targets we have.  We see that, into the future, large energy users can be a solution as well as a challenge to us.  It is looking at how they bring solutions to the table that help meet the targets we need to meet.  Government policy needs to look at how that can evolve over the next period in time.</p></speech>

Environmental solutions are part of what we do.  It is one of the key criteria when we are progressing any projects and, in this case, progressing the programme as well.

One was an assertion we are using a different approach.  We are not.  As evidenced recently, we have made a decision in Kildare-Meath to put in an underground cable and we have made a decision in the Mayo-Roscommon region to put in an underground cable.  Why are we doing that?  We are doing it because we can.  We can manage to deliver an underground solution in those regions because we are within the constraints of physics in terms of what is possible.  We are not treating Cavan-Monaghan differently.  We are up against the boundaries of physics and we cannot put an AC cable underground for the North-South interconnector.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned a report which stated an underground cable was technically feasible.  That is one thing but is it judicious to put a HVDC cable in the central nervous system of an island's power system?  Absolutely not.  It will fail and, when it does, it will bring the system down in the two jurisdictions.</p></speech>

We are aware of it and will participate in it and offer our views as a key stakeholder in this process.</p><p>That is as much as I can say about the review.  It is a matter for the Government.  EirGrid respects the Government's decision to carry out such a review and we will engage fully.</p><p> The last point referred to the matter which is the subject of court proceedings.  As it is in Northern Ireland we await the outcome of that hearing, which will take place very early in June.

I have questions on pylon procurement and access to lands.  I do not believe Mr. Foley answered the questions on access to lands as raised by Deputy Carthy.  How does EirGrid propose to get access to lands given the community resistance?  Has pylon procurement begun?  What stage is that at?</p><p>On the overall approach to the North-South interconnector in the context of shaping our electricity future EirGrid said:</p> <blockquote> 	We cannot achieve this ambition on our own.  We need support across a vast range of stakeholders, but particularly in the community and political domains. </blockquote> <p>The North-South interconnector is a blueprint of exactly what not to do.  It is deeply insulting for the communities who are watching this to hear from Mr. Foley in his position that EirGrid has the facts and they have a lot of noise.  It actually goes to the root of the problem here.  Will Mr. Foley acknowledge that the facts are disputed?  The facts have changed over the years.  This is the problem and it is fundamental to what is at stake.  The local communities are deeply offended by the approach taken by EirGrid and by the Government.  There is a solution.  It involves real and meaningful engagement, which has not happened to date.</p><p>What role will EirGrid have in the review?  Has contact been made by the Government, by the Department or by the Minister on the review?  In 2006 and 2007, when was it estimated that the North-South interconnector would be operational?  In 2021, when is it estimated that the North-South interconnector will be operational?  To what degree is community opposition taken into account?</p></speech>

Mr. Foley said much of the increase in demand comes from electric vehicles, heat pumps and data centres.  It is true to say that the bulk of it is coming from data centres.  In managing our grid infrastructure, would EirGrid favour a change in the planing regulations?  Dr. Ryan said that he works with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Should our planning regulations not now be taking account of the cumulative impact of data centres on our emissions targets and on our infrastructural capacity?  Would EirGrid favour such a mechanism?  Reference was made to favouring the move of data centres away from Dublin and that EirGrid would certainly support that.</p> <p>  A report by the Irish Academy of Engineering in 2019 said an estimated &euro;6 billion investment in the infrastructure would be required to support the influx of data centres.  How can we ensure it is not the public purse that picks up the cost of that infrastructural investment and that the data centres that require such critical infrastructure carry the burden of this cost?  What are the options to prevent more gas-powered generators coming on line, in line with the data centres?</p> <p>  I have a final question for Mr. Foley on the importance of the single electricity market and that a fully independent market in the North would likely increase the cost of electricity for customers in the North.  Does Mr. Foley have a view on where EirGrid stands on the options put forward in the Northern Ireland Utilities Regulator call for evidence report?  I believe there were four options.  Does EirGrid have a preferred option in that call for evidence?</p></speech>

First, I will go back to the North-South interconnector questions from Deputy O'Rourke.  On access to lands, there is ongoing engagement with local landowners.  That will continue in respect of access to lands in terms of ourselves working with the ESB.</p> <p>  We have procured the designers of the towers.  This has happened and contracts have been awarded to carry out design work.  Procurement notices for the full construction contracts will issue shortly, certainly within the next week or so, in anticipation of a positive outcome from the court hearings.</p> <p>  We acknowledge there is a difference of opinion.  I have been with Cavan County Council and Monaghan County Council in the last two weeks, and I have offered to meet with the North East Pylon Pressure Campaign protest group.  That invitation is out as we speak.  I am very hopeful there can be a discussion between my team and the protest group and that we can try to have a sensible discussion about what the facts are around underground versus overground.  I am looking forward to that engagement because the dialogue will help.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Rourke asked about EirGrid's role in the review.  EirGrid is another stakeholder.  We were not part of the terms of reference.  We have been advised that the process has been kicked off.  We expect a question and answer session to take place, or a submission to be made to the Department, on the basis of some documentation that will be forwarded to us.  We will participate in an open and transparent manner, along with other stakeholders, in that review.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the timeline for the North-South interconnector and that the dates have slipped due to the court hearing.  We are fortunate in the sense that the growth in electricity demand in Northern Ireland has been very flat over the past years post-recession and continues to be so.  To some extent, this has helped us by not making the situation so acute that the lights would go out in Northern Ireland.  We are happy that the current programme, which sees completion around 2024, will be adequate in supporting the security of supply needs in Northern Ireland.  I believe I have answered the questions there.</p> <p>  Senator Boylan asked a very important question about data centres and I would appreciate if she would indulge me in trying to get my arms around all of the dimensions she raised.  Should I have said the Member of the European Parliament?</p> <p>  The data centres are a big part of the Irish economy today.  That is a fact.  The most recent report from IDA Ireland, as I understand it, on the economic benefits of data centres suggest the overall economic benefit is approximately &euro;7 billion to the Irish economy.  This is not inconsiderable and is something we should be conscious of.</p> <p>  Let us acknowledge the fact that we are living and experiencing the most spectacular social experiment in human history where millions of us are working from home.  Thanks to the information and communications technology sector, I currently have 600 staff working seamlessly from home today.  I have been working from home for nearly 15 months.  Data is the currency of the 21st century so it is absolutely critical to business.  The reality is that data permeates every aspect of our lives, including the social and the non-working element of our lives.  It is ubiquitous and part of everything that happens from the time we get up in the morning to the time we go to bed.</p> <p>  In Ireland we must ask ourselves a number of key questions.  I will pose those questions and maybe give the committee some of the thinking that EirGrid is sponsoring at the moment.  What road do we see for data centres in the Irish economy over the next decade and beyond?  It appears that they will continue to play a central role because they are so important to the economy and to society.  What level of growth can be reasonably accommodated?  We have to ask this question.  Where can this growth be accommodated?</p> <p>  One will see from the four options we have presented that EirGrid brought up the possibility of high-demand centres being located not in the Dublin area but in the regions, to be less impacting.  How should it be accommodated and what should the rule-set be?  Should there be a pecking order for firm capacity, for example?  Should we reward those who deliver on their promises?  Should those who have a track record get preference?  What price or risk should be borne by the developers?  Is it time to start asking developers of data centres to bring some part of the solution such as on-site low-carbon generation?  We pose those questions with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and with the Department with a view to a new framework that would inform the growth and development of data centres into the future.</p><p>I hope that has answered the question from MEP, Ms Lynn Boylan. </p></speech>

I read the four options outlined in the presentation.  There is an acceptance that this transition will be costly financially, and will also be costly to communities and the environment.  It is not a no risk or no impact solution.  I thought our first port of call would have been to minimise those costs.  I am surprised that there is no mention of demand management in the document.  The document referred to four questions.  Surely the first question should be how we can manage the demand for electricity, including renewable electricity, because of the costs of generation and transitioning.</p> <p>  Data centres will be a huge cost to us.  I accept the point that they are part of how we live at the moment and have a function within our economy.  However, if we expect data centres to move to provide their own generation capacity on site, are we not better off putting a cap on the growth we will allow in the sector?  Such a cap could force changes.  The expectation that we will be able to transition to a low carbon economy while at the same time allowing an incredible increase in demand from a particular industry is a contradiction.  </p> <p>  I hope that the first port of call is to ask what level of demand we will accept because there will be a cost to all this, financially and environmentally.  Surely we should impose a cap on large users.  What is Mr. Foley's opinion on that?  Where does demand management come into play in the proposal?  Should there be a cap on the amount of energy we allow to be used by data centres?</p></speech>

I know we are limited in time.  I thank Mr. Foley and his colleagues in EirGrid for the presentation.</p> <p>  I understand an estimated &euro;50 to &euro;75 million worth of electricity goes to waste each year when wind turbines are powered down or energy is dumped because more has been produced than can be used.  I raised this issue with the Wind Energy Ireland representatives earlier.  The Minister, Darragh O'Brien, launched a new initiative with Cl&uacute;id Housing, in partnership with EnergyCloud, which allows for excess energy to be used to heat hot water and homes and alleviate the risk of fuel poverty - about 460,000 households are at risk of fuel poverty across the country.  About 50 houses in the Cl&uacute;id scheme are using EnergyCloud.  What are the thought of EirGrid on utilising that excess energy across the grid?  Does it view it as a realistic option that could be rolled out with local authorities?</p> <p>  I refer to point one of the summary.  In terms of electricity security for the island, how does Mr. Foley envisage the threat to that?  Are there any blackspots across the grid currently?  He said the grid generally talked about "most".  Where are the most prevalent blackspots, i.e. threats to electricity security across the island?</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  On the grid generally, one hears different stories about the difficult situation it is in at certain points.  Some large electricity users are concerned that there is the potential for outages based on current demands.  There is also a recognition that some gas generating compressors are working off grid in order to provide it with the appropriate level of electricity.  If that is the case, in addition to what EirGrid has to do to bring on additional technologies and meet the demand from renewables, is the existing grid network, in particular on the east coast, at capacity?  Could the witnesses tell us about its status?</p> <p>  In the constituency Deputy Crowe and I represent, an organisation received planning permission to erect a wind turbine about ten years ago.  It was only erected in the past number of weeks and has subsequently been adjudged by the council to be in breach of its planning conditions.  A directive has been issued by the county council for the wind turbine to be removed.</p></speech>

In light of the announcement earlier this month, does that have enough capacity?  Is there a need to upgrade the facility?  The 400 kV lines were state-of-the-art infrastructure in the 1990s.

We know there can be future developments.  One key element for me is that the cleanest and greenest megawatt is the one that is not used.  Therefore, we need to think about how that can be brought out more.  We are trying to plan for the system knowing the demand we are forecasting, which, as Mr. Foley said earlier, is up to 50%.  If it is less than that, it will make the target more achievable within a shorter timeframe.</p><p> We would like to work with the Government and the Department on the cap Deputy Whitmore mentioned and on how caps may be brought onto the system.  The solution we have proposed is potentially to move some of the demand outside of the greater Dublin region to facilitate the connection as much as we possibly can, knowing, as Mr. Foley said earlier, that it is a key part of the ecosystem and the other benefits back to society, and noting the concerns Deputy Whitmore mentioned earlier.</p><p> Moving on to Deputy Devlin's questions, EirGrid is working very closely with Cl&uacute;id Housing and EnergyCloud on that endeavour.  We see that as a potential opportunity to utilise the energy that is curtailed and constrained off the system.  The curtailment is coming because we are world-leading and at times we cannot operate the system.  We have too much generation on the system, more than we can run on it and, therefore, we are now moving that up, moving to 75% instantaneous and going above it.  We see unlocking that demand potential as a real solution to that.</p><p> I am trying to answer the questions very quickly.  Deputy Dooley's related to outages on the grid.  As we are operating the grid and minimising building new infrastructure, we have to take part of the existing grid out to operate it, make it stronger and modernise it more in order that the future generators and demand customers can connect onto it.  That is part of evolving the transmission system of how we do it.  Also, we see that some energy users are growing more quickly than the infrastructure can be built.  It takes a number of years to build infrastructure and, therefore, during that period some of the large energy users are putting solutions in place which allow them to grow it at the rates they want to grow it while we are developing the system.</p><p> The final point that was raised related to wind farms in various jurisdictions.  Unfortunately, I do not have the knowledge on that specific project to hand so I cannot comment on it.</p><p> I think I have covered most of the-----</p></speech>

Today the committee will engage with the Minister for Finance on the draft stability programme update.  I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and Mr. John McCarthy, assistant secretary at the Department of Finance.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references the witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and the statute by absolute privilege.  If witnesses are giving evidence remotely, however, from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  The witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise of make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If a witness's statement are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, by name or in such a way to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place that Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I now ask the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.464" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021042700002#A00400"><p>I thank the Chairperson.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to be here today to discuss the draft stability programme update, SPU.  The SPU sets out the Government&rsquo;s macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for Ireland for the next five years.  It will be submitted to the European Commission later this month.  At the outset, I stress that this is a purely technical document, with the projections based on existing Government forecasts and decisions.  In accordance with the requirements under EU legislation, the macroeconomic forecasts set out in the SPU have been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.</p> <p>  The speed and scale of response to the supply and demand shocks created by the pandemic have been the theme of the Government&rsquo;s economic response.  Since March last year, we have moved rapidly, using the strength of our public sector balance sheet, to replace lost private sector demand in order to ensure that firms, workers and incomes were supported and protected through wage subsidies, deferrals of tax liabilities, and income supports.  Our overarching objective has been to support households and firms, as well as to limit the permanent effects of the pandemic.</p> <p>  As we look towards a cautious reopening of the economy over the weeks and months ahead, it is clear from the stability programme update that the relationship between economic activity and public health restrictions has weakened over each wave of the pandemic.  Certain sectors of our economy have been better able to adapt to living with Covid.  The adaptability and innovation shown by businesses is borne out by the high frequency, real-time economic information published by my Department, which shows that the impact of the current set of restrictions is around half that of last spring.  Much of this is due to the flexibility of our domestic enterprises.  Firms and consumers have innovated and adapted.  Last month&rsquo;s VAT data, up 8.5 % on the first quarter last year, shows that people have altered their behaviour.  They are buying local and buying online.</p> <p>  As we all know, however, the pandemic has not impacted everyone equally.  Those in contact-intensive employment have suffered the most, while many others, especially those with the ability to work from home, have had very little or indeed no reduction in income and are as well off as before.  Equally, those who have continued to work have continued to pay income tax and many businesses that have been able to operate through the public health restrictions continue to pay corporation tax.</p> <p>  The strength of these revenues, as well as the extraordinary easing of monetary policy by the ECB, have enabled the Government to support jobs, incomes and businesses throughout the crisis.  This is only right, as the huge impact of the pandemic has demanded a forceful response from the Government.  This is what we have done.</p> <p>  The overall budgetary strategy remains one of providing strong, counter-cyclical budgetary support to the economy.  With a value of almost &euro;38 billion, or nearly one fifth of national income, the budgetary support provided by Government has been extraordinary.  We are in a position to do this because of the supports of the ECB and the support for our public finances over recent years.  The total value of payments paid to date under the Government&rsquo;s three main support schemes, the pandemic unemployment payment, the employment wage subsidy scheme and the Covid restrictions support scheme, is now &euro;13.5 billion.  We have spent more than &euro;7 billion on pandemic unemployment payments and around &euro;5.5 billion on wage subsidies.  While the response has been appropriate and necessary, the cost continues to be significant.  Last year, a general government deficit of &euro;18.5 billion, or 5% of GDP, was recorded.</p> <p>  In the medium term, the speed at which the economy can recover will depend on our vaccination efforts.</p><p>This was a constant theme, for example, in the recent IMF and World Bank meetings.  They are the cornerstone of our domestic recovery.  The programme is now being accelerated over the coming months.  Of course, there will be week-to-week fluctuations and day-to-day challenges but the bigger picture is clear; we are on track to vaccinate a large majority of the adult population of our country by the end of this quarter.  This in turn will allow for a more significant easing of containment measures over the summer, and with that a sustainable recovery can begin.</p><p> A conditioning assumption underpinning the projections in the SPU is that low levels of public health restrictions will be in place in the second half of the year, with minimal restrictions next year, which should allow economic activity to normalise.  However, it is likely that this normalisation will be somewhat different from the pre-pandemic norm.</p><p> Based on this scenario, modified domestic demand, MDD, which is the best indicator of economic trends, is projected to increase by 2.5% this year.  This will accelerate to 7.5% next year.  The release of pent-up consumer and business demand will be the key driver of the economy in the near term.  The recovery in consumer spending is also assumed to be supported by an unwinding of part of the excess household savings built up during the pandemic.</p><p> The cost of this pandemic is, of course, felt most particularly by those who have lost their jobs.  When the number of people in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment is added to the standard unemployment rate, the unemployment rate is projected to average around 16.25% this year, before declining to 8.25% next year.  This level of employment is projected to increase by around 80,000 this year and 225,000 next year, although the level of employment will still remain below its pre-crisis peak until 2023.</p><p> Over the medium term, an important but still open question relates to the extent of any permanent destruction of the economy&rsquo;s productive capacity from the pandemic, the so-called scarring effects.  At this base point, evidence is extremely limited.  The scale of such harm will become clear over time as more data becomes available.  Of course, a key area of focus of our existing policies is to try to minimise that scarring.  A preliminary estimate is that my Department is projecting domestic demand to grow at around 3.5% over the medium term.  This means that, notwithstanding a reversion to trend growth over the medium term, domestic activity would still be lower by the end of the projection period than the level suggested by the pre-pandemic trend, with employment still lagging.  I reiterate that the outlook remains very uncertain - for example, if more stringent health measures are needed for a longer period, the Irish economy could be 4.5% smaller by the end of next year than it would under the main scenario.</p><p> On the fiscal front and on a technical basis, a deficit of &euro;18 billion is estimated for the year.  This is based on existing Government policies.  I repeat, as I said previously, there will be no cliff-edge to our most important supports but any extension to these supports will, of course, worsen our deficit.  This year&rsquo;s deficit will bring our overall debt levels to just under &euro;240 billion, or 112% of national income, measured in a way that strips out some of the bigger influences of larger companies on our national income.  To put this another way, our public debt is approaching &euro;250 billion.  Once the worst of the pandemic has passed, it will be necessary to address this by eliminating our deficit over time in a way that balances supporting the economy with continued sustainable national finances.</p><p> A deficit of just under 3% is projected for next year.  This assumes that beyond 2022 all Covid-specific supports are assumed to be unwound.  With a recovering economy, withdrawal of these supports should be sufficient to better align what we take in and what we spend.  In other words, economic growth via increased tax revenues will be enough to close the gap between what that State earns and what it spends.  There are, however, clear downside risks for our public finances.  In particular, international corporate tax reform could weigh more heavily on this revenue stream than is currently assumed.  Having said that, our public finances are in a better position to absorb the expected shock to revenue than, for example, a decade and a half ago.  Our tax base is much wider than prior to the global financial crisis and, importantly, there is time to build up the resilience of the public finances before international reforms move to the implementation phase.</p><p> Overall, the pandemic has taken a severe toll on our health, our economic health and lives and livelihoods.  However, the continuing progress of the vaccination programme and the collective effort of our country provides reason for optimism.  We entered into this crisis from a position of strength and our economic model has proven its resilience.  Together, we will overcome the pandemic, rebuild our economy and return our people to work.</p></speech>

There was relief last week when he talked about no cliff-edge for Covid-related income supports but in recent days that relief quite quickly gave way, certainly on my part and I suspect on the part of many people out there, to deep concern at suggestions that the PUP payment might be cut in the near future for sectors where there are still large numbers of people unemployed through no fault of their own because of the impact of Covid measures.  I want to get an assurance from him that people who have lost employment and income, as a result of the pandemic, are not going to be further punished because they happen to be in the sectors that are worst hit.  I think it is important to put it that way.  Some sectors have been hit much worse than others and they are going to be the longest impacted, or scarred, by Covid.  The idea that there would be a withdrawal of PUP payments from, for example, taxi drivers, whose industry is on its knees, musicians, arts people, cultural workers, areas linked to aviation, certain parts of retail, and hospitality, and that they would be punished by cuts in the PUP in the short term, when we are still a long way from the recovery of those sectors, would be unacceptable.  I want to get an assurance from the Minister that that is not the case.</p> <p>  I would like the Minister to comment on the reports that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is talking about troika-style monitoring of public service budgets, which is a very alarming echo of the austerity policies that failed us so badly in the aftermath of 2008.  Surely one of the things we have learned from Covid is that in areas like health, ICU capacity, hospital capacity and public health infrastructure, we do not need retrenchment; we need more investment, more spending and more capacity building.  The same can be said about education, higher education and, obviously, public housing and affordable housing.  We do not need retrenchment in these areas.  We need significant increased investment because big deficits in these areas have been further revealed because of Covid.  Again, I want an assurance that that is not the case.  Indeed, I could add climate-resilience infrastructure to that list as it needs significant increases in spending and investment.  Any talk of troika-style retrenchment would be extremely worrying when we need to move in the exact opposite direction.  Perhaps the Minister could respond to those points.</p></speech>

Far from the Government looking to punish any parts of society or any citizens, the approach of the Government has been to sustain society while we have all been grappling with an economic crisis that has its origins in health and public health.  That is why the Government has had the PUP in place for so long.  We have sustained a higher level of income replacement for citizens because we recognise the need to support them at a time of significant challenge and that is what we have done.</p> <p>  What happened last year is the Government looked to begin to change and reduce those payments at the right time, as work became available and the economy began to reopen.  The Government has not yet made any decisions regarding what the nature of the PUP will be later in the year.  However, we will have to make decisions relating to that payment at the right time and look at how we can change it as the economy reopens.  We can sustain emergency levels of expenditure and very high levels of support when we need to and many people do not have the option to work.  However, as the economy begins to, and does, reopen, we will have to begin the work of moving some of the supports that are in place into line with the rest of the social welfare system.  It may be the case that we will be able to sustain some of those payments for longer than we would otherwise be able to do.  This what the Government began the work of doing in the second half of last year but we were not able to complete those changes because, obviously, we were then confronted with further developments within the disease and we reverted to a tiered level of payment on the PUP, with the highest level of payment being &euro;350.  The Government has not yet made any decisions with regard to the PUP but, as the economy begins to reopen and we move out of a health emergency, the very high current levels of spend will have to be considered and we will have to decide what their future will be.  </p> <p>  As regards the arrangements put forward by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, this is not about the changes in expenditure that are associated with a decade ago.  The SPU indicates clearly that, as the economy returns to a degree of normality, the return of growth will do much of the heavy lifting that is required to close the gap between taxation and expenditure.  What the Minister is recognising, and on which I agree with him, is that when we get to a point at which the health emergency is behind us, many of the very high levels of spending we have in place in particular Departments will need to be reviewed and adjusted.  As the Deputy will be aware, our current working assumption is that the emergency levels of expenditure will come to an end at the end of next year.  That is what the processes put in place by the Minister are seeking to do.</p></speech>

The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, will bring a memorandum to Cabinet today.  I am not sure what is in the memorandum, but it certainly raised alarm bells.  It would be very helpful for the Minister for Finance to give reassurances to people, particularly those in sectors where there is likely to be quite a long-term impact from Covid.  I previously referred to taxi drivers.  They will be protesting on Thursday.  Their sector will not recover until the music, entertainment, aviation and tourism sectors recover.  It would be completely wrong to cut their PUP, as it would be to cut the PUP of workers in sectors such as music or entertainment where it is clear they have lost income and employment opportunities as a result of Covid and are likely to be the longest impacted by those factors.  Assurances in that regard would be helpful.</p> <p>  It is not just about the fact that there are emergency Covid payments and public services.  My point was that Covid has revealed significant deficiencies in spending and investment in several areas.  It is important that we do not go backwards, to where we were previously, but, rather, recognise the lessons of Covid.  We need to increase capacity in ICUs, hospital bed numbers and public health teams around the country to name just a few examples.  Similarly, we need investment in schools such as in better ventilation, better quality buildings and smaller class sizes.  Surely these are the lessons of Covid.  Learning those lessons means increased investment and capacity building.  I have given just two examples.  Housing is another I could add.  Any talk of just returning to the situation pre Covid would not be learning the lessons of the pandemic in terms of going to the new and better normal that has been much spoken about.</p></speech>

First, it is due to the support of the European Central Bank, ECB, and, second, when we came into this crisis, what we were collecting in taxation was approximately equal to what we were spending.  Our national finances were in a position of broad balance.  There had been a primary budget surplus since 2014 and we were due to run quite a significant surplus for this year.  All of this was a massive help in the context of funding the significant measures we have had in place during the pandemic.</p> <p>  In the SPU, we are planning to increase current expenditure each year by 3% to 3.5%.  We still plan to increase current spending when we have beaten the pandemic and as we reduce the emergency expenditure that is in place.  We have a plan that shows that, before any decisions are made on top of it, growth alone would help our national finances to achieve much of the recovery and that in the aftermath of that we can continue to increase spending.  It is not just an argument in respect of going back to where we were.  It is about recognising that as we see an improvement in the health situation, we will have to consider how we begin the journey of ensuring that what we spend is approximately covered by what we collect in taxation.</p></speech>

It is a difficult time for everybody but it is obviously so for him in his position.</p> <p>  I am very interested in the issue of the wall of cash to which he alluded in his statement.  The savings of many people have increased during the pandemic.  The concern is that, as we reopen the economy, there may be a spending splurge, which may lead to inflation.  We may see money leaving the country.  People and families may be inclined to go overseas on foreign holidays when they can and the purchase of new vehicles may increase significantly if we do not seek to curb it, if that is the right thing to do.  We probably should seek to stimulate economic activity in Ireland rather than seeing much of those savings go overseas.</p> <p>  For environmental reasons, I am particularly interested in the risk of a significant uptake in the sale of new cars.  The new petrol and diesel cars that are sold this year will be the ones generating emissions in 2030 when we are trying to cut emissions by more than half their current level.</p> <p>  I would very interested to hear the Minister elaborate on the challenge of dealing with the wall of cash, inflation and money leaving the country rather than stimulating economic activity within our borders.</p></speech>

It is a challenge that we will face, as will every other economy that has been closed for a period and is beginning the process of reopening.</p> <p>  In terms of where we are now, if he looks at where we were in 2020, we estimate that our household savings ratio, that is, the portion of income that is not being consumed, reached almost 24% across that year.  That is approximately double where we have been in previous years.  If we look at the comparison between February 2020 and February 2021, there was an increase in deposits of approximately &euro;11 billion during that period so there has been a very considerable increase in savings.</p> <p>  Regarding how much of that will be spent, at what rate and where, the stability programme update has relatively conservative assumptions regarding this.  We are assuming that these savings will be released gradually back into our economy.  Our assumption is that the willingness of families to spend those savings will be dependent on the degree of optimism or certainty they face regarding their own future, particularly in terms of where we are with employment.  </p> <p>  In terms of what we can do to respond to that challenge, the first thing is to see how we can get our economy open in a sustainable way.  There is a way in which these household savings are not facing significant bottlenecks in terms of how that investment can be released into our economy.  Second, we have to consider what we can do to try to encourage that money to be spent in ways that are more conducive to public goods within our economy and the sustainable development of our economy.</p> <p>  To use the issue the Deputy raised of cars, he will be aware of all the changes we made in the latest budget where we fundamentally changed our motor taxation system and also our taxes in respect of the purchase of a car to make it more aligned to public goods and reduction of climate change.  There are policy tools available to us in that particular area, for example, in our old VRT and motor tax regimes, that would not have been available.</p></speech>

There were some very small elements of what it proposed that we did not go with because I had a concern about the proportionality of it but the vast majority of what the TSG proposed in respect of the taxation of vehicles was implemented.  In parallel to that we have expected increases in carbon taxation, which are due to happen in this year's budget anyway.</p> <p>  We have not begun the budgetary process yet in respect of any new decisions that might be made in that area.  As is always the case in respect of a budget day decision, although I am perhaps saying it earlier in the year than I have previously, we have not made any decisions on this and any decisions will have to await budget day.  I am conscious that we made some very fundamental changes in this area very recently and I will want to see how those will bed in and affect behaviour.  There are some positive signs that the Deputy will be aware of that they are having an impact in terms of the kind of vehicles being purchased but we barely have a quarter worth of data under our belt yet.</p></speech>

We have had a clash with the finance committee which the Taoiseach was appearing before.</p> <p>  I want to talk to the Minister about the Covid-related expenditure.  The SPU points out that of the &euro;12 billion Covid-related expenditure available in 2021, only &euro;2.5 billion will be available in 2022.  Can he outline what will comprise the &euro;2.5 billion that will continue in 2022?</p></speech>

The Government has not yet made a decision on the composition of that.  That will have to be made on budget day.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will have to engage with different Ministers regarding the composition of that for next year.</p></speech>

Currently, we have only made decisions on the PUP up to the end of this year so any decision on the payment for the rest of this year and even for next year will change those figures.</p></speech>

That is the case.  The Deputy is correct with regard to employment.  My expectation is that inside the &euro;2.5 billion there would be figures that relate to health.  That is a matter directly for the Minister, Deputy McGrath, but I will double-check that with him and confirm it for the Deputy.</p></speech>

He set out a plan to cut it in January and again in subsequent months.  We disagreed with that plan but regardless of the political decision the plan was abandoned as we saw how Covid got a grip on society.  It appears now that the plan is about to be refloated in the second half of the year.  Is that the case or is it scaremongering?  Will the PUP continue for the remainder of 2021?</p></speech>

We have said we want to provide clarity on income and business supports in the coming weeks.  We have not made a decision on that but it is the case that over time, as our economy reopens, we will have to change these payments in a very careful way.  For example, getting our national finances back into a healthy position and recognising that we have a debt of &euro;250 billion means that as our health situation improves we will have to consider the future of some of the emergency supports we have had in place.  We did that last year.  The Deputy disagreed but if and when we get to a better place regarding public health, the Government will have to reconsider them.</p></speech>

Taking the traditionally unemployed total of 128,000 out of it, it will leave approximately 130,000 Covid-related unemployed.  Some of those sectors potentially will still not be able to return to work because of public health guidelines.  I am thinking of those who worked in areas such as tourism, aviation, where there are mass gatherings and so on.  There was a commitment given in the past that their payments would not be cut as long as Government decisions basically prevented them from returning to their job.  Does that commitment still stand?</p></speech>

That is what we did last year and the Government will have to carefully consider how we do this across this and next year.  We are not in a position to continue to maintain very high levels of emergency expenditure as our economy is successfully reopened, which is what we are looking to do.</p> <p>  If the Deputy is looking for a commitment from me that the PUP will continue to be around in an unchanged way, I cannot give it.  If he is looking for a commitment that any changes we look to make on it will be made in a careful way and that we will look to integrate it with how we manage the public health of our country, that is absolutely what we will look to do.</p></speech>

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council says this only covers wage inflation, inflation and demographic pressures and does not deal with Government priorities.  I take that as an acceptance that it will be beyond 3.5%.  The Minister has said in the media that 3.5% is prudent and in line with the growth trajectory of the economy.  Given that this 3.5% growth in expenditure does not cover many of the programme for Government commitments, where does the Minister think expenditure growth needs to go?  Would he be satisfied with 4.5%, 5% or where is his thinking on this?  Does he accept it will be higher than 3.5%?</p></speech>

Second, it depends on the Estimates process and the work the Minister for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform does.  That work is yet to be done but I expect it will be higher than 3.5%</p></speech>

This has been an unprecedented 12 to 15 months we have lived through. To say we have given out &euro;13 billion in PUP and wage supports is a statement in itself.  The only good thing about that is that money is going to people rather than to corporations or whatever.  It is, and will be, in the economy because people will have money and they are paying their bills to keep going.</p> <p>  Looking at where we are and where we are going, there are a few questions.  We talk about investment and about housing and technology being two places where investment is very much needed.  I had a discussion this morning locally in a Zoom meeting about housing, the dysfunctional nature of it and what solutions we can put in place to make housing one of the triggers to economic recovery, as well as providing much-needed homes.  There is a lot of talk about affordable housing, social housing and whatever else.  The important thing is that the private housing market is not working at the moment.  I believe the cost of building a house has gone up substantially in the past number of years due to the fact we want to build a better standard of house.  We are looking at having a house that is more passive and uses less energy.  Long term, we will get the benefit from that, but the initial capital cost for developers or anybody building a house is added to considerably.</p> <p>  As well as that, a large volume of housing is not occupied in towns and villages and for which we are not taking any regard, in terms of the help to buy scheme or the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  For instance, with the help to buy scheme, if it is a second-hand house, the buyer will not qualify for support.  For first-time house buyers, it is imperative we get young families back into towns and villages and give them the same chance as if they were buying a new house.  A large number of houses lie vacant in our towns and villages and it would not cost the same as building a new house.  We seem to be dead against the idea of supporting that in a real, tangible way.</p> <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme will only support the purchase of a house.  It will not support the refurbishment the buyer will have to carry out on a house.  For example, someone could buy a house in a village for &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 and put in another &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 to have a modern living space in a town or village for a family, as opposed to spending &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000 on a new house, including buying a site, building a house, etc.  There seems to be a lack of commitment to that. </p> <p>  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland lately, in a presentation on the cost of building apartments in Dublin, stated that more than 70% of the space in Dublin over ground floor retail is vacant.</p><p>That is a great deal of space that could be used for people to live in, and one might ask why we are not taking it up rather than being driven mainly to support only people who are buying or building new houses.  If we are to get the economy to grow and grow, while at the same time increasing the potential for people to work in a blended way in the regions, towns or villages, that is important.  In the previous Government, it was a battle at times but we got the national broadband plan in place, which has proven to have been a very solid decision at the time.  If there is any way in which we can accelerate the programme, we should do it.  It is only in the past year that people have realised how much they are missing out on broadband.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.501" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021042700002#F00200"><p>On the Deputy's second point, the Government will do what we can to speed up the delivery of the national broadband plan.  The Deputy and I were involved in that decision in the previous Government and time has proven it to have been the correct decision.  I understand that the difficulty in speeding it up is related not to funding or even to the contract but rather to the impact of the public health restrictions and the fact that they have not allowed the work needed for this project to go ahead.  I hope our exiting public health restrictions will allow that work to accelerate.</p> <p>  On the question regarding the help to buy scheme and whether it should be made available to existing properties, there are inflationary challenges and risks with such schemes.  The way in which we have prevented those risks developing is by making the scheme contingent purely on the building and completion of a new home.  We have tried to make that policy focus as much as possible on the delivery of additional supply.  My concern is that if we were to focus such schemes on existing housing stock, although I think the Deputy is suggesting buildings that might require work in order for them to be liveable, it would not have as great an impact on the release and creation of new homes.  It would mean doing work on structures that exist or even on existing homes, and I do not believe that is the route this scheme should go down.</p> <p>  On the other hand, the Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and Darragh O'Brien, through the rural regeneration and development fund, have been making grants available to towns and villages throughout the country to put in place plans that allow homes to be delivered in towns and villages.  I think that is the way we should do it and I understand it is the way we are doing it, namely, by servicing land and sites in the centre of towns to allow homes to be either completed or delivered there.  That is the best way of delivering the priority the Deputy outlined, which I share.</p></speech>

They are derelict structures in towns and villages, and young people are willing to get involved in them and take on the challenge of doing them up and living in those towns and villages.  There is no incentive for them to do that, however, and in some cases, services such as sewerage may not be there.  This would not add to inflation.  The Minister stated he wants to increase the supply of housing, and this is one of way of doing so and at the same time rejuvenating towns and villages.  The schemes currently in place through the Departments of the Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and Darragh O'Brien, are there to provide public areas and public realms and buildings, but there are private properties too and people just need a bit of an incentive.  I think it would be a game changer.</p> <p>  The next issue I want to raise, in the context of future budgets and the NDP, relates to construction cost inflation.  It has been reported that because we closed the construction industry, we have lost up to 40,000 people who have gone to the UK to work.  We need to get them back.  They are people with skills such as engineers, project managers, quantity surveyors and so on as well as skilled labourers.  When we come to implementing the NDP and try to regenerate the economy through capital expenditure, the level of inflation in construction may be different from that of overall consumer price inflation.  There may be a spike in inflation in construction because material prices are increasing as a result of many factors, including the lack of supply of native timber and other resources and the increase in the price of steel, which is a scarce commodity at the moment.  In the context of the NDP and the funding in that regard, we may not get as much buck for our pound as we think we will.  What kind of contingency planning will be done to account for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.503" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021042700002#F00400"><p>I absolutely understand we are facing an inflationary risk in the pricing of raw materials, an issue that has been raised with me by businesses.  On the other hand, the great challenge we faced in construction over recent years concerned the degree to which construction was competing with other priorities apart from housing within the economy, such as the delivery of commercial property, the building of hotels and other priorities that obtained at that point.  My expectation, for the short term if not longer, is that in respect of some of the other priorities the construction sector was seeking to deliver ahead of housing, a rebalancing may occur that allows a greater priority to be given to the delivery of housing within the economy.  While I accept there are issues with the pricing of raw materials and there will be issues with how we rebuild the number of workers we will need to get our construction sector up and running again, it is possible that the demand for some of the other things the construction sector has wanted to deliver in recent years may change.</p> <p>  From a capital point of view, we are going to continue to invest heavily in the delivery of homes.  The total level of voted capital expenditure, before the Government adds to it in the coming period, stands at between &euro;10 billion and &euro;11 billion per year.  When the previous Government, of which the Deputy was a member, started in 2016, that figure was between &euro;3 billion and &euro;4 billion.  It has increased significantly and, unlike during the previous crisis, we are not planning to cut back on it.  That will play a very positive role in delivering our priorities in housing and elsewhere.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.504" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1487" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021042700002#F00500"><p>I thank the Minister most sincerely for taking time out of his busy schedule.  I really appreciate it.  It is very good of him to come before the committee to assist us in our work.  I will try to be helpful in telling him about some of what I have been hearing on the ground.</p><p>I have had discussions with people involved in the tourism sector in recent days.  As the Minister will know, the county I represent, County Kerry, is the premier tourism capital of Ireland and of the world.  The hoteliers and all the business people have told me they are finding it difficult to get employees to fill positions in their businesses.  For varying reasons, they lost their employees during the pandemic.  They redeployed to other sectors that were able to stay operating.  I have first-hand experience of dealing with some projects that were allowed to continue during the pandemic.  For instance, it is ironic that those managing some of the larger public contracts taking place throughout the country are also finding it difficult to get people with the varying skill sets required to work on the ground.  I am telling the Minister this because as Minister for Finance I genuinely want him to hear it.  I am only saying it to be helpful.  I presume he knows it already.  Deputy Canney rightly highlighted in his excellent contribution what is currently happening in the housing market as a result of the cost of materials having greatly increased.  I would make a special plea to the Minister on behalf of the Rural Independent Group which, as he will know, has flagged the issue of VAT imposed on insulation material.  We are encouraging the owners of private houses and businesses to insulate their homes and the places where we work to conserve energy and thereby reduce fuel bills.  It is a big disincentive for the State to charge VAT on those goods.  I would be worried about that.  The Minister might closely examine that area when future budgets are being adopted.  </p><p> In recent days, I have outlined my concerns about the timing of the introduction of carbon taxes and what they will mean for every man, women and child.  I hope the Minister heard those concerns.  All of us are interested in protecting the environment.  I appreciate we are all only custodians of the environment but we cannot cripple people with taxes.  I believe in and adore democracy.  I appreciate and fully respect the right of people to vote for whoever they want to elect to different positions.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for a person who gets to the position of being a Minister, and in particular a Minister for Finance and all that entails.  However, I am worried about the future in that we are giving control of carbon budgets to a group of people who are not elected and were not put into their positions by anybody in the public domain.  I have grave concerns about that.  If we as legislators are entitled to vote at budget time that is fine, and we live in a democracy.  If other Deputies vote through a measure that I do not like, my attitude is that is fine because that is democracy.  However, I am concerned when I see a group of disciples being brought together.  We are being told that this group will tell the Irish people in future how much tax they will pay in terms of carbon tax and what areas will be affected.  I have no problem with the Minister for Finance introducing a budget and our voting on it but my God if we are going down the road of unelected people having a say in the future finances of our people, I would have grave concerns about that.  I must put that on public record.  It would be wrong of me to say it in other forums and not to say it in front of the Minister.  </p><p> I sincerely thank the Minister for his work.  I acknowledge he is in his ministerial role at an extremely difficult time.  I respect work and people I see working and doing their jobs.  I know the Minister is doing that.  I might not agree with everything he does or with what his Government does but I appreciate the reasons he does it.  I also appreciate the reason those in government think every decision they make is perfect and right, but I would not agree with all of those all the time.  A number of sectors of society have been closed for a long time.  I would not have agreed with that decision but what is done is done.  As a representative of those people, be they people involved in different areas of hospitality, hairdressers or beauticians, I know they are not happy.  The fact that people were not allowed to go mass and up until today only ten people were allowed to attend a funeral has greatly upset many people.  While those in government might have thought they were acting in the best interest of the health of the people, they alienated themselves from many people because people did not agree with what they were doing.  I thank the Chairperson for the opportunity to make that contribution and I will stay quiet now.</p></speech>

Does the Minister wish to respond?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.507" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021042700002#G00300"><p>I will indeed.  I thank the Deputy for his contribution.  The first thing I would say is that I never pretend for a moment that any decision I made is perfect.  All I can do, which I do my best to do, is weigh up the pros and cons of every decision.  I make a decision motivated by the public good and then justify that decision to the Oireachtas and to our country.  It is in that spirit I will quickly deal with the different points the Deputy made.</p> <p>  First, on his point on carbon taxing and his concerns, I assume, regarding the new carbon emissions reduction legislation that has been brought forward by the Government, he would be the first person to make the case for the beauty of the countryside in Kerry, its environment and its biodiversity.  That legislation has been brought forward by the Government with the aim of being able to protect that or minimise the harm to it for the all the generations to come and even for this generation.  That is what has motivated the legislation that has been brought forward.  Decisions on carbon taxation will always be decisions that are made with respect to the finance Bill by the Oireachtas and the Minister for Finance.  If the next D&aacute;il is unhappy with the decision-making process that has been brought forward in the Bill from the Government, the democratically elected members of that D&aacute;il can change the structure of that decision making if they so wish.  The structure that has been brought forward by the Government to deal with the issue of carbon budgets is the subject of legislation, which in turn depends on the consent of the democratically elected members of our Oireachtas.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's point regarding VAT on insulation materials, I cannot give any commitment about that but I will certainly have a look at it and consider it in terms of decisions that will be made later in the year.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's final point on the hospitality sector and the difficulty employers face in potentially getting their staff back to reopen our hotels, restaurants and so on, I am aware of that challenge.  It has been being raised with me directly in the context of employees who have moved from one part of our economy to another.  In some cases, employees have left our country and now face the challenge of getting back into the country.  We will have to consider those issues in terms of how we can reopen our economy in a sustainable and safe way.  At the heart of the employment challenges those in the hospitality sector face is they being able to indicate credibly to those returning to work in hotels and restaurants that they will be working in hotels and restaurants that have every prospect of being able to stay open and not be closed again.  That is what the Government is trying to do.  We want to ensure that what we reopen we can keep open and that we can have public health policy in place that will allow businesses to stay sustainably open as opposed to having to close and our having to shut them as we have done during the last year.  I am aware of the concerns the Deputy has raised.  That is why we are hoping to safely and sustainably open new parts of our economy to create more certainty regarding continuity of employment within them.  That in itself is difficult, which is why the decisions we are making at the moment are very finely balanced.</p></speech>

I will ask about pensions.  Can we ensure that every older person who has been resident in Ireland will receive full pension payments?  We know the current system is not working in that regard.  Can we dramatically reduce the bureaucracy by having only one test for assessing payment and eliminating the very complicated conditions that are a part of the current systems?</p></speech>

Perhaps she can explain the issue to me a little more as our session goes on.  I am not aware of all of the detail regarding the relationship between residency and qualifying for an old age pension in our country.  I know what the criteria are for a contributory pension, non-contributory pension and so on.  I am aware of that.  Perhaps the Deputy would explain further her concerns about residency.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is making different decisions to look at how we can support those parts of society in the important work they are doing.  If the Deputy has any particular priorities or views as to how that should be done, it would be helpful for me to be aware of them.</p></speech>

Deputy Canney spoke about housing.  Many people who do not qualify for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan come to my office because they are not first-time buyers.  Some of them are in second-time relationships and earn slightly above the threshold for social housing.  Those people are falling through the cracks.  Are there any plans to address their needs?  Is it possible that we could harness some of the power of the substantial savings that are out there with some sort of housing bond that could help our councils to build more social housing?</p></speech>

The funding for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has significantly increased to allow our local authorities to build more housing directly.  The Land Development Agency will begin its work mainly in Dublin.  It is looking to find ways in which it can deliver affordable housing at a greater scale than has been possible in our country to date.  In short, the way in which we are looking to meet the need to which the Deputy referred is through the amount of money that we are making available to our local authorities for them to directly build housing.  As the Deputy knows, our local authorities have been open for longer than would have been the case with the private sector for the delivery of privately-owned homes in recognition of the issue the Deputy is raising.</p></speech>

In some cases, homeowners looking for something as simple as new windows or doors might get the front windows done this year and the back ones done next year.  Can the Minister see an improvement around budgets in the near future in that regard?</p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy is familiar with that issue from her local authority.  That funding has increased.  I am most familiar with the housing work of Dublin City Council, which has put considerable effort into void conversion and I believe that work is going well.  There is always a case to be made for trying to put more money into this area and I know that is a case that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is pressing at the moment.</p></speech>

While Deputies are organising themselves, I will ask a quick question.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke a little bit about the challenge of writing the stability programme update, SPU, this year because of the degree of uncertainty and the dynamic situation in which we are living, including the reliance on vaccines, etc.  My question relates, selfishly, to the operation of this committee but also to other fiscal bodies that will be looking at what the Government is doing.  One of the matters that has been raised at our committee is an issue around scenario analysis and planning.  We are projecting a certain amount of growth but, obviously, we are not entirely sure whether that growth will be as we project it.  We are not entirely sure, even with pronouncements from President Biden on tax changes, what companies will do in terms of corporation tax.  We do not understand growth in the medium term or what either higher or lower revenues will do to our decision-making processes.  In terms of oversight for committees such as this, fiscal bodies or the work of the Minister, is there scope to improve scenario analysis or planning for the Government and those of us who are reading reports?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.527" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021042700002#H02000"><p>This is covered off in the stability programme update that I know the committee has considered.  We get into the issue of trying to look at different scenarios that our economy could face in that update.  In particular, we look at what different scenarios relating to the spread of the disease could mean for our economic forecasts.  The scenario analysis we have done here is more advanced than we have had to do in recent years.  We cover off the different risk assessments and risk matrices in tables Nos. 17 and 18 in the stability programme update.  My view is that limitations in our modelling are not preventing these scenarios being more detailed.  It is, rather, limitations in our ability to forecast and the uncertainty of future developments.  If our scenarios are in any way insufficient for the committee, it is not due to the challenges that we have with modelling and the models available to the Department of Finance, but it is a reflection of the fact that so many things could happen in the future.  We have to make reasonable assumptions regarding the most likely things and, on the basis of that, make our forecasts.  For those who believe our forecasts should be more accurate and sophisticated, as some do, I ask for their help as to how we can form a better view of what the future may hold.  We have seen how unpredictable it is over the past year.</p></speech>

I am still getting slightly conflicting signals from the Minister and would like to get a bit of clarity on the PUP.  Some sectors will, of course, recover,  As public health restrictions are lifted, people will be able to go back to work and they will not be on the PUP, so the Minister will not need to maintain it for them.  In respect of continued public health restrictions or the scarring effect on particular areas, a few of which I have mentioned, such as aviation, music, entertainment, certain areas of hospitality and tourism, since people's loss of employment and income results from Government public health policy, can the Minister give an assurance that he will maintain supports for those groups because otherwise he is, in effect, punishing those worst hit by the pandemic?  This would be pretty ironic considering, as the Minister pointed out, some people have not been impacted economically at all and some sectors of our economy and some of the wealthiest people and most profitable businesses have done extremely well during the pandemic.  It would be grossly unfair to pull supports from the worst affected while others have done extremely well in the pandemic.  The Minister should give assurances that he will not do that at any point when the loss of income and employment is not the fault of these people but is a consequence of the pandemic and measures the Government took to address it.  If the Minister does not give this assurance, people will be very angry.</p> <p>  Another question I put to the Minister last week to which I have not received an answer is in the same ball park.  Why has the Government consistently refused to extend schemes like the CRSS and the CBAS, the grant support schemes for people who have ongoing fixed costs that they cannot cover because of loss of revenue, to people who do not have rateable premises?  Those groups have been as badly hit - in some cases, even worse - as those with premises but the Minister has refused to extend the grant support schemes to them.  Again, I refer to musicians, taxi drivers, people in events and so on.  Why is the Government not giving them support when they are some of the worst hit when it comes to covering their fixed costs and when the debts they are accumulating are going to make it very hard for them to recover?</p></speech>

I heard him continually make the case for zero Covid, particularly when we were dealing with the consequences of the third wave in our country.  Given that we have not met the criteria of zero Covid, as he described, I would really be interested in hearing whether he is supportive of us reopening the economy in the way we are doing at the moment.  I am interested in hearing his views on this but I will answer the questions he put to me because he has put serious questions to me.  I am interested in hearing whether he, as a leading proponent of zero Covid, still stands by that view when we have levels of community transmission that are higher than he would have indicated as being safe in respect of our economy reopening.</p> <p>  To deal with the questions the Deputy put to me, because I accept I am before this committee to answer its questions, although I believe in debate and argument on matters, the Government has not made a decision on the future of the PUP but it is a general payment.  It is a payment that we make available to everybody and is at a level that is significantly higher than other rates of job support payments we make available to people, for example, through the jobseeker's payments.  It is significantly higher than that.  As we get to a place where our economy is reopening, we are going to have to make decisions at the right point about what the level of that pandemic unemployment payment is.  What the country will not be able to afford is a situation where our economy has reopened and is approaching a degree of normality and programmes like the PUP, the employment wage subsidy scheme and CRSS are unchanged and still exist in their current format.  That is where the Deputy and I differ.  Over time, as employment grows, I believe our deficit will need to fall to keep our country safe from other challenges we could face.  </p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question on the CRSS, for months in the D&aacute;il, many Deputies called on me to bring in a scheme to support businesses that were required to close due to public health guidance.  That is what the CRSS is.  It is an immensely powerful and successful policy tool and has been acknowledged as such by all those on it.  It will pay out probably over &euro;500 million to businesses that need it most.  I was asked to put in place a scheme for businesses that were required to close.  That is what I did through the Revenue Commissioners and both the Revenue Commissioners and I stepped up to doing that.  We then acknowledged that there were businesses that were not supported by that scheme.  That is why a variety of other schemes were brought forward that look to address the needs referred to by the Deputy.  Schemes like the tourism interruption scheme introduced by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Covid-19 business aid scheme introduced by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment involve tens of millions of euro and try to meet the different needs that are there.  I acknowledge that there are still some businesses and citizens who feel they are not getting the support they need or deserve but we have now spent &euro;12 billion on these different schemes to meet those needs, so I can assure the Deputy it is not for lack of effort or intent on our behalf and we are looking to address the issues to which he referred.</p></speech>

On the point about zero Covid, we would not be in such a precarious situation having to decide between high circulation levels of the virus and reopening after a long period of lockdown if the Government had introduced a zero Covid approach at the appropriate time and not made the mistakes it made in December and January, which have left us in a much more protracted period.  The truth is that there is tremendous fatigue and there will be no stomach for trying to reimpose even harsher restrictions.  However, the Minister should do everything to avoid a fourth wave so there should not be premature accelerated reopening, which could produce a damaging further wave and greater lockdown.  There should be mandatory quarantine to keep the variants from coming in and completely destroying the vaccination programme and the progress that people's hardship has achieved.</p></speech>

If I heard the Minister correctly, his concern is that we would end up effectively renovating homes that are already lived in and not actually reactivating vacant homes.  I encourage him to take this very seriously and to think about it because we have some very good Government policy at the moment between the rural strategy, the town centres dispersed policy being developed and the remote working strategy.  I think there are 200,000 vacant homes spread across the State.  It will not be possible to reactivate all of them but a substantial portion of them could be reactivated as homes, particularly for young families, to bring life back to our towns and villages.</p><p>Perhaps there is a way around the Minister's concerns and we can be creative in introducing some kind of modification of the help to buy scheme so that young people, in particular, are supported in purchasing what are essentially vacant private structures.  The benefits would be entirely positive and align with Government policy.  I would be interested in hearing more of the Minister's thoughts on this suggestion.</p></speech>

My view is that it is a priority.  As he stated, we have good policies in this area in terms of how we develop our town centres, but the way this needs to be implemented will vary in different towns and from local authority to local authority.  For example, if we have homes that are in an exceptional state of disrepair, the family that he is referring to may need more support than they would for a home that had not been lived in for a while and might need less work.  That is the kind of issue that is better dealt with by grants from our local authorities than through varying the help to buy scheme.  If this is the priority that many local authorities assert it is, there are clear opportunities in the rural regeneration fund and the ample funds that are being made available for town centres for some of that money to be reprioritised or diverted local authority by local authority to deal with it.  For example, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, has made more money available to deliver hubs in various towns and villages across the country to take advantage of the roll-out of broadband.  Perhaps local government should accompany that by using a small amount of its money to assist in the rejuvenation of homes near those hubs in a way that is well designed for each local authority area.  That is how it should be done.  It would avoid any inflationary or price pressure risk that could come were we to change the help to buy scheme.</p></speech>

I am sure the Chair will not be slow in telling me if I do.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about a matter discussed by the Committee of Public Accounts recently, that being bogus self-employment.  Our PRSI is low by EU standards.  It will be examined by the newly established Commission on Taxation and Welfare, which has been given a far-reaching remit to recommend changes to the taxes we pay and the entitlements we receive.  Will the commission go beyond headline tax rates and examine areas of avoidance through, for example, bogus self-employment?  If it recommends tax increases, will the Minister accept them?</p></speech>

Any decision on taxation has to reside with the Minister for Finance and the recommendation that he or she makes to the Government.  I will be informed and advised by what the commission will do, but given that it has not even begun its work, it would not be appropriate for me to say that I will automatically accept the outcome of said work.  I will be informed by it and I am sure I will accept many of the commission's recommendations, but I would have to see the work and the commission's output before I decide on whether to accept all of its recommendations.</p></speech>

We have discussed our crisis in credit provision.  We are all aware of the importance of credit in fuelling the engine of the economy.  Having two major fuel sources leave will have an impact.  There have also been discussions - I am not sure whether it was at this committee or the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach - on the role that the credit union sector will play.  We have heard from the sector that it feels it is not able to use all of the resources that could be used.  In recent months, we have heard growing talk of a State-owned lender or public bank.  That would probably be a longer-term strategy.  What are the Minister's views on same?  What role can the credit union sector play in the here and now?  Do some of the regulations need to be relaxed to give credit unions greater powers?  Not only can credit unions play a strong role, but many of the bank branch closures are happening in more rural areas, meaning that a great deal of local knowledge is lost.  That is concerning for local business people in particular.  What role will the credit union sector play?  I would also be interested in the Minister's views on a public bank.</p></speech>

We still have large domestic banks that are well capable of competing with one another to meet the credit needs that our economy will have.</p> <p>  Credit unions will be able to play a larger role in meeting the economy's credit needs in the years to come, particularly in the context of the changes in branch networks.  Those changes are not only happening in Ireland, but in many other parts of Europe as well.  A number of the issues that the credit unions raise with the Deputy and me are the consequence of the regulations that the Central Bank has in place to keep those unions safe and protect them and their members.  I support the independence of our regulator and the decisions it makes in that regard.  That said, we are engaging with the credit union movement.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to reassess the legislative framework for credit unions.  We are doing that work.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and I are working on some proposals in that regard.</p> <p>  Concerning the Deputy's question on the setting up of a public bank in Ireland, I do not support such an initiative for a number of reasons.  First, the level of State involvement in our banking sector at the moment is already advanced.  We are a minority shareholder in one bank and the majority shareholder in two others.  Our starting position is a high level of State involvement from an ownership point of view.  Second, the Deputy touched on non-bank entities such as our credit unions - there is also An Post, which she did not mention but I am sure she would - that are capable of responding to consumer needs that they believe are not being met.  Third, we vowed a decade ago that we would never again build a direct link between the balance sheet of our country and our banking sector.  A public bank is a way of tightening that link and creating new kinds of risk for us in future.  I do not see the case for it.  It would take a long time to do.  Instead, we need to take stock of where our banking sector stands at the moment and determine what our more appropriate policy priorities are in the context of the exit of KBC and Ulster Bank.</p></speech>

At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach last week, we had a discussion on Biden's proposal for a global minimum corporation tax rate, an issue on which the OECD has launched a base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process.  In a recent RT&Eacute; interview, the Minister stated: "I&rsquo;ve been saying this moment has been coming for years; it&rsquo;s now happening, and it will have consequences."  He has stated elsewhere  - I do not recall where - that our regulations on CFCs, transfer of pricing rules, limitations on interest deductibility and so on have been strengthened and will be strengthened further.  Some people would argue that those factors would have given us a competitive advantage.  In light of these potential changes, what preparations is the Minister making to formulate a new industrial strategy to ensure we will flourish?</p></speech>

Irrespective of the impact we will have to deal with, he is the Head of State and Government of the United States.  The Deputy referred to him as "Biden", but we should respect the offices other people hold.  I do, even though the proposals he is bringing forward will create consequences for us.  The election of President Biden is deeply positive for the world and for how we can engage with each other in a co-operative way.</p> <p>  Turning to the substance of the Deputy's question, on the issues relating to CFCs, changes to how we tax hybrid entities and other commitments I have made in respect of changes to aspects of our tax law, I will continue with that because irrespective of the challenges that President Biden's tax proposals may create for us, we will address those challenges in a safer place if we have resolved some of the issues that exist regarding technical parts of our tax law that create opportunities for aggressive tax planning.  I will continue with those policy changes.</p> <p>  As for whether we need a new industrial policy, even though the challenges that could be created by the OECD and by changes in US tax policy will be significant challenges for our country, I believe we have the measure of them.  Our policy strengths, and the strengths we have with regard to education, the diversity of the economy and the breadth of employers that are now in Ireland, both domestic and international, mean we will be able to overcome these challenges and pursue new opportunities.  On the specific tax issue the Deputy mentioned, I will examine, through engaging with the OECD and directly with a number of colleagues in much larger economies, how we can influence an outcome that respects tax sovereignty and the need for small and medium sized economies to be competitive.  That is a large project that will take up a large part of this year. I look forward to updating the Deputy and the committee on it.</p></speech>

If we do not do it, nobody else will do it for us.  The use of the OECD as a means of achieving that objective is to be welcomed.  Is it expected that Ireland's peripheral geographic position in the European Union will be taken into account in a meaningful way in whatever restructuring of taxation policies takes place?  Will sufficient provision be made to ensure that this country has an even chance of surviving in the competitive world of taxation and high finance?</p></speech>

The truth is it will not be automatically given to us.  This is the most intensely competitive area of negotiation one can imagine, and other countries will not wish to afford undue recognition to small and medium sized economies as they make the case for the kind of change they want to see happen.  That is their prerogative and I respect that.  It is up to us to make the case for tax competition within certain parameters being a legitimate policy response to the disadvantages of size or location.  In short, it will be up to us to do that and up to me to make the case for it.  I do not expect it to be automatically recognised by other countries.  They will make the case for their national priorities and it will lie with us to do the same for ours.</p></speech>

Solidarity tends to be in relatively short supply in the context of foreign direct investment and of investment that can build tax revenues within the jurisdiction of each country.  On the case we are making for small and medium sized countries also having the expectation of being able to be competitive, and on the right to determine an economic model within certain parameters that contributes to our competitiveness, many other countries share a similar view.  It will be up to us to work with them to make the case the Deputy and I are discussing.</p></speech>

I will definitely make the case that the issues such as those for which the Deputy has made the case for many decades, as a member of our party and a Member of the House, should be advantageous and should not disadvantage us in the negotiations under way.  We made a significant statement last week on corporation tax policy and the negotiations under way.  The statement was scrutinised throughout the world and has provided a good basis for the political engagement we are having.  It is a really important area for Ireland now.  We have made our case, and our diplomats and I will make the case in the negotiations that will take place before the OECD meets before the summer.

We need to think about the confidence that we have for the future and the potential in the country post Covid to ensure that we get ourselves up and running again.</p> <p>  I am sure the Minister knows about this but I want to reiterate it.  The European Union has downgraded the Northern and Western Region from developing region to region in transition.  The Northern and Western Regional Assembly has made the case that we can receive positive discrimination in getting European funding because we are now in a lesser region.  Taking into account our strategy on remote working, blended working or whatever, we have the potential to develop the Northern and Western Region because it is an area in transition.  We can get a bigger percentage of the structural funding from Europe because we are in a different category.</p> <p>  How can we best do that to ensure that we develop this region and bring it back up again while at the same time creating facilities and infrastructure to attract people to come, live, work and raise their families?  I am not necessarily talking about Galway city.  I am talking about the smaller towns and villages.  It comes back to the point about the vacant properties that are not homes but can and should be homes if we insist.  There is potential to do something positive.  I ask the Minister to outline his thoughts.  I believe we have a fantastic opportunity to get more funding from Europe.  If we have a will there will be a way to do it.  </p></speech>

We need to make the case within the European Union for those areas in which we might be able to get further funding.

We need to provide the projects and then look for the funding.  I imagine the European Union informed the Department of Finance last year that it had reclassified the Northern and Western Region as a region in transition.  It has downgraded it in economic terms due to the lack of funding that had been made available <i>per capita</i>and this is what it has come up with.  I will ask somebody in the Northern and Western Regional Assembly to send that report on to the Minister along with its submission on how we can use this and positively discriminate in favour of the region.  Now is the time to look at that.  We should be aware that instead of getting 40% of funding for projects from the Structural Fund we can get up to 60% funding.  This is how to bring our region back up again.</p></speech>

When, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I worked with the Deputy, I would have been aware of and would have been dealing with issues like that, but it now sits with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, which is why I cannot give the Deputy a more comprehensive answer.  As I have said, I am very happy to look at the report and engage with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, to see if any projects can be put forward for such funding.</p></speech>

Last week I got three phone calls from business people.  One of them who was starting up a new business has invested in property in the region and expects to be up and running with the project in September.  It is a good-news story.  These are young business people in their 30s.  I will be directing them towards Enterprise Ireland which will be able to provide supports.</p> <p>  Another company owner, employing 25 people at the moment, sees the potential to expand that to 50 people.  They are looking at doing that now.  They are not waiting for supports or someone to tell them what to do.</p> <p>  An out-of-work carpenter started to make little pods in his own back garden.  He now has such a demand for them that he is looking for space for his workshop.  There is great potential, but we need to ensure we support them in every way we can through LEOs, Enterprise Ireland etc.  Sometimes Enterprise Ireland is looking towards export potential which may not develop for several years.  I was surprised to get three similar phone calls from three young people who see the potential and want to drive ahead.  There is great potential in indigenous enterprise within the country.  We need to harness that, embrace it and shout about it from the rooftops because it is very important to give other people the confidence to do the same.  </p></speech>

Despite the challenges we are facing, Irish companies are innovating, employing people and growing.  In these debates and discussions, we inevitably focus on the difficulties and areas on which we disagree.  However, one of the reasons the very worst has not come to pass for our economy over the past year has been down to the resilience and innovation of Irish companies and Irish entrepreneurs, the women and men who run these companies and work in them.  We are all working to try to give them the kind of support they need to keep going and to get the success that they deserve.</p></speech>

That fund is a loan that can be given to businesses for five and a half years.  It is administered through AIB.  My understanding is that the money is being made available essentially for free.  However, when the business takes up the offer of the money and does it through AIB, I believe it ends up paying - do not hold me to this - 4% or 4.5%.  Is that not an extraordinary handling fee by a bank that was bailed out by the taxpayers?  If I am wrong in what I am saying, I ask the Minister to correct me because that is my genuine understanding.</p></speech>

We do not make the money available.  That money comes through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  The money is not made available for free to our banks, but at a very low interest rate.  However, the banks then price up on the loan they make available to companies to reflect two things.  The first is the cost to the banks themselves in administering the loan; second is the risk profile of the business to which they are lending.  The interest rate will be higher than the rate at which SBCI lends to the bank.  That is just being driven by the cost of the loan being administered.  It also reflects the risk of the business receiving the loan.</p><p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland loans, and especially the one that is about supporting growth in the future, have been really heavily subscribed and very successful.  It is a loan scheme that is working very well at the moment, despite some of the concerns the Deputy may well have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.575" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021042700002#A00400"><p>The business today is pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of a certain institutional burials (authorised interventions) Bill.  We are resuming our consideration and members will recall we had several sessions on 14 April.  Before I invite the witnesses to address the committee, I wish to put on record that the committee issued an invitation to the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance.  However, a representative of the group confirmed that they are not in a position to attend the proceedings here today.  Witnesses in attendance today in the D&aacute;il Chamber and representing the Collaborative Forum of Former Residents of Mother and Baby Homes and Related Institutions are Ms Alice Coughlan, Ms Amanda Larkin and Mr. Sidney Herdman.  Ms Alice McEvoy was also invited to attend on behalf of the forum.  However, unfortunately, she advised that she had to withdraw from the proceedings.  Witnesses appearing virtually before the committee from a location outside of the Leinster House precinct and representing Aitheantas are Ms. Maree Ryan O&rsquo;Brien and Mr. Rody Ryan, BL, legal counsel for the group.  The witnesses are all very welcome and we are delighted so many could attend our meeting today in regard to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme.  Before we commence the meeting, I want to take this opportunity to thank them for taking the time to prepare their opening statements and to thank those who provided written submissions.</p> <p>  I also want to take the opportunity to set out the purpose of the meeting and how proceedings will be conducted to avoid any confusion during the meeting.  While acknowledging the harrowing experiences of survivors during their time in mother and baby homes and county homes, the purpose of our meeting is to consider the policy provisions of the proposed legislation.  A discussion will take place on the provisions of the general scheme as they relate to the statutory basis and framework under which Government may decide to authorise interventions at certain sites where manifestly inappropriate burials have taken place, associated with institutions operated by, or on behalf of, the State, or in respect of which the State had clear regulatory or supervisory responsibilities.</p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses that they are expected to strictly adhere to the subject matter scheduled for discussion, and any deviation on these matters will be addressed through the Chair.  It is the responsibility of parliamentary committees to consider and discuss topics in a balanced and fair manner.  In achieving this goal, it is the committee, and only the committee, that determines the witnesses it engages with.  This level of engagement will greatly assist the members of the committee in finalising its scrutiny report on the general scheme.</p> <p>  At this point, we always like to highlight the support services available to anyone affected by the matters under discussion today.  The HSE has a dedicated counselling service for former residents of mother and baby homes, and the telephone number is 1800 817 517.</p> <p>  The committee wishes to have a productive public engagement.  However, I must remind witnesses that they should not mention names of individuals or organisations even if that information is already in the public domain, nor should they make charges against anyone by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable.  These are normal parliamentary procedures and exist to ensure that engagements are conducted in a constructive way.</p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I will read out the standard text regarding the provisions of the Defamation Act to remind witnesses of their rights and obligations.  For the witnesses present in the D&aacute;il Chamber, the following will apply: they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For the witnesses appearing virtually, I need to point out that there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if they are directed by me to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, it is also imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  We will move on to the opening statements.  I will call on the witnesses in the following order; Ms Alice Coughlan, Mr. Sidney Herdman, and Ms. Maree Ryan-O&rsquo;Brien.  Ms Amanda Larkin and Mr. Rody Ryan are available to answer questions.  I invite Ms Coughlan to deliver her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am member of the Collaborative Forum of Former Residents of Mother and Baby Homes and Related Institutions, and a survivor &ndash; a mother &ndash; of Bessborough mother and baby institution.  While the members of the forum are pleased that the Bill is setting out a legal framework to address the issue of identifying children and mothers who died in institutions, and to ensure they have a dignified burial, the Bill itself is divisive.  There are members of the forum who are broadly in support of it, and members of the forum who oppose it.  For my part, I support the Bill, though not without reservation.</p> <p>  As a survivor of Bessborough mother and baby institution, and as a mother whose child was taken, I can say from experience that to lose a baby, to not know whether your child is alive or dead, is the worst experience anyone can ever imagine.  I know my child survived, but so many did not, and for far too many women, the question remains.  We have known about the 800 bodies in Tuam since 2017 and yet, four years later, we have made no progress in identifying the children, or in providing closure for the survivors who fear that their child, their brother, their sister, is among the bodies.  Four years later, and these babies have yet to receive a proper burial.  It is for this reason that I think this Bill must pass into legislation as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I am not a legislator and I have no experience in matters of law, so if I am told that a new legal framework is required to ensure that the children currently rotting in Tuam and other institutions are excavated, then I must trust that this is necessary, and ask that anything that can be done is done, that there are no more delays, and that action will finally be taken to rectify what is yet another betrayal of the women and children of Ireland.</p> <p>  This does not mean that I support the Bill wholeheartedly.  I have spoken to other survivors and they agree that there are issues that must be addressed.  We believe the Bill should include a list of institutions in Ireland, publicly and privately-owned, Catholic and Protestant.</p><p>Nothing can be left open to interpretation, there can be no ambiguity and no site can be exempt from investigation.  Where there are known or confirmed discrepancies between death records and burial records at any of the listed sites, there should be an investigation.  For example, there are approximately 900 bodies, women and children, missing in Bessborough, and this must be addressed.  </p><p> Ultimately, however, we believe, and I believe, there can be no delay.  The longer we wait to excavate the bodies, the more women will die without knowing whether their child is rotting in the ground or in a septic tank. </p></speech>

We discussed all situations in respect of the institutions and the burials as well.  We did a report in 2018 and it is there in the Government records.  If the committee requires the relevant information, I think it is chapter three which deals with the Bill.  We have already made our recommendations, which we all agreed to in the Collaborative Forum.  There are 20 people on the Collaborative Forum and we all make independent choices for different groups.  If the committee could get that report, it would be helpful for the Bill.</p> <p>  It is a disgrace to our ears to hear what went on in the 1990s in these burial grounds.  I refer to human bodies lying in unmarked graves.  Any other country would have a full investigation into these unmarked graves of humans.  I know the situation with Tuam, where there is a septic tank with bodies in it.  In our day and age?  Come on.  We have an organisation in our country and in our society and it should be called in to oversee all this.  The organisation we refer to is the Coroner Service.  It is a legal body with backup.  Its members can provide reports.  Let them stand up and do their work.  </p> <p>  I belong to an organisation on the Protestant side of the fence, which is Institutions Out There.  We have marked most of the children in these unmarked graves in Dublin.  A monument was already put up for them, but we do not know where they are exactly because there are different plots in that ground.  We would like to know where they are and that needs a bigger investigation in itself.  I am talking about all institutions with burial grounds.  The powers already exist to go in there and sort it out.  Please sort it out.  I might have siblings in a burial ground that I do not know of.  I know that my birth mother was in a mother and baby home called the Bethany Home.  Subsequently, I was there at the door of the Bethany Home.  My older sibling, who lives in England, knows of three other babies, but we do not know where they were born.  We do not know if they were born in the Bethany Home or not, if the committee members can see where I am coming from on that issue.  I want to make that point.  </p> <p>  I thank the committee very much for letting us come here today as the Collaborative Forum and I ask the members to please feel free to read the report.  I thank the members of the committee for their time, and I am only too happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

As a recognised key stakeholder group, our primary objective is that reform of the law in this area should be led by victim-survivors and that the principle of 'people before paper' should be at the heart of any legislation.  Throughout past processes, victim-survivors have been afforded what can only be described as witness or bystander status on matters directly affecting us.  Matters concerning institutions, burials and forced and coercive adoption were constructed and maintained based on good intentions, knowing what was best and professional opinion.  We feel that the narrative on this issue should be directed and led by victim-survivors as opposed to those who have not been directly affected.  In advocating for an approach led by victim-survivors, we believe firmly in the process of restorative justice and the right of all victim-survivors to participate.</p> <p>  While we welcome this Bill as a first step in addressing urgent issues surrounding burials, in the context of an all-inclusive approach led by victim-survivors, we would like to highlight several key issues regarding the Bill.  We believe there is an opportunity for this Bill to introduce an agency with broader functions to fulfil the objectives of this Bill, as per our submission.  We question the remit of this agency and its ability to carry out its functions effectively.  We are strongly of the view that existing agencies are no longer fit for purpose and should be replaced by a new agency with overall responsibility for these matters on the grounds of constitutional principles of fair procedures and centralisation of the different facets of the same issue in one agency.</p> <p>  The legacy of this issue is still one of shame, stigma and secrecy.  While much time has been given over to the form of inquest and establishing the aspects of who, when, where and how, one of the first hurdles any agency must overcome is that due to the piecemeal approach of previous investigations and the limited understanding of this issue, some families are unaware that they have a family member who died in a home as some victim-survivors have yet to engage with this process.  While we feel there is a role to be played by a coroner regarding inquests and investigating and establishing causes of death, the coronial system is one with known shortcomings.  </p> <p>  As highlighted by other submissions, we also agree that there are fundamental questions in respect of human rights and burials, our obligations in law and the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, all of which require a more thorough investigative approach involving inquests, forensic investigations and storage of remains than is provided for in the Bill.  We would also like to highlight the ownership of lands and burial grounds.  We believe the State should take ownership of all burial grounds, including those identified and those yet to be identified, by means of compulsory purchase order, an established system under constitutional law, to fulfil its international human rights obligations and to preserve and protect these grounds.</p> <p>  The final key issue we would like to highlight and contribute to is the issue of archives and memorialisation.  We are strongly of the view that the appropriateness of certain models and the shape that any future archive or memorialisation take are decisions that must be made by those directly affected when all the facts are known as part of an evolving and adaptable process.</p> <p>  We welcome questions from the committee members on our submission or our observations. </p></speech>

I recently had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the collaborative forum, namely, Ms Larkin and her mother and others.  I welcome them today.  Certainly, during my discussions with them, I got an in-depth consideration of the issues at stake from the perspective of victims and survivors with families who are searching for due process to locate loved ones.</p> <p>  The importance of this proposed Bill is such that it receives comprehensive parliamentary scrutiny by the committee.  I commend my colleagues, who are committed and united in fulfilling their duties to support the victims and survivors of mother and baby homes and their families in seeking truth and justice.  We look forward to engaging with them today and with other groups in future to ensure that we do our job to the best of our ability and provide them with hope of closure within their lifetime.  That is hugely important.</p> <p>  Today, I want to hear from all the witnesses in terms of their submissions.  I very much welcome them.  My question is very open and generic in nature.  Regarding the concerns of witnesses on the aspects of the Bill they feel need to be addressed, what basic changes would they like to see to this legislation to satisfy family members and survivors in respect of our international human rights obligation?  Each of the witnesses might give us some feedback in that regard.</p></speech>

They are sitting rotting in a septic tank.  We have done nothing for the last four years.  It has been going on longer than four years.  It is four years since we had architects telling us there were babies down there.  That would be my main issue.</p> <p>  If we had to go through the rest, certainly, there are many things we would like to see happening.  As far as I am concerned, we need a simple Bill to take the babies and toddlers - imagine, three-year-old children - out of this septic tank.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.589" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Amanda Larkin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021042700002#C00700"><p>I will start by explaining who I am and why I am here.  My name is Amanda Larkin.  I am a member of the collaborative forum and my mother is a survivor of the Tuam mother and baby home.  She was born there in 1949 and spent five and a half years of her life there until she was boarded out.  My grandmother was coerced into the Tuam mother and baby home.  She was, therefore, imprisoned in the home and she was trafficked to the psychiatric unit in Castlebar in County Mayo, where she reportedly spent 12 years of her life before she passed away and was buried in a mass grave in Castlebar.  A stone was only put up at the mass grave approximately ten years ago by the heritage committee in Castlebar.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Dillon's question on the Bill before us, one of the main concerns of the group I represent and with which I work would be to have a larger database for potential siblings and close family members whose loved ones were in the Tuam home in order that there is a guarantee that those babies are returned to their relatives, and that no body is left unidentified or left outstanding at the end of this.</p></speech>

That should not be there.  If my granddaughter, who is eight weeks old on Friday, wants to research her family, she cannot because the information will be locked away for 30 years.  I am sorry; that cannot happen.  I am still looking for parts of my family.  I am 57 years old and I do not know where they are.  The situation is that it can be done; get it done.</p></speech>

What we need to do is look at this in a more holistic manner.  One of the shortcomings with this issue is that the focus of it is way too narrow.  To put it in context, we put a question to the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Ms Katherine Zappone, approximately two years ago.  The reply to the question was essentially that no data exists as to birth mothers who placed more than one child for adoption.  We do not know, therefore, in many instances whether adoptees have siblings who are interred on any of these grounds.</p> <p>  This goes to two points.  The DNA aspect of it needs to be far broader in that adoptees would be interested in being involved and would be an asset to it.  The other point is that public awareness of this as an issue is quite narrow.  It seems to be limited to specific remits, even the remit of the commission, and not heard outside that.  We need to broaden that remit and broaden the awareness of it, as we touched on in our opening statement.  Many families are actually unknowingly involved and do not know that they have a family member who is interred on these grounds.  This may need to be addressed when approaching it from an agency point of view.</p> <p>  One other point as regards information retention, I would have thought it was quite clear from when we ran the Repeal the Seal, Open the Archive campaign that any suggestion in respect of retention of data for survivors or victims is completely unacceptable.  They have to be available to the people to whom they directly pertain.</p> <p>  I will also highlight the issue that we brought up in our submission, which is the extension of the agency and the compulsory purchase order, CPO, mechanism.  We should not be in a position, in this day and age, where there is even the remotest suggestion that a children's burial ground in Cork should be built upon.  Those grounds should be under State control and they should be preserved and protected for future generations.  That needs to be done in tandem with intervention in Tuam in a timely and expedited manner.  As regards the legal aspects of it, I can defer to counsel for further clarification, if it is of any assistance.</p></speech>

I need to move on to our next speaker but we will come back to Mr. Ryan as well later.  We will move on to Senator McGreehan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.593" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1671" speakername="Erin McGreehan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021042700002#C01100"><p>I thank all the witnesses for appearing before the committee today and for their very considered contributions.  Every time we have these conversations, one sees how people have been continuously let down by the State and how we have not taken care of our citizens.  We did not even have the consideration to give a baby or a child a proper burial.  It is incredibly devastating.</p> <p>  Given that this State has done such wrong to mothers, women and children, I feel that all the answers as to who, what and where are not there anymore.  We are not going to find out all the answers on where babies are, who they are or how they got there.  We have had 100 years of lies and deceit.</p> <p>  I ask Ms Ryan-O'Brien about her concept of the restorative justice and how best we can investigate, as thoroughly as possible, to provide some justice for women and children.  I believe the concept at the previous session was transitional versus restorative.  We need to restore faith and as much justice as possible.</p><p>I would be interested to hear about that point of view.</p><p> On head 3 the submission dealt with manifestly inappropriate burials and the Government discretion to decide to exhume remains.  Will the witnesses elaborate on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.595" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maree Ryan-O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021042700002#D00200"><p>Transitional justice is usually for large-scale human rights abuses.  Restorative justice brings it down to a more individualistic aspect.  Given the understanding of what happened as large-scale human rights abuses and criminal abuses, the assistance restorative justice could give to victims of what has been acknowledged as criminal acts would be understood.</p> <p>  I guess the Department has taken the theme of restorative justice as a restorative recognition scheme.  We view restorative justice as essentially restoring as much, retrospectively building back in as many ways as we can.  That does not mean it would be essentially doughnutting legislation around adoptees to look at different ways that we might restore aspects of identity.</p> <p>  As regards survivors, truth and justice mean different things to different people at different times.  What might be one survivor's truth is not the truth for another.  What one concept of justice may be for one is not for the other.  We have to be very mindful of the different individualistic views of what restorative justice is.  It changes as regards each survivor and each victim.  It needs to be brought down to that very basic element of what each individual person wants from a process.</p> <p>  As regards head 3, I will defer to Mr. Rody O'Brien.</p></speech>

We would prefer if that was a little bit more prescribed and not as discretionary as laid out in the Bill.</p> <p>  Head 3(6)(d) refers to the fact the Minister may look for exhumations in circumstances where there are not manifestly appropriate burials.  It is quite alarming for many survivors and their families to think that, in certain cases, the Minister has such discretion.  Certainly, it could be tightened up with regard to what the Minister really needs in this regard and how it will be prescribed in law.</p></speech>

The Bill does not address the withholding of consent for landowners who acquired the land in the periods exceeding the burials and preceding the general scheme.  How does this affect the investigation process?</p></speech>

It is a point we made in our submission.  There appears to be a loophole in how the Bill is drafted in that regard.  There is a gap.  Head 5(4)(c) sets out where the owner is withdrawing or not allowing consent for the investigation and the Government maintains it is being withheld unreasonably on the basis that the owner of the land was the owner at the time the manifestly inappropriate burials took place or that they acquired the site in question on or after the date of publication of this general scheme.  There is a gap there of parties who may have acquired land between those two dates.</p> <p>  I am not sure whether it is appropriate to mention any particular institution.  I know of at least one prominent institution, however, with regard to planning and development which would fit into that particular category.  That needs to be tightened up to allow the State-----</p></speech>

In the context where there is consent, it is fine.  However, where there is no consent and it is being withheld unreasonably by the landowner, in addition to what we said in the other points, we are also recommending the alternative of a compulsory purchase order scheme.  This is approved in constitutional law.  It is in the interest of the common good.  The scheme set out here is a perfect example of what is in the interest of the common good.  Nobody would dispute the fact that what the Bill is trying to achieve is in the common good.  It is in the realm of the authority of the Oireachtas to decide what is the common good.  That is decided in case law in the Article 26 reference of the Planning and Development Bill 1999.  That is the common good aspect to this which means the State has the power to do that.</p> <p>  This would also come under our obligations under international human rights law and the rights of people to be buried in a dignified manner.</p><p>It even involves the investigative approach, which I would like to have the opportunity to discuss later on.  In order for us and the State to do that comprehensively, the compulsory purchase order mechanism is something that should be considered and included in this Bill.</p></speech>

Could Mr. O'Brien comment on that part of the submission?  How likely is it that this restriction could hinder access to justice?  I was referring to head 6.</p></speech>

This is an opt-out for the State in the discretionary nature of investigating these sites where dwellings are in place.  There are a number of institutions where dwellings are now in existence on the sites in question so this is the problematic issue.  How will that be addressed?  Is it just the case that we will just forget about it in the context of dwellings?  It is not even clear in the Bill whether it concerns dwellings in the area, beside the site or alleged to be on the site.  We need clarity on that.  I would be concerned that this would be an opt-out at which we need to look more closely.</p></speech>

Two or three committees are aligning at the same time today and I am trying to move headphones from one device to another so I thank the Chairman for letting me back in.  To concur with what other speakers have said, the past number of weeks at work have involved the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation and the burials Bill.  Listening to opening statements such as that circulated by Ms Alice Coughlan week after week has been harrowing.  These are stories from the heart.  We can sense the pain and hurt in them.  I wish to put my questions to Ms Coughlan because Bessborough has been very much in the news over the past week or so.  It is shocking to say that there is a trade-off debate between 179 apartments and over 900 babies whose whereabouts we do not know.  It is not fully documented or fully established.  A lot more is known about Tuam because there have been four or five years of in-depth archaeological and historical work and a very intense investigation.  The Bessborough survivors' group has been bounced into a situation where it has had to fight this <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>an oral hearing with An Bord Plean&aacute;la but has the group undertaken any on-site investigation such as those in Tuam?</p></speech>

When a group of people, let us say the congregation, cannot tell us where these bodies - women and children - are and then turns around and sells the land, this nation must say that something is wrong.  If they are doing it on the site of the one, two or three mother and baby homes of which we are all aware, we must presume that this is what was happening in respect of most mother and baby homes.</p></speech>

People are buried there - certainly in Tuam.  We must substantiate whether it is the same in the case of Bessborough.  When I started out in politics in 2004, I remember writing to An Bord Plean&aacute;la not fully understanding how it worked.  I very quickly got a slap on the wrist and was told that it could not be interfered with politically, I could not write to it and it was above politics.  In this case, which is something of national interest and fraught with hurt, pain and anguish, our committee should have an opinion on this.  My opinion, which I wish to have recorded, is that it would be improper to develop any housing infrastructure on land without knowing what sorry tales in terms of lives lost may be buried under that ground.  I have nothing more to say.  I have read the witnesses' statements.  They speak for themselves and will have the full support of our committee.  I apologise as I must return to the Oireachtas Committee on Health.  As I said, committees are aligning themselves this evening, which is unfortunate.  I apologise to our witnesses for having to depart the meeting.</p></speech>

I want to touch on what Ms Coughlan said.  Understandably, there is so much fear around people's stories being exposed against their will.  This committee will work to balance the right to privacy with the right to access data.  In Ireland, this has always been weighed very heavily in favour of privacy but there are international best practice standards we can refer to and ensure that both interests are protected.  It is important to note that.</p> <p>  I agree with regard to a compulsory purchase order for Bessborough and I will be pushing for it.  It is clearly a site of national importance and for the common good, as Mr. O'Brien referred to it.  In respect of all of the sites, particularly Bessborough, the need for a compulsory purchase order, the unmarked graves there and what Mr. O'Brien said about how the Bill leaves itself open to too much discretion around investigations and the need for that to be more prescribed, how do Mr. O'Brien and the other witnesses think it could be improved?</p></speech>

I know this is only pre-legislative scrutiny, but it is the appropriate time to say that it is very discretionary with regard to the language that is used in the Bill.  Senator Ruane asked me previously and I do not want to waste this committee's time by repeating what we said there but there is discretion.  If the Minister is reasonably of the opinion that this is a manifestly inappropriate burial, an order will be made - referred to in head 3.</p><p>After that, there is reference in head 5 to the various different criteria.  Again, we believe the language is not prescribed enough.  A number of factors are set out in head 5 of the general scheme, particularly in head 5(2).  It states that the Government shall consider two or more of these factors to be particularly significant.  Head 5(2) refers to:</p><blockquote>	(a) human remains [that] are uncoffined; (b) the burials would not reasonably be considered to provide a dignified interment; (c) the human remains were not buried at the appropriate depth specified in the Rules and Regulations ... [and] (d) the human remains are buried collectively and in a manner or in a location that is repugnant to common decency and would reasonably have been so considered at the time the burials took place.  </blockquote><p>It does not prescribe that one of those factors are satisfied; the Government will consider two or more of those factors.  This is just not prescribed enough with regard to intervention.  The name of the Bill is certain institutional burials and interventions Bill.  We need to be a little more clear on that.  <br/><br/>There is also scope for the Minister to recommend exhumations where it is not manifestly inappropriate as was mentioned previously in the conversation with Senator Ruane.  Section 5(b) of head 5 of the Bill refers to &quot;expert technical reports in respect of the conditions, location and age of [the] relevant burials&quot; and &quot;Evidence in support of the factors [that we mentioned] ... shall include, but may not be limited to&quot;, followed by a number of points including the reference to expert reports.  We believe that this should be a little more prescribed and detailed.  Basically, clarity is needed about when interventions take place and when they do not and what is meant by manifestly inappropriate and what is not.An example of circumstances should be given in which the Government, Minister or me, can say that it is not manifestly inappropriate but we still are looking to exhume remains.<br/><br/>We can foresee many difficulties with survivors and their families regarding to last point, in particular, without some more prescribed language and clarity in the legislation.  That was the issue with regard to that.  I am happy to speak further on the CPO if there is a requirement to do so.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their very poignant and personal life stories.  It is not easy to share and I really appreciate that.  I have listened to different witnesses as they have come in and it has given me a real insight into a really dark period in our State's history.  The intergenerational effect it has had on people who are survivors and victims of mother and baby homes has come up again today.  I thank the witnesses for sharing that.</p> <p>  I have two questions and a point of information.  I want to pick up on the point made by Ms Ryan-O'Brien on restorative justice.  I was involved in this process in a professional capacity in the past.  Usually the best outcomes are when victims, survivors and offenders involved in the process focus on ensuring that offenders are held responsible for their actions.  What are Ms Ryan-O'Brien's thoughts on that?  How does she see this process evolving when it comes to atrocities carried out in the mother and baby homes, given the historical context and how far they go back?  I would appreciate her thoughts on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.631" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maree Ryan-O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021042700002#F00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  This probably ties in more with our suggestions regarding the development of an agency that is outside a purely institutional burials remit, and more towards one encompassing all experiences reflective of the history of forced and coercive adoption, incarceration, institutions and so on.  One of the main issues with this Bill is that it is, again, very piecemeal.  It focuses on one aspect as opposed to a whole, holistic approach.  To give the Deputy an example, I am an adoptee but I did not come through the mother and baby home system.  As such, I have been outside the remit of the commission of investigation and so on, as have thousands of others.</p> <p>  We also have an ongoing issue with regard to illegal adoptions, which is subject, hopefully, to further investigation.  Of course, there have been documented difficulties with the final report of the commission of investigation.  We see the restorative element coming in as a holistic element within a stand-alone agency, which would deal with all of these matters in, as I said, a holistic way rather than on a piecemeal basis.  Only then can we begin to appreciate how interwoven this is.  For example, it would not be unexpected that adoptees who came through one home would have siblings who died in another.  We cannot keep looking at it on an isolated basis.  We need to look at it more and then develop this restorative aspect where we can incorporate truth telling and supports for victims who came through this system, rather than just looking it as specific to one home, one agency or one remit.  We need to look at it as part of an overall, progressive aspect, which could then build in further legislation around information and tracing, as Deputy Cairns touched on.  Truth telling would be an aspect of both restorative and transitional justice.  We need to acknowledge this.  </p> <p>  In order for us to have legislation that is effective and to be able to have the databases to pull on for identifications, it is entirely foreseeable that we may have bodies who were, sadly, interred on these grounds that we cannot identify.  We need to be able to work with families.  As Ms Coughlan touched on, there are families who, even now, would not understand that they were somehow included or implicated in these burials, in the institutional abuses that went on and in forced and coercive adoption.  We need to be future-forward as regards legislation to see where it will go, not just where we are now but how it will develop in the future.</p></speech>

I have one quick question and one point of information.  Mr. Hardiman mentioned a report in his opening statement.  I did not pick up on what the report was when he spoke; it is not in his opening statement.  I would appreciate it if that report could be shared with us at some stage.  We heard previously in other meetings of witnesses who were not informed that the excavation at Tuam was stopped.

Tuam was mentioned on a very high level in our report.  It is disgusting what went on there.  That was the first time I really got in depth with the Tuam instance and what went on there.</p> <p>  My own background is the Bethany Home, which was one of the Protestant organisations.  They have other burial grounds that have not even been touched on yet.  Our burial grounds are in Mount Jerome, here in Dublin.  There are three different plots, if the Deputy understands that.  We have erected a memorial there with almost all the names, about 16 of which are still missing.  That work was done in 2012 by a man called Niall Meehan.  He did the work to find the names and the history of who is buried in those graves.  We do not know exactly who is in which plot.  We would like to sort that out first and foremost.  That is on the Bethany side.</p><p>On the Collaborative Forum side, all institutions that have burial grounds and the Government does not know who is buried in there.  That is ridiculous.  We do not live like that in our society today nor did we yesterday.  The 19th century for institutions is absolutely disgusting in our society.</p></speech>

It adds to the body of knowledge of people's experience.  I am being influenced by what I have heard today and the previous day too.</p> <p>  I am still trying to get my head around the coronial process.  I would like to hear Ms Ryan-O'Brien's perspective in light of the submission we received from Professor Phil Scraton on the disapplication of the coroner's existing mandatory jurisdiction.  We have a coroner system here.  Has Aitheantas considered the effects of the legislation as drafted on the coronial process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.638" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maree Ryan-O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021042700002#G00300"><p>I might defer to Mr. O'Brien on the more technical aspects.  The coronial process has documented shortcomings.  My concern, having been through the glorious experience of dealing with the current institution and agency that adoptees and survivors have to deal with is that we are essentially promising people they will get answers to questions, which are then going to be heaped on what is already a broken system.  I am not sure how we are going to do this but I feel the coronial process as it is will not give people the answers they need.  It is completely understandable that they feel these answers should be forthcoming quickly.  We are going to put this workload on top of a broken system and break it further.  I am not disputing that there needs to be a coroner's role in the agency, which Professor Scraton touched on, but it needs to be independent of the existing system unless it is run in tandem with reform of the system or there is a separate role for a coroner or someone of that ilk in the agency itself.  What this needs to do is deliver much-needed answers and deliver them quickly.  We cannot have it going on for another interminable length of time.  My concern is that if it is abrogated to the coronial system those answers will not be forthcoming.  The very least we deserve to give people is answers, which are long awaited.  We cannot even begin to imagine what they have gone through waiting for these answers.  Whether or not it is possible to do in the current system, I do not know but we need to consider having a separate role of that ilk in this agency.</p></speech>

We are trying to interrogate the whole issue around things such as DNA storage.  We know from Mr. Tansey, in a submission to the committee from the group he works with in Tuam, that survivors would have their DNA taken and stored for possible matching with babies' remains that are exhumed.  Since then, two of their group have died but no DNA has yet been collected from any survivors who accordingly are increasingly anxious.  Therein lies the terrible hurt that can be relieved in the short term.  It is about creating a system where evidence gathering is robust such that the restorative justice and the transitional justice that is being spoken about is based on a set of structures and protocols whereby a person has somebody to interface with where things such as DNA are examined and there is an investigatory process that tallies with the law of the land.  That is why I am asking about the coronial process.  Perhaps Mr. O'Brien could address that further because I am grappling with it at the moment.</p></speech>

The role of the coroner is basically bypassed in the general scheme under head 7.  Head 31 does allow it back in where there are questions of investigations where garda&iacute; are involved and where the death may be as a result of unnatural causes.  The wording is very vague.  It refers to exhumation and to the Garda but I do not even understand what it says there.  In the case where there is an unnatural death or a death in violent circumstances the coroner is involved.  It appears that this scheme bypasses that.  Ms Ryan-O'Brien, Ms Coughlan and others made the point that time is really important here but, at the same time, there is a balance between justice and time.  Leaving the coroner system out altogether is problematic from the point of view of justice, investigation, and establishing what happened.  Under international law and the European Convention on Human Rights we are obliged to investigate these mass deaths and mass burials.  There is scope somewhere to include a coroner aspect to the Bill without maybe going down the traditional route as most people involved know about.  It is a very long drawn-out process in any event.  It may be possible to incorporate a role for the coroner specifically to deal with the issues that are addressed in the Bill and interventions with regard to investigation - which is really the key word - and justice for all those involved so that they can have some sense of closure.  I would not rule out the fact that a coroner's role can be bypassed as it appears to be done here.</p></speech>

I am mindful and respectful of how sensitive this is.  I will ask a couple of questions.</p><p>I do not mean in any way to be insensitive.  I am just trying to figure a way through and some solutions.  I will do that at the end.</p><p> My first question is for Ms Coughlan.  I found her contribution particularly powerful and it reflected experiences I have had with people who have come forward to me.  I refer to mothers being fearful of what is going to come out or of being obliged to disclose information under the proposed information and tracing Bill that we anticipate shortly.  I see that fear coupled with our need for information and disclosure and to accumulate information.  In addition, I see in the submissions the need for us to expand the list of institutions or where there may be burials of this nature.</p><p> In a previous session, we talked about how to engage with local knowledge and why it might be difficult for people with that knowledge to come forward.  I would be interested to know, therefore, if Ms Coughlan has thought about that aspect and if she has any proposed solutions or ideas in that regard.  One of the things I have put on the table regarding information and tracing is to have a confidential line whereby people can verify who they are and their bona fides in giving information, while not being obliged to disclose their identity.</p><p> I fully support the idea of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, depending on the situation with Bessborough.  It is my understanding the Minister certainly tuned in to, if he did not actually fully attend, the oral hearing in respect of Bessborough last week.  Fair play to him for that.  In that context, we await that outcome to see where we need to go from here.</p><p> Turning to Mr. O'Brien, from my understanding, I read head 3, combined with several other heads, including head 31, more optimistically.  I see it as being discretion to bring in specialist knowledge and to expand powers where it is necessary.  Therefore, I see that as perhaps a positive aspect.  Tuam is going to be our first experience in this respect, and whoever is going to be involved in that process is going to have accumulated experience that I would like to see used at other sites, where and when necessary.</p><p> Finally, in the Tuam context, and bearing in mind CPOs etc., there are residential dwellings in and around the site and they have been there now for decades.  The area where there may be remains might have been inappropriately built upon.  How do we marry those difficulties and how can we be sensitive to them?  I could take up the whole two hours.  I met with Ms Ryan-O'Brien before and I look forward to hearing from her again in the context of information and tracing.  I hand over now to whoever wishes to engage with my questions.</p></speech>

If a gardener came into your house tomorrow, dug up the garden and three bodies were found, the Garda would be called in immediately.  If you owned four more properties outside of that house, garda&iacute; would be there within ten minutes digging everything up.  They were able to be at a GAA field yesterday excavating and exhuming a 300-year old body.  We know these bodies are in there in these cases.  Let us bring this issue down to simple things.  We actually know these bodies are buried in a pit in Tuam.  The point I make then, and even if this means we must get a separate Bill, is that we need to get these bodies out of the ground now.  When we talk about Bessborough, we know there are 900 bodies there.  As I said before, most institutions followed the same routine.  We can work on that aspect.</p> <p>  The thing is, however, the archaeologist involved in 2017 said these bodies should be taken up within six months.  Here we are four years later and we are still discussing it.  We are listening.  I reiterate that I am not a facilitator or a lawyer and I am not whatever.  What I am saying is there are these bodies in Tuam that we know about.  Therefore, they should be excavated and exhumed immediately.</p></speech>

They would find it very intimidating.  It took me a week and I had to go back within myself.  This my first time speaking about all this.  My daughter knows.  I have spoken to my daughter who was adopted and I have got back to her.  The point I am making is about actually not knowing.  You spend your life hoping that your child who was adopted was happy and that you have given her a better life.</p> <p>  I will give some information now, and this might be hurtful to everybody.  I was told I would not be getting my daughter.  I was told I could agree to an adoption.  I walked in, I signed a page and I was given a new name.  You would not even be given that in Portlaoise or Mountjoy prisons if you were a murderer.  I am not going to go into much of it, but I was given a separate name and told if I did not agree to adoption, then my daughter or my son - my child - would be in an institution until he or she was at least 16 years old.  Would that be called a free choice?</p></speech>

I went for help.  My way of getting over what happened was that I blocked my mind off from it for 40 years.  I went on and never trusted anyone and never allowed anyone to have control of me again.  That was the way I coped.  When my mother died in 2015, I went for help.  I went in front of the commission.  We talk about this aspect, but I went in front of the commission and I have the letter here.  If somebody wishes to pass that on to everybody, they more than likely can.</p> <p>  A year later, to the day, I was offered counselling.  When I wrote to the judge who was the chair of the commission, I received a three-line letter back.  Would that encourage people who might have been hiding things for their entire lives to come forward and talk?  There must be an agency.  I refer to an agency that was completely independent, so that someone could go into a hospital in Cork or Galway, for example, and give the relevant information and family history to a social worker.  That is what I wanted in the forum.  I refer to a situation where a person's family might know nothing about a situation, and that person being able to go in and give the medical history-----</p></speech>

To be clear, Tuam is a crime scene.  The Government has come down and got public opinion in Tuam on what we wanted done in Tuam.  It is a crime scene; it is not down to public opinion.  The law does not go with public opinion.  The law is the law.</p> <p>  The tombs were broken back in the 1970s by children and that is when the coroner and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should have gone in and investigated Tuam.  That is when the babies were let down for the second time.  They were let down when they were let die and when they were lowered into a septic tank.  Back in the 1970s, they were let down by the State, the coroner and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that came with the church and covered it up in Tuam, and blessed the grounds.  Deputy Cathal Crowe said that the legislation and related matters have been worked on here for weeks.  This has been going on for a lifetime for the living witnesses.  This has been going on for ten years for the families since Tuam was uncovered, since the news broke.  It has been going on seven days a week and 24 hours a day since 12 January when the commission's report was made public.</p> <p>  Tuam is a crime scene and should have been excavated in the 1970s.  What we feel about Tuam is not important.  If we have to go into the playground and gardens then that is what has to be done but that is not my opinion or the opinion of politicians.  That is the law.  The law will bring us there if there are anomalies, which is what is believed to be the case.</p> <p>  The tax payers of Ireland paid for an expert team, in 2017, to do a dig and its recommendations have not been acted on.  It recommended that a liaison team should be set up to deal directly with the families so that the families hear first what is happening and not through social media, which was brought up here on the last day when Tuam was discussed.   That recommendation must be followed and picked up on.</p> <p>  The expert team recommended that the site should be excavated within six months.  They said that because air and gases got in when they opened the tanks they have no idea what effect that would have on the remains.  We are losing vital DNA and remains plus we have no idea what will have happened to the bones in that time.  If extremely simple legislation is required to get the babies out of Tuam then let us do so.  Every day that passes we are losing and it is another apology down the road that the Government will have to give to living witnesses saying "we're sorry that that happened and should have moved quicker".  Four years have elapsed since the experts went into Tuam.  However, my mother has spent 72 years fighting to find out who she is.  She has reached the conclusion that she will never know for certain the identity of her mother and will never have a picture of her mother.  She now seeks justice for the little ones in the tank because she could have been one of them.  She wants their bodies recovered and treated with justice, and respect.         </p></speech>

I, too, thank all of the witnesses for coming in today.  We all feel so bad about the stories and the situation has been very hard.  I thank Ms Coughlan for her story.</p> <p>  My first question is for Ms Coughlan and Mr. Herdman.  I am conscious that the decision on the application to develop Bessborough has not yet been made, and I am sure that the back and forth is quite upsetting.  I agree with everything contained in both of the witnesses' statements.  I agree with the many survivors with whom I have spoken.  There can be no delay in getting answers.  We also need a full list of all of the institutions in which mothers and babies were held, and we must cross-check the details with any records.</p> <p>  I have found myself asking whether we need to consider re-establishing a collaborative forum for the survivors of the mother and baby homes, and Bethany Homes.  What do the witnesses think about that?  Groups like the Collaborative Forum are vital in any conversation like this one.  What engagement has the forum had with Ministers since the report of the commission was published?  Today, I have listened to the witnesses and survivors speak and it is apparent that this is all about communication, timing and answers, which is something the witnesses might come back to me on.</p> <p>  There is so much to go through before we even think about a future memorial.  It is important, however, to discuss this before someone decides to put something in place that further upsets survivors.  Sadly, many of the survivors due to their age may be unable to give their opinions when the time comes in the future.</p> <p>  Last week, a report that was commissioned by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties on the current coronial system was released and the system is in much need of reform.  As so much needs to be done to improve the coronial system which, for the most part, is made up of good people such as part-time coroners who only have a limited number of administration staff and there are not enough Garda investigators, which are issues that we really need to address.  The coronial system is in urgent of reform in the interests of speed.  I can see the merit of establishing a new agency that has the powers that usually rest with coroners.  I am interested in the suggestion that a new agency also has a recording and administrative role, which is important.  </p> <p>  The Department has established an information management unit.  Last week, I suggested that we ought to look at providing a liaison officer in every local authority.  Do the wtinesses think it would be beneficial for survivors to have a local person or office so they can access information or support in tracing, records and so on?  I have worked with some survivors in my area of Carlow and I feel that access to information and records, and working with different groups is so important. </p> <p>  Finally, I thank the witnesses and I know that today has been hard for them too.            </p></speech>

The Deputy wanted to know more about the Collaborative Forum.  It was set up in 2017-2018 so we have been going for three years.  The Collaborative Forum, as a group of people, is a fantastic idea and comprises all different types of survivors, victims, mothers, babies and children.  It is a good group.  Unfortunately, in terms of the Minister and the Department, I asked one question to the top Department and was told that I would have to ask the Minister's office.  Does the committee understand where I am coming from there?  That is playing the boot one to the other.</p> <p>  The Collaborative Forum was set up but who took charge?  It was the former Minister, Katherine Zappone.  She was very good at getting the meetings together and everything but she has stepped down.  Since the new Minister was appointed we have only had two Zoom meetings with him.  I do not think that he is fully aware of the bigger picture.  He has brought in another group of people from different Departments who probably do not know anything about institutional abuse or mother and baby homes.</p><p>I was disgusted to hear that this Bill did not contain our recommendations, which we made in 2018.  Ministers, Deputies and Senators should have that information at hand.  The legal system did not get our statement of recommendations.  It has the burials, the memorials and the compensation in it.  We have all suggested all the things we want.  It is all there.  The tools are there for our community of victims and survivors.  We are willing to work with them but when the Department bounces one and the Minister's office bounces two, who do I go to?  Is that a good enough answer for the Deputy?</p></speech>

Everybody in the town immediately knows what that office does.  Why can these women, especially mothers or children, not go into a hospital and see a social worker?  This information can then be sent by fax or whatever to Dublin.</p> <p>  As I said, if the adoptees or the adopted people want to meet, a psychologist can be there to guide both sides.  I genuinely believe that in many instances, we put people in a situation years ago where they were forced into giving their babies up for adoption.  I am not being funny but many of them were sold.  Now, suddenly, the Government is turning around and saying a daughter or a son has every right to know about his or her mother and family.  Surely, however, it would be better if we gave people help and anonymity and they were spoken to and somebody sat down and explained to them that they will not be the talk of the town or whatever.  Does the Deputy know what I mean?  That is very important.</p></speech>

I know the Deputy mentioned it but I do not believe Sidney or Alice covered it.  To be clear, the group I represent and with which I work feels it is extremely distressing to visualise memorialisation.  It is too difficult right now in Tuam for them to do that.  We are not near that path.</p> <p>  With the survivor-centred plan that has been promised by the Government, we feel that we can look at that down the line after the excavation of the illegal burial site.  There is time for that.  With the collaborative forum, I know a new structure is being looked at and will be rolled out.  There are, therefore, changes coming along that path as well.  That is coming quite quickly from the Department; it is not slow.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about information and communicating with survivors and families.  It is something I have raised for the past four years with anybody who has visited Tuam.  I know Deputy Dillon and Chair will be aware of the idea of a Tuam hub for the mother and baby home.</p> <p>  At the moment if a person finds out that he or she is from the Tuam home, or has anything to do with it, there is no national number for survivors or families to ring.  There is no information hotline from the Government that a person can ring and find out information.  A person's information centre is Ms Catherine Corless in Tuam.  When someone Googles it, that is the only name he or she will find.  Ms Corless has become the information centre for everybody.  Whether she chose it or wanted it, that is how it is.  I have said to Ministers and to everybody that it is not fair to put that pressure on one person.  We have thanked her and the Taoiseach stood in this very room and thanked her for the work she has done.  He did not acknowledge the ongoing work she is doing, however.  The Government has not picked up and put in place something for people.</p> <p>  What I suggest, and I suppose it goes against what Alice  said, is the collaborative forum and an information centre in Tuam for the mother and baby home.  Let people have one wherever there was a mother and baby home or an institution.  It is a one-stop shop for survivors where they can meet and come through different situations together.  Facilities and things would be made available to them for accessing records, grants and medical stuff and help filling out forms.  Remember, it is easy to say to the survivor that all the information is here.  If that survivor cannot read and write, however, it is going nowhere.</p> <p>  That is the main point I am making to the Government at the moment.  All the information that comes to survivors comes through email.  We are dealing with survivors in their 70s and 80s.  They do not have email.  If they have email, we are entrusting it to an advocate to then read that email and tell that person his or her opinion of that email.  We are actually taking the power from the hands of living witnesses and survivors.  That is very unfair.  It should be given back to them.  The buck should stop with them and they should choose who they want to go to.</p> <p>  An information centre in Tuam for the mother and baby home would really cover that.  I do not know if it is something that has to be there for 50 years or for a year but it should certainly be there.  There are plenty of buildings in Tuam.  I am sure Galway County Council would be more than accommodating in giving us a range of buildings from which to choose.  It would have to be a building and not a room, however.  It should be an entire building in which people could access different resources.</p></speech>

One point I will make is that we have been let down by successive Governments for a long time, be it either on information and tracing or on the proposed legislation to deal with Tuam.  If, therefore, we are asking for prescribed text within legislation, it is usually to ensure there will not be any grey areas and that promises will be acted on.  It is fair to say that we are sceptical about the Government's intent.  I do not doubt the Senator's intent or that of her colleagues in this regard but we have had very disheartening experiences over quite a long period.</p> <p>  To touch on Tuam, the legislation underestimates the amount of work that needs to be done.  Clear provision needs to be made for the storage of data.  It is quite foreseeable that when every body is eventually exhumed, we will not have the technology to identify one of them, be it either through DNA or other means.</p> <p>  A more suitable model for the retrieval and storage of DNA and remains would be something similar to the World Trade Center, where undertakings were essentially given that every victim would be identified following the crash.  The approach they took was to decide, in instances where the remains could not be identified, that time and science eventually would catch up and they would be able to identify them.  If we take a similar approach to that as regards a repository, hopefully, time and science will eventually enable us to identify who these children were and who their families were.</p> <p>  As well as that, I believe it is quite probable that adoptees had extended family in these homes.</p><p>We need to be aware of that when we are casting the net on the DNA encatchment to ensure we bring as many people in as possible.  We can only do that through education and through explaining the context of this as a wider societal situation as opposed to the piecemeal basis we have with institutions.</p><p> I want to touch on both of the questions that have been brought up on the legislation and moving forward.  There is a clear stratification with this issue.  We have people who were part of the remit for the commission of inquiry and investigation, we have people who were outside the remit of the inquiry and investigation, and we have people who were illegally adopted.  Moving forward, we need to have something that addresses all of those issues.</p><p> We are probably touching on something to do with information and tracing.  As regards information officers, however, I would struggle to see how we could provide people with information that essentially is not there.  That is the main issue we have.  We do not have an appreciation of how vast this is and how many people it encompasses.  Ms Coughlan touched on this as well and I would completely share her view that there are birth mothers who have still to come forward and state that they have children who were interred, who died or who they suspected died.  How do we go about building trust with women?  How do we reach out and support them?  That is something we need to encompass in any legislation or programme moving forward, be it a restorative transition programme or whatever way we choose to describe it.  It needs to take as many people on board as possible and support them in a way they have not been supported so far.  We need to see that support both in legislation and in practice.  We need to see that in society and in the education on this issue.  The way the issue has been approached means we are only ever looking at it as one issue, be it institutional burials or mother and baby homes.  Even the term mother and baby homes is exclusionary as it excludes people who did not go through that or who were adopted.  There is a disconnect because the survivors think this does not involve or affect them when in practice it could.  We need to look at all of this as a holistic issue, rather than just as one specific issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.685" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rody O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021042700002#L00200"><p>I want to address a number of points that Senator Seery Kearney made on compulsory purchase orders.  I agree with her on the power of the testimony of Ms Coughlan.  Ms Ryan-O'Brien and Ms Coughlan mentioned that the reform of the law must be survivor-led and must allow survivors to have a voice.  As a lawyer I can say it is important that survivors get to speak before the lawyers do and here I am speaking to the committee.</p> <p>  Senator Seery Kearney asked about the dwellings and compulsory purchase orders.  She is right that this issue is complicated.  There are houses and dwellings on sites that may be burial grounds from the past.  That matter is not even clear.  As Ms Coughlan rightly pointed out, there may be scenes that require investigation.  Some of these are crime scenes and they need to be investigated.  As we mentioned before, we have obligations to investigate these mass burial sites of children.  It is an issue of investigation to ascertain evidence and information about burial sites.  Thereafter we can look at questions about dwellings and carrying out CPOs on land.</p> <p>  Apart from our international obligations, we owe it to survivors and all the people who have been buried on these sites to ascertain the truth and investigate.  A level of investigation is glossed over or left out of this Bill.  The committee needs to consider that and to go back and look at the investigative role.  That would bring in some role for the coroner's court that would not drag it out for too long as the existing system does.  The committee can reconsider that with all of the evidence because that is important with regard to investigation.  Investigation is the key element that is sadly lacking in the general scheme.</p></speech>

I agree and I do not understand why it has not been enforced up until now and why this is treated like something different.  We know the coroner is obliged to act.  The Coroners Act 1962 states that when remains are found in a coroner's district he or she is obliged to act.  One of the criteria pertains to a death that occurred in State care or institutions.  There is no reason it has not already happened.  At present, this Bill disapplies the coroner so I agree that this is very problematic.</p> <p>  If this Bill is not changed, despite our best efforts - and we will be pushing for that to be changed in the Bill - as far as I know that leaves us with one option, namely to push for either the Attorney General or the Minister for Justice to instruct the coroner to act, which they can do.  Would the witnesses be in favour of that?  If we cannot change this Bill to disapply the coroner, would they be in favour of the Attorney General or the Minister for Justice instructing the coroner to act?</p></speech>

Every day that passes we have no idea what is happening to the remains that are in the septic tank in Tuam.  The bodies need to be taken out.  It cannot be delayed and it cannot be a question of scrapping this and starting again.  If the bodies need to be taken out between now and setting that up then that is fine but the big thing is to take the bodies out.  If we leave them in there for another year they might decay to the extent that we might not get any DNA because we do not know what is happening to them.  Let us look at the worst-case scenario.  Do we want a situation where, in another year's time when we have the coroner and everything, we will not have anything to test?  The priority is to get the bodies out of the septic tank in Tuam.</p></speech>

It begs another question.  This is a good and thorough committee and its work is good.  If the committee is going to bring recommendations back, it seems baffling why a role for a coroner or a type of coroner could not be incorporated in this general scheme.  If the committee made such recommendations, why would those not be followed?  From that, the committee's work might get some results more quickly.  As the previous speakers have said, time is of the essence and if the committee was to get something on board and get some kind of system in place, it would be more time efficient.</p></speech>

We need to do that very quickly.  Thereafter, I hear Mr. O'Brien's comment that there are questions to be answered and that the mechanism for that must not overwhelm the coronial system for decades.</p><p>Perhaps there can be a combination. That is the point of pre-legislative scrutiny.  We can bring in people, listen to what they have to say and make recommendations to the Minister thereafter.  It gives us an insight also to lobby the Minister as well.</p><p> I am deeply appreciative of the vulnerability, honesty and sheer fact-facing that all of the contributors have had this afternoon and I thank them.</p></speech>

That is just Tuam.  I am no human rights expert but anybody can see, from briefly looking at the European Convention on Human Rights, that it is hard to find a right that has not been infringed, whether it is the right to life, liberty, privacy, family life or freedom from inhumane and degrading treatment, to name but a few.</p></speech>

In every aspect of it that has been dealt with so far, it has been dealt with on a piecemeal basis.  We have never looked at it as a complete interwoven issue and that is what we need moving forwards.  We need to incorporate as many people as possible.  If somebody is involved indirectly, be it either a direct victim or an indirect victim of the system, then he or she deserves a voice and deserves to be heard.</p> <p>  One of the criticisms I would have had of the process in the past is that it was too restrictive.  That was something that the special rapporteur highlighted as well with regard to the investigation of the commission, that it was too limited.  Therefore, the report was limited and so on.  The impacts are limited.</p> <p>  Moving forwards, what we need is a more holistic view of this as an issue.  We need to incorporate as many people as possible and we need to educate as to how it impacts.  The shame, stigma and secrecy is something that we still live with and we still see on a day-to-day basis.  We need to find a way to overcome this so that we can truly achieve what we all want to achieve.  We appreciate even more, given the Covid restrictions, the reunification of families so that people can know where their loved ones are buried or even that they had loved ones who are buried.  Moving forward, that is what our approach is and what we would like to see.</p></speech>

We wish her a speedy recovery.</p> <p>  From SOLAS, I welcome Mr. Andrew Brownlee, CEO and Ms. Mary-Liz Trant, executive director of delivery, and from Skillnet Ireland, Mr. Paul Cleary, CEO and Ms Tracey Donnery, executive director of policy and communications.  They are here to brief the committee on reform of the apprenticeship model, specifically, how to rebrand it as a viable career option equivalent to higher education qualifications; restructure non-traditional apprenticeships; encourage more female apprentices; and, provide requisite apprenticeship training to ensure a skilled workforce for a just transition to a green economy.  </p> <p>  I will invite Mr. Brownlee and then Mr. Healy to make a brief opening statement which will be followed by questions from committee members, each of whom has a six minute slot for questions and responses.  The committee will publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  As the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, and as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does, they have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by me to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  I now ask Mr. Brownlee to begin; he and Mr. Healy have five minutes each.   </p></speech>

SOLAS has responsibility for funding, planning and co-ordinating further education and training in Ireland and is the statutory authority for apprenticeships.  This means we have statutory responsibility for approving new areas of industrial activity for apprenticeship, approving employers, maintaining a register of apprentices, and making statutory rules for the conduct of apprentices.</p> <p>  SOLAS also has a role as the co-ordinating provider for craft apprenticeships.</p><p>While training is provided by a network of education and training boards, ETBs, institutes of technology, ITs, and technological universities, TUs, SOLAS remains responsible for developing and setting curricula, scheduling off-the-job training across the provider network, setting assessments and overall quality assurance of provision.</p><p> The apprenticeship system is underpinned by a strong partnership approach, with SOLAS playing a central role in its development and management alongside the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, education and training providers, employers and social partners.  It is crucial in delivering the right and latest skills for employers and delivers a significant and positive impact on society and the economy.</p><p> At the start of this year, the apprenticeship population reached 20,000 for the first time.  The female apprentice population has also grown substantially in recent years and now stands at 1,100, building on major efforts to increase participation and offer more diverse opportunities to enter an apprenticeship, although much more needs to be done to address barriers to entry.  This was thanks to the opening up of apprenticeship following the publication of the most recent apprenticeship action plan.  There are now 60 apprenticeship programmes to choose from, ranging from level 5 to level 10 on the national framework, serving industries as diverse as biopharma, ICT, recruitment, financial services, retail, hospitality, engineering and construction.</p><p> We have seen apprenticeship develop significantly as a viable career option for a much wider base of people.  The Generation Apprenticeship campaign targets employers, parents, teachers, guidance counsellors and potential apprentices of all ages and backgrounds.  We are also exploring how further education and training and apprenticeship options could be set out alongside higher education choices as part of the CAO decision-making process, which could be a real game changer in raising awareness of these great pathways that are available to everyone.</p><p> Over the past three years, important steps have been taken to ensure that apprenticeship is promoting and supporting green skills, with content developed and integrated into a number of core apprenticeship programmes.  Centres of excellence in nearly-zero energy building, NZEB, are now established in the south east and midlands, with three further regional centres of excellence in development.  New apprenticeships in the areas of arboriculture, geo-drilling, scaffolding, roofing and cladding have green skills technology and knowledge as components of the curriculum and approach.  The Generation Apprenticeship schools competition has also had sustainability as its core theme over the last three years.</p><p> We believe the work of SOLAS and our partners has helped to support a world-class and rapidly expanding apprenticeship system, with the quality of our apprentices acknowledged on the global stage in Worldskills competitions.  It provides an excellent foundation from which to further grow and diversify that system.</p><p> The new apprenticeship action plan, published last week, sets out an exciting new agenda for the development of the system over the next five years.  It targets an increase in registrations to 10,000 per annum and aims to create a single integrated apprenticeship model.  This includes further development and enhancement of the consortium-led approach, increased support for employers, including SMEs, support for targeted recruitment of under-represented groups and targets for the public sector to take on apprentices.</p><p> The plan also includes a commitment to establish a national apprenticeship office, to be jointly managed by SOLAS and the HEA.  SOLAS will retain its statutory responsibilities with regard to apprenticeship but it is hoped that this joint office will provide apprenticeship with a distinct focus and identity, and reflect the fact that apprenticeships are now provided across both further and higher education.  SOLAS looks forward to playing a lead role in this office and in the continuing management, development and oversight of apprenticeship in Ireland.</p><p> SOLAS will retain responsibility as co-ordinating provider for craft apprenticeships, although there is a commitment to move this provision to a devolved model of delivery over the lifetime of the plan.  This will involve education and training providers taking on more of a lead role in this regard, building on their expertise in developing curricula, setting assessments and quality assuring provision.  A migration plan will be developed in close partnership with all our key stakeholders involved in this process including industry, unions and the providers themselves.</p><p> While there is an exciting future for apprenticeship, of course, we must acknowledge the significant damage that Covid-19 has caused to provision over the last year.  Our training centres and institutions, which provide off-the-job training, have been closed or operating at severely reduced capacity for nine of the past 12 months.  The practical focus of apprenticeship means that most of this training has to take place on site and the restrictions have caused significant waiting lists to develop.  The problems have also acted as a spur for innovation, however.  We have seen apprenticeship training move online for the first time ever with theory elements of programmes delivered remotely.  We have worked with providers and unions to phase back essential on-site provision via safe, socially distanced approaches.</p><p> Addressing the backlog will be a significant challenge but the recent announcements of &euro;20 million in capital funding to expand capacity, the use of online and competency assessments to speed up the apprentice journey through training and working with providers and unions to agree flexible and overtime arrangements to facilitate provision outside of traditional training periods will all help to start to make inroads in the next few months.</p><p> I hope this provides a brief overview of the reform of the apprenticeship model and the current and evolving role that SOLAS plays in managing and developing the system.  I thank the committee for its time and I look forward to further discussion on this matter.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.712" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021042700002#B00300"><p>Chairman, committee members and colleagues, we are mindful that we speak to everyone today in the context of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, which, as we know, is having a profound global impact on societies, economies, workers and the ways in which businesses operate.  Certain sectors of our economy, particularly those providing customer-facing services, remain under immense strain and will not offer their pre-Covid-19 employment levels for some time to come, giving rise to job displacement, skills mismatches and exceptionally high unemployment levels, particularly among our younger people.<br/><br/>As members will be aware, significant challenges remain for businesses as they adapt their models to provide a safe environment for employees and customers.  Workers, too, are learning how to complete tasks remotely, enabled by digital communication tools, yet many activities and functions do not lend themselves to distance working.  In the context of the dramatic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our labour market, the work of agencies such as Skillnet Ireland and SOLAS in upskilling those in employment has never been more important and will be a driving force as we enter a period of significant disruption that will require all of us to adapt and learn new skills.<br/><br/>Skillnet Ireland was set up by Government in 1999 to help meet these challenges.  We were given a specific mandate to work directly with employers to develop the skills of those already in employment, and in doing so, contribute to the overall competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise sector.  I will note to the committee at this point that our mandate is distinct from that of apprenticeship and we do not have a formal role in the delivery of apprenticeship schemes. <br/><br/>Returning to in-employment upskilling, which is, yet again, the focus of our work, Skillnet Ireland uses a highly specialised approach, working directly alongside Ireland&rsquo;s main industry groups, sectoral associations, industry clusters and chambers of commerce.  Each of these groups operates and promotes its own distinctive Skillnet network.  There are 73 Skillnet networks it total, covering every sector and every region in Ireland.  Working with our partners, we identified the major trends shaping their sectors or region, for example, new digital skills, management skills, the impact of climate action, Brexit and Covid-19, but also how we can help jobseekers.  This approach gives us direct access to thousands of companies and workers every year.  In 2021, Skillnet Ireland will support 19,000 businesses nationwide, which I will stress are primarily small firms and microbusinesses, upskilling 70,000 workers and facilitating over 6,000 training programmes.<br/><br/>Our approach is very agile and responsive to the needs of employers.  We also contribute, however, to substantial actions in many of the labour market and enterprise priorities set out in Government in policies and strategies.  We played a key role in preparing Irish businesses for new realities posed by Brexit, for example, including rapidly upskilling more than 3,000 workers on new customs procedures through our clear customs<i></i>scheme.<br/><br/>We have also been highly proactive in helping the business sector operate safely during this pandemic through our rebound scheme, which has supported more than 3,500 SMEs to date, limiting the spread of infection in industries spanning childcare, healthcare, manufacturing, hair and beauty, the creative sector, retail and hospitality.<br/><br/>Central Statistics Office, CSO, data from March tells us that in excess of 440,000 people are currently in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  We must not allow a long-term unemployment legacy to arise from this pandemic.  With the support of our department, Skillnet Ireland has been on the ground since July of last year helping those who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic to find new employment opportunities.<br/><br/>Our Skills Connect scheme operates on the basis of cross-sector employability.  By that I mean we help people move from sectors worst affected by the crisis to new jobs in growth sectors such as technology, healthcare, food production and in the green economy.  Some 1,200 companies are supporting these Skills Connect schemes by hosting work placements for jobseekers, which we then combine with upskilling courses and other career supports.  We have seen very strong employment outcomes to date through Skills Connect, with some programmes achieving an 80% conversion rate to employment.</p><p>Demand is strong, and we expect to support more than 8,000 jobseekers through Skills Connect this year.</p><p> I will now turn to climate change, the most pressing issue of our time, and the implications for businesses and workers as Ireland transitions to a low carbon and environmentally sustainable economy.  This month, we launched our climate ready initiative, which will equip business with the skills to manage climate action but also to thrive in the green economy.  In 2021, the initiative will see us support more than 1,100 companies and 3,000 workers in areas including sustainable business practices, skills for the renewables sector, clean water and sustainable finance.  At a minimum, we will invest &euro;10 million in green skills through the climate ready initiative over the coming four years.</p><p> Skillnet Ireland is funded through the national training fund.  Our 2021 allocation is &euro;41 million, representing approximately 5% of the fund in a given year.  However, it is important to stress to the committee that Skillnet Ireland operates on a cost sharing basis with employers, where our grants are combined with investment from businesses.  In 2019, employers made a total additional contribution of &euro;22 million to Skillnet Ireland training programmes.  This represents a highly efficient use of public moneys and an effective vehicle for State investment in the skills of our workers.  To meet an ever-increasing demand for our services, with the assistance of our Department we are now pursuing a number of participation opportunities on EU programmes.</p><p> I would like to make a number of recommendations.  In light of the challenges outlined, the Government should maintain a rigorous focus on developing the skills of those already in employment.  It should implement in full the recommendations arising from the independent evaluation of the national training fund undertaken by Indecon, including greater priority being placed on supporting in employment training.  It should also continue to expand demonstrably effective government and enterprise upskilling mechanisms, such as Skillnet Ireland, allowing us meet the serious demand we have, particularly from small firms that employ between 60% to 70% of our workforce.</p></speech>

My first series of questions will be those Deputy Conway-Walsh wanted to raise.  I thank the witnesses for their statements.  This is a crucial issue.  My first questions are for SOLAS and Mr. Brownlee.  As I understand it, in February 2021 almost 7,000 apprentices from five craft programmes were on waiting lists for off-the-job training.  At that stage, 1,800 of them had been waiting for more than a year.  This goes well above and beyond the Covid situation.  What is the situation at present, two months later?  Given that 1,800 people had been waiting for more than a year what are the non-Covid related causes of delay?  Why were there delays prior to Covid in the first place?  How will we clear the backlog and when can we expect it to be cleared?</p> <p>  My next question relates to the overall approach.  We welcome talk of a unified approach but there are some misgivings about the consortia-led model.  Some of the trade unions, including Connect, have been raising concerns that it is a move away from what has been a fairly successful model for craft apprenticeships under SOLAS.</p> <p>  The level of take-up under the consortia-led model has not been anything like what it was under the former model.  This led to some of the targets being missed.  Is it accurate to say that overall the approach is to move craft apprenticeships to this consortia-led model?  Will SOLAS no longer be the co-ordinating provider for craft apprenticeships once the migration is complete?  There are concerns.  We have a world-class apprenticeship model for training tradespeople and there are concerns that risks are being taken in this regard.</p> <p>  It has been said that the apprenticeship population is reaching 20,000.  My understanding of figures released by the Department is that there was an apprenticeship population of 28,500 in 2007 before many of these new apprenticeships were ever envisaged.  The 10,000 additional annual registrations would give us a population of 31,000 to 33,000 apprentices.  Proportionately, this leaves us a long way short of some of the more successful countries.  Given the importance and emphasis being placed on this and on expanding areas linked to the green economy and construction, is it ambitious enough?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.716" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021042700002#C00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will try to take the points in turn.  The Deputy is absolutely right that waiting lists are a significant worry and concern for SOLAS.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, training centres and institutions provide the off-the-job training and they have been effectively closed for nine of the past 12 months.  My understanding is that at the end of March we had more than 4,000 people waiting to get onto phase 2 training, which is the start of the pipeline.  They are waiting to go into training provided by education and training boards.  At the end of March, the number for phase 4 was just under 2,000 and for phase 6 it was 1,500.  It is a significant problem.  We know how urgent an issue it is.  We know how important it is for apprentices and employers.  We are absolutely committed to getting apprentices back into the training they need and deserve as soon as possible.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that this was an emerging problem before Covid.  At that point, we had approximately 1,000 people waiting to get into phase 2 training, which is the first step in the pipeline.  The reason for this was pretty simple.  The number of craft apprentices had been expanding rapidly in recent years and there was a capacity issue regarding ability to keep up.  The issue now is that the waiting lists are four times that level.  It is very much a Covid-driven problem but I accept there was an emerging problem before Covid happened.  There is definitely a clear action plan in place to address it.  We are going to expand capacity with the help of the Department.  A capital investment of &euro;20 million will be made in further education and training and higher education.  This will target in particular the areas of greatest strain, which are plumbing and electrical.  The good news is that we have apprentices back on site thanks to great work with the TUI, SIPTU, education and training boards, institutes of technology and technological universities.  We have had to do this in a safe and socially distanced way so there are capacity constraints.  They are finally back on site and this will help us address the throughput.</p> <p>  We continue to deliver online the components that we can as part of the training package because this can speed up the apprenticeship journey.  We are also looking at using competency assessments to see whether we can progress the apprentices.  We are working with the unions to see what flexibility and overtime arrangements can be put in place to deliver apprenticeships outside of the traditional training periods because this will be essential to move things forward.  This is the position on waiting lists.</p> <p>  The unified model of craft apprenticeships is very much part of the new action plan.  The Deputy is right that a plan is set out whereby SOLAS would effectively migrate out of the co-ordinating provider role for craft apprenticeships over the five-year lifetime of the plan.  The thinking behind this plan is that there has always been a bit of uneasiness between the roles in terms of management and oversight of the system and being a provider of education and training within the system.  There is a bit of a conflict about which we have always been concerned.  Another issue we need to take account of is that we have education and training providers, including education and training boards, institutes of technology and technological universities, with their own very well established quality assurance arrangements.  In a way, they should be very well placed to help reform-----</p></speech>

Unfortunately, if I have to take a call, the connection will be lost.  I hope that does not happen but I cannot prevent it.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their opening statements.  This is a really exciting area on which the committee has the privilege of working with the organisations represented.  The area on which I would like to focus is twofold and has been touched upon by the witnesses in their opening statements.  The first relates to the opportunities in terms of climate action and reskilling and the second concerns one of the unfortunate consequences of Covid-19, namely, high unemployment in the younger age groups in particular, which has been mentioned by both witnesses.  My focus will be primarily on the potential both organisations will bring to leaving certificate reform and how rebranding apprenticeships and on-the-job training can become a pathway to career progression for those who might not ordinarily focus on academic performance or the CAO system.</p> <p>  There are some identifiable constraints within the existing arrangement.  What work have the organisations represented, particularly SOLAS, put into evaluating how the process could be streamlined to ensure the apprenticeship programme that is being rolled out by the Minister, Deputy Harris, is a success?</p> <p>  My second question concerns what I would regard as a relatively small programme.  The plan to increase numbers by 10,000 over four years is, of course, welcome, but is there a constraint to making it a much larger programme or is it simply demand that is responsible for this?  Please forgive my ignorance if that sounds like a simplistic question.</p> <p>  On the issue of on-the-job training, I am encouraged to hear some of the numbers provided by the witnesses.  It is unusual for a group to come before the committee and set out conclusions and recommendations.  It is most welcome and I thank the witnesses for that.  My question relates to the identification of areas where Skillnet Ireland can step in and provide support to companies that are looking to diversify and provide more sustainable work for their employees and what steps Skillnet Ireland can take in that regard.  Perhaps Mr. Brownlee can respond initially.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.719" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021042700002#D00200"><p>On those points around making apprenticeship a more viable career option and looking at the importance and the role of the leaving certificate in that regard, there are a few things to say.  First, we have been focusing a lot on the Generation Apprenticeship campaign to raise awareness in schools of potential apprenticeship pathways.  We have been working with guidance counsellors, the National Parents Council Post Primary and the TUI to get the information out there.  However, clearly that is only part of the issue.  We have a system here where the focus of all school leavers' decisions on where to go next is around the CAO.  That lends itself to a situation where two thirds of school leavers go directly into higher education.  Indeed, there are even schools where 100% of school leavers go directly into higher education.  I believe there must be people in that cohort who are better suited to an apprenticeship or to a further education and training, FET, course, even it is part of a pathway to then go into higher education.</p> <p>  We are doing a few things in this area.  We are working with the CAO, the education and training boards, ETBs, and Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, to look at how we can find a way to put FET and apprenticeship options on the table at the same time as the higher education choices at that decision point when young people are talking to their families, teachers and career guidance counsellors about what to do next.  That is one part of it.  The other part, to which the Deputy has alluded, is around the leaving certificate.  A review of the senior cycle is currently being undertaken.  It is most important that that review looks at how we can embed vocational options and pathways within the senior cycle so that people can get a taster for careers in engineering, STEM, nursing and a whole range of different vocations, and can be encouraged to move into further education and training and apprenticeship.  That is very important.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the constraints on the scale and ambition of the programme.  I do not think there are such constraints, but I think you need to take apprenticeship as being part of an overall system.  There is massive potential for much more of role for further education and training and for higher education to work alongside those two offerings to give us a fit-for-purpose system which can meet the needs of the future world of work and society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.720" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021042700002#D00300"><p>In respect of the Deputy's question about helping business to diversify and become sustainable, it speaks to a broader question around our ability as a country to compete on the basis of talent, which is something we have been very successful at doing.  Having a high-skilled and agile workforce is a core part of our proposition in this country and how we win investment.  However, that is, of course, under immense strain all the time from factors such as technology in particular and how it is reshaping the workforce and skills.</p> <p>  In many ways, there is a twofold challenge that Skillnet Ireland is working on.  The first is how to maintain a highly skilled workforce in the context of the changes occurring with the introduction of new technologies and so on.  Our job really starts when people come out of the public education system, further and higher education and into work.  That is when they are in our hands.  We can boost their skills while they are in employment.</p> <p>  The second challenge that we are committed to is working with small firms, in particular.  We will support somewhere in the order of 16,000 to 17,000 SMEs this year.  It is important we help them because there are productivity challenges within our small firms of which the Deputy will be aware.  For workers within small firms, it is important their skills are not left behind due to productivity or innovation issues within the firm in which they are working.  It is a core part of the work we do in supporting hundreds of thousands of workers in small firms to remain competitive and have opportunities within their careers.</p> <p>  Therefore, the dual challenge we see is delivering a system that continues to produce high skills in respect of those in employment but which can also meet the skill challenges of those working in smaller firms.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.721" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021042700002#D00500"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh &aacute;r n-a&iacute;onna.  I wish to spend the few minutes I have asking the witnesses about three issues, namely, the shortage of skills we have to deal and contend with, the question of how we build the prestige around apprenticeship, and the issue of gender.</p> <p>  On the question of the shortage of skills, I am getting a picture that it is about trying to get people who are preparing for working life to think in terms of apprenticeship but also the vital work of providing ongoing training to people within the workforce to allow them to move or develop, as the case may be.  Will the witnesses give us some numbers to demonstrate how acute the shortage of skills in our economy is and to give examples of areas?</p> <p>  The second issue is that it is clear that there is a need to build the prestige around the notion of apprenticeship and to get people thinking and to make it part of higher education so that people have pathways and so on.  I am always very struck by the tradition of the journeymen apprentices that you would come across in other countries.  At the start of their careers they have elaborate costumes and there is a great pride in their professions.  Is this something that could be part of the necessary building up of the identity around apprenticeship for particular trades?  Is it something from which we could learn?</p> <p>  The third question concerns gender.  One of the aims of the reform of the apprenticeship model is to encourage more female apprentices.  Certainly, there is a huge disparity in areas like construction.  I believe that, currently, 5% of our apprentice cohort are female.  Does that mean there are particular barriers that need to be addressed, or is the desire to encourage more females into apprenticeship in pursuit of something else?  Is there another reason?  Is it about filling gaps in the market, drawing people from one sector of the economy to work in the other, or is there another reason?  The "why" is as important as the "what" in all of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.722" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021042700002#D00600"><p>I thank the Senator.  I will deal with the first of those points and then I will pass over to my colleague, Dr. Trant, who has been leading on a lot of work on how we build the prestige of apprenticeships and widen participation in them.</p><p> On the Senator's point regarding skills gaps and needs, we benefit from having the skills and labour market research unit based in SOLAS.  I am happy to send on more detailed statistics.  Principally, the highest level needs we are seeing at the moment are around tech and skills related to the construction sector.  The Senator hit on the fundamental point.  Our main concern with regard to skills is not the skills we need for today, but the skills we need for the future world of work.  It is fair to say that the days of doing a block of education and training between the ages of 17 and 21, and that serving people for the rest of their careers and their lives, are gone.  We need a system that allows people to upskill and reskill continually throughout their careers and their lifetimes.  We put a lot of focus into the workforce upskilling agenda through a programme called Skills to Advance.  The principal and initial target of that programme are the 900,000 people in the workforce, many of them older workers, who do not have the equivalent of junior or leaving certificate qualifications.  It is a really hard group to reach.  There is a role for further education and training, FET, at local level, working with employers to upskill these people so that their jobs remain sustainable and they can adapt to new technology.  </p><p> I am sure Mr. Healy will elaborate further on his role and workforce upskilling as well.  At this point, I will hand over to Dr. Trant to deal with the Senator's second and third points.</p></speech>

On building the prestige of apprenticeship, as mentioned by my colleague, Mr. Brownlee, there has been a lot of work going on over the last five years on the Generation Apprenticeship approach.  Thankfully, we have 60 programmes available now, up from 27 five years ago, which span all 21st century industries in Ireland.  The feedback is that employers have a huge role in promoting the benefits of apprenticeship as a pipeline in terms of what they offer people coming into their companies and the pathways they make available.  We have 25 ambassadors around the country who have been excellent in peer-to-peer engagement, but also in working with schools and engaging with teachers and students in schools about apprenticeship as a fantastic route to a career.</p> <p>  There are many countries in Europe where apprenticeship is well embedded and valued.  Obviously, our systems will never be the same.  We need a change in attitude to apprenticeship as a route of learning right up to PhD level.  Apprenticeships are really valuable and they have a huge amount to offer.  We need to get that on the table, and at the critical point when people are making decisions about what they want to do, how they propose to get started in their careers and how they propose to upskill.  The initiative, The Right Course, a website that presents everything together, introduced this year by the Minister, Deputy Harris, has been very helpful.  It presents, for the first time, all of the options to people and encourages conversations about what people want to do, be that an academic course or a course that is work based.  We have work to do.  The new action plan sets out a number of steps to be taken in that regard.  </p> <p>  On gender, the Senator is correct that there is a lot of work still to be done and also a need for a better understanding of the barriers, which vary.  The Senator mentioned construction.  The number of women in construction is relatively low.  There are employers who are doing a lot of really good work in this area and they have shown results.  Employers who have focused on this and encouraged women to come into their industry have that benefit and they are building on it.  There are many small companies that do not have the time and effort to do this.  This is where some of the supports nationally will come into play.  That will form part of the plan.</p> <p>  Approximately one year ago, Skillnet Ireland gave a talk to a girls school during which the question, "Why can't we access apprenticeships?", was asked.  That group of girls thought that apprenticeship was not for them.  This shows there is still a level of understanding needed in the system about apprenticeships and who can avail of them, including that they are open to people of all ages and backgrounds.  The next five years will be really important in building on the work that has happened.  We need to get the 5% we have already to a level that is much more representative of our population as a whole.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming to meet us again to discuss this important issue that has been forgotten for a long time, although I know significant work has been done in the area over the last few years.</p> <p>  A couple of issues come to mind.  I know that a lot of engagement is happening in secondary schools, but to what extent is our secondary school system designed in such a way that the natural route is to go into an academic third level course?  In terms of the subjects taught in secondary school in respect of the leaving certificate, our vision of what education means needs to change for us to see apprenticeships as the natural progression rather than pointing to them as another little thing that students can do, which is, perhaps, what it sounds like to young people.  They do not have the confidence in the practical experience that is required in an apprenticeship.  I believe apprenticeships and other routes need to be wrapped together.  We need a reform of second and third level so that further and higher education can come together, rather than us trying to advertise something that is not easily understood.  I would welcome the witnesses' thoughts on that.</p> <p>  On gender, which was raised by Senator Mullen as well, it is fantastic to see that real increase, but it is coming from a really low base.  As I understand it from the figures provided, it is 1,000 women out of a population of 20,000.  Females in politics know it is very difficult to put themselves into an area where everyone already in it is male.  Not everyone, but almost everyone, does not see themselves doing that.  Are there female mentors available who could be encouraged to take that lead and do something similar to Women for Election?  In regard to politics, it is often said that women have to be asked four times to go into politics whereas men put themselves forward.  This is because women do not see themselves in that area.  A lot more work is probably needed by all of us in that regard.  The witnesses might also offer their thoughts on that issue.</p> <p>  I would like to raise one final issue.  This is about what employers need as well as what people need to feel fulfilled.  That requires a response from Government, including in terms of the programme for Government.  I have a particular concern in regard to the 500,000 target provided for in the programme for Government in terms of retrofitting.  This is but one example of commitments in regard to the green economy.  Do the witnesses believe they are well placed to be able to respond to that need in terms of the apprenticeships currently in place and the people taking them up?  What more needs to be done to ensure that we hit our targets of 51% reduction in emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050?  The work done by Skillnet Ireland and SOLAS is critical to us hitting those targets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.727" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021042700002#E00500"><p>I thank the Senator.  The first two points in regard to the school system and how to develop female ambassadors and mentors can be separated.  We can be the agents for change in this area.  My first point is that we have an excellent education system, one that is respected worldwide.  Whatever we do, it is about building on that system.  It is not about ripping it up and starting again.</p><p>I totally agree with the Senator.  I remember a meeting of a previous incarnation of this committee at which a brilliant young female apprentice said that she was interested in vocational and technical subjects subject at age 12 or 13 when she went to secondary school.  However, she went to an all-girl school and because there was no one there to teach those subjects, they were not available as options.  There is a legacy problem in that many schools are designed to generate the academic CAO pipeline.  One aspect of our strategy, which we are exploring with the NCCA, is whether we can use further education colleges to offer taster modules for programmes as part of senior cycle or transition year so that we can bring the capability into schools.  A lot more people, particularly women, could be advised as to what options are available.  That is important.</p><p> In terms of green skills, there is a great deal to do and there is much that we are already focusing on.  We are developing and expanding a network of retrofitting and upskilling centres.  There are two NZEB centres in place and three more are planned.  We are updating apprenticeship curricula.  Perhaps Dr. Trant can talk about that in more detail.  We can provide more information after the meeting if the committee requires it.</p><p> The new FET strategy is trying to create a sense of a college of the future which deals with all of the points we have talked about, including a larger scale, a bigger identity within the community and region and bringing together what was traditionally further education and training activity.  Being a green campus is a prerequisite for all of that development.  Within the strategy, we have made a commitment that all FET provision will be used to develop knowledge of climate change and environmental issues.  There was a follow up in the programme for Government we talked about, a green further education and skills development plan.  There is real opportunity to embed that learning in every FET course so that we are effectively creating the agents of change and the new generation that will understand what needs to be done and help to drive us towards those targets.  We are working with the ETBs on that at the moment.  It is an exciting opportunity where no matter what further education course one does, there will be a sustainability component within it. </p></speech>

I can confirm that I am in Leinster House.  Many issues have been touched on already and I want to give the witnesses a platform to expand on some of the points they want to make because due to the limited time available, committee members can speak for longer than the witnesses.</p> <p>  I want to focus on youth unemployment, an issue I raised with the T&aacute;naiste in the D&aacute;il last Thursday.  The figure given was 59%, which has been challenged.  Whatever the percentage is - it may not be 59% because of the nature of the pandemic - it is still high.  The EU average is 17%.  The UK figure is 14%.  Our figure, while not the highest, is still remarkably high.  As I often say, the economic model offered to young people before now involved a lot of insecure and low paid work.  Some 23% of Irish workers are in low paid jobs.  How can we tackle youth unemployment and ensure that we do not return to an economic model which is dependent on insecure, low-paid employment?  That is for anybody to respond to.</p></speech>

We want to avoid the legacy of long-term unemployment affecting our youth arising from this crisis.  It brings into sharp focus the vulnerable nature of employment that predated the crisis to which the Deputy alluded.  We see this as an opportunity to address this problem and invest in people's skills , particularly the service and customer-facing sectors, and to provide options and career paths for them through investment in upskilling and lifelong learning.  In many ways, there is an opportunity in this crisis to help to tackle a problem that was a legacy issue before Covid ever arose.</p> <p>  I invite my colleague, Ms Donnery, to comment on some of the work we are doing to support jobseekers in particular, with a focus on moving people from the sectors most affected by the crisis, such as the services sector and so on, to growth sectors like technology, the green economy, private healthcare and others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.732" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tracey Donnery" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021042700002#F00500"><p>We launched a new programme, Skills Connect, last year.  We are developing programmes with businesses whereby they identify areas of job growth, especially in the technology sector, the green economy, food and agriculture.  Thirty four of our Skillnet networks are running programmes that provide people with job placements and career development in order that they can develop the confidence to return to employment or change career.  The programmes also provide technical skills and qualifications.</p> <p>  A new programme, Future in Tech, comprising eight different pathways, including cybersecurity and many other areas in the technology space, enables people to develop pathways.  They do not need to have prior experience in technology.  People can develop their skills at entry level and then reach a point at which they can choose one of eight different pathways.  We have found, for example, that people are moving from logistics and have an interest in technology.  There is a lot of support and mentoring from businesses.  We have 1,200 companies providing supports for individuals.</p> <p>  In the green space, the NZEB programme has been successful.  Young people in particular have become involved.  We have found that, like our main programme, Skillnet, the gender balance is 50-50.  One of the reasons for this is because we showcase best practice and examples.  It shows participants people who are like them doing the work.  It is one way in which we try to support and attract as many women as men to these programmes.</p> <p>  We have found that the gender balance of 50-50 has followed through across the different programmes.  A lot of that is down to showing people best practice examples, including videos and other things that will appeal to individuals so that they can see themselves in particular roles.  As part of this, we have a great programme, Women ReBOOT.  It supports women who are returning to the technology sector.  For years it has had a skills gap, which continues to be a problem.  It also has difficulty in retaining women and supporting and developing them further.  The programme supports women who may have worked in the technology sector and left it for a number of years, often due to caring responsibilities.  It aims to bring them back and support them in the sector.  Critical to this is the support provided to help the person to have the confidence to return to work, as well as specialist training and qualifications in the latest technology and the support of other peers.  I have spoken to a number of women involved who have told me that what attracted them the most was hearing from someone who has done it because they did not believe it was possible.</p> <p>  This involves the support of companies, from multinationals right down to small businesses, that are willing to mentor trainees, provide them with training placements and, ultimately, employ them.  Over 80% of those in the Women ReBOOT or TechSTART programmes have been employed.  The medtech sector is also engaging with women returners.  One of the supports we provide is helping people to return to these sectors.</p> <p>  There is a wide range of different programmes.  I have outlined a taste of some of them.  The key issue is how we promote this system, make it appeal to people and provide a mix of peer support and technical skills.  Often these programmes are between four and six months in length, with qualifications being recognised by the national framework of qualifications, as well as industry accreditation.</p></speech>

I was delighted to see the launch of the apprenticeship programme over the past few weeks.  The target was increased to up to 10,000 a year.</p><p>Mention has been made, including by Dr. Trant, of the broad range of apprenticeship programmes.  There are 60 and this is to be expanded to include another 18.  I really like the fact that the system is being opened to the public sector.  I would like to see local authorities, in particular, benefiting because it will really have an impact in regional areas.  There are so many skill sets in local authorities that we do not even know about, including in engineering, roads, communications, housing and planning.</p><p> I thank all the speakers.  I will direct my first questions to Dr. Trant.  On the apprenticeship programme, what is the process for a company to get registered?  I have had many queries on this, which is brilliant.  There were queries from various companies, including retailers and SMEs.  Could I have a brief description of how a company gets registered?  How long does it take in respect of retail?  I looked up the details today and saw sales but I did not see a category for retail.  What is the procedure for retail?</p><p> On ETBs and further education and training, there has been a lot of modernisation.  I was familiar with Galway and Roscommon ETB as a board member.  There has been a lot of modernisation to bring everything online.  That is from the operations point of view.  What supports are in place for the organisations to roll out SOLAS programmes and further education and training?  It was stated there are three areas we need to look at.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, launched this morning the regional workshops that will be targeting companies and telling them about additional incentives to take on apprentices.  It is so hard for SMEs and micro-enterprises.  How are they going to proceed?  Where are they going to have the bandwidth?  How can the apprenticeship office help them?</p><p> How is Dr. Trant engaging with career guidance teachers?  How will they support parents?</p><p> I have a question for Ms Donnery on Skillnet.  I thank her.  It is great to hear about the supports she has in place for women, including through having ambassadors and role models.  These are crucial, particularly when trying to get people involved in STEM.  Reports were produced by Science Foundation Ireland several years ago and it was discovered that the most important aspect is to have a female role model, be it someone you know, such as a family member, or a friend of your parents, so you can see your path is feasible.</p><p> Could Ms Donnery state three things Skillnet Ireland will be doing to support different types of enterprises, listing one each for micro-enterprises, retail and hospitality?  What is Skillnet Ireland going to do for SMEs and multinationals?  How is it getting involved with the regional skills forum, particularly the West Regional Skills Forum?  I thank all the delegates.</p></speech>

For employers interested in getting registered, there is an online process.  They can submit an expression of interest on <i>www.apprenticeship.ie</i>and this gets passed on.  Contact is made with the relevant ETB in the region and there is follow-up and a visit.  There is a bit of support regarding what the apprenticeship is and making sure the employer is prepared.  The employer becomes registered in that way and approved to employ apprentices.  It can be a quite quick process, especially if an employer is already familiar with the apprenticeship system.  Generally, it just takes a short number of weeks.  We now have over 7,000 employers using apprenticeship.  This is almost double the number six or seven years ago, so it is growing.<br/><br/>We are working on the technology base.  Covid has really emphasised the need to have accessible ways of using these processes and getting employers on board.  Part of the work ahead will be to streamline those systems.<br/><br/>On the ETBs and the online aspect, we have had investment in technology-enhanced learning since 2018 and 2019.  This was really fortunate because it meant ETBs were quite well prepared when Covid arrived and people needed to switch online.  There has been a lot of investment in upskilling staff and many online courses and supports.  We went fully online with <i>www.apprenticeship.ie</i>from January this year, and that all worked smoothly.  Obviously, there were challenges with a practical course but it meant that apprentices remained engaged and were able to continue, and that they now have completed their training.<br/><br/>On engaging with career guidance teachers, we work very closely with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors.  We go to every conference.</p></speech>

Skillnet Ireland provides opportunities for businesses to collaborate and determine their skills needs.  Key to what we will be doing is ensuring all businesses will have the opportunity to develop the talent they need.  One of the strengths of the model is that we enable smaller businesses to work alongside larger multinationals to develop the skills needed for the particular sector or region, including by horizon scanning and looking to see what is coming next.  We ensure that the best practice of the larger companies, which can sometimes be more advanced, can be shared with the smaller companies.</p> <p>  The three things we will be doing with businesses include broadening the base of businesses we support.  We already support all the larger companies and most mid-size companies but there are still plenty of smaller companies that we could support.  We would be giving them opportunities to determine, using their own voice, what skills they need, particularly in the focus area of SME productivity.  In this regard, there can be a very wide range of programmes, depending on the sector, be it aviation, nursing homes or manufacturing.  It is also a matter of supporting the companies in developing the skills needed for digitalisation.  I am referring to building digital skills, digital literacy and digital capacity, but also the capacity to understand digital models or changes to businesses and business models.  In addition, we have recently launched our Climate Ready programme.</p></speech>

Ultimately, the manager finds out their business needs and which of those require training.  Skillnet can work and effectively act as a training manager for those concerned.</p></speech>

This is the second year in a row without a written junior certificate examination.  Last year, there were difficulties certifying those who were leaving school after their junior certificate to ensure they could enter an apprenticeship.  Ultimately, the Minister provided an interim letter of confirmation after some pressure from ourselves and others.  I want to know whether this is being boxed off for this year.  Can we ensure that there will be no repeat of the delays faced by those leaving school after the junior certificate and that they will be able to access apprenticeships swiftly and without any complications?</p><p>On the future of apprenticeships, a lot of work has gone into <i>www.apprenticeship.ie</i>but I hear complaints about it not being user-friendly.</p><p>The feedback is that <i>apprenticeship.ie </i>is not user-friendly and that there are some difficulties with it.  Are there plans to revise or update the platform because that is something that I receive feedback on?<br/><br/>This is probably a peculiar point but it occurred to me as we are speaking here.  I can think of instances where people I have known with smaller businesses would have provided an apprentice to somebody they knew who may have been struggling and not had a job for while and who probably might not have otherwise provided an apprenticeship to this person.  This would have allowed that person to serve their time with them but they allowed that because of the circumstances that young person was in.  There is obviously a logic to a unified approach and everyone having a fair crack of the whip but will there be a flexibility on the ground for circumstances such as that?<br/><br/>Similarly, are we taking enough cognisance of the fact that many people who would offer apprenticeships would run businesses that are quite small?  Are we taking cognisance also of their ability to negotiate this new consortia-led model?<br/><br/>Finally, I raise the lack of painting apprenticeships in Cork, which Mr. Brownlee would be familiar with.  The Rossa Avenue facilities are still idle.  I know specialists in the field who have told me that Irish customers are looking to Britain to find skilled painters, particularly decorative painters, and this seems to be a waste of local talent.  Is there any update on that?</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, in 2020 there was an agreement that a State certificate or letter would be supplied along with a skill report which would get a person over the previous criteria of having to have 5 Ds in one&rsquo;s junior certificate to access an apprenticeship.  It worked.  I got statistics from the apprenticeship team this morning that 25% of our apprentices in 2020 came through that junior certificate route.  It worked even if it took longer than we would have wanted to get the system in place.  The same conditions apply this year, so I hope the Deputy will not see any of those same issues this year because there will be clarity that that is the approach from the start.<br/><br/>I will ask Dr. Trant speak to the Deputy about the <i>apprenticeship.ie</i>website because we launched that in the last few weeks.  Hopefully, that will alleviate the issues that the Deputy found there in the past.<br/><br/>On the Deputy&rsquo;s SME question, that is a very valid point.  It is something that the apprenticeship incentivisation scheme for employers tried to deal with.  It has given employers a &euro;3,000 payment to take on a young person on an apprenticeship.  I want to return to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in&rsquo;s question on youth training and upskilling because we have a great deal to say on that but I will do that later on.<br/><br/>The Deputy is correct in that there is a sense that if one is with the ESB, one gets the &euro;3,000 incentive and if one is an SME, one gets the same incentive.  The action plan identified the need for additional SME supports to be provided to try to persuade those businesses about which the Deputy talked to take a chance without too much of a financial hit and to take on that local person they may feel deserves a chance.  That is definitely something that we need to focus on.  It is a focus in the action plan.<br/><br/>On the question regarding painting and decorating, we  followed up with Cork Education and Training Board which I believe was in contact with the Deputy.  There is a workshop available and it is just a question of demand at present.  The Deputy referred to some evidence of there being demand and of taking people from the UK at a system level but we do not see that demand.  My understanding is that there is only one workshop offering a painting and decorating apprenticeship at the moment and that is in Ballyfermot.  That is something we continue to monitor and if we can get evidence of that demand, that is certainly something we can look at resurrecting.  <br/><br/>I will hand over to Dr. Trant to speak about the new website.</p></speech>

We will be looking for feedback through a detailed survey of users.  The anecdotal feedback is very positive so far but once it is up and running for a while, we will be receiving feedback.  If there are any ongoing issues that the Deputy is aware of, we will be very happy to take that on board and build it into the ongoing work.  We are looking at the updating of the website as phase 1 and there will be further phases.  There is a great deal more technology and streamlined systems that we can build into the website and that is part the new action plan for the future.  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question directly as to whether the website is going to be revised and updated, we have done a fair amount of work on it and this will continue.  I hope this will be of help to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I will start by asking Mr. Healy about the extraordinary levels of youth unemployment at present.  Obviously, it is contributed to significantly by Covid-19 but what role does he see the apprenticeship issue playing in trying to resolve youth unemployment so that we do not have a long-term problem in this country?   As I am sure he will appreciate, the most destructive thing that can happen to any economy is that there are high levels of persistent youth unemployment.  I would be interested in hearing his views on that and then perhaps Mr. Brownlee&rsquo;s views on the same issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.754" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021042700002#H01000"><p>I will pick up on Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's question as well.  Obviously, dealing with youth unemployment and providing young people with opportunities at top skills has been part of the DNA of further education and training for a long time.  As we mentioned, we have the apprenticeship incentivisation scheme for employers, which is trying to persuade employers to take that chance and take on young people.  There is also a whole range of programmes in further education and training, FET, that are specifically designed to help young people to upskill and to take them directly into jobs and employment.  In Youthreach, we have specific skills training and a significant amount of post-leaving certificate, PLC, provision which has incredible success at taking people into really interesting jobs and careers, together with community training centre provision.  The key for us is to mobilise that provision and ensure the capacity is there to deal with this immense demand that we have at present, which both Deputies have identified as being a real issue and concern.  We are trying to ensure that the places are available.</p> <p>  There is also a cultural issue where there is a large number of young people who cannot walk into jobs, no matter how insecure they previously would have been, and have no access to any income-earning potential.  They probably do not think of further education and training or even an apprenticeship as a viable option because there has been that predominance of higher education choices almost as part of the psyche.  We need to focus on trying to persuade them that there are opportunities out there, even online opportunities through e-college.  We could perhaps also look at the system of support that we give them.  For example, SUSI support is available for all higher education and PLC provision but if one wants to do a traineeship at the same level, level 5 or level 6 as PLC, one does not have access to SUSI, instead one is asked to sign on for welfare support to take one through the course.  That type of system creates a kind of divide and a perception that that type of upskilling and help is not for certain people but this is a key focus and an issue.  We have put in place an initiative called Skills to Compete which is all about addressing those structural issues in the labour market as a result of Covid-19.  This is a three-pronged initiative.  One is about giving the person the employability skills that will help him or her to get a job.</p><p>Second, it is about giving people access to the digital skills they will need for any job in the future world of work.  Third, it is about targeting skills in specific occupations.  That might be technology, green skills, energy and opportunities like those.  There is a whole range of responses and I am happy to follow up with a more detailed outline of what they are.</p></speech>

On his specific question about youth unemployment, we are dealing with that under three headings.  The first of these is cross-sector employability, namely, helping people to achieve a movement, a career transition, from the affected sectors, particularly the customer-facing sector, into growth opportunities in technology and other parts of the economy.  The second heading relates to how the work we do is very close to employment.  We are working hand-in-hand with employers so we are seeing, almost in real time, the skills gaps, the jobs they are trying to fill and so on.  We are helping to match those with suitable jobseekers we are upskilling.  The last heading relates to work placement.  It is not just an isolated training programme which might be taken online, this is fully integrated with work.  The places we offer to jobseekers and to the very concerning numbers of youth unemployed come with a mandatory work placement, where they are being hosted among 1,200 businesses which are voluntarily supporting us.  In respect of many of these schemes, particularly in technology, we are seeing a conversion rate to employment of 80% or more.  Therefore it is about quick interventions, not letting the problem fester over time and not having a long-term youth unemployment legacy arising from this pandemic.</p></speech>

What can we do to try to direct more students toward the apprenticeship avenue and maybe give them an opportunity to recognise it is a more attractive avenue for them than, say, going down the CAO route, which is the more orthodox path presented to them?</p></speech>

It is about senior cycle reform so there are more vocational options and pathways available.  It is about supporting the work we are doing to try to bring FET and apprenticeship options into that decision point at CAO time.  It is about reform of further education, apprenticeships and higher education itself, making it more focused on providing people with the kind of lifelong learning and workforce upskilling opportunities that will facilitate the continual upskilling and reskilling that we need.  It is about backing that green skills agenda as well because there is so much potential for that and it probably just needs a bit more investment in the development and establishment of the capability and infrastructure that will make it happen.  Of course there is also investment in capacity and in capital infrastructure and in the staffing and resources that will allow us to expand capacity to the extent we need to in order to deal with the waiting list problem, but also to the extent that we need to meet our ambition in the national apprenticeship plan and our own FET strategy.</p></speech>

In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, they have put apprenticeship programmes on the roadmap.  It is greatly appreciated and is very much a priority within the new Department.  Looking for more women to participate is very much welcome.</p> <p>  My question is for both organisations.  I wish to concentrate on the hospitality sector, with which I have had a lot of meetings and interactions over the last while.  Representatives have spoken about how a lot of their own staff will not be coming back and reskilling and retraining and everything like that and I am aware that both the Minister and Minister of State have mentioned this.  I ask both organisations to outline what they are doing for the hospitality sector and maybe what additional resources or opportunities are there for the sector.  Perhaps Mr. Brownlee will go first.</p></speech>

The hospitality sector is of concern in a number of ways.  There are a couple of really good apprenticeship programmes up and running for that sector.  I might ask Dr. Trant to come in on those in a minute.  We are doing a lot.  We launched a workforce upskilling initiative for the hospitality sector, so while it is in this period of inactivity in which its businesses are constrained, we are rolling out, through Skills to Advance, a range of upskilling initiatives to develop its leadership and management capability.  A major initiative to develop the sector's understanding of green skills and sustainability was launched in the last few weeks.</p> <p>  We are obviously providing them with access to e-college and a whole range of upskilling and reskilling opportunities.  One of the sector's real concerns was on the affordability of having to subsidise the off-the-job training of its apprentices.  That is something the new apprenticeship action plan is trying to address.  It is saying it is going to address the lack of parity between employers who take on craft apprentices and those who take on apprentices under the newer programmes and give a grant in order that there is more support for employers and they are not taking as much of a financial hit.  That could have a big impact on the hospitality sector.  Dr. Trant may wish to come in on the apprenticeships in that space at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.767" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary-Liz Trant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021042700002#J01300"><p>As Mr. Brownlee mentioned, there are three apprenticeships in the area, namely, commis chef, chef de partie and sous chef.  There were over 203 apprentices in training when the pandemic hit last year.  Due to the fact that a lot of the employer's premises were not able to remain open and training centres and institutes of technology were shutting down as well, it was really challenging.  The training providers have done a lot of work to move online and to keep the apprentices on board.  By and large that has worked and helped.  The real focus is to help those apprentices to complete and then, hopefully once the vaccine gets rolled out and the country opens back up again, there is going to be a huge amount of demand and new opportunities in the industry for those apprentices once again.  There is no doubt it has been an industry really badly hit.  There is an awareness in the industry of the long-term need for a pipeline, through apprenticeship, for example, and the importance of sticking with it.  Recruitment is on hold for the moment in 2021 but that is unsurprising.  However, we are hopeful that, in supporting the current crop of apprentices to get through, there will be new opportunities as things start to open up and the pipeline will get going again.</p></speech>

For example we have a restaurant skillnet and this year we have launched a new hospitality skillnet with the Irish Hotels Federation because despite there being issues, a lot of companies are using this time to upskill their employees.  As Dr. Trant said there, this relates both to developing the management skills but also to the skills of the staff.  We also have a skillnet in the fitness and leisure sector, which is part of this wider sector.  The key supports which we have found to be very beneficial to the sector this year include our mentors work programme.  It is dedicated to supporting leaders, owners and SMEs in re-examining their business models, looking to shift business online, looking at either of the pillars of financing their business, their people, operational efficiencies or digitalisation.  There has been a high take-up among businesses within that sector.  We have also seen great collaboration from some in the sector, such as the Restaurant Association of Ireland and others, which are working together to develop programmes which will help the businesses be ready for reopening.  Our ReBound programme was also very valuable and had great take-up, particularly with helping businesses be ready to ensure their staff would be safe when they had an opportunity to reopen last year.</p><p> We have a lot going on in that regard.</p><p> We also find that across all our regional networks, which are mixed sectoral networks, they are putting in place many supports to help the staff from the hospitality sector to develop their skills to allow them move to another sector while there are opportunities.  Also, there are many women in this area, some of whom are part-time workers.  They have been able to upskill and equip themselves to be ready to take on a job in a new area, for example, medical technology or technology.  Luckily, all of those networks are still going strong and still finding great demand from the businesses to upskill their staff.  We are providing them with supports to keep that going.</p></speech>

I know from speaking to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, that there is an appetite for this within the Department.  I would encourage both SOLAS and Skillnet Ireland to do all they can for this sector because it will be very important post-Covid in terms of economic recovery.</p> <p>  I have two further questions and I invite Mr. Healy and Mr. Brownlee to comment.  Later this year the committee will examine the issue of reform of the leaving certificate.  Do Mr. Healy and Mr. Brownlee have any thoughts on how more vocational options, including apprenticeships, for school leavers could be promoted and encouraged?  It is an opportune time to examine reform of the leaving certificate because of Covid-19.  The current leaving certificate system is outdated; I have been saying that on the public record in recent years.  Whether we introduce continuous assessment or whatever we have to give every student every opportunity.  Some people want to go to third level to do different courses but we have to look at the apprenticeships also, what those skills have to offer and how we could incorporate the leaving certificate into that.  Mr. Healy might begin by making a brief comment followed by Mr. Brownlee because I do not want to be taking time from everybody else.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.771" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021042700002#K00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I will comment briefly but it is probably largely in Mr. Brownlee's domain.  In the reform of the leaving certificate there may be an opportunity to integrate more subjects with the reality of work, for example, to help people in that transition into employment directly after their leaving certificate.  What aspects of the leaving certificate could be moved from rote learning and expressing one's memory onto a page?  What can be done within the curriculum?  How can the curriculum be modified to make it a more pragmatic intervention in the life of a student, not just in terms of the academic process but in preparing them for a long life of work and moving into employment either directly after the leaving certificate or directly after further or higher education?  I will hand over to Mr. Brownlee for the broader answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.772" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021042700002#K00400"><p>I thank Mr. Healy.  I touched on some of this earlier but there are probably three fundamental aspects that I would like the committee to examine.  The first is the embedding of vocational options as part of the senior cycle.  As Mr. Healy mentioned, there is an opportunity now to do that.  There is a system in Scotland where further education colleges deliver modules effectively as part of the leaving certificate or highers, as they are called in Scotland.  There is real potential to look at a similar system to get those kind of vocational options and experiences on the table, particularly in schools that do not have the technical teaching capability to look at delivering them.</p> <p>  The second is around CAO reform.  We need to find a way to put further education and apprenticeship options on the table at exactly the same time as higher education choices for our school leavers.  That needs to be done either via the CAO system directly or a parallel system that sits alongside that.  It is very important that we can reinforce that aim.</p> <p>  The third aspect is around the role of the transition year, TY.  If we can embed taster modules and experiences as part of TY that give students a flavour for the many great apprenticeship and further education opportunities we will sow the seeds and then build on that through the other two interventions after that.</p></speech>

I think we are still having Microsoft Teams issues.  My question is a follow-up one for Mr. Brownlee.  It was just a remark with regard to bringing the apprenticeship programme into the schools at a stage where decisions were being made by students in terms of their future.  It might have been a turn of phrase.  I would have thought that bringing it in before that would have been appropriate on entry into the senior cycle.  Does Mr. Brownlee have a comment to make on that?</p> <p>  Other witnesses might wish to contribute on the point that the future of the leaving certificate, as raised by the Chairman, which is a matter for discussion at this committee, will involve new pathways to careers, as we mentioned earlier.  If we are to provide the information to students within secondary schools we have to do it as early as possible so that in conjunction with reform of the CAO process and the leaving certificate it is seen as a real pathway.  Do the witnesses have a comment to make on that?</p></speech>

I did not mean to imply that it should not be something we focus on before the leaving certificate time.  Transition year is a very good opportunity to sow some of the seeds but we should be talking about using all the initiatives in recent years to build understanding of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, even at primary school level as well as secondary level.  As part of those conversations we should be telling students that there are many apprenticeships and FETAC courses they can pursue as part of that to that.  It is to get people to start thinking at a much earlier stage that that might be for them.  I totally agree with the Deputy.  I was talking about the fact that when young people make their actual choice about what is next they do not even see those apprenticeship or further education opportunities when they are talking to their teachers, parents or guidance counsellors.  If they do not have the options on the table, how can they persuade a bigger proportion to go for it?  The Deputy is right.  That will only work if we sow the seeds at an earlier stage to allow them make the decision.</p></speech>

Martin.  Ar son an choiste, ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire, Teachta Coveney, agus a chomhghleacaithe go dt&iacute; an cruinni&uacute; inniu.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his colleagues from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We are looking forward to this exchange this evening regarding the protocol and where things are at.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity against legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present in the building.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin or both, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contribution to the meeting.</p> <p>  I call on the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

This week we will finalise the ratification of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  The European Parliament today completes its scrutiny of the agreement.  I hope and expect it to be endorsed by the European Parliament when the result of its consent vote is announced tomorrow morning.  This will allow for the final formalities to be completed.</p><p>D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, of course, adopted by acclamation a motion of support in January.  Ratifying the agreement will put a full toolbox at our disposal to make the best of the new framework for EU-UK co-operation.  The agreement provides for 23 dedicated committees and working groups, under an overall EU-UK partnership council to oversee the implementation of all aspects of the EU-UK relationship, with a view to making them work as well as possible.  These will become forums where the EU can come together with the UK to iron out the practical details of how we co-operate on issues from trade to aviation to law enforcement.  Ireland and all EU member states will have the right to participate in these meetings as part of the EU delegation.  We hope that the work of these joint bodies can begin as soon as possible.  We look forward to engaging in them fully in support of our interests and values.</p><p>This week&rsquo;s developments are something of a milestone in opening up new paths for us to maximise the potential of the agreement.  They also serve as a timely reminder of what the agreement has gained for us and, importantly, what it avoided.  It is not so long ago that the daily newspaper headlines questioned whether an EU-UK agreement would be possible at all.  Members of the committee are all too familiar with what a no-deal outcome would have meant for this island.  In addition to tariffs and quotas, such an outcome would have severely constrained co-operation in key sectors such as transport, energy and policing.  The ESRI found that, over the long term, a trade deal would almost halve the negative impact on our GDP of no deal.</p><p>The agreement does not, nor could it, replicate the <i>status quo ante.</i>It means, however, that these important forms of co-operation and trade can continue, although in a new framework.  The adjustment to the new reality created by the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, and with it the Single Market and customs union, has been challenging.  There can be no doubt that the Government&rsquo;s years of long planning and major investment in financial supports and infrastructure were entirely justified.  While we have mitigated against the worst possible outcomes, we were always clear that no level of preparation could have entirely allayed the effects of Brexit.  Our fishers, hauliers, as well as our importers and exporters, are at the sharp end of the unavoidable changes brought by Brexit.  We continue to engage with these sectors closely.  The Government remains wholeheartedly committed to providing all of the support and guidance it can as we navigate these challenges together.</p><p>The EU-UK Trade Cooperation Agreement is, of course, not the only treaty that establishes new EU-UK arrangements.  The withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, also provides a vital framework that is of particular importance for this island.  The protocol is the only solution to the problems created by Brexit for the island of Ireland.  We firmly support ongoing contacts between the EU and the UK on its full implementation.</p><p>The Government respects and has listened to the concerns voiced by some on aspects of how the protocol operates.  From my own engagements with the European Commission Vice-President, Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, I know the EU is doing everything possible to reflect these concerns and, working with the UK, to implement the protocol in a way that impacts as little as possible on people&rsquo;s everyday lives and trade.  I welcome particularly the recent commitment to the joint EU-UK engagement with Northern Ireland stakeholders in the weeks ahead on the issues involved.  Last week we saw the start of that engagement with the business community and other leaders.</p><p>I firmly believe that by acting together within the framework of the protocol, the EU and UK can find solutions to the outstanding issues.  I welcome the recent constructive engagements between Vice-President &Scaron;efoviand Lord Frost.  Finding a sustainable and collaborative way forward is ultimately to the benefit of all communities in Northern Ireland, as well as to the EU and UK as a whole.  It will also foster stability that, given recent concerning disturbances in Northern Ireland, is needed now more than ever.</p><p>All committee members want to see the protocol and the EU-UK Trade Cooperation Agreement operate as effectively as possible.  I look forward to the committee members&rsquo; interventions and to answering all of the questions they may have.</p><p>I thank the Chair and, as I say, I am at his disposal for questions for as long as is necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.787" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1552" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021042700002#B00200"><p>I thank the Minister for that overview of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol.  The British Prime Minister has spoken about "getting the barnacles off" the Northern Ireland protocol and "sandpapering" it into shape, whatever that means.  The UK Government has unilaterally extended the six-month grace period, resulting in the EU taking legal action.  Checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland across the Irish Sea ceased for a time.  Are there many outstanding issues to be resolved with the protocol?  Is the Minister confident these operational difficulties can be resolved by way of pragmatic solutions?  Would it be fair to say businesses in Northern Ireland are slowly coming to terms with the protocol and how it is operating and with figuring out just what is involved in it?</p> <p>  I refer to the recent disturbances in Northern Ireland, as mentioned by the Minister.  Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol are cited as one of the reasons for these disturbances, although we know the situation is more complex than that.  The DUP has a five-point plan to do away with the Northern Ireland protocol.  I am conscious of developments in the DUP this evening so I do not want to say anything to interfere with that.  It would appear the DUP not attending meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council is part of its plan.  Is it the Minister's understanding that it is boycotting meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council?  That would be a disappointment, given those meetings are so important for the shared island initiative.  Are there any plans for a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference?  Following on from that, would the Minister agree that all parties and both Governments must renew their commitment to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and make it work so that the hard-won peace we have can be maintained?</p> <p>  I refer to the protocol again and to the unique opportunities for Northern Ireland presented by same in terms of new investment and jobs.  The Central Statistics Office has published trade statistics for Ireland for the first two months of this year.  These statistics indicate that trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland showed a dramatic improvement and this was in Northern Ireland's favour.  What can the Irish Government do to highlight the benefits of the Northern Ireland protocol to Northern Ireland as part of our foreign policy objectives?</p></speech>

It is like "The Krypton Factor" as the Minister has about a minute and a half to answer five questions, but we will show a wee bit of latitude.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.789" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021042700002#B00400"><p>It would not be a great situation if we used all of the time for questions and did not get any answers.  If I miss something now, I will try to pick it up in the next round because there will be similar questions from many Deputies.</p> <p>  The British Prime Minister has described their approach to trying to amend elements of the protocol and its implementation in colourful language, as he often does, when he talks about barnacles and sandpaper.  What he means is he wants to try to make it more acceptable and to smooth over some of the areas that have caused significant political friction.  In principle, both the UK and the EU want to try to do that together where they can.  They also have to, and the EU in particular has to, ensure they do that within the confines of the protocol itself.  These discussions are not a renegotiation of the protocol.  It is about using the flexibilities that are there to the maximum extent possible to try to find a pragmatic and flexible way of implementing the protocol that minimises the impact on trade in Northern Ireland on goods coming from Great Britain.  There is no friction at all on goods going the other way.</p> <p>  The unilateral action of the British Government was deeply unhelpful.  It set back relationships significantly at a time when there was some momentum in discussions between both sides to try to find ways in which, for example, grace periods could be extended and other flexibilities could be found to try to deal with some of the pragmatic frustrations in Northern Ireland linked to the implementation of the protocol earlier in the year.  Unfortunately, unilaterally announcing an extension to grace periods and other unilateral actions around soil, plants and so on were actions that undermined trust and relationships and that have ultimately resulted in the EU preparing a legal action.  It is to be hoped that will not be needed, but unless trust can be rebuilt, which it is being, the EU will have no choice but to look at those options.</p> <p>  What is outstanding?  The discussions on the relationship between Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and Lord Frost have improved significantly and it is important to say that.  Their technical teams have been working closely together to try to itemise what parts of the protocol can be managed in a way that, first, allows the implementation of the protocol to be robust and to protect the integrity of the Single Market and, second, can be done in a way that minimises disruption to trade.  There are about 26 issues that have been itemised in that discussion so far and about 20 of them can be resolved through technical negotiation.  Then there are about half a dozen issues that are much more political and more difficult to deal with.  Those issues may involve negotiation and changes in approach that can allow the protocol to be implemented more easily.</p> <p>  If one takes, for example, the most high profile of those issues, namely sanitary and phytosanitary standards, SPS, we know that previously the EU had effectively offered what it terms as "dynamic alignment" for the UK with EU SPS standards.  There would have been no need for checks on live animals, foodstuffs, plants or soil if there was an SPS dynamic alignment agreement across plant health, food and animals.  The UK Government decided not to do that.  It does not like the idea of dynamic alignment because it does not want to be tied to EU rules and EU rule-setting.  Instead, it proposed an agreement around equivalence of standards and that the EU would recognise UK standards as equivalent to the EU.  That was unacceptable to the EU for understandable reasons.  I hope the negotiating teams will be able to look at this space and see whether there is a middle ground position between dynamic alignment and equivalence on SPS standards.  Such a position could dramatically reduce the number of tests that are required on goods coming into Larne and Belfast ports from Great Britain into the Northern Ireland market and into the Single Market via Northern Ireland.  That is something that is a political decision and not just a technical one that both sides need to try to make progress on.</p> <p>  There are a few other areas of discussion, such as where medicines get approval and for how long.  The EU wants to ensure there are no barriers to medicines finding their way into Northern Ireland, particularly in the middle of a pandemic.  At the same time, we cannot have a situation where medicines are being approved in the UK for Northern Ireland and then sold on into the Single Market where there is essentially a UK approvals mechanism providing medicines into the EU Single Market and bypassing the European Medicines Agency.</p><p>Obviously, that cannot be facilitated.  How do we secure stability of supply of medicines into Northern Ireland but not in a way that undermines the integrity of the EU Single Market on medicines?  Likewise, there is a series of issues on tariffs, steel being perhaps the best example.  Again, we are trying to ensure that Northern Ireland can have access to steel but that it would not be used as a vehicle to import steel into the EU Single Market and avoid tariffs in doing so.  There are some issues around that as well.</p><p> Issues less linked to the protocol but that are linked to the broader trade and co-operation agreement that I think relate to Northern Ireland that need further discussion are around country of origin labelling and the consequences for goods produced in Northern Ireland that are effectively British goods being able to benefit or not from EU trade agreements that need to apply from a country of origin perspective to EU-produced goods.  That is a big issue for some in the agrifood sector, particularly around the dairy industry where a very significant portion of Northern Ireland's milk is processed south of the Border and in many cases is in a mixed milk pool with milk in the Republic of Ireland that is turned into powders, butters, cheeses, yoghurts, infant formula and a whole range of other things.  Country of origin issues need further discussion and negotiation.  That is also true of other supply chain issues, where, for example goods that originate in the EU that go to a distribution centre in the UK and are essentially re-boxed or repackaged and redistributed back into Ireland, into the Single Market, whether or not tariffs apply to those goods - at the moment they do - because they are no longer considered EU goods because the integrity of those goods are not monitored in the EU Single Market when they are re-boxed or re-badged in the UK, but nor are they UK goods because they are not produced in the UK.  The goods are effectively stateless and, therefore, tariffs apply.  There is a whole range of issues that need discussion in a way that is facilitated by pragmatic partnership between the EU and the UK to try to find solutions to many of these issues.  If we could find a way forward on sanitary and phytosanitary controls, SPS, that could significantly reduce the inspection burden on goods coming into Northern Ireland ports from Great Britain which would be a win for everybody.  Hopefully, it is something we can see some progress on.</p><p> I will make no comments on the DUP other than in the context of the North-South Ministerial Council.  Yes, there was an issue about a DUP Minister not being present at a transport North-South Ministerial Council but the meeting subsequently happened and there was a Minister present.  There is a potential issue about an agricultural North-South Ministerial Council meeting tomorrow but we will have to see what happens with that later this evening.</p><p> Of course the Good Friday Agreement is our Northern Star in terms of trying to protect its institutions and foundation as the basis of relationships, respect and institutional interaction both within Northern Ireland, North-South on the island of Ireland and also east-west between the British and Irish Governments.  To that effect, we are hoping to have a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at some point in the coming weeks and months because there are many issues that Dublin and London need to be talking to each other about in the context of Northern Ireland and the relationship between these islands.</p><p> Finally on the opportunity for the Northern Ireland protocol, it is not something that is being discussed yet but believe me, it will be in time.  I refer to the business opportunities for Northern Ireland where they have a foot in both markets.  Anyone producing goods in Northern Ireland has unfettered access into the GB market and completely unfettered access into the EU Single Market for goods.  That has got to be a significant business opportunity for Northern Ireland, which I hope that, when over time we address, in a pragmatic and flexible, way the political differences and tensions around the protocol, can be a source of optimism, investment and opportunity for businesses in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his very detailed first set of responses.  This committee has been very actively engaged in looking at the outworking of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement since it was published.  Rather than focusing on minutia, I would like a broader perspective from the Minister on the tone of the commentary coming both from the EU and the UK.  I was struck today by the reported comments of President von der Leyen to the European Parliament as it debated the ratification of the agreement.  She said quite emphatically that the Trade and Cooperation Agreement has real teeth and that vigilance will be required and that the EU will not hesitate to take action if there are breaches.  I thought it was a fairly belligerent assertion of the strength of the agreement.  The Minister already spoke of the British Ministers unilaterally making decisions outside the confines of the agreement and the co-operation and understanding of their partners and Ministers making statements, basically air brushing the EU out of issues now, except to make disparaging comments about the EU in relation to vaccine roll-out.  President von der Leyen said that history would judge what our future relationship will be, but we have to set the tone of history, do we not?  What is Ireland's role in that?  The Minister talked about the EU-UK partnership council.  Will he share his vision of Ireland's role in that and how we can ensure that there is a really constructive future relationship between the EU and the UK?</p> <p>  My second question relates to some of the difficulties experienced by industry.  Understandably the Minister's comments have been largely on industry in Northern Ireland but the UK, as he rightly said, made the decision to prioritise regulatory divergence over alignment and that has caused problems.  I was contacted by a very substantial company in my constituency which has a real problem with the export health certification, EHC, of all animal product origin.  It is the most significant individual change.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine proposes to manage that certification by way of veterinary certification.  That requirement to a vet-certified EHC is taking approximately ten days whereas the competitor companies producing the same product in the Netherlands and Germany, also exporting into the United Kingdom, have a turnaround of less than five days.   That is putting Irish companies at an enormous disadvantage.  My question, then, relates to companies in the Republic of Ireland exporting into the UK.  Is the Minister proactively ensuring that difficulties such as the one I mentioned are overcome and are these part of the &Scaron;efovi-Frost dialogue?  </p></speech>

I do not want to start naming them now.  One is in the Deputy's neck of the woods.</p><p>It exports very large volumes of food on a daily basis and has distribution warehouses in the UK that are part of quite a sophisticated supply chain that comes from Macroom to Wexford and onto the UK.  It is just one of many companies that will be relying on an efficient turnaround of veterinary certificates in order to be able to sell food into the UK.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.796" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021042700002#D00300"><p>Yes.  My understanding is that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has committed to making sure that we can match what is in place in other European countries.  In the Netherlands, as I understand it, the turnaround time that is being committed to is four days.  Currently, we anticipate that it will take ten days here so we will have to get that timeline down.  I am in the middle of a conversation on that and we will work with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, who is aware of this issue, and his Department.  It essentially means making sure we have enough vets to enable us to have faster turnaround times and we can do that.  To use a term that is somewhat overused, there was an abundance of caution in terms of the timelines that were promised at the start but our food industry is far too big not to be competitive on something like this, where the State needs to facilitate a faster turnaround time.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's first question regarding the more fundamental issue of the relationship between the EU and the UK, there are serious trust issues when it comes to Brexit and the protocol, fuelled by the British Prime Minister's comments.  He has spoken about the "ludicrous" trade provisions in the protocol and has said that some of the provisions are "absurd" but this is the deal that he signed up to and which his negotiators negotiated that he is now thrashing.  That is politics, in terms of the language that is sometimes used.  In return, the EU uses very legalistic and rigid language but that is driven by the experience of the British Government changing its approach in the autumn, openly admitting that it was going to break international law in a targeted and specific way.  It also comes from the British decision at the start of March to essentially act unilaterally which, in the EU's view, is completely contrary to the obligations under the protocol.  There is a real wariness in Brussels because of the unpredictability of the British Government's approach to some of these issues.  I hope that, over time, the relationship between Lord Frost and Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efovi can address some of those trust issues.  We are very lucky to have Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi in that role because I have found him to be extraordinarily interested and diligent on Irish issues.  I have had many hours of discussions with him and he rings me after every significant meeting he has to make sure that he is not missing something from an Irish and EU perspective.  We are very lucky to have him.</p> <p>  Equally, Lord Frost is somebody who is on top of the detail and has proven to be a trusted negotiator by the UK Prime Minister.  It is really important that the two individuals that lead for both sides develop a relationship of trust.  That relationship will need time to develop, given how it started, which was not good, but it is improving.  I was in London two weeks ago and had a very good meeting with Lord Frost and worked through some of these issues in advance of him travelling to Brussels.  Relationships are improving but there are still real issues with regard to trust.  That would have been clear to anyone listening to the debate in the European Parliament today on whether it should ratify the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  There is still a lot of soreness around the story of Brexit, its negotiation and the relationship between the two sides but I hope that will heal over time.  </p> <p>  From an Irish perspective, we need the EU and the UK to be close partners in so many areas because if they are not, it puts Ireland in a very difficult space, as we found out repeatedly during the course of the Brexit negotiation process and as we are now finding out in the context of the implementation of the protocol.  In my view, the protocol is the best way of limiting the disruption of Brexit on this island to the greatest extent possible but from a political perspective in Northern Ireland, it is very complicated.  We will do everything we can to try to improve that relationship but there is an onus on the British Government, in particular, to do the same.  There is also an onus on the EU, which has made mistakes, particularly with its threat to trigger Article 16, although it reversed engines very quickly on that mistake, within three or four hours.  One does not see the EU acting unilaterally in the way that we have seen happen, unfortunately, on the other side.  We need to focus less on blame and looking backwards and more on trying to find solutions, pragmatism and flexibility where possible, and on looking forward.  We have an agreement now and we need to do what we can to make it work but both sides have got to own that agreement and not try to disown elements of it because they find them hard to sell.</p></speech>

A lot of the questions I had prepared have already been posed.  I will try to flesh out some of the Minister's answers to Deputy Howlin.  Deputy Howlin mentioned the fact that Commission President von der Leyen spoke today about the EU having teeth in terms of the enforcement of the TCA.  We all share the hope that the agreement is ratified by vote tomorrow morning.  Judging by the tone of the debate in the European Parliament, it will be ratified but taking those comments into account, it is very reassuring to hear that the Minister is speaking so regularly to Vice-President &Scaron;efovi.  What role, formal or informal, does the Irish Government have <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the implementation and monitoring of the TCA and the protocol aspect of the withdrawal agreement?  The Minister referenced the wobble in relation to Article 16 in January and when we met the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, previously at this committee he referred to the possibility of developing an early warning system or something less formal.  What is the role of the Irish Government, given that no other member state is more affected by the TCA and the protocol?  The Irish Government's proactive role in the European Council and the Minister's own proactive role has been vital throughout the Brexit process.</p><p>There has been much talk about the implementation of the protocol.  To be frank, it has clearly been politicised on the ground in Northern Ireland for obvious reasons but there has been talk about a possible EU-UK veterinary agreement and an agreement on SPS which will move the UK closer to EU standards and that would make a lot of the checks required under the protocol redundant.  Does the Minister have an opinion or an update on that?  Is it a possibility?</p><p>It is great to hear that the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council, BIIGC, is due to meet soon.  One can talk about Ireland's role in improving the EU-UK relationship but in terms of the crucial Anglo-Irish relationship, constant and consistent meetings of the BIIGC and the North-South Ministerial Council are more important now than at any time since the Good Friday Agreement was signed.  There must be a push to formalise those meetings.  It should not be the case that the BIIGC would only meet on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis when required.  Such meetings should simply be in the calendar.  In that way, we de-dramatise them and ensure that the relationships between politicians and between Government officials remain constant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.799" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021042700002#D00600"><p>I wish to acknowledge Deputy Richmond's role in a lot of the public debate on many of these issues.  On his last point, we are very keen to have regular BIIGC meetings so that they are not seen as something that is triggered in an emergency situation or when there is a problem to be solved.  What we were working towards with the previous British Government under Teresa May as Prime Minister, and with David Lidington in particular, was putting in place a schedule of BIIGC meetings two or three times a year.  The idea was that they would be scheduled months in advance so that they would not become an issue.  They would just be a procedural thing whereby the Governments meet and discuss the issues of the day.</p><p>Sometimes, these discussions concern serious, difficult issues; other times, they are planning and policy discussions.  If we put these meetings in a regular cycle every year, then we are using the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement as they should be used.  Instead, what has happened with the BIIGC is that there have been very few meetings.  The last one was in 2019 and was really useful.  It confirmed the memorandum of understanding that is now the basis for the definition of the common travel area and a whole range of other things linked to that in terms of social welfare, pensions, education and other things that we have now legislated for.  The 2019 BIIGC meeting in London was a most useful one.</p><p> We would like to "de-dramatise", to use a term that has been used throughout the Brexit process, what the BIIGC is all about, as opposed to every time a meeting is triggered, it raises hackles in certain political parties because they do not like the two Governments talking about Northern Ireland with them not being present or whatever.  Just like we should have North-South Ministerial Council meetings as a matter of procedure, we should also have BIIGC meetings as a matter of procedure.  Even if there could be two a year, that would be very welcome, as it would be with the other formats such as the British-Irish Council, BIC, and so on.</p><p> As regards the protocol, I make no secret of the fact that in my view it is very much in the interests of the UK and the EU to put in place a veterinary and SPS agreement that can effectively ensure there is a guarantee of common standards in the two jurisdictions that prevents the need for inspections at ports.  It is a no-brainer, as far as I am concerned, in terms of the pragmatic facilitation of trade.  Unfortunately, many of the issues linked to Brexit are approached not from the basis of pragmatism but on the basis of interpretations of sovereignty and so on, and Britain needing to be able do its own thing and change without having to consult the EU.  Therefore, so far, the concept of dynamic alignment with EU rules in any sector has been rejected as a way of reducing trade barriers.</p><p> I hope we can find another way of doing this that the British Government can support.  I am even conscious of the fact if I am advocating too strongly for this approach, it may make it more difficult for some to agree it because it is the Irish Government's position and therefore there must be something that is not quite right about it.  That is not the case here.  For many years on this island, we have co-operated on animal and plant health and we have had pragmatic arrangements, even within the European Union together, between Britain and Ireland in relation to some checks.  In my view, there is a real opportunity here to change the implementation of the protocol quite significantly, within the confines of the protocol, by putting in place a veterinary and SPS agreement for animal and plant health.  The estimates are that the number of checks could be reduced by up to 80% by doing so.  Not only would that benefit Northern Ireland in terms of Larne and Belfast, but it would also benefit Dublin and Rosslare and anywhere else where goods are coming in, whether it is Cork, Waterford or Foynes or anywhere else.  From our perspective, we want the fewest possible barriers to trade in the Irish Sea.  This is an area on which I will continue to try to advocate for change.</p><p> In terms of the trade and co-operation agreement, and the role or influence of the Irish Government in the trade and co-operation agreement versus the protocol, first, it is an EU-negotiated agreement, not a bilateral negotiation between Ireland and the UK.  We never allowed it to become that, which was a wise thing to do in my view.  It is an EU-UK agreement and an EU-UK implementation plan, which of course requires consultation with political, business and community leaders in Northern Ireland as well as the Irish Government, because we are all impacted by it.  However, I must say, just as was the case with Michel Barnier, where there was an incredibly close relationship between his negotiators and the Irish Government to make sure we fully understood the implications of all decisions that were being made, that kind of relationship of trust has very much carried over into our relationship with Vice President &Scaron;efovi on the protocol in particular.  The trade and co-operation agreement is different.  It is much broader.  It is as much about trade between France and the UK as it is Ireland and the UK.  We clearly have a say there, but it is a much stronger one in terms of shaping the approach on the protocol than it would be on any future negotiations around the trade and co-operation agreement.</p><p> Just to give the committee a sense of how the trade and co-operation agreement and the protocol have changed the trade environment between Ireland and the UK, Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures show that the value of imports from the Great Britain for January and February 2021 was 57% lower than in the first two months of 2020, while the value of exports to Great Britain in the same period had decreased by 12%.  On the other side of that coin, roll on-roll off volumes on direct routes to and from continental EU ports increased by 74% in those two months.  Therefore, we are seeing quite a dramatic impact on supply chains in terms of how they function.  It is too early to draw definitive conclusions from that because there was a lot of stockpiling in November and December in anticipation of a no-deal scenario and therefore looking to avoid tariffs.  Literally every warehouse in the UK was full of product that was essentially being stockpiled.  That explains some of the dramatic fall-off in trade in the months of January and February, but undoubtedly, the trade and co-operation agreement and the new realities of, and barriers to, trade are also part of that story.</p><p> Deputy Howlin will have more accurate figures on this, but I think that there are 36 direct ferry trips being made each week from Rosslare alone, primarily into France, but into mainland Europe, bypassing the UK.  Last December, that figure was six.  It is now 36, so it has increased sixfold, which is quite extraordinary.  Whether that will be sustained indefinitely into the future or we can get back to a point where the UK land bridge is being used as the most efficient way to get goods to and from the rest of the EU Single Market, and whether we can get back to the kind of supply chains that would have served us before 1 January 2021, remains to be seen.  Certainly, an SPS and veterinary agreement would make some of those things much easier, but for now Irish companies are adjusting to the new realities as well as they can, but it certainly has been quite difficult for some sectors.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the role played by his officials right across the remit of his Department over the past five years and his own contribution in his time there.  It has been extraordinary.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a few points.  The Minister briefly mentioned the triggering of Article 16 and stated the EU moved very quickly to reverse its position.  What impact did that have on the protocol?</p> <p>  I note the Minister emphasised the positive personal relationships that he has with Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and previously with Mr. Barnier.  Do we not need, as Deputy Richmond referred to and what Mr. Barnier said, something more formal than depending on personalities getting on?  What changes were implemented as a consequence of the triggering of Article 16 to ensure that, as well as the very important relationships and personal connections, there is actually a mechanism to avoid that happening again?</p> <p>  The Minister spoke in his remarks of constructive engagements between Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and Lord Frost.  He went through the practical elements of those and there does seem to be progress.</p> <p>  We would like to "de-dramatise", to use a term that has been used through Brexit, what the BIIGC is all about, as opposed to every time one is triggered, it raised hackles in certain political parties because they do not like the two Governments talking about Northern Ireland without them being present or whatever.  Just like we should have North-South Ministerial Council meetins</p><p>The Minister also mentioned that there are half a dozen political issues.  Will the Minister give us a flavour of these?  Are they quite complicated?  What are the chances of resolving them?  With regard to a sustainable and collaborative way forward, the Prime Minister is knocking the barnacles off the deal.  Does he understand how experienced the Minister is in barnacle management through sailing?  Does this type of language not suggest that we still have difficulties with language and difficulties regarding the need for constructive diplomacy in resolving all of these issues in all of our best interests?</p></speech>

I know what the Prime Minister was getting at.  He wants to try to smooth the implementation, which has been very jarring for some people in terms of tension on certain issues, such as bringing plants into garden centres in Northern Ireland in the springtime and the time delays in ports.  Some people would make a very strong case that the grace periods need to be a lot longer than they have been.  There is a range of issues.</p> <p>  The difficulty is that sometimes in politics we can use deliberately ambiguous language and different people can take what suits them from these messages.  It is much harder to do this on something such as trade, which is very black and white with regard to the legal responsibilities on protections of an EU Single Market and the precedent being set if we do not implement the rules in a rigid and consistent way.  This is why the protocol is there.  It would not be there if it did not really need to be.  We cannot have a situation where other countries in the EU are suspicious that there is, essentially, an unguarded back door into the EU Single Market through Northern Ireland.  They will not tolerate that.  Some in the Chamber have been in the European Parliament and they will understand why.  Countries such as France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium and many others value the protections provided by the Single Market and the need to protect the integrity of the Single Market for everybody staying in the EU.  We cannot create a double standard just because of a difficult political negotiation with the UK.  This is why the solution became the only one left on the table.  It was because of the kind of Brexit the British Government insisted on pursuing that Northern Ireland had to be treated in a slightly different way to the rest of the UK by a de facto extension of the EU Single Market for goods to prevent the need for any border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.  The price of this was limited checks in the ports of Larne and Belfast.  Now we have to try to find a way to implementing this in a way that can be accepted.</p> <p>  I do not want to overplay the positivity about negotiations between Lord Frost and Vice-President &Scaron;efovi.  There was a reasonably good meeting the week before last in Brussels but there are still serious outstanding issues.  Both negotiators are under some pressure to deliver.  Certainly from Vice-President &Scaron;efovi's perspective, he needs to ensure the EU is seeing follow-through on the commitments to which the UK has signed up, which to me seems a perfectly reasonable ask.  He is willing to show some flexibility in timelines on the implementation.  I do not want to comment too much on British politics but certainly there are also political pressures on Lord Frost and expectations around this.</p> <p>  As I have said, from what I can remember there are 26 issues and five of six which are political and contentious.  I mentioned some of them earlier with regard to SPS arrangements, steel, tariffs, country of origin issues and ensuring no impediments to the supply of medicines into Northern Ireland.  There has been an issue regarding VAT on second-hand cars, which was quite contentious.  Again, both sides are looking at what is possible and what is not.  This gives the committee a flavour of some of the technical issues.  Then, of course, there are discussions on grace periods on issues such as veterinary health certificates and for how long the grace periods are acceptable.</p> <p>  Likewise, with regard to raw prepared meats such as minced meat and sausages, there is no third country in the world that exports prepared raw meat into the EU Single Market.  It just does not happen.  The UK is looking for an exception to this rule.  The EU is stating it cannot do this without creating a precedent for a range of other countries that would like the same provisions.  At present, there is a grace period, which means sausages and minced meat come into Northern Ireland, but this grace period will end at some point.  When this will happen and what will happen after it are the types of issues under discussion.  These are not easy issues to resolve, even though they were resolved in the protocol when it was signed up to and in the implementation plan for the protocol, which was also signed up to by the British Government in December.  They have been reopened and the EU is trying to be as pragmatic and reasonable as possible but it can only go so far.</p> <p>  With regard to Article 16, this was a mistake that should not have happened.  It would not have happened if there had been normal consultation.  It was a very unusual week when it happened.  The European Commission was under a lot of pressure about the lack of supply of vaccines, particularly from AstraZeneca, and the focus of the discussion was very much not the protocol at all.  It was around trying to secure consistent supplies of vaccine that were being produced in the EU but some of which were being exported out of the Union by companies that were not fulfilling commitments to the Union.  Unfortunately, the protocol got caught up in that debate on the basis of the fear of some supposedly legal expert that if there were to be any limitation on export of vaccines because of the protocol they could travel through Northern Ireland and into Great Britain in a way that could not be managed.  This was flawed thinking on many levels quite frankly but that is how it happened</p> <p>  In my view, although I do not know for sure, even Vice-President &Scaron;efovi did not know this was being proposed.  Certainly Commissioner Mairead McGuinness did not know.  This was managed by quite a small circle of people and mistakes were made.  Once we heard about it we acted very quickly.  We got on the phone and spoke to all of the people who needed to be part of the conversation and it was reversed within four hours.  Unfortunately, the issue lit a flame under people who were opposed to the protocol and we have not managed to dampen down those flames since, quite frankly.  I do not think this was the only issue but it was the trigger that allowed some people to take a very aggressive stance against the protocol and against the EU's approach to Northern Ireland more generally.  This is a significant frustration within the Commission.  It certainly contributed to the negative environment that is there.</p> <p>  The Deputy's final question was on the fact that we cannot rely on relationships.  This is totally true.  We cannot have relationships between an Irish Government and EU institutions based on the personalities that happen to be in the privileged positions at the time.  The only reason I make the point on personal relationships is that we are fortunate with the two key negotiators for the EU.  Michel Barnier has a real understanding and passion for Ireland that started long before Brexit discussions.  It goes right back to when he was a Commissioner.</p><p>Likewise, Vice-President Maros &Scaron;efovi is genuinely interested in Ireland and the complexity of politics on the island of Ireland, and that helps.  Of course, many of these relationships are between my officials and their counterparts in the European Commission; this is not solely reliant on two individuals or, for example the Taoiseach's relationship with President Von der Leyen, which is also a very good relationship.  It is an institutional linkage and we have invested heavily in ensuring we have a team in Brussels that can reinforce those relationships and we will continue to do that.</p></speech>

I want to home in on two specific areas.  The majority of people in the north of Ireland voted against leaving the EU, and this is widely acknowledged.  Many view the Irish peace process as a European success story.  I agree with the Minister's comments on how the Good Friday Agreement is like our northern star and that it is critical we protect all the institutions.  That must be foremost in all our actions going forward.  The trade and cooperation agreement offers protections to the peace process by providing special status for the North.  However, there is the question of the resulting democratic deficit that has been part of the fallout from the entire process, and whereby we see elected representatives in the North having no role or voice in shaping legislation that they are now essentially bound by.  There is a major role for the Minister and Government in calling for, advocating and, indeed, negotiating for dialogue between the EU and elected public representatives and civic society in the North.  It is also important the EU be made to understand this dialogue is important and will contribute to reducing the tensions we have unfortunately seen being played out on the streets of the North in recent weeks, and in offering an opportunity for the people of this island to define their future with the EU together.  On that democratic deficit, what role does the Minister see being put in place to ensure the voices of political leaders, parties and civic society in the North can be heard within the EU, in terms of helping to shape the EU legislation they will ultimately be bound by?</p> <p>  I raise also the issue of fishing.  It was one of the most contentious issues and probably held up much of the discussions as well as the final agreement.  From some of our previous engagements, the Minister indicated this was one of the areas he had hoped would be addressed first and was not foreseen to be one of the issues that would cause the most difficulty.  The fisheries element of the TCA is an absolute mess.  It is a bad deal for Ireland.  According to the figures, the new agreement provides for a 25% aggregate reduction over the next five and a half years, of the quotas available to the EU 27 fishing fleet in UK waters.  The Irish fleet takes approximately 34% of its landings from UK waters so it is obviously going to have significant fallout for our fishing fleet.  It is estimated that there will be a loss of in the region of &euro;43 million, in quota share, by 2026.  There is a real threat Irish trawlers will have to be decommissioned due to the lack of access to British fishing waters.  The Government must take a number of actions immediately.  It must engage directly with the British Government on the issue if it has not done so.  There must be bilateral discussions on access by Irish trawlers to British waters.  We must reopen the discussion on the subject of quotas for Irish fishing in general.  The quota for Irish trawlers must be increased within Irish waters to compensate for the loss of income due to the agreement.  There is also the issue of adequate compensation, and not just for the fishing industry itself but for our coastal and inland communities.  The amount being offered through the Brexit adjustment fund is quite simply not sufficient to compensate for the damage that will be done due to what is being asked of our communities.  Therefore, what actions will the Government take to deal with the huge fallout for the fishing industry in Ireland?  Will it consider holding bilateral talks with the British with a view to gaining more access for the Irish fishing fleet to British fishing waters?  Then there is the issue of compensation.  This is about our coastal and island communities but it is also broader than that; it is about their livelihoods and the fallout for entire communities as well.</p></speech>

The opportunity and upside of the protocol for Northern Ireland is of course that it has left the EU but is still treated as part of the EU Single Market for goods.  This is a unique opportunity for it where trade and business are concerned.  In the context of how the rules of the Single Market develop and are discussed and debated in Brussels, there are no politicians from Northern Ireland taking part.  Certainly, political leaders in Northern Ireland have an input and a say in the context of the protocol and its implementation through the specialised committee.  That is very much the case.  There is also a real effort by the EU side to actually have regular consultation and reach out to business leaders and political leaders to really understand how the protocol is impacting.  However, it would also be a difficult proposition to suggest that there be MEPs from Northern Ireland in the European Parliament when Northern Ireland is not in the EU.  Thus there are compromises being made in the context of trying to prevent what would be a bigger problem, namely, having to put border infrastructure between North and South on the island of Ireland, which is something I do not think is doable, implementable or politically acceptable.  Of course, the alternative to that is that the Republic of Ireland, and the island as a whole, would be taken out of the EU Single Market for goods by default, which we could not allow either given that it is in many ways the basis of a competitive economy for us here.  The protocol, therefore, is a way of trying to manage disruption in the best way available.  However, it is not perfect and we will try to do everything we can to listen to and ensure political leaders in Northern Ireland are part of the discussion so we can reflect those views in European institutions when and where necessary.  The political tensions around the implementation of the protocol and so on have created an atmosphere where it is difficult to get constructive dialogue at the moment but, hopefully, that is something that can change over time and we can ensure concerns in Northern Ireland are more than reflected in Brussels.</p> <p>  On fishing, I am very familiar with that element of the TCA and spent many hours trying to influence that outcome.  It could have been a lot worse but it still was not a good outcome.</p><p>A no-deal Brexit would have been far worse for the fishing industry but we are still talking about Ireland losing approximately 15% of our total value of fish quota in 2020, which is approximately &euro;43 million of a lost catch opportunity for our industry, which is significant.  Much of this is mackerel, which is the most valuable fish stock to our fishing industry, particularly in Donegal.  There is an ongoing conversation between the Government and the European Commission led primarily by the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, supported by the Taoiseach and me, to look at what we can do in the European Union to try to remedy what we regard as a burden sharing issue, whereby Ireland is being asked to carry too much of the burden versus other EU countries that have not lost the same level of percentage losses that we have.  Let us wait and see where that goes.</p><p> I do not think it is a realistic proposition that we could start negotiating on a bilateral basis with the UK and access UK waters.  This, of course, is part of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which is an EU-UK negotiation.  We cannot legally start doing side deals that undermine the international trade agreement between the EU and UK when the competence on trade negotiation is at EU level rather than member state level.  I do not want to raise expectations.</p><p> There are some issues on which we need to try to negotiate solutions bilaterally with the UK and Scotland, for example with regard to Rockall, but negotiating quota share and access as a side deal, and expecting that other EU interests would not notice it and that there would not be a consequence for Ireland in terms of quota allocation under the Common Fisheries Policy, will not happen.  It is important to be honest about this.</p><p> Certainly within the EU, we have not yet concluded fishing discussions regarding whether Ireland has been asked to take an unfair level of the burden of fishing opportunity losses.  As I said, no deal would have been far worse.  What the UK Government was looking for on fishing was many multiples of what it got in terms of access to extra fish.  Even so, &euro;43 million is a lot of money to an industry that has quite tight margins and it does have an impact, not only on fishing opportunities but also on the processing sector.  We have to look to compensate primarily with fish and not money.  What the fishing industry wants is fishing opportunities from stocks that are well managed as opposed to money in handouts.  Financial compensation may well be part of the package also.</p><p> I hope that in the coming weeks we will have a conclusion to the discussions on the Brexit adjustment fund.  The Deputy said it is not a lot of money but to get more than &euro;1 billion of a &euro;5 billion fund means more than 20% of the overall pot is going to a country that has 2% of the population.  I know we are impacted significantly more than any other country but it still represents a pretty good outcome.

This was made much worse by the British Government's unilateral action on the grace periods.  Enough voice has been given to removing barnacles and sandpapering the Irish protocol.  I accept what the Minister said, that there is a read on it that it is Boris Johnson saying we need to streamline the Irish protocol and make it work, and nobody has a difficulty with this, but it also sells to another crowd, which is, I assume, is the reason he says some of what he does.  It is very hard to have trust when we do not have consistency.  When we are dealing with a British Government it depends where or why it is going where it is, because sometimes we fear it is a negotiation gambit, even with regard to dealing with these sorts of issues in the protocol, and sometimes we believe it is selling to its own Brexiteer wing.  We are never quite clear.  The only positive thing I take from this is that I do not think unionists can necessarily bank what Boris Johnson says regarding there being no referendum on Irish unity and that the union is safe.  They can put that alongside all commentary from British Prime Ministers and the Tory party over the years.</p> <p>  What facilities do we have in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement?  The Minister speaks about the EU-British Partnership Council and the 23 committees.  We have what now sounds somewhat positive, which is the relationship and communication between Commissioner &Scaron;efovi and David Frost.  I add my comments on the necessity of the North-South Ministerial Council, particularly what Deputy Richmond said about the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference being placed on the calendar, if that were at all possible, and, as the Minister would say, removing the drama from it.  This would be an absolute necessity.  The other difficulty with this is that it takes two to tango.  The Irish Government needs to ensure this can happen.</p> <p>  We have already had comment on the DUP and an element of panic politics.  We have seen it internally and externally.  Politics should deliver for people, and I suppose this is through job and educational attainment, as opposed to circling the wagons and playing the orange card.  There has been commentary, even in recent days, on the Northern economy.  I do not expect the Minister to comment on this but my view is that the jobs dividend and the economic dividend the North requires will only come through Irish unity.</p> <p>  We can also accept that unionism is not what it was.  The demographics have changed and the world has changed.  We have seen the recent violence and none of it is welcome.  Protests with people standing on bins is a far remove from Jim Molyneux and Ian Paisley and the huge monster rallies against the Anglo-Irish Agreement which, at the end of the day, also failed.</p> <p>  I welcome what the Minister said on his interaction with the business community and others.  This is the start of a process.  I would like information on what qualms they had.  The Minister offered solutions and spoke about the positives of the Irish protocol for Northern businesses to deliver some of these jobs and an economic stimulus.  How did he find the people when he engaged in the conversation?  I imagine it is a very different conversation when it is removed from political considerations, particularly at the minute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.813" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021042700002#H00300"><p>On the trust issues, in a negotiation that is complex trust builds up over time.  The breakdown of relationships at different moments during the Brexit discussions are well documented and understood at this stage.  What would help from an EU perspective would be to get clarity and line of sight on, for example, physical infrastructure in ports in Northern Ireland with regard to Border control posts.  It is not that they want to force more inspections, it is just that they want to make sure the infrastructure is there so that it is for real.  This in many ways is a signal that the British Government and the Executive in Northern Ireland are facilitating what has been agreed and what is part of international law in the withdrawal agreement and protocol.</p><p>Likewise, there are practical things that were fully committed to in December, for example, access to IT systems in Northern Ireland to understand the data around trade flows.  Part of the deal in December was that the UK did not want the EU to have a significant presence in Belfast or Larne.  The UK wanted that presence to be low-key, and understandably so.  There is not a big EU office in Belfast with an EU flag hanging out of the wall.  Instead there is a very low-key presence of trade experts from the EU, who are there not to impose checks but, effectively, to report back to the EU that the protocol is being implemented as agreed.  It is important for those people to be able to access in a low-key way the data on goods that are coming and going to ensure they know that the systems are working as they should.  It is important also that their security can be guaranteed in respect of some of the tension.  These are practical things that can happen in a way that does not involve press releases or drama but reassures the Commission that, from a technical perspective, the infrastructure and the data are being shared and that this relationship and partnership is transparent and is working as has been agreed.  The facilitation of those kinds of practical issues makes it easier for the European Commission then to show flexibility or pragmatism around things such as extensions of grace periods because there is an understanding that the British Government is fully committed to implementing the protocol.  Some of those things are happening, but a bit more pace in delivering some of those elements would be helpful.</p><p> I have said it before and I will say it again: the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are not just about the Executive and the Assembly in Northern Ireland; they are also very much about the North-South Ministerial Council.  Let us face it: nationalism in Northern Ireland - certainly, many among the nationalist community in Northern Ireland - bought into the Good Friday Agreement.  Many people in Ireland agreed to amend the Constitution because of the commitment to a structured engagement with the Irish Government in the context of managing an all-island, North-South relationship through the North-South Ministerial Council.  It is, therefore, an absolutely essential element of the Good Friday Agreement in terms of all-island co-operation, and the idea that we could just shut that off and try to effectively isolate Northern Ireland and not to interact politically with the Republic of Ireland in the context of North-South Ministerial Council meetings very much undermines not only the letter but also the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  That is why it is important that those meetings function and happen regularly.  There are different arguments surrounding the BIIGC, but it is a really important structure for the Dublin and London Governments to interact on.  That is why we continue to advocate for a BIIGC meeting, and not only that but also a scheduling of meetings in order that we do not have to essentially lobby for a BIIGC meeting for months every time before one happens.  I think that message is understood, but let us wait and see where it goes.</p><p> I have had quite a few interactions - they are usually on Zoom these days - with the business community in Northern Ireland.  When we lived in more normal times and I was travelling to Belfast or elsewhere in Northern Ireland almost once a fortnight for quite a sustained period, some of those interactions were with business communities such as Belfast Chamber and the Derry and Newry chambers of commerce.  The business community in Northern Ireland is pragmatic.  What it is looking for is certainty in order that it can then shape its business, trade and supply chains around as much certainty as we can give it.  Of course, many business people welcomed the British Government's unilateral action to extend grace periods because it meant that some of the choices they needed to make got pushed back for a period.  However, the uncertainty that has created now in terms of the relationship is not good for the business environment in Northern Ireland, not good for foreign direct investment and not good for managing supply chains out into the medium term.  The primary ask of the business community is that it be given a picture of how this will look.  It is not interested in getting involved in the political stand-off on some of these issues.  It wants these issues resolved, whether customs checks and the delays in that regard; SPS checks or future SPS agreements; health certificates; or tariffs on certain products that they had not anticipated might have tariffs applied to them because of country of origin issues.  Flour is a good example of that.  Because mills in the UK source grain from Canada to produce flour in the UK for the Irish market, that is not considered UK flour because of where the grain comes from and, therefore, tariffs apply.  There are issues like that on which we need to work with business to try to address and accommodate.</p><p> From my perspective, the interactions with business leaders and the business community, who happen to be primarily unionist, have been very frank and positive, but there are other anxieties in Northern Ireland, obviously, that are linked to loyalism and political unionism, which we have to respect and try to understand in how we talk about these issues.  However, we have to be honest too.  There is no point in telling a community, a political party or somebody what they want to hear to try to reduce tension if one is not telling them the truth.  We have to be respectful but also truthful about the options that are there for us in the context of the deals that have been done and international law, which is now part of the international treaty that is there.</p></speech>

Earlier he spoke about the gulf between the dynamic alignment and the equivalence when it comes to food standards, SPS checks, etc.  Can he see that gulf being bridged?  One of the complaints I recall from EU farmers in particular was the issue of equivalence when it came to Brazilian beef, etc., and there will be resistance from the Council member states.  How can that gap be bridged?  Has the Minister any thoughts on how we can take steps towards one another?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.816" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021042700002#J00300"><p>I need to be careful here that I do not start prescribing solutions.  We have people who are a lot smarter than I am, who are technical experts on trade and concepts such as dynamic alignment versus equivalence and who are looking at this issue and trying to find a way in which EU trade rules will not be undermined.  At the same time, the British Government, I hope, will look with an open mind at how it can move away from simply asking for recognition of equivalence and move towards a much more reassuring position that British standards would be effectively paralleled to EU veterinary, SPS and animal and plant health standards and so on.</p><p>There is a school of thought that asks if the wagon is hitched to the EU in terms of standards, does it undermine the capacity to do trade deals with other parts of the world?  This might include doing a trade deal with the US on the use of genetically modified products or hormones in beef and dairy products and so on.  There is much politics at play.  I hope the upside of a veterinary agreement or an SPS agreement between the two sides would be clear.  Trading in beef and dairy products between Ireland and the UK or between the UK and France seems to make much more sense than trading between the UK and Canada, Brazil or the US, given the distances and sustainability questions.  Let us wait and see where it goes.  Currently there is no breakthrough in the area but if the objective of a politician or businessperson in Northern Ireland is to reduce the impact of the protocol with goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, and they want to halve the number of checks in ports, there is a way to do it if the British Government agrees to find a way with the EU to giving assurance on common standards in the area.<br/><br/>On the question of dairy processing, this is a reference to country of origin matters that are problematic.  I probably should not name companies but everybody who understands the agricultural sector knows who they are.  Some of our dairy processors source up to 40% of their milk pool from Northern Ireland.  It is a big and very important supply chain for dairy farmers in Northern Ireland with regard to price guarantees and all the rest of it.  All of that Northern Ireland milk can still be sold right across the EU.  There is no issue at all with that.  It is considered within the Union as part of the Single Market for goods.  Where there is a legal problem for product that originates in Northern Ireland is with country of origin labelling.  There are 60 or so EU trade agreements with other parts of the world and they apply to EU products.<br/><br/>Milk produced in Northern Ireland, even if it is processed south of the Border, is technically a UK-origin product.  Therefore, the benefits of certain trade deals linked to certain dairy products do not apply.  The processors involved may well need to ensure the milk being sourced from Northern Ireland is used for markets across the EU and so on.  There are some limitations in terms of a trade deal with Japan, Vietnam, CETA or wherever for milk produced in Northern Ireland.  My understanding is that so far the processing sector is getting on and adapting to the position.  The ideal scenario would be if we could get agreement within the EU, which does not require British Government approval <i>per se</i>, that product from Northern Ireland under the rules of the EU Single Market for goods could be considered within those trade agreements as EU product or equivalent to EU product.<br/><br/>That technically requires a minor amendment to a trade agreement.  There is no such thing as one side looking for an amendment without the other side looking for a corresponding change as the price.  There is no appetite in the EU to start that process, given all the other matters people are trying to deal with in the context of Northern Ireland.  I hope that in time we will be able to gradually change some of those trade agreements to accommodate goods produced in Northern Ireland.  I have certainly been advocating for that to ensure goods produced in Northern Ireland are at no disadvantage to goods produced in any other part of the Single Market or even the island of Ireland in the context of EU trade agreements.<br/><br/>We can see with current dairy prices that the market remains reasonably buoyant.  I hope we can improve the position over time but for now the companies involved seem to be managing.  I do not think they are separating their milk pools but I presume they are using the milk pool from Northern Ireland for certain products that are primarily concerned with EU markets.  That is a guess because it is a while since I spoke with some of the processing companies.  That is my understanding of what is being done.</p></speech>

In fairness, I probably threw far too many questions at him.  How does he foresee benefits from the TCA panning out?  We have spoken about the EU-British Partnership Council and the 23 added committees, along with the facility that was within the withdrawal agreement to deal with current difficulties.  In fairness, the Minister has answered comprehensively on what they are.  If people are up for a solution, one is possible.</p></speech>

We would be asking our businesses to spend hundreds of millions of euro on tariffs to facilitate trade across the Irish Sea.  It would have been a disaster and we would have been looking at enormous compensation packages for certain sectors that would have had to reorient their supply chain and the markets they target.  We have avoided that, as long as the European Parliament votes to ratify the deal this evening, which I expect it will.</p> <p>  The TCA is essentially about putting structure on a new relationship because there is no structure based on EU membership any more for the UK.  The TCA deals with facilitating trade in goods, which avoids tariffs and quotas.  It also deals with trade in services, although that is not fully settled with respect to equivalence around some of those services and recognition of qualifications.  There is a range of matters around provision of services that are very different for the UK.  That has a big impact on Ireland as many of the services in Ireland are provided from the UK.  Areas including common recognition of professional qualifications and standards is a big part of this.  There is also the question of energy, which is very important for Ireland in terms of the all-island energy market.  It is really important for Northern Ireland in particular.  There is also the free movement of persons, which is a big issue for most other EU countries but less of an issue for us because of the common travel area.  There is the question of aviation, road transport and the facilitation of haulage and so on, which is a very important matter for us.  The TCA provides guarantees for that.  Although it is not a good deal for us on fishing, it is better than no deal at all.  There is also the question of EU programmes, including PEACE PLUS, where the guts of &euro;1 billion will be committed to funding over the next seven years.  It is the lifetime of the next multi-annual financial framework.  The British Government is making a big contribution to that as well.  There is also the question of dispute settlement structures and systems.</p> <p>  The TCA puts institutional structures around all these questions and provides as much certainty as possible for a third country outside the EU that does not want to be aligned in any of the areas that were on offer.</p><p>It is considerably better than not having it, for many reasons.  What was the other question?</p></speech>

There are tools built into the TCA such as dispute resolution mechanisms and arbitration, or we could respond by applying tariffs on certain products, for example, if it is appropriate to do so.  Having the TCA ratified will hopefully provide a positive platform for engagement on partnership but it also has teeth as regards retaliation, if that is necessary, but hopefully it will not be.  There will be a lot of monitoring of all these sectors for compliance with what has been agreed on the TCA as well.  Of course, there is also a cross-linkage between the implementation of the TCA and some of the retaliation mechanisms within it that could also be linked to non-implementation of the withdrawal agreement or protocol.  Again, I certainly do not think we should be talking about threats-----</p></speech>

Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, said there would be no trade agreement unless the Good Friday Agreement is implemented in full, and that presumably applies to the Northern Ireland protocol as well.  Is the US Administration alert to the position of Ireland in the context of an EU-US trade deal?  Is that view shared by the US Administration generally and is that something Ireland is pursuing with it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.827" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021042700002#L00800"><p>I think the US would like to do a trade deal with the UK and that it would also be open to doing a trade deal with the EU.  This is an administration that wants to reach out and build transatlantic trade partnerships, which is good news for Ireland and for the UK.  President Biden has been very consistent and firm, as have the Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and other prominent individuals in the Friends of Ireland group, such as Richard Neal, Brendan Boyle and others, who have been extraordinarily supportive through the Brexit journey.  They have been very clear that if the UK was to undermine the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement by not implementing what it had agreed to implement to protect the Agreement, that would have knock-on consequences on the UK's ambition to get a trade deal across the line because there would be a lot of pushback against that.</p> <p>  My view on this, for what it is worth, is that we should be talking about a transatlantic trade agreement that involves the EU, the UK, the US, Canada and any others that want to be part of it.  Why are we talking about bilateral relations and some sort of competition to see who can do a trade deal with the US first?  We should be trying to create a trade platform based around the Atlantic with the EU, the US, Canada, the UK and other countries that border the ocean, just like the trans-Pacific trade agreement that has been put in place.  We could do something comprehensive and this current US Administration under President Biden is very open to developing much closer and stronger ties, both trade and political, with Europe as a whole.  It may be a way to work with the United Kingdom.  Unfortunately, politically we are quite a long way off that at the moment in the language that is being used in Westminster but that would be the logical road to travel if we are looking to benefit from removing trade barriers to a big market like the US, as we have done with Canada.  There is no reason the UK should not be involved in those discussions, rather than having this competitive race to see who can do a trade deal first.  I do not get the logic of that.  It does not build the kind of relationship I would like the UK and the EU to have in the future.</p></speech>

We appreciate him being here this evening.  In light of his officials being with him, I want to raise a matter but I do not want an answer on it at this time.  I refer to the issue of the 40-day residence rule for live exports.  The new bureaucracy is causing difficulty for Northern farmers, Donegal farmers and those in the Lagan Valley importing Scottish Blackface rams or even Scottish Galloway bulls.  It is upsetting at a very practical level.  There is an upset in the commerce that has traditionally and historically always been carried out between Ulster and Scotland.  I want the Minister's officials to be aware of that when they are looking at the agricultural sector during the deliberations and talks.  There are issues that are annoying and upsetting people at a practical level and we should try to reassure farmers that, through these talks and deliberations, things will be positive in the end.</p> <p>  Go raibh maith agaibh uilig agus beidh muid ar ais ar&iacute;s gan dabht.</p></speech>

I thank her for writing to the committee in February regarding her experience, expertise as senior lecturer in politics at UCC and, indeed, in the context of her own research where she has been a lead author on two research reports examining the role, function and practice of members of parliament in Myanmar between 2015 and 2020.  As part of her work, she visited the parliament in Myanmar on a number of different occasions.  I am very pleased that she has shared the research she had led on the parliamentary system and survey of the members of the members of parliament in Myanmar.  She is now going to share her experience and expertise with us, and to inform us of matters.  Indeed, we are all shocked to see on a daily basis the images of the sanctions, cruelty and suffering inflicted on civil society in Myanmar by a military regime, in a country that has succeeded in establishing, through difficult challenges, a parliamentary democracy, albeit a fragile democracy but one that has been progressing in a strict way over recent years.  We look forward to hearing from Dr. Murphy.  We also look forward to discussing the options for our committee to assist in highlighting the issues and exhorting the international community to respond to the instability in Myanmar.</p> <p>  The committee is being broadcast from the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Any statements that may be potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity will result in a direction that the remarks be discontinued.  We all will comply with such direction, as we always do in the committee.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely from outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who may be physically present.  Witnesses from outside the jurisdiction are advised that they need to be mindful of domestic law, from which they are joining us, and how it may apply to the evidence given and statements made.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that we should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make the person in any way identifiable.  Members are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located within the confines of the Leinster House complex.  For anyone watching online, some Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely I seek forbearance should technical issues arise as they already have in terms of our initial engagement with Dr. Murphy.  </p> <p>  Again, I welcome Dr. Murphy and invite her to make her opening statement, following which we will proceed to observations, questions, queries and brief statements.  Members will be conscious we must stick to the time allocated to us this afternoon for our engagement.</p></speech>

Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021042700002#B00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and all of the members of the committee for the opportunity to discuss the situation in Myanmar.  I am very pleased to engage with the committee.  I welcome its interest in learning more about the situation and considering what role Ireland might play in responding to the crisis.</p> <p>  Before I begin, I apologise for the earlier technical issue and the fault was on my end.  I also apologise that members cannot see me as I have had to enter the meeting using a web browser as opposed to the Teams App.</p> <p>  As the members will be aware, the military coup in Myanmar has been ongoing since 1 February 2021.  There are few signs of a peaceful return to civilian rule in the short term.  The seriousness of the crisis should not be underestimated.  Further violence is almost assured.  It will likely be accompanied by economic collapse and a serious humanitarian crisis.  The repercussions of such developments are grave and include geopolitical instability in the region.  The tragedy of the situation is all the more poignant given that Myanmar and its people had experienced newfound freedoms as the democratisation process proceeded since about 2011.</p> <p>  Myanmar, as members will be aware, is a diverse and complex country.  Myanmar gained independence in 1948 but it was subject to an oppressive military junta from 1962 until 2011 when a gradual return to civilian rule began to proceed.  Throughout that period, Myanmar had to deal with the longest running civil war in the world.  Ongoing since 1948 and based on a very complex mix of conflicts between the State and ethnic groups, including non-State actors and a military that has, over decades, infiltrated both the State and the economy in very deep ways.</p><p>The 2008 constitution and free elections in 2015 signalled the beginnings of a democratisation process.  However, on 1 February this year, the day the newly elected Myanmar parliament was scheduled to meet for the first time following the November 2020 election, the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, seized control and declared a year-long state of emergency with a stated intention to hold new elections at the end of that period.</p><p> The coup followed the intensification of tensions between the military and the civilian government which crystallised further after the November elections.  The National League for Democracy, NLD, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won by a landslide.  The military and the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, USDP, disputed the election result, claiming widespread fraud and calling for a rerun of the election.  In the aftermath of that coup, leaders of the NLD, including Aung San Suu Kyi, have been detained and imprisoned and are facing various charges.</p><p> I highlight in particular that there has been widespread public opposition to the coup which catalysed into an extraordinary civil disobedience movement spearheaded by Myanmar professionals, including doctors, bankers, teachers, factory workers, civil servants, transport staff, and many other workers across the country.  Hundreds of thousands of workers from these sectors are striking and have been doing so for months.  They aim to stifle the economy, thereby cutting off the military&rsquo;s sources of revenue and forcing an end to the coup.</p><p> We have seen the mass mobilisation of young people in Myanmar.  This cohort is playing a critical role in opposing the coup.  I emphasise the extent to which young people, in particular, are resolute in their resistance to military rule in Myanmar and have shown themselves willing to make extraordinary sacrifices to ensure the return of freedom and democracy.</p><p> The political response has included the formation of the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, CRPH, by a number of elected NLD MPs in exile.  The committee comprises 17 members.  Importantly, it includes two elected MPs from ethnic parties.  It seeks to conduct parliamentary affairs as per its electoral mandate in November.  The junta has charged 17 members of the CRPH with incitement and has threatened anyone who contacts them with seven years' imprisonment.</p><p> On 31 March this year, the CRPH declared the abolishment of the 2008 constitution and announced a new interim constitution, the Federal Democracy Charter.  Two weeks later, the CRPH formed a national unity government that brought Aung San Suu Kyi back into her previous role as State Counsellor.  The national unity government includes cabinet members drawn from both the NLD and, critically, the ethnic parties, all of whom are currently in hiding or outside the country.  They are seeking international recognition as the legitimate government of Myanmar.  The junta has declared the national unity government unlawful.</p><p> The military has responded forcefully to repress all political and civil opposition in Myanmar.  It has imposed martial law in parts of the country, introduced curfews and altered laws to prevent mass mobilisation and undermine the civil disobedience movement.  According to UN sources, more than 700 civilians, including children, have been killed by the military since the coup began.  Many more have been seriously injured.  There are more than 3,000 in detention, and tens of thousands in the ethnic states, in particular, have been displaced as villages have been targeted and bombed by the military.  In the larger cities, we have seen increased movement out to rural areas to escape the crackdowns.</p><p> I must stress the military&rsquo;s tactics in this regard are increasingly indiscriminate, systematically attacking neighbourhoods, randomly discharging weapons into homes, and bombing and shelling villages in ethnic areas.  The UN has reported the use of heavy artillery against civilians.  There are also reports of the military targeting medical professionals with arrest and preventing those who need medical treatment from receiving it.</p><p> In addition to this deteriorating human rights crisis, a humanitarian crisis is looming in Myanmar.  Many citizens have lost their jobs amid the turmoil and can no longer afford to support basic needs.  The World Food Programme has warned of food insecurity in the short term.  Communication systems have been severely disrupted.  Myanmar&rsquo;s economic situation is also deteriorating.  There will be an expected 10% contraction, at least, in 2021.  A serious refugee crisis cannot be discounted.</p><p> The EU and the US have imposed some sanctions on Myanmar, including financial sanctions and travel bans on key military personnel.  The US has also applied a series of sanctions, including financial sanctions, in respect of the military&rsquo;s two major conglomerates.</p><p> At an Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, summit meeting on 24 April 2021, a five-point consensus on the situation in Myanmar was agreed, calling for the immediate cessation of violence, constructive dialogue among parties, a mediation role for the special ASEAN envoy to be appointed, provision of humanitarian assistance and access to Myanmar for the ASEAN envoy.  Although this five-point consensus is welcome, there are issues which remain unaddressed.  ASEAN did not call for the release of political prisoners.  There are no explicit plans for dialogue with the national unity government and no clear timeframe for actions.</p><p> The seriousness of the crisis in Myanmar should not be underestimated.  If the situation continues to escalate, and the signs are that it is escalating, the country risks becoming a failed state in the heart of Asia.  The consequences of this are severe and include unconscionable human suffering, economic and social devastation, a likely refugee and humanitarian crisis, and geopolitical instability in the region.</p><p> In terms of how the Oireachtas and the Irish Government can play a role in opposing the military coup and supporting democratic forces in Myanmar, there are a series of actions that might be considered.  First is encouraging and supporting a robust leadership role for ASEAN, which has a critically important role to play in addressing the crisis in Myanmar.  There is also capacity for Ireland to use its position on the UN Security Council and in the General Assembly and its network of embassies across Asia to encourage ASEAN and individual countries in the region to leverage their efforts and influence to prevent the situation from deteriorating.  It would be important for countries to support and endorse the work of both the UN special envoy to Myanmar and the ASEAN special envoy to Myanmar.  Sanctions must be maintained and there should be a push for additional targeted sanctions against military-run businesses and industries.</p><p> There is a role for the Oireachtas to play in publicly acknowledging the CRPH and the national unity government.  There is capacity to push for the European Union to strengthen its response to the situation in Myanmar.  Ongoing support for an international arms embargo is similarly important.  The Oireachtas may consider applying pressure to leading gas and oil companies operating in Myanmar to temporarily stop giving taxes and other pipeline-related payments to the military regime and the conglomerates it dominates.  There is capacity to engage with tech companies to protect, improve and facilitate ongoing access to communication facilities in Myanmar and to encourage the fashion industry, which supports a large garment industry in Myanmar, to speak out much more forcefully against the military coup.</p><p> The Oireachtas and the committee may wish to consider calling additional witnesses to share evidence, including, for example, members of the CRPH in Myanmar, former ambassadors, business interests in Myanmar, and UN personnel.  The Oireachtas can play a role in defending the human rights of elected MPs in Myanmar by raising the crisis there with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, IPU, which has its 142nd assembly upcoming in May this year.  Finally, the fact of this session sends a signal to Myanmar and helps support public morale among Myanmar protestors and citizens by helping to maintain an international focus on what is happening in Myanmar and by maintaining sustained, strong and vocal opposition to the military coup.</p></speech>

On a daily basis the army is quelling anything it regards as dissent.  Protesters are being beaten and arrested and, in some cases, killed on a daily basis.  Of course, this is against the background of the general strike which has seen public services for civil society and the people of Myanmar coming to an almost complete halt.  </p><p> I propose to revert to members of the committee now for their questions.  I will take members in groups of three and then ask Dr. Murphy to respond.  I thank her for her recommendations, many of which seem eminently reasonable and which, after this meeting, we will be in a position to give further consideration.  Deputy Brady is first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.840" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021042700002#D00200"><p>I welcome Dr. Murphy and thank her for her opening statement.  I have been following the situation in Myanmar closely over the last few months.  Indeed, over the last few years any time that Myanmar has been in the news it has been, unfortunately, in connection with matters related to genocide and acts against citizens by the military junta.  I am really concerned about the situation there.  Dr. Murphy has spoken quite graphically to all of our concerns and I thank her for opening statement.  Recently I have been speaking to a number of people who worked previously with NGOs on the ground in Myanmar.  They are very concerned about the situation there and about some of their colleagues who are still on the ground in Myanmar and who are afraid to speak out because of the potential repercussions.  Unfortunately, what we are seeing and hearing on the television news is probably only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what is actually happening on the ground.  I thank Dr. Murphy for highlighting the situation there.</p><p>Myanmar has been in difficulty since it gained independence from the British in 1948 and what we are seeing now is part of the legacy of the colonisation of south east Asia and other parts of the world by various countries.  I have referred to acts of genocide that have happened in Myanmar, the most recent being those perpetrated against the Rohingya Muslim population in 2017.  This led the councillors of Dublin City Council to withdraw the Freedom of the City which was conferred on Aung San Suu Kyi.  Concerns have existed for some time about the actions of the Myanmar Government in dealing with some ethnic minorities and what is being done now by the military junta must be condemned. </p><p>Dr. Murphy mentioned the ASEAN talks and the agreement that has been reached but yesterday the Karen National Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Karen National Union, KNU, launched an attack in the southern part of Myanmar.  Concern has been expressed that this attack will give the junta an excuse to back out of the tentative agreement that is in place at present.  The junta has said that it will focus on quelling any military revolt.  The KNU has a long history of fighting for self-determination.  The make-up of Myanmar is complex, with so many different ethnic groups within the country.  Does Dr. Murphy share the concern of others about the implications of the actions of the Karen National Liberation Army?  </p><p>My brother lives in Thailand and has told me that huge numbers of refugees have fled Myanmar and crossed into Thailand.  This is creating real difficulties in the context of Covid and the mass movement of people.  There have been significant spikes in case numbers.  Does Dr. Murphy have any information regarding Covid in Myanmar?  We have all seen what is happening in India but I am interested to learn about the situation in Myanmar <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Covid-19.  As I said, there has been a spike in the number of cases as a result of people fleeing persecution and crossing the Thai border.  This has obviously created a humanitarian crisis and a crisis in terms of the spread of Covid.  </p><p>Again I thank Dr. Murphy and hope she will be able to answer some of my questions.</p></speech>

I glanced through her research project on the parliament, which is so sad.  At the time of her research, it looked as if things would be so different.  She met what seemed to be a very enthusiastic set of parliamentarians who wanted to do their job better.  As has been said by the Chairman and Deputy Brady, the images on television of the unfolding humanitarian crisis are so distressing.  We know that at least 720 people have been killed and more than 3,000 imprisoned.  We also know a little of the barbarity that exists in the prisons and the overall picture is very distressing.  It is good that we are addressing these issues here today.</p> <p>  Am I correct in assuming, in terms of geopolitics, that the military junta is being supported by China and to a lesser degree by Russia?  Is that why the ASEAN response did not include releasing prisoners and was somewhat muted?  Is there a connection there?  Would it be fair to say that we in the West, including the USA, are supporting the return of the National Unity Government, NUG, and that China is supporting the military junta?  Is that a valid assessment and if so, what are the implications of that?  If it is not valid, I would be interested in hearing more from Dr. Murphy.  It is very interesting to see that the ASEAN agreement fell short of a full settlement or was that done on a tactical basis to try to achieve some moderate solution initially?  I presume Dr. Murphy is happy with what we are doing within the UN Security Council.  The briefing documentation would suggest that we are very active at the Security Council on this question, as we should be.  I presume Dr. Murphy is happy in that regard.  </p> <p>  I understand from the briefing material that in excess of &euro;1 million was given directly in aid to Myanmar.  What is Dr. Murphy's view of the entire humanitarian effort?  I presume it is never good enough but is she satisfied that the aid is getting to its intended target or is the junta making efforts to thwart that?  Dr. Murphy's recommendations to us with regard to the embassies are eminently sensible and, as the Chairman said, we will discuss them further as a committee.  I thank Dr. Murphy very much.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.843" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021042700002#E00100"><p>I welcome Dr. Murphy to our meeting today and thank her for her time and her work on this very important issue.  We know that historically the military has been extraordinarily powerful there.  There are almost 500,000 members of the military.  Dr. Murphy referred to the need for an international arms embargo.  Following on from Senator Joe O'Reilly's question in which he suggested that the military in Myanmar was getting support from other countries, could Dr. Murphy say who has supported it in the past with the arms it has?  I noted on some television programmes recently that it has quite a powerful set of hardware.  For it to work, an arms embargo would have to be universal and include all countries.  Given that it has such an arsenal, I wonder what its impact would be.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked about Covid.  With the mass gathering happening at the moment, and with no testing or treatment, it is obviously a huge concern also.  It could spread among the general population.  I noted that many of the doctors in the hospitals are refusing to co-operate with the military junta at the moment and the healthcare system has more or less collapsed.  Perhaps Dr. Murphy would comment on that.</p> <p>  The situation of refugees going to other countries such as to India, China, Laos and Thailand and the Rohingya refugees going to Bangladesh is of huge concern.  Dr. Murphy mentioned more than once her concerns regarding this complex spreading to other jurisdictions and destabilising the general area.  Will she say a little bit more about this?  What are her concerns about this and how might it happen?  We would all agree with the responses Dr. Murphy suggested we make in our role on the UN Security Council and in the European Union, and that maybe we should support the Government and the Minister in what he is doing in that regard.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the fashion industry, which Dr. Murphy said is quite important to that region.  What other industries are there underpinning Myanmar's economy?  I am aware it has oil, gas, and a lot of renewable energy.  Will Dr. Murphy comment on that?</p> <p>  The situation is a huge concern.  There are very few places in the world where this kind of thing is happening at the moment, and to this extent.  I know there are wars elsewhere.  Syria was similar to this and we saw what happened there.  This is very worrying.  I thank Dr. Murphy for being here and for the work she is doing.</p></speech>

I will then call Deputy Clarke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.845" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary C. Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021042700002#E00300"><p>I thank the Chairman, Deputy Flanagan.  I thank all the members for their questions and, in particular, for their interest and concern.  Let me start with Deputy Brady's questions.  I would 100% reiterate and underline the way in which the Deputy depicted the sinister nature of the atmosphere in Myanmar right now.  The actions of the military have been appalling in the extreme.  I mentioned just some of them.  There are all sorts of allegations against the military in how it has been treating its own citizens during this period.  It is the indiscriminate nature of the violence that is really adding to the sinister nature of society in Myanmar right now.</p> <p>  On the question of information, the Deputy makes an important point.  I do not think all the information is getting out.  Communications systems have been limited.  The Internet is not available during the night.  Access to the Internet is patchy and completely non-existent in some parts of the Myanmar.  In this situation, information is absolutely critical to the opposition, in particular.  It is critical to allow it to organise and to protest, and to facilitate the coming together of protesters.  It is also critical to allow the protesters and the opposition movements to communicate with the rest of the world and to give a true sense of what precisely is happening on the ground in Myanmar.  The international community is not quite getting a full picture at the moment because of the ways in which the military has been limiting communications systems.</p> <p>  I refer back to one of the points I made in my recommendations for ways in which the committee and the Oireachtas could engage with the tech community and tech companies.  I am aware there are moves among many in Myanmar and among those who are following the situation to connect with Elon Musk's Starlink project.  This is important because the Starlink project tests low-orbit satellite Internet provision in different parts of the world.  What is critical about this facility is that it offers access to an open web and allows the user to bypass a state's Internet controls.  There is enormous optimism about the way in which these technological developments have the potential to disrupt authoritarian regimes such as the military coup we are seeing in Myanmar right now.  It means that one can effectively cut off the extent to which a regime can control and dominate information, because a state simply cannot regulate this particular service.  It also means that Internet access can be offered in the most remote areas of the planet, and parts of Myanmar fit that category.  China and Russia are opposed to this form of technology, but many countries across the West are enthusiastic about the way it can help to assist with democratisation processes, and the provision of information freely and fairly around the world.</p> <p>  The Rohingya crisis has been a particularly appalling aspect of what has been happening in Myanmar in recent years.  The Rohingya community is concentrated mainly in Rakhine state in Myanmar.  Since the beginning of the military coup there appears to be some latent empathy emerging for the Rohingya community more broadly across society in Myanmar, across the ethnic groups and across the main Burmese ethnic population, which accounts for some two thirds of the population.  It has been interesting to watch this.  Given all they have experienced since 1 February, the ordinary citizen in Myanmar seems to be developing a degree of empathy for the way in which the Rohingya were treated by the Myanmar since 2017.</p> <p>  On the other ethnic groups, reference was made to the Karen National Liberation Army, KNLA, which has a very long history of fighting for self-determination against the military.  Many of the ethnic groups, not just the KNLA, are seeing an opportunity during this period of instability for them to proceed with their attacks against the military and to push even further for some of their political and constitutional goals.  We are also seeing some young people, especially in and around urban areas, now choosing to align somewhat with some of these ethnic groups, and choosing to contribute to the military effort to defeat the military coup itself.</p> <p>  Again, it has been quite interesting in the period since the coup began on 1 February 2021, to see some degree of unity among disparate groups in Myanmar that had previously been opposed to each other.  They are now, effectively, all united against a single force, which is the military coup.  There is some capacity for the international community and for national institutions such as the Houses of the Oireachtas, to assist the ethnic groups, to assist the civil disobedience movement, to offer them some degree of capacity building and to help them to stabilise the partnerships that are emerging between these groups in their attempts to defeat the military coup.</p> <p>  We are seeing the beginnings of a refugee crisis, which Deputy Brady also mentioned.  With regard to those countries that border Myanmar that are seeing an influx of refugees at the moment, the Oireachtas and governments around the world might encourage those states to consider granting asylum to people who are fleeing persecution in Myanmar.</p> <p>  Covid-19 is a very serious issue in Myanmar right now.  The Covid-19 crisis had caused enormous disruption up to this point but now there is the near collapse of the health system and the complete absence of testing since 1 February.</p><p>That protests groups have been gathering in such large numbers makes it likely that the Covid-19 crisis will deteriorate even further.  The fear is that as the refugees move across borders, we will see an intensification of that problem and a degree of hostility between refugees and populations in those countries.  There is an enormous amount to be aware of here and it is very hard to know precisely the extent to which Covid-19 is problematic simply because of a lack of information and any process of testing right now.</p><p> I thank Senator Joe O'Reilly for his comments and his kind words about the two reports with which I was involved.  I feel particularly saddened reading those reports again and reflecting on those brief periods I spent in Myanmar.  It was clear the democratisation was proceeding and there were certainly challenges and difficulties.  On the whole there was an atmosphere of enthusiasm and optimism.  There was a clear preference for a future based on democratic principles.  That was absolutely self-evident, despite the challenges and difficulties.  It is an enormous tragedy to see the way in which there has been a rolling back of all that progress over a period of ten years or so.</p><p> With regard to the geopolitical position, there was mention of China.  This is a complex matter in itself.  As the committee is aware, China blocked the UN Security Council condemnation of the coup but has, nevertheless, backed calls for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and a return to democratic norms in Myanmar.  China has a policy of non-intervention in cases like this.  It is fair to suggest China has not lent decisive support to the military in Myanmar.  China's key and overriding interest is to maintain stability in Myanmar.  To a certain extent, maintaining stability, whether in the context of military or civilian rule, is the priority.</p><p> Relations between the National League for Democracy and China were relatively harmonious in the period before the coup and there has traditionally been some wariness of China in the national capital, Nay Pyi Taw, about the role China may have in Myanmar as it proceeds through the democratisation process.  China is very important to Myanmar in that it is its biggest trading partner and it is also one of the largest sources of inward investment.  Approximately 1 million tourists from China visit Myanmar every year.  China, therefore, has an important role to play.  Myanmar is also important to China in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative.  There are more than 30 bilateral agreements between China and Myanmar, including everything from the development of railway systems to deep sea port projects.  This is important to Beijing because it provides an alternative route for energy imports.  Aside from this there continues to be a degree of wariness in Myanmar about Chinese intentions.  They fear this may be costly for Myanmar and they also fear that some of these facilities may be put to military use in future.</p><p> China's interest in stability is sort of based on its economic interests in Myanmar, or it is at least linked to them.  I tentatively suggest that China would see a civilian government in Myanmar as offering a greater prospect for stability than a military-led Myanmar.  It is not simply a case of China supporting Myanmar without there being any restrictions or nuance in that respect.  It is a complex relationship and China's approach to this has not been decisively supportive of the military.  It is important to note that.</p><p> With regard to the perspective of the United States and the West more generally, the condemnation of the coup has been wholesale and quite vociferous.  I mention the UK in this context as well as it has been quite outspoken.  There are some difficulties for the US, the West and Britain.  Recognising the legitimacy of the National Unity Government is challenging because that government is completely disparate now; some of the members are in exile but most are hiding and they are not necessarily in contact with each other.  They do not have any access to the resources of the state.  There are difficulties.</p><p> The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, has been playing a very delicate role in trying to navigate this terrain.  It invited the leader of the military, Min Aung Hlaing, to the ASEAN summit last Saturday but it did not invite representatives from the National Unity Government.  There is some dismay in Myanmar that ASEAN appears to be prioritising the military coup in that context.  However, it is more nuanced, challenging and sensitive than that.  ASEAN is trying to create a scenario and conditions whereby it can draw the military into longer-term negotiations aimed at addressing the situation and moving back to the democratisation process as it has been experienced.  There are enormous challenges and major sensitivities and none is simplistic.  All of them pose problems or difficulties for those trying to navigate the area.</p><p> Ireland has by all means been speaking out on this very well.  Its position on the UN Security Council means it has some capacity to engage other members on a bilateral basis, particularly other countries in the region, including Vietnam, for example.  Norway is also on the UN Security Council now and it has been quite outspoken.  It has an embassy in Myanmar.  There is capacity for all that to be developed and I have no doubt Ireland's contribution to the UN Security Council is ongoing.</p><p> Humanitarian aid to Myanmar is something promised by the ASEAN summit.  We must be very careful about who would distribute this aid and how it would filter into Myanmar.  It is fair to say that if the military was given access to that aid and asked to distribute it, the civil disobedience movement would refuse to accept that humanitarian aid.  That speaks to the resilience and resoluteness of the civil disobedience movement, so care must be taken on how aid is distributed in Myanmar and who is given responsibility for that.</p><p> I thank Deputy Stanton for his questions.  He mentioned the international arms embargo and the access to weaponry or defence resources that the military in Myanmar has.  It has very substantial reserves of power in that context.  In particular, it has very strong defence links with Russia, with defence contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  The committee is aware that Russia is another member of the UN Security Council that did not support a statement condemning the coup earlier this year.  Russia supplies arms and equipment to Myanmar.  It sees the coup as a domestic matter and it also has a policy of non-intervention in these cases.  Russia is an important player in facilitating what is happening in Myanmar.</p><p> The only different point I could make is that an international arms embargo also has an impact on the ethnic groups and the emergence of what has been called an embryonic federal army that aims to take on the military in Myanmar.  An arms embargo would also affect those groups and there must be an awareness of that.</p><p> Deputy Stanton also asked about Covid-19 and I repeat the points I have made.  The healthcare system in Myanmar is close to collapse.  There is no testing capacity and there has been mass mobilisation of people but we do not have adequate information or data on the extent of Covid-19's spread.  We can only assume it is spreading.</p><p>That causes all sorts of problems within Myanmar, where there is no functioning healthcare system to deal with the fallout and, in addition, the movement of refugees across borders creates its own difficulties in the wider region.</p><p> In terms of destabilisation in the area and the broader geopolitical concerns, the committee will be aware that Myanmar borders not just China but also India, Thailand, Laos and other countries in the region.  There are concerns about conflicts on the borders, particularly if the ethnic groups, many of which are confined to border areas, step up their aggression against the military.  There are fears that conflict would spill over into other countries.  There are also concerns about the way in which a substantial humanitarian and refugee crisis may put pressures on neighbouring states.  There are already hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees located in Bangladesh and adding to those numbers in any way, shape or form has the potential to destabilise the area.</p><p> There are important points to be made about the economic situation in Myanmar, as Deputy Stanton mentioned.  Oil and gas are two important resources in Myanmar and this speaks to one of the recommendations I made in the discussion paper I submitted to the committee.  There are companies such as the US company Chevron with substantial sway and considerable interests in Myanmar.  For decades, Chevron has been working there through a subsidiary called Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise.  This is a State-owned company that is now controlled by the military junta and probably represents the largest source of funding for the military at the moment.  That company runs a massive gas pipeline that has also been linked, in the past, to alleged human rights abuses.  Myanmar's army has been accused of permitting those abuses, including rape and murder, while providing security for the pipeline.  </p><p> Chevron and the French company, Total, transport natural gas from the Andaman Sea to Yangon, Myanmar's most populated city, and to Thailand.  These two companies have substantial stakes in these particular projects.  They have paid hundreds of millions of US dollars in recent years to this State-owned company, the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, which is now, effectively, run by the military.  There have been international calls for these companies not to pay the many taxes and production rights they owe to this particular State-owned company and to instead put those taxes and production rights into escrow accounts to safeguard those resources until such time as there is a return to democratic rule in Myanmar.  There is a strong sense among many in Myanmar that stopping the oil and gas money is a vital way of assisting the democratic struggle there.</p><p> I will say a few words about the fashion industry.  There has been rapid growth in the garment sector in Myanmar, concentrated particularly around Yangon.  Major brands and retailers use the facilities around the city and source materials from Myanmar, including Adidas, H&amp;M, Zara, Primark, which has some interest, Samsonite and Benetton.  We have seen a big increase in exports to the European Union since approximately 2011, when the economy began to liberalise and the democratic system began to take shape.  Many of those companies have severed their links with Myanmar in the aftermath of the coup.  There are, obviously, fears about disruption but there are also fears about reputational damage.  The issue is that this has left many in Myanmar without jobs and income.  It also critically threatens to undermine the advances in worker conditions which had come on the back of these companies taking an interest in Myanmar.  The industry has, of course, also been severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p> On the ground in Myanmar, the civil disobedience movement has been very critical of the fashion industry, which employs hundreds of thousands of people, for the way in which companies have been so tepid in their condemnation of the coup.  The military has also targeted the garment district because many of the workers there live in hostels and dormitories that are relatively easily targeted.  Workers want the fashion industry to make it clear that the suspension of their business in Myanmar is until such time as a democratic government is restored.  They want the fashion companies to speak up and to defend their interests because many of these workers have been fired for attending protests.  Many have been locked into their factories to prevent them attending protests.  Limiting the ability of the military in this context and speaking out against the military would be a considerable moral boost for the protestors in Myanmar.  The garment sector predominantly employs women in Myanmar.  They are a cohort of society that has traditionally encountered a higher degree of discrimination relative to their male colleagues and counterparts.</p><p> I hope I have addressed the bulk of the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

It made for difficult reading and hearing.</p><p>I want to go back to the area of humanitarian aid.  I understand there are some aid workers on the ground at the moment.  I fully take on board Dr. Murphy's point about military interaction with any further aid that could be delivered into the region.  Does she have any more information on the capabilities of the humanitarian workers in Myanmar at the moment?  What resources do they have?  What is their availability to meet increasing demand as more and more people rely on them?  </p><p>I am referring specifically to an article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>that states, &quot;Up to 25,000 villagers have fled their homes and are hiding in jungles and caves&quot; close to the Thai border.  It is critical that there is unhindered and free access for humanitarian workers.  This committee has heard of difficulties in other areas and the impact that has on delivering aid.  What do we know about what is there?  Do we know what their capabilities are, in terms of what we are expecting to be increasing numbers reliant on them?</p><p>Dr. Murphy referred to the fact that the medical system, as such, has faced significant difficulties but is there any access to medical care available, particularly, say, to the likes of children, pregnant women or those who may be suffering from malnutrition in the area?</p><p>How many members of the National League for Democracy are detained or in prison?  Where are those members who are not imprisoned?  What interaction are they having with the countries that surround the area?  If we are now looking at a potential refugee crisis coming from this area, what is the capability of the neighbouring countries to take in those individuals, even on a short-term basis, to meet that immediate need?  There is no doubt in my mind that Ireland and the EU need to work with the countries in the region because we need to see an effective and sustainable outcome to this situation and, if it is in any way possible, to halt the ongoing escalation that is taking place.</p></speech>

Before I revert to Dr. Murphy, there are a number of points or questions that I would also like to put to her.  I acknowledge her frank engagement with us as a committee.  We can follow up as early as Thursday on this.  As she will be aware, Ireland fully supports the sanctions against the perpetrators of the coup and the economic entities that currently sustain the regime.  We are, of course, conscious of the fact that EU sanctions and measures that predate the current coup were in place and were supported by Ireland.</p><p>It is important that we continue to strongly support the measures and perhaps a further expansion.</p><p> In this regard I was very struck by what Dr. Murphy said about the possible engagement with international tech companies, many of which are operating in Ireland.  Obviously, communications from areas such as Myanmar and other areas which from time to time experience unlawful coups are vital.  It is not a new adage that the truth is the first casualty of war.  We need to ensure an adequate flow of information.  The committee will investigate that further to see what can be done from an Irish perspective in respect of our engagement with the tech companies.</p><p> Dr. Murphy said that the response from ASEAN to the political situation fell short of calling for the release of political prisoners.  I ask her to expand on the reasoning for that.  In the past few weeks, I would have thought there was a possibility of suspending Myanmar from ASEAN.  However, Dr. Murphy did not include that in her recommendations, nor did the European Union, which has referred to further engagement of ASEAN.  What are the likely next steps in the engagement with ASEAN, given that she does not support suspension of Myanmar's membership?</p><p> Dr. Murphy responded to Deputy Stanton on the arms embargo, which is crucial notwithstanding the resources that are currently available to the directors of the coup.  She specifically mentioned Russia.  I would add India and China and ask her to respond to that.</p><p> Dr. Murphy recommended the engagement of Irish and international parliamentarians with politicians in Myanmar.  However, the ambassador with a remit for Ireland would be the Myanmar ambassador to the UK, who, of course, was recalled some weeks ago.  I note the Irish Government did not receive any notice of the recall and was not in any way informed.  Therefore, we do not have any direct engagement through ambassadorial channels.</p><p> Dr. Murphy has experience of engaging directly with politicians there.  Would it be fair to say that she has direct knowledge of the work practices and political philosophy of some of the current CRPH members?  Would she recommend international democratic regimes contacting them?  In that regard I ask her to comment on the national mandate of these CRPH members?  What is their remit nationally across Myanmar?  Is it a broadly based political organisation?  As a consequence of that, what international recognition has there been of the CRPH?</p><p> When Dr. Murphy says that there might be further direct engagement, perhaps even towards the civil society, what is her view of there being civil society leadership?  There have been calls internationally for the generals to speak directly to civil society.  Does she believe that would be a meaningful engagement?  What is the strength of the civil society leadership?  This is something that will provide us with further engagement.  I ask her to respond to Deputy Clarke and me on these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.852" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary C.  Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021042700002#H00200"><p>The Chairman and Deputy Clarke made a good point about humanitarian aid.  Most of the NGOs and international development organisations have effectively left Myanmar and very few remain on the ground there.  While there are some, they are very constrained in what they can do, how they can work and how visible they can be.  They are under threat of being detained by the military.  They need to be exceptionally cautious in their work which makes it even more challenging in assisting Myanmar in-country now.</p> <p>  The Deputy rightly made the point that doctors and healthcare system workers have effectively been on strike since the beginning of February.  That has had very real and impactful consequences for the healthcare system in Myanmar.  Doctors and medical personnel are trying to provide some form of care to those who need it urgently and in emergency situations, but they are doing that under the threat of extreme violence and the possibility of detention by the military and beyond that torture, imprisonment and perhaps even worse.  The only medical facilities that are readily available are private hospitals.  These have become exceptionally expensive in recent weeks and are beyond the means of the vast majority of Myanmar citizens.  </p> <p>  There is some voluntary provision of care, but, as I said, that is becoming exceptionally difficult.  Doctors, because of the role they have been playing in the civil disobedience movement, are being targeted by the military.  They have had to act very cautiously in assisting people who may need medical assistance.  This speaks to the way in which a humanitarian crisis is looming in Myanmar in the absence of that kind of medical care for all aspects of society, including children.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the National League for Democracy.  I cannot give a precise figure for the people who are detained, in exile or in hiding, but many of them would be operating under the threat of being picked up by the military and detained.  Much of the work and activity of the national league is being filtered through the CRPH, which is being led by 17 MPs, two of whom represent ethnic parties with 15 representing the NLD.  They would be senior figures within the NLD movement.  That is the focus for engaging with the political system or at least with the alternative political system in Myanmar now.</p> <p>  On the capability of neighbouring countries to accommodate refugees, I made the point that Bangladesh is already hosting hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees.  Thailand is also seeing some influx of refugees right now.  Any influx of refugees in the large numbers that may materialise in the weeks and months to come will be exceptionally challenging for many of these countries, particularly countries like India which, as we know, is experiencing a severe Covid-19 crisis now.  Underdeveloped countries in the region will also struggle to accommodate that kind of influx of refugees and all that goes with that in terms of the economic demands on society and the potential for instability in those border regions.</p><p>I agree there is an onus on the western world and the European Union to look at the way in which NGOs can be mobilised on the borders in Myanmar to deal with the likelihood of large numbers of refugees moving across the borders into other states in the neighbourhood.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for his comments, particularly in regard to the tech industry and other international companies which are operating in Myanmar, and ways in which the committee and its members may be able to engage with those companies in terms of encouraging them to be outspoken in their objections to the Myanmar military coup right now.</p><p> On the question of ASEAN, as we know, it met on Saturday and I made the point that it produced a five-point consensus plan, which must be welcomed, although it fell short in key respects.  I need to put that in a degree of context.  ASEAN is a ten-member body of states in the region.  It is an intergovernmental body and the primary reason for its existence is to maintain peace and stability in the region.  It represents 650 million citizens across the region.  It is guided primarily by the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.  That is a very important principle for ASEAN and, of course, it comes with challenges in that it means ASEAN has historically been accused of not always having a strategic vision in terms of dealing with crises like these.</p><p> There are also diverging priorities among the member states which make up ASEAN and, even on the issue of the Myanmar coup, there are very different perspectives.  Countries like Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia have been more outspoken and have condemned the violence, and they have also expressly called for the release of political prisoners.  That is not something we have seen in regard to other countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, which have been much quieter in terms of responding to the coup.  In fact, countries like Vietnam and even Thailand may be seen as being more sympathetic to the military in Myanmar than to the civilian government.</p><p> There are some strategic difficulties for ASEAN in terms of how it can deal with a crisis like this.  It is not a body which can be compared with the European Union, which is far more developed and advanced in its capacities.  That record of weakness in implementing decisions needs to be watched very carefully in the weeks ahead.  ASEAN is to be applauded for having reached the five-point consensus plan and, in fact, for some observers the extent to which it was able to reach agreement, and we understand agreement was reached with the leader of the military coup on these five points, is to be applauded.  However, the biggest challenge going forward is to ensure the five-point consensus plan is implemented and, even on the first point on the cessation of violence, there is no sign there has been a serious cessation of violence in Myanmar since Saturday, although that was something that was agreed to at the meeting.</p><p> There is a need for the international community to speak up and to pressurise ASEAN and to ensure accountability in terms of pursuing the five-point consensus plan.  I did not mention expelling Myanmar from ASEAN, although some have mooted that as a possibility.  I would see it differently.  I think it is better for Myanmar to be talking to ASEAN than to be excluded from ASEAN at this time.  ASEAN did invite the military to its summit but it did not invite the national unity government.  As I mentioned, there is some concern on the ground in regard to why that happened.</p><p> Some individual countries in ASEAN are, I think, more open to being pressurised than others.  Therefore, there is potential for the Oireachtas and the Irish Government to apply pressure in that particular respect.</p><p> On the issue of Irish parliamentarians and how they might engage in a real and meaningful way with what is happening in Myanmar, the CRPH has spoken to elected representatives in other jurisdictions and it had a meeting with four Members of the European Parliament.  The European Union has not legitimately recognised the CRPH but, nevertheless, there appears to be a degree of empathy for what the CRPH is trying to do.  It has a strong mandate in that all its members were all elected in November 2020 and they are collectively representing more than 400 elected MPs, including members of the National League for Democracy, NLD, and some ethnic groups.  However, on a wider scale, there has been very little in the way of formal recognition for the CRPH and that is primarily a consequence of the fact the CRPH is an organisation in exile.  Accessing the organisation is certainly possible but the capacity for those in the organisation to talk to each other or to have any control over the resources of the state is completely constrained at the moment because of the military coup.  There are difficulties but I would certainly encourage the committee and the Oireachtas to engage with the CRPH, if that is something the committee is open to, and there are ways and means of facilitating that.  It would be a very important message to send to the CRPH and would be very well received by the CRPH.  It would symbolise an enormous commitment on the part of Ireland to what is happening in Myanmar right now and would give a very significant boost to public morale among the civil disobedience movement in particular.</p><p> The Chairman mentioned civil society leadership.  This is a little more disparate and there are not necessarily any key leadership figures we can point to.  Trade union leaders have played an important role in terms of mobilising the civil disobedience movement, but one of the key problems is that many of those in leader positions within civil society have now been detained.  They have been picked up by the military and imprisoned, and some will have lost their lives during the course of these protests.  Therefore, it is very challenging to isolate leadership within the community at the moment, and it is made even more difficult by the absence of information emanating from Myanmar right now.</p></speech>

Deputy Clarke has been responded to and unless there are further questions, I will bring matters to a close.  The fact I do not see other members offering is testament to the comprehensive manner in which Dr. Murphy has dealt with all of the questions.  I thank her.  As the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, we are very anxious at all times to uphold the democratic will and to ensure the wishes of the people are at all times respected.  That, of course, refers to the November election in Myanmar.  I ask Dr. Murphy to give us some closing commentary, after which I will bring the meeting to a close.  I say to members that we may have an opportunity on Thursday to have a look in specific terms at the recommendations of Dr. Murphy and how best we might engage further.  Perhaps Dr. Murphy has a closing message she would like to leave the committee with.  On behalf of our members, I thank her for her very informative engagement with us this afternoon, for bringing and sharing her experience and expertise, and for furnishing us with the content of her very useful survey of the path to embracing democratic structures within Myanmar.</p></speech>

I have spent recent days speaking to colleagues, one or two of whom are still on the ground in Myanmar, and others who have been working in the region.</p><p>They are colleagues I have worked with in the past on surveys we have conducted in Myanmar.  All of them are devastated by the recent events in Myanmar, none more devastated than the Burmese people I worked with on the ground in Myanmar, many of whom are young people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who really began to experience freedoms and democratic stability in the past ten years or so.  I cannot stress to the committee how resolute they are about meeting the challenges of the current situation, defeating the military coup and returning to the democratisation process.  There is an onus on all of us and on the international community to support, recognise and assist that effort because it is the efforts of those people on the ground who wish to see a return to democracy in Myanmar that will ensure the situation stabilises.</p><p> Having said all of that, it is very important for the international community to recognise the seriousness of the crisis in Myanmar and the potential for it to become a failed state in one of the most important geopolitical and economic regions in the world.  That will have consequences for all of us, even those here in Ireland on the western periphery of the European Continent.</p><p> I would offer the committee any further assistance in the future.  I can speak to any of the members privately about the recommendations I have made.  I can, if necessary, help to put them in contact with further witnesses or individuals within Myanmar they may wish to engage with.</p><p> I thank the members most sincerely for their time and their interest.  I know that colleagues in Myanmar are watching today's event and taking heart from their interest in what is happening in the country.  I hope that it will translate further into actions and a greater purpose in terms of assisting that effort in Myanmar right now.</p></speech>

There is a lot to be done.  We will engage as a cross-party group of parliamentarians.  Ireland will further engage through its Government.  We can have further engagement through the EU, acknowledging the endorsement of High Representative/Vice President Burrell's welcome for the five-point consensus coming from ASEAN, as Dr. Murphy mentioned.  We will continue to engage with our colleagues across the EU.  Senator Joe O'Reilly is an active member of Ireland's parliamentary delegation to the Council of Europe.  I am sure the Council of Europe has also been engaged on this issue.  Ireland, as a member of the United Nations, is making contributions on this issue, not only at the Security Council but also at the UN Human Rights Council, acknowledging the points on human rights made by Deputy Clarke.</p> <p>  We will come back to this issue at an early date.  I thank Dr. Murphy for her assistance to this committee.  I have no doubt that we will have further ongoing engagement with her but also with all of the actors involved on what is a humanitarian, political and social crisis within Asia and one that Ireland will actively engage in with a view to bringing matters to a satisfactory and democratic conclusion.</p> <p>  The committee is adjourned until our usual slot at 11.30 on Thursday morning when we will have a private meeting.</p></speech>

The committee has been supplied with a detailed briefing document for each of these Votes in advance of the meeting.</p> <p>  I will outline the work of my Department in light of the proposed 2021 Estimates, and touch on the proposed 2021 Estimate allocations for the President&rsquo;s Establishment, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  While I have certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas for administrative matters in some of these offices, they operate independently of my Department.</p> <p>  On Vote 1, the Estimate for the President's Establishment is &euro;4.51 million.  This includes &euro;3 million for pay and administration, with the balance to fund the centenarians' bounty.  On Vote 3, the Estimate for the Office of the Attorney General is &euro;17.46 million.  Of this &euro;12.26 million relates to staff costs and &euro;2.46 million is allocated to the Law Reform Commission.  On Vote 5, the Estimate for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is &euro;44.7 million.  This provides &euro;16.5 million for fees to counsel engaged by the director to prosecute cases, &euro;7.3 million to fund the local State solicitor service and costs awarded against the State arising out of legal proceedings.  On Vote 6, the Estimate for the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office is just under &euro;37.69 million, the bulk of which relates to salaries and administration.  A provision of just over &euro;16.4 million is allocated for the payment of legal fees incurred.</p> <p>  The Estimate for my Department, Vote 2, is just over &euro;50 million.  Almost 47% of that relates to staff and administration.  The remaining &euro;26 million provides funding for Covid-19 public communications, the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, the National Economic and Social Council and several independent inquiries.</p><p> My Department will continue its central role in providing, co-ordinating and overseeing a whole-of-government focus on the response to Covid-19.  It is vital that we ensure that our overall approach to the management of the pandemic continues to be one that is prudent and sustainable over the immediate-, medium- and longer-term.  It is essential that disease prevalence is brought to lower levels, hospital and critical care occupancy are reduced to low levels and that the most vulnerable are protected through vaccination before further easing of restrictions is considered.  Any easing of measures should be gradual, with sufficient time between phases to assess the impact and to respond if the situation deteriorates.  Subject to the prevailing public health situation, the areas under consideration for after 4 May are a full return of construction, the reopening of cultural institutions, a phased return of non-essential retail and the recommencement of personal and religious services on a staggered basis.  </p><p> Ireland is working as part of the EU in securing a stable supply of Covid-19 vaccinations.  Vaccines continue to be administered very quickly after their arrival here and Ireland is ahead of the EU average for doses administered.  As of yesterday afternoon, a total of all 1,407,184 vaccines had been administered, including 1,007,003 first doses and 400,151 second doses.  One in five of the population who can get the vaccine have received the first dose.  A total of 12,000 vaccinators have also been trained in anticipation of the ramping up of vaccination corresponding with increased supply.</p><p> From the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was recognised that providing clear and timely public information would play a vital role in the State's response to this public health emergency.  There is provision for &euro;15 million for Covid-19 public communications in this Estimate.  The communications programme needed was of an unprecedented scale, comprising the majority of Departments and a large number of State agencies.  Platforms used include national and local print and radio, television and a variety of digital channels depending on the specific audience being targeted.  There have been 45 campaigns completed to date, covering multiple strands, including public health, business reports, well-being supports, societal supports and communications on the various roadmaps to lift the various restrictions.</p><p> The impact of the pandemic on the domestic economy and public finances has been severe.  However, the enormous scale of Government intervention has prevented even larger declines in economic activity, even higher rates of unemployment and an even more rapid rate of firm exit.  We hope it has laid the foundations for a swifter recovery by ensuring businesses can stay viable and survive and that jobs can be retained.  As the virus is effectively brought under control, there will be a need to move away from these extensive and wide-ranging emergency supports, with a move first to more targeted interventions for sectors which remain subject to restrictions, as well as towards investments which support recovery and opportunities for future growth. </p><p> We know that the pandemic has not impacted everyone equally.  It has had a disproportionate impact on people who work in contact intensive sectors, many of whom are younger and on lower pay.  We must ensure that the recovery is inclusive and balanced and recognises the unequal burdens and risk of increasing inequality stemming from the pandemic.  We must also ensure sustainability is to the fore as we rebuild.  There will be challenges, but there will also be opportunities as we transition to more sustainable economic development.</p><p> Work is progressing on the development of the national economic recovery plan to support and reboot the economy to meet all of these challenges.  It will set out a roadmap for a resilient, innovative and productive economy aligned with the Government's green and digital ambitions.  Like all sectors, housing and construction have been impacted by the pandemic.  However, we are committed to working with the sector to deliver an increased supply of affordable, quality and accessible housing.  </p><p> Tackling climate change and transitioning to a climate-neutral economy remains a key focus of this Government.  My Department plays an important role in driving the implementation of our ambitious climate agenda.  This year the key architecture that will frame our approach to climate action for years to come is being put in place.  This includes the climate Bill, Ireland's first carbon budget and an updated climate action plan, all of which will reflect a step up in ambition committed to in the programme for Government.</p><p> My Department played a key role in ensuring a successful outcome in the finalisation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which came into force on 1 January 2021.  This work, together with the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, secured Ireland's key objectives in the Brexit process.  These were protection of the Good Friday Agreement and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, ensuring the best possible outcome for the economy, trade with the UK and the protection of Ireland's place in the Single Market, maintenance of the common travel area and our continued commitment to our place at the heart of Europe.</p><p> My Department has been strongly engaged in the national Brexit readiness work, in close collaboration with the Department of Foreign Affairs and across government.  This has included the development of primary legislation, the provision of financial upskilling and advisory supports for business, extensive stakeholder outreach and a multi-year public communications campaign to promote readiness</p><p> Whole-of-government readiness work must continue as we support businesses or individuals encountering difficulties with customs checks or clearance and as we prepare for the introduction of new UK import controls.  Right across government, we will work to mitigate the impact of Brexit on our economy and citizens.  Covid-19 has also thrown into sharp relief how interconnected and interdependent our world is.  As we work this year to overcome the pandemic and rebuild our economy, we will do so with the added strength and resilience of EU membership and through continued engagement with the wider international community.</p><p> At the beginning of January, Ireland took its seat at the United Nations Security Council.  Our two years on the Security Council is an opportunity for Ireland to make a meaningful contribution to international peace and security.  Three principles underpin our approach: building peace; strengthening prevention; and ensuring accountability.  I plan to participate in a number of high-level debates in at council during our term in office and attend a regular UNGA high level week in September, a month during which Ireland will hold the presidency of the council. </p><p> We marked the 23rd anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement on 10 April.  The Agreement represented a new beginning for political and community relationships on the island, with a new ethos of tolerance, equality and mutual respect.  We must continue to protect and nurture the potential of the Agreement.  I have established a shared island unit in my Department, which is funded from the Department's Vote as a whole-of-government priority to invest in and look to our shared future on the island in an open, inclusive and constructive way, engaging with all communities and political traditions. </p><p> In budget 2021, we established a shared island fund with a major commitment to &euro;500 million in capital funding over the next five years, ring-fenced for North-South investment, to deliver projects that will enhance connectivity, sustainability and opportunity across the island.  To inform how we deepen our co-operation and connections on the island, the unit is progressing the comprehensive research programme, working with the ESRI and other partners to enhance understanding across a range of policy areas.  </p><p> Three shared island dialogue events have been held to date.  There has been engagement with young people on climate and biodiversity issues and on the pivotal role of civil society in our peace process.  There have been really refreshing, practical and thoughtful contributions in the dialogues from a range of community and sectoral perspectives.  </p><p> Through the work of the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality, my Department will continue to support whole-of-government efforts to combat poverty and disadvantage, improve the position of vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, promote diversity and inclusion, tackle inequality in all its forms and provide ongoing support to children and families.  </p><p> Work of the implementation group on policing reform is supported by an implementation office in my Department.  I am encouraged to see the responsiveness and flexibility shown by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with the demands of Covid-19.  Its contribution at an organisational and individual level has been immense and we are extremely grateful to it.</p><p> My Department, together with the Department for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, provides the secretariat to the future of media commission, an independent expert body established by the Government to establish how public service aims can be delivered and sustainably funded through broadcasting, print and online media in Ireland over the next decade.  Since it commenced its work last October, the commission has held a public consultation process that received more than 800 submissions from the public and has run six online dialogues with experts, stakeholders and the public.  The commission is working to a very tight timeline and I expect it will bring forth a set of recommendations to Government by July of this year.</p><p>My Department continues to promote the deliberative democracy process by supporting the current Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality.  The assembly published the results of its voting on 45 key recommendations last Saturday and I thanked the citizens involved for their commitment and hard work.  Their full report, which will set those recommendations in context, is expected to be submitted to the Houses for consideration in June.  The assembly&rsquo;s experience of operating on an online basis will inform the approach to be taken with regard to the other citizens&rsquo; assemblies outlined in the programme for Government. </p><p> Provision is also made in the Estimate in 2021 for a number of independent inquiries, including the Moriarty tribunal, the Cregan commission and the Cooke commission.  The Estimate includes an allocation of just over &euro;2 million for the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, for its work in providing forward looking, strategic advice on economic, social and sustainable development issues.  The current NESC work programme includes a programme of research to support the Shared Island initiative and to contribute to policy response and analysis on Covid-19.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Revised Estimates with Deputies.</p></speech>

At our earlier meeting Senator Higgins and Deputy Farrell raised the issue of the lack of information the committee is receiving on the EU recovery and resilience fund.  While it is not the Taoiseach's Department, the committee would like to have a detailed and comprehensive response from the Minister and the Government on that fund as it operates.  If the Taoiseach could assist in that regard, it would be helpful.</p> <p>  Second, we will have separate meetings on this but it would be helpful if the letters that went to the various individuals regarding the pay agreed for the Secretary General of the Department of Health were furnished, and that those involved furnish the committee with the relevant information that they were asked for.  It is disappointing that their responses have been extremely slow, to say the least, and inadequate in terms of the extent of the information required by the committee.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider the work of the committee and what it is trying to achieve.  It is not personal to anybody or anyone who holds the position of Secretary General; it is simply that the committee has agreed a work programme, has set out the information it requires from the various individuals concerned but the response to date has not been to the standard that I expect from senior civil servants and politicians.  We intend to proceed with our hearings and ask the Taoiseach to influence the others we have written to to ensure that the information required by the committee is forthcoming and that we can deal with the issue comprehensively.</p></speech>

That is a fundamental point that I want to underline.  My officials have co-operated, in my view, with the committee.  Letters have been responded to.  I am not aware of specific information that the Chairman says the committee has not received but I will check.  As far as I can see, we have responded to the correspondence we received from the Chairman on behalf of the committee.</p> <p>  On the recovery and resilience fund, the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are preparing a Government submission to Europe and have been in touch with the European Commission.  It has to be broadly aligned to the EU's recovery and resilience programme and the thematic approach the commission has adopted.  Significant parts of that will involve investment in the green economy and digital transformation.  The allocation to Ireland in grants is expected to be approximately &euro;915 million over a four-year period.  The Government is identifying priorities in the context of that plan and will submit it to Brussels in the first week of May, I think.  That is the essence of it.  I have talked to both Ministers.  The Government is still working on prioritising, and has been doing a lot of work on this over the past while and has been engaged with the Commission.  It also involves country-specific reforms that the Commission may indicate it would like to see consistency in fulfilling reforms it wants in the broader economy.  It will represent a distinct piece of work involving how to strategically use the grants that will come from that fund.  The idea is to concentrate it on some key strategic priorities in digital transformation and the green economy to create jobs.  A broader national economic recovery plan will be published subsequent to that.  There is also the national development plan that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is preparing, which will be a ten-year plan on the structural projects.  There is also the Brexit adjustment reserve fund.  Those are four big pieces of work in the Government's investment agenda, which we will announce during 2021 with a view to developing the economy after.</p></speech>

We look forward to receiving that.  The committee has looked for specific and detailed information around the Secretary General's pay.  The responses have, in my opinion, been weak.  It is the first time that I have seen such a response.  They are usually anxious to give information but it is quite clear from the content of the responses made so far that the information being asked for by the committee is simply being overlooked and not dealt with.  I look forward to the co-operation of the senior civil servants, the Taoiseach and the senior politicians when we undertake the investigation, which is proceeding.  While we are dealing with the Estimates today, I just want to make that point to the Taoiseach.  If we do not conclude the Estimates today, members know that we can come back and go through it on another day.  We will be sending a separate invitation regarding the investigation into the decision that was reached on the &euro;82,000 increase.  I encourage the Taoiseach to get all those involved to review their responses and perhaps come back to us again.</p></speech>

We will write again to those concerned and we will raise the same issues we raised in the previous correspondence.  It would be far better if we were to just get the information we are asking for and moved on.  We are not looking for anything other than how the decision was reached, how the increase of &euro;82,000 was reached at a time the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is telling us about austerity in the future, and the recent announcement by the person appointed that he would not accept the increase until the economy recovered.  We want to find out what that means.  It is not about that particular statement; it is about the position and the payment.  We will write again to everyone and hopefully we will get the information we are asking for.</p></speech>

Maybe this is his first time.  I will add to what the Chairperson has just said.  I do not believe those are the views of the Chairperson alone.  They are shared by many members of the committee.</p><p>My first question relates to Government leaks.  It does not concern the investigation by the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation into the leaking of the document by the T&aacute;naiste.  This concerns a different leak and one that has caused much hurt, anger and pain.  On 10 January, the mother and baby homes report was leaked to the national media before it was shared with the survivors.  I am sure the Taoiseach is as aware as I am of how people, particularly the survivors, found that deeply insensitive, disrespectful and unacceptable.  The Taoiseach responded two days later by saying that the Cabinet had agreed that the Secretary General of his Department would examine the leaking of the details to the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>We are now three months on, so can the Taoiseach inform this committee what this examination found?  Does he know now and has he uncovered who shared the information with the newspaper in question, on whose authority this was done, what the repercussions were and whether there has been any communication with the survivors on this matter in a public way?</p></speech>

Meanwhile, the Government is working to try to deal with the issues that emerged from the recommendations of the report itself, particularly by fulfilling the commitments we have made on the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2021, which is essential for access to information, and in respect of the fund to redress financially and through various other recommended measures the survivors of mother and baby homes.

It concerns the Stardust inquiry.  Budget 2021 allocated funding for an inquest into the Stardust fire after years and years of campaigning by the families.  I commend those families who have never let this issue go.  A commitment was made that no family would be prevented from accessing justice, but that is not the case with many of them now being denied legal aid.  My colleague, Senator Lynn Boylan, spoke about this matter in the Seanad as recently as yesterday.  She said that these families have waited 40 years for justice and are now being asked to supply PPS numbers, bank statements and payslips.  They are even being asked what kind of car they drive.  This is 40 years in the waiting and families still have to fight and to protest for the justice that is their right.  Section 29(2) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 allows for a discretion to waive the financial eligibility test.  This requires a statutory instrument from the Government.  Given the commitment that the Government has given, is it willing to provide that statutory instrument to waive the financial eligibility test for these families who have campaigned and waited for so long?  What communication, if any, has the Taoiseach had with the Office of the Attorney General or with the Department of Justice to bring forward a statutory instrument?  As the Government has made a commitment to the families, what work has the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department done to provide access to legal aid for all of the families concerned?</p></speech>

I do not get involved in every case.  We are very anxious to see that the original Government decision on the inquest will be followed through and facilitated and that the families of the victims will be given every co-operation that we can.  I will pursue that and see what we can do on the issue.  Invariably, legal issues of this kind are not as simple as presented.  I know that from long experience.  Fundamentally, we do not want to have barriers or obstacles in the way of pursuing the truth on this or facilitating families in getting access to information and justice in respect of this case in particular.</p></speech>

He is correct in saying that legal issues are sometimes more complex.  At the heart of this is the financial test to legal aid.  Given the scenario we are dealing with, the fact that it is an inquest and the provision in the 1995 Act to waive that test, surely that should be done in this case so that all of the families who have been impacted will not have to go through the types of obstacles and hurdles I have outlined.  Each of them must now have access to justice in what has been agreed and long and hard fought for, which was an inquest into the Stardust incident.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department is responsible for the implementation of the programme for Government.  While the Department of Finance will obviously have responsibility for the budget, for public expenditure and for the 2021 stability programme update, it nonetheless falls within the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remit to ensure commitments in the programme for Government are delivered.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that the stability programme update contains a 3.5% increase in expenditure year-on-year over the next number of years.  Is he aware that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has said that the fiscal projections rely on technical assumptions that do not reflect the Government's priorities and that projected spending increases are very close to what is needed just to cover rising prices, wages and demographics?  In plain man's text, there is no money to deliver the commitments that are in the programme for Government under what is published in the stability programme update, not alone to talk about the commitments on major spending items like Sl&aacute;intecare or the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.905" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021042700002#D02500"><p>First of all, the Government is investing on an unprecedented scale in respect of its commitments under the programme for Government and, in the context of Covid-19, in underpinning the wider economy with the various supports that we have put forward to protect employers, to keep businesses intact during the Covid-19 period, to provide the pandemic unemployment payment to employees who are unemployed and to keep employees tied to enterprises so that these businesses may be kept viable for the future.  There has also been a variety of very significant expenditures in education, health and across all of the various Departments to underpin activities that are under way within those Departments.  The stability programme update is not the budget but it gives a broad technical framework as to where we are in fulfilling our commitments in that regard.</p><p>They do not exclude further increases, for example, in subsequent budgets or prioritisation that Governments may take beyond that.  There are two key dimensions here as far as I see it: one is the degree to which we emerge from Covid and evolve from the level of supports that we currently have in place.  I think we can get to a reasonable position in terms of reducing deficits over time, as specific Covid expenditure falls away and the economy reboots and restarts.  Substantial elements of the current expenditure profile are made up of Covid expenditure, both current and, in some respects, capital.  There will be challenges but, on the other hand, the macroeconomic advice from the Commission, the ECB, the IMF and others is to maintain the stimulus position until we emerge stronger out of Covid-19 and reboot the economy.  It is not all within the stability programme update.  There are a number of key issues.  The budget will be the key milestone.  The national economic recovery plan that we announced, the national development plan, NDP, will have clear indicative programmes in the coming years.</p></speech>

Could he comment on whether that is the direction of travel in terms of Government policy on the PUP?  What would he say to all of those who have been made unemployed as a result of the pandemic, some who cannot go back to work because of public health restrictions that may still be in place at that time when it is planned to cut the payments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.908" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021042700002#E00300"><p>No decision has been made to cut anything at the end of June.  The clear international advice globally is that countries must be very careful that we do not cut off supports too early because it could create a very negative impact on the economy.  As we reopen sectors of the economy and people go back to work there will be a fall-off in the number of people who avail of the PUP.  It will decline naturally.  People will go back to work in construction and in retail as we emerge from Covid-19.  We must tailor supports over time and look at how we can help some sectors to restart and give them added support in the rebooting phase.  I am thinking in particular of the hospitality and tourism area to see what we can do to help those sectors and later the entertainment sector.  However, we must get the numbers down.  As things stand, we have given clarity that up to the end of June the range of supports we currently have will stay in place.  By the end of June, we hope to be in a much better position regarding Covid and that sectors of the economy will have restarted so that the dependence on the support mechanisms will reduce.  We will have a chance to focus on the budget then.</p></speech>

We all want restrictions to be lifted in line with the public health advice and for people to be able to get back to work, but we also know that in the third quarter of this year 180,000 people are projected to be unemployed as a result of the pandemic restrictions due to Covid.  It is outlined in the stability programme update that the pandemic unemployment payment will not exist in 2022.  That is there in black and white in the report.  What is reported is that it will be phased out from the end of June onwards.  Is the Taoiseach denying that it will be phased out?  Could he give the commitment given by his predecessor that the supports will not be cut while sectors are restricted from returning to work as a result of public health guidelines?</p></speech>

Our total supports to date represent 18.4% of national income.  Deputy Doherty is trying to present a picture of cuts.</p></speech>

He is asking me questions in the context of creating the impression that massive cuts are on the way, whereas the story of this Government has been one of unprecedented intervention and support of income and jobs.  We intend to maintain that theme of support for jobs and incomes but in 2022 we hope to be well out of this Covid experience.  That is the hope of all of us.  That would mean a different type of situation then in terms of the interventions by the Government in the form of income supports and supporting companies to provide employment.  We hope that we would return to some level of a new normal but that we would also invest in new areas such as the green economy, digital transformation and the hospitality, travel and tourism sectors to try to get people back to work.  The main focus of the national economic recovery plan is jobs and getting people back to work, in particular young people who have suffered a lot during this pandemic.  Therefore, there might be a need to tailor supports, but the idea that we would keep the same supports going well into 2022 or forever is not tenable either.  If we get out of the grip of Covid-19 and the influence it has on it, we will have to look at new areas for the allocation of expenditure, in particular in sectors that have suffered more than most in the past 12 months.</p></speech>

Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis an Taoiseach for his appearance and, most importantly, for the weighty documentation his Department presented in advance, which allows us the ability to dig in.  I will ask two sets of questions on two very specific areas.  They are pretty different from what Deputy Doherty asked but very similar to ones I regularly put to the Taoiseach on the floor of the D&aacute;il during Question Time.</p> <p>  The first relates to Vote 2, part F, the shared island unit in the Department.  It is something that I have said many times is an extremely welcome initiative driven by the Taoiseach's personal commitment.  It has significant potential for everyone on this island regardless of our political beliefs.  The unit has been allocated a ring-fenced budget of &euro;500 million, which is extremely welcome.  A review is in progress and three quasi-virtual dialogues have been held.  Where is the advance in concrete proposals?  I think, for example, of the Narrow Water bridge that has full planning permission and buy-in from both local authorities.  It is supported by both the Executive and the Government here and it is something that, for want of a better word, is an easy win and can be achieved.  Any possible strengths that will come out of the shared island unit will only be displayed when there are tangible and physical results, not just conversations but actual physical work.  What is the status of that particular project, but also other ones the Taoiseach has mentioned many times in various speeches and within the programme for Government that are so important to show how important this unit is to communities North and South?  I will come back in when the Taoiseach has replied.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.919" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021042700002#E01400"><p>It is a very important piece of work.  The &euro;500 million will be allocated through the relevant Departments for those expenditure items.  A key project to which we have already allocated funding of approximately &euro;6 million is the Ulster Canal.  We intend to do more there to bring that project ultimately to conclusion.  It will make a significant difference in bringing people together from both sides of the Border to enjoy a wonderful amenity and also develop a first-class facility for people to enjoy.</p> <p>  We have an interesting project coming forward on research.  We are trying to develop a programme for research in third-level institutions, PRTLI, type project to be funded through the shared island unit in terms of collaboration between third level bodies North and South on topics of mutual interest.  Both of those are coming close to realisation.  We are working with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  We have already allocated some basic grants for research projects of &euro;20,000 per project on the shared island itself.</p> <p>  The Narrow Water bridge project is one I am interested in pursuing.  Both county councils are committed to it.  I have been in touch with the Minister for Infrastructure, Nichola Mallon, on the Northern side.</p><p>We are hoping to progress that.  Close to June, I would like to be in a position to outline some further projects on which we can get agreement and to which we can give the go ahead.  The Deputy will be conscious we have supported a feasibility study with regard to North-South high-speed rail.  We have also supported a complementary industrial project in Derry and Letterkenny, in conjunction with the City Deal initiative.  We will create industrial parks on both the Derry and Donegal sides to try to develop both indigenous industry and foreign direct investment.  This will be an investment in the North West Regional Development Group, whose members have worked consistently over many years irrespective of politics.  We would like to be in a position to support that initiative, which will complement the work the group is doing.  We will also be funding a feasibility study with regard to the Sligo-Enniskillen greenway.  We announced quite a number of projects at the North-South Ministerial Council plenary session at Christmas.  We hope to be in a position to announce spending on a number of further concrete projects in June.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.921" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021042700002#F00200"><p>I thank the Taoiseach very much for that.  The real proof of this shared island initiative will be the sight of actual shovels in the ground and material advancements so that people can see these projects.  The buy-in of the Northern Executive will be very important.  I hope that certain political noises and stand-offs between certain elements of the Executive can be avoided to progress projects.  That just makes sense for everyone on this island.</p> <p>  One of the issues the Taoiseach touched on was that of high-speed rail between Dublin and Belfast.  This will be very important to the new Dublin-Belfast economic corridor.  It also feeds into a second area, which relates to Vote 2.  I refer to the Government's post-Brexit trade and investment plans.  One of the great skills of one of the Taoiseach's predecessors, an iarThaoiseach, Enda Kenny, was his ability to take to the world and sell Ireland, to get companies of all sizes to invest in the country and to push through really imaginative projects that allowed the economy to recover and which restored so many people's jobs.  Deputy Doherty has already spoken about those who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic.  That will be a very significant challenge.</p> <p>  With regard to that section of Vote 2, the Department of the Taoiseach not only works alongside but co-ordinates with State agencies like Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland which come under the T&aacute;naiste's Department.  There is also the matter of how the Taoiseach envisages maximising Ireland's role on the UN Security Council.  There are only 18 months left in that appointment.  A great deal has been curtailed by the pandemic but the Taoiseach has said, both in his address and in the supporting documentation, that his Department has big plans for that role.  As we are facing into a very acute economic squeeze post pandemic, with the spectre of the lingering fallout of Brexit, will the Taoiseach flesh out how his Department will lead the economic charge in that regard, bearing in mind the great work done by his predecessors, such as Enda Kenny?</p></speech>

We had many meetings, under the auspices of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, with companies and economic interests in the United States in respect of our interests in terms of both companies that want to expand into the United States and American companies that invest and are present in Ireland.  Over recent months, I have held regular meetings with significant senior personnel in many multinational companies.  These were held virtually as we could not travel.  Thousands of jobs have been announced.  Since January alone, I estimate that up to 6,000 jobs have been announced in a number of companies.  There have been very significant announcements from the likes of Intel and from quite a range of digital companies that have announced plans for expansion and investment.  As we get out of the Covid pandemic, we will be able to do this better by getting out there and visiting these companies.  I anticipate the Government doing that with vigour once we can do so as a result of greater vaccination rates across Europe and the world.  That will enable us to get back out there again with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to advance Ireland's cause and to create jobs.</p> <p>  Some work has recently been done by the T&aacute;naiste's Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the value of economic trade agreements.  This will be published.  The research refers to four trade agreements, those with Korea, Japan, Canada and Mexico.  These trade agreements have resulted in dramatic and very significant increases in Ireland's exports.  We are a global nation and depend on global connectivity.  I am very conscious of that.</p> <p>  With regard to our role on the UN Security Council, Ireland has been working extremely hard and doing a lot of work.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been leading this contribution admirably.  I intend to be there in September, as I have said.  We have had engagement in respect of that, especially with regard to Syria and getting the agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue back on track.  We have also had engagement on the climate front.  We put the whole climate security issue on the agenda.  So far, our representatives have been very effective and we hope to build on that.  Our values and our approach to the conduct of international relations include encouraging a rules-based approach to international organisation and taking a peaceful approach to conflict.  We want to apply the values that have informed Irish foreign policy over the years in the context of our membership of the UN Security Council.  We do not necessarily wish to use our membership to raise our economic profile but rather to have a good and beneficial impact on the world, as best we can, through the Security Council.</p> <p>  With regard to the situation post Brexit, we need to do further analysis of the impact of Brexit on the British economy, as we export a great deal to Britain.  The early figures as to the reductions in trade flows are significant.  It remains to be seen whether these reductions will be sustained.  That is something on which we have to keep an eye.  In our engagement with the British Government, we are developing post-Brexit structures between Britain and Ireland.  This will replace the kind of engagement we had as common members of the European Union.  The work is ongoing with regard to the approach to the British-Irish dimension post Brexit but also with regard to putting the EU-UK relationship on a stronger basis.  I hope that is happening because it would have a beneficial impact on the Irish trading experience for our exporters and importers and on the issue of Northern Ireland and the protocol.</p></speech>

I echo the points raised earlier.</p> <p>  I mainly want to ask the Taoiseach about Covid supports, and the pandemic unemployment payment in particular.  Before I do so, however, I want to tease out an issue.  It is possible I picked the Taoiseach up incorrectly, so this may be an opportunity for clarification, but I thought the Taoiseach said in his introduction that the State's vaccination programme is ahead of the European average.  Will the Taoiseach clarify his comment in that regard?</p></speech>

Is the Deputy referring to my opening remarks?  He is.  I am sorry, the Deputy is right.  I said, "Vaccines continue to be administered very quickly after their arrival here and Ireland is ahead of the EU average for doses administered."</p></speech>

These are the most recent figures I have, but they are two days old and the Taoiseach may have access to more recent ones.  If he can, he might clarify.  All of that said, the percentage of the population that has received one dose is 20% whereas the EU's percentage is 21.26%.  In terms of what is probably the best indicator of where a nation stands, that being, doses per hundred, Ireland's figure was 28.6 whereas the figure for the EU was 29.18.  This seems to indicate that, if anything, Ireland is behind the European average - not by a massive amount, but behind all the same - and that a statement asserting that we are ahead of the European average is not correct.  Would the Taoiseach like to clarify?</p></speech>

Perhaps the Taoiseach can clarify further.</p><p>In any case, I will turn to the key point that I want to raise.  The <i>Irish Examiner</i>reported yesterday that there was to be a special Cabinet meeting at which the issue of unwinding Covid supports would be the sole item on the agenda, with reductions in the pandemic unemployment payment over the summer at the top of the list.  Was that report incorrect?  If it was correct and there is a plan for such a meeting, can the Taoiseach give us its date?</p></speech>

I am the Taoiseach and I am not aware of any special Cabinet meeting being organised to discuss the unwinding of supports.  I have not seen the specifics of the report in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>and I am not commenting on it because I do not have it in front of me, but we have not considered the holding of any Cabinet special committee to unwind supports.</p></speech>

There is a Cabinet sub-committee that has been working on the national economic recovery plan, the recovery and resilience plan and various aspects of the economy.  That meets regularly.  There would not be a need for a special Cabinet meeting in the first instance.  They would work their way through the Cabinet sub-committee if there were to be decisions of that kind.</p><p>For the sake of transparency, at Cabinet meetings <i>per se</i>, there can be expenditure reviews that various Ministers bring forward.  They can be quarterly reviews and Ministers say how spending is going in their Departments, both current and capital.  That is just good husbandry.  It makes sense in terms of identifying earlier if there are underspends or overspends and whether we need to reallocate moneys to areas where they can be spent.</p></speech>

The article referred to troika-style spending reviews for Departments and the need for a special Cabinet meeting.  We will note the fact that the Taoiseach has indicated that there is no intent to have such a meeting and we will move on.</p> <p>  The so-called Covid solidarity tax or Covid wealth tax came back into the news at the start of April when a senior official in the International Monetary Fund, IMF, voiced support for it.  It landed in Ireland again when a Minister of State - I believe it was Deputy Joe O'Brien of the Green Party - voiced his support for such a tax and wrote to the Minister for Finance in that regard.  The basic argument put forward was that there were people who had gained enormously financially since the start of the pandemic and others who had been significant losers on the financial front.  Some of the former include large pharmaceutical corporations, corporations that provide Zoom meetings and other social media meetings of that kind, etc.  Obviously, people who have lost their jobs and, in particular, the poor and the young have lost out financially.  It struck me that the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach were very quick to rule out that tax and argumentation was not given to support the logic of their position.  Many commentators wonder whether the ruling out of this suggestion was overly hasty and perhaps put Ireland behind the curve.  The IMF is not in any way a radical organisation.  It is proposing to clip the wings of the super wealthy in order to defend the system of the super wealthy, but it is proposing this as a serious suggestion.  It has been ruled out very hastily, though.  Will the Taoiseach comment on the idea that it was overly hasty to do so and that the Government has perhaps-----</p></speech>

I think the context there is that, as I said earlier, 18.4% of the national income is the level of support that the Irish Government has put in play.  It is an unprecedented level of State expenditure.  The State has never been more involved in the economy than now because of the pandemic.  I would ordinarily have thought that such a position was something that Deputy Barry would have embraced.</p> <p>  In terms of the reviews, we want to get people back to work and we want to get sectors reopened in the economy.  If we can, that will be a natural reduction in some of those expenditures, be it the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, or the pandemic unemployment payment.  We do not want to hit the economy with measures that could restrict the growth of the economy in 2021 and 2022.</p><p>That is why there is a view that the idea of a Covid-19 solidarity tax is not something that the Government is minded to do.  Government is not minded to do that right now.  Government wants to assist and facilitate recovery rather than choke it off unnecessarily, although I am not saying one issue on its own will choke it off.  That philosophy will govern how we emerge from Covid-19.  We want to try to reposition the economy so that we can create jobs and get sectors that have been hit hardest back up and running.</p><p> We have to look attentively at the sectors that have been hit hardest.  I have identified some of them and they include hospitality, tourism, travel, aviation, entertainment, music and the arts.  All these sectors have suffered greatly as a result of Covid-19.  We have borrowed a vast amount of money to sustain this period.  We are in a position to be able to do that given the role of the European Central Bank in underpinning the sovereigns throughout Europe and the collective way Europe has approached this.  That is why we took the approach we did in terms of the idea spoken about by the Deputy.  That is how we see it.</p><p> We have a progressive tax system in Ireland.  Those on higher incomes are taxed more.  That is a fact of the Irish taxation model.</p><p> There is a balance here.  We want to try to create and grow enterprise as we emerge from the pandemic.  We want to create new opportunities for people to create jobs as well.  GDP is forecast to expand by 4.5% this year and 5% next year.  Modified domestic demand is probably a more useful indicator and that is projected to go up by 2.5% this year and to reach 7% next year, which is significant.  There are large amounts of savings.  Can we trigger some of that back into the economy?</p><p> We have to work on many issues.  We are looking at developmental things.  How do we get construction back up and running?  How do we get greater delivery on the construction side?  How do we get more houses built in 2021 and 2022?  These are key parts of the agenda.  Can we get the skills side of that sector up and running?  The reason for the launch of the national apprenticeship programme is to get far more apprentices into the field to back up the national electrical programme and several initiatives we have under way.  We also need to continue to develop our health services post pandemic and learn lessons from it.</p></speech>

I believe the increase is appropriate to the position.  I believe that long after the incumbent leaves the position the Secretary General of the Department of Health should get higher remuneration than Secretaries General of other Departments.  It is an extraordinary Department, one that is way above any other Department in terms of the responsibility.  I have served in four Departments.</p> <p>  This is a policy matter in the first instance.  In some areas where we have done this before in the public service it has worked, whether it be in respect of the National Treasury Management Agency, National Asset Management Agency, the chief executive of the HSE, the Garda Commissioner or the financial regulator.  In my view it is not only about one individual in the Department but rather the Department of Health and the responsibilities it has in terms of the allocation of the overall budget that goes to the Department, the transformation required in health, the need to address the issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, the implementation of the transformative programme of Sl&aacute;intecare and the vast budget.  We have had issues around the national children's hospital and so on.</p> <p>  The Secretary General has now taken the position in respect of himself and that was his decision.  My view is we need to work on the Department of Health and transform it.  The Department has a major challenge ahead.  The issues the Department of Health has to deal with in any one year, even outside of the pandemic, are on a scale that is higher than other Departments.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach mentioned this in his opening address.  The first module of the commission has been examining the write-down of &euro;119 million in debt by the State-controlled Irish Banking Resolution Corporation with the sale of Siteserv.  The Taoiseach will remember this was a major crisis when it came to light previously.  We understand the company was acquired by another company that was in the control of Denis O'Brien at the time.  I am flabbergasted this particular module has been going on for six years.  I understand that in recent weeks the Taoiseach has given the go-ahead for another extension until October.  The final cost of this commission could be &euro;30 million according to sources in the Government.  The cost could run up to &euro;70 million depending on how it completes.</p> <p>  Two major questions arise in the minds of people on this.  There is the question of the length of time for justice to be achieved.  That is a major question.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  This rocked the Government six years ago and is still receding into history without an answer of justice, and that is problematic.  At issue is &euro;30 million of taxpayers' money, which is especially difficult to raise at this stage.  What will the Government do to ensure that the commission achieves its investigative purpose in a reasonable time and within a reasonable budget?</p></speech>

We received a request.  The interim report suggests it is at an advanced stage and there is a reasonable prospect of it being brought to conclusion.  That is my view from what has been written to me as the administrative head.  Therefore, we have written to all the relevant people outlining the decision to grant the recent request for a further extension until 31 October of this year.  If that had not been granted, it would have had the effect of dissolving the commission with no findings to show or no return on the substantial costs to date, which run to &euro;9.6 million.  We would have no return for those costs or any additional costs that would occur but are not yet paid.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach mentioned the shared island element in his address.  The Minister of Health in the North of Ireland, Mr. Robert Swann, stated just in the past week that he was finding it difficult to achieve co-operation with the southern Administration and that there was not a natural flow of information to his Ministry.  He indicated, for example, that information pertaining to variants found in the South was obtained by him through the media.  Is it not incredible, when there is so much logic to an all-Ireland approach to the illness, that there is a unionist, who in general would have an aversion to North&ndash;South co-operation, complaining about the southern Government not communicating key information required to ensure the health and well-being of the population?  I have asked the Taoiseach where the secretariat is for North-South co-operation on Covid.  I understand there is none.  I asked him to state which Department is the locus of North-South co-operation on Covid and I now understand there is no specific Department managing this.  Why is it that unionist ministers are complaining about the lack of co-operation of the southern Administration on a life-and-death issue such as this?</p></speech>

I did not interrupt the Deputy.  I want to make it very clear that I have had discussions with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister about variants as far back as variant B117.  Our Chief Medical Officer has had discussions with Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer in respect of B117, which is one of the earliest variants and one we all know too much about because of the degree to which it spread so rapidly here, in the North and the rest of the UK, and now elsewhere across Europe.  If I am not mistaken, everyone has acknowledged that the relationship between both sets of officials, North and South, has been constructive and productive.</p> <p>  The main area of difficulty has concerned travel information in terms of the passenger locater form information.  We took steps to be satisfied in this regard.  Requests were made of the Northern Ireland Executive in regard to it.  A memorandum of understanding between the two Chief Medical Officers has been signed.  They engage regularly in respect of decisions they are taking.  On the political side, so too do the Executive and Irish Government.  The Minister for Health here, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has engaged with Mr. Robin Swann, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has also engaged with political leaders in Northern Ireland.  I engage in discussions with Ms Arlene Foster and Ms Michelle O'Neill at various times on aspects and dimensions of Covid.</p></speech>

I understand from his response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n on the increase in salary for the new Secretary General of the Department of Health that he has the same view as his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, that is, that the new pay increase is commensurate with the scale of responsibility.

Does the Taoiseach believe, therefore, that the scale of responsibility of the new head of the Department of Health is actually greater than that of the Taoiseach?</p></speech>

I did not enter politics with an eye on salaries.  Obviously, I believe in the basic principle that a Deputy's salary should be linked to that of a principal officer because I can recall a time, before the principle was put into effect, when politicians were competing with each other to try to reduce pay to see who was the best in the class and to get the best media commentary.  I believed the reform many years ago to connect a Deputy's salary to that of a principal officer was good.  Now and again, of course, when there are public service pay increases more generally, the focus falls on the increase for Deputies.  When it comes to the salary of Ministers and the Taoiseach, the remuneration is high.  I do not have any issue with that other than that if we are trying to attract people from different careers and fields, we have to look differently at it.</p> <p>  It is interesting, if one thinks about it, that the State, at local and national levels, has no difficulty in contracting individuals and companies, but mainly companies, at much higher levels of expenditure.  We need to reconsider that.  Many issues have arisen in the Department of Health over many years.  Genuinely, given the nature of the budget, more than &euro;20 billion, the position is as I describe.  We saw issues associated with the children's hospital manifesting themselves.  I am of the view we have a chance and opportunity.  Through Covid, we can learn a lot.  Sl&aacute;intecare, with full Oireachtas agreement, has really transformed our approach to health.  I am not saying it is down to one individual &mdash; of course it is not &mdash; but it sends a signal that we are going to deal with health positively and constructively through giving it a higher focus in terms of both policy and execution.  We did that with the HSE, which was important, and we did it with the Garda Commissioner, the National Treasury Management Agency and other bodies.  It was effective.  I appreciate that not everybody would agree with me on this but that is my view on it.</p></speech>

I am sure that many people, when they look at the salary scale, would have a view on this.  We need to admit there was a lot of outrage over the increase.  When people note that the Taoiseach is on a lower salary than the new head of the Department of Health, they will be quite astonished.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach made an interesting point on attracting people into the sector.  We have had many a debate on this with various Ministers.  An interesting point that keeps cropping up is that we need to be able to attract international talent.  We have seen that only three of the 23 applicants were international.  What really shocks people is that it turns out we have somebody who was working for the State who was more than capable of doing the job and more than willing to take it.  The individual even waived the salary increase.  Therefore, it is quite clear the massive increase, of &euro;81,000, was not in fact needed.</p></speech>

The decision on the competition is independent, based on the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, approach and model, but, even for the successor to the incumbent, I would still leave the salary at the level in question.  I was a Minister for Health and witnessed at first hand the enormity of issues and the rapidity with which they arrive on the desk of a Secretary General.  The Department of Health is not like other Departments.  Sometimes in the political debate, it is easy to have a go at these points.  I appreciate that and that people have different perspectives, but when it comes to the substance and detail of this, I am of the view that while my approach is not the only approach, it is a correct one.  There are other elements we have to put in place as well.  We have to fund health to a greater degree and reform it also.  A combination of funding and reform will enable us to have a stronger and better health service in the future.  We need a more strategic, focused Department once it gets away from firefighting Covid-19.</p></speech>

To be clear, I am not raising this to score political points, and I am not saying the Taoiseach was suggesting I was.  I fundamentally believe the decision was wrong and rooted in inequality.</p> <p>  I want to move on to the issue of the shared island unit.  With regard to the recent disturbances, how much of the funding for the shared island unit will be targeted at reaching out to loyalist and unionist communities?</p></speech>

There is also a reconciliation fund, which is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the PEACE fund, which is quite substantial.  There is more than &euro;1 billion in the PEACE fund, &euro;500 million in the shared island fund and a number of millions in terms of the Department of Foreign Affairs budget for reconciliation and outreach to communities, particularly disadvantaged communities.  My view is that we need to do more in respect of outreach to disadvantaged communities in the North, especially in loyalist communities.  When I use the term "socioeconomic", I am speaking about the levels of unemployment.  That applies in regard to the nationalist communities as well.  I have consistently raised with the British Government, and will continue to raise, the need for very substantial investment in the area of early school leavers, school completion, progression to further education and third level education and the creation of opportunities for employment.  Many young people live in areas where this does not exist at the moment.  This is one of the areas that has not been sufficiently developed in the context of the Good Friday Agreement.  I have long held that view.  I would like to see a commitment over and above what we are already providing in collaboration with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.</p></speech>

The Green Party in Northern Ireland has introduced the Northern Ireland climate change Bill.  It is timely that the Green Party, as an all-island political party, is front and centre in introducing transformative and ambitious climate action legislation.  I understand the Bill is on Committee Stage today.  I am fairly sure there are people who will oppose the science and the required net zero target of that Bill.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, the Taoiseach spoke about interconnectedness.  Nothing connects us more than the natural environment.  There are issues of climate change that will affect us as an island.  The climate environment knows no borders.  How important is it that Northern Ireland adopts the net zero target in context with the ambition stated here and in the UK?</p> <p>  On the shared island unit and the climate change unit, will the Taoiseach update us on the negotiations or work that has been ongoing to ensure we have all-island climate action?</p></speech>

The UK Government as a whole has set fairly ambitious targets as well in regard to climate.  In Northern Ireland and in terms of the all-island context, we believe climate is an obvious issue for the shared island unit and the shared island dialogue series.  There has been one very good series of all-island dialogues North and South.  Climate does not recognise any border so it is very important Northern Ireland would sign up to this and all of its implications.  There are opportunities here as well in terms of the creation of jobs.</p> <p>  I would like to see joint actions between ourselves and the Northern Ireland Executive on biodiversity projects.  I am saying to colleagues on the Border and in the North that there are opportunities for funding from the shared island fund in respect of the protection and so on of biodiversity.  That is just one concrete example of where we could do something really effective on the ground.  We also need to get alignment on awareness of the issues and on development of the debate around climate change.  We are anxious to pursue that through the dialogue series and to get an all-island approach to it.  We will work with all parties and, in particular, civil and environmental groups that are focused on this area to ensure we get unit of approach.</p></speech>

It is vital we take action on marine protected areas that covers all of the waters around our island, and in the area of transport.  Investment in improving that interconnectivity through the Belfast-Dublin rail line is imperative as well in terms of reducing transport emissions.  I see a number of opportunities there.  Will the Taoiseach comment on the discussions he has had on the Belfast-Dublin rail line and improvements in that regard?</p></speech>

That realm of public transport lends itself to an all-island approach, which would be to the benefit of all, not only from a climate change perspective but also from an economic and mobility perspective and the perspective of the integration of people throughout the island.  All types of links would flow from that approach.  As a Government, we are committed to that.  The feasibility work needs to get under way.  We want to do that work expeditiously so that this gets real follow-through.</p> <p>  In terms of the marine protected areas, there is potential for an east-west and North-South approach to this issue that will be very important.  The Deputy will be aware that in the Republic we are developing the marine planning Bill because we want to create a single mechanism planning framework that will facilitate, for example, developments of offshore wind.  The next decade in offshore wind will be very significant.  I also see the potential of collaboration.  I mentioned to the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce last week during my engagement with it that we are committed to the offshore wind agenda for the next number of years.  It would make sense, therefore, that there would be a North-South approach to that as well from a private sector investment perspective and a public sector underpinning of it.</p><p>In those areas, and perhaps also in marine research, we are going to facilitate North-South research, as I have said.  We would fund it from the shared island fund.  We will work with both the Executive and the British Government in that respect if they can add to that value to it.  The British Government may want to do so.  I know the Prime Minister supports the shared island idea.  We could very well get some east-west, North-South dimensions to those areas that have been mentioned, particularly the marine protected areas and the wider climate issue.</p></speech>

It is particularly important that investment and supports are required for the data gathering and science gathering we need for marine areas.  While I fully support the offshore renewable energy industry and the positive benefits it can bring in areas like job creation, energy resilience and surety of supply, we must ensure that development is carried out with marine protection and the preservation of that fragile environment at the forefront.  That work is going to require significant research and investment in research capabilities.  I was delighted to hear it mentioned by the Taoiseach.  I support it and thank the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

I thank and congratulate all of the people in the public and private sectors who have been involved in fighting the virus, which looked like an impossible task at the beginning but is beginning to show results.  Will a resurgence in the virus require a further intervention in some shape or form?  I do not suggest a lockdown.  Do the Taoiseach and the various Departments have a proposal in mind to curtail a resurgence without a lockdown?</p></speech>

Our strategy has worked since Christmas but it has been very difficult for people and it has been very difficult for various sectors of the economy in particular.  Companies have been hanging in there to try to keep themselves alive during a very difficult period for them, economically speaking and in terms of viability.</p> <p>  We have taken the pressure off the health service substantially.  It was in a terrible state in January.  The numbers were just too high and the pressure on the system was too high.  We got case numbers down.  Now the vaccination is going up apace.  Currently, I think we are at about 25%, or so it is my understanding, although Deputy Barry might have mentioned 20%.  We were at 25% some days ago in relation to that so we are in a good position.  As vaccination increases, we hope we can avoid the scenario that has been outlined.  We know that the vaccines have been effective.  The incidence of death and severe illness has gone way down among those who have been vaccinated.  Within the week we will have 95% of all over-70s vaccinated with a first dose of a vaccine, which offers huge protection.  We have all the nursing home residents and front-line health care workers vaccinated with first doses, and also, substantially, the over-70s, more or less.  We are into the 60s age cohort now.  The point I am making is that we can avoid this if we do it right because of the vaccination combined with the progress we have made to date.</p></speech>

In that context, will particular attention be given to those sectors of the economy that were particularly hard done by during the lockdown?  In local towns and villages throughout the country, services like clothes shops and boutiques, which served the local community and were iconic for the local economy, could not operate and had to close down whereas their competitors in larger cities were able to continue.  During the recovery, will particular attention be given to those who suffered the most in that regard?</p></speech>

Many people in the different sectors have actually articulated their appreciation for the level of supports.  They did not catch everybody in some respects.  There are still some minority groupings who did not quite get caught due to the criteria attached to some of the supports.  In terms of moving out of Covid, emerging from the Covid period and the national economic recovery plan, we are going to pay attention to those sectors that have suffered more than most to see whether we can give more developmental assistance.  That has to be worked out.  We will look at whether we can do things that will enable them to make a good recovery from what has been a very difficult period for them.  I am conscious, as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been, that certain multiples should not exploit a situation when small individual retailers are closed, for example.  In terms of drapery, clothes and other types of products that cannot be sold in retail shops at the moment, I am aware of some attempts to circumvent that and the Garda has clamped down on that.</p></speech>

There is a recognition that the peace process must be worked at on a continual basis and that measures must be taken to address issues that might arise at local level in the North of Ireland.  I know that there has been quite an amount of discussion on whether a border poll should be taken now.  In some areas, it is felt that a border poll should not take place for many years.  Regardless of what happens, it is essential that both communities in Northern Ireland are reassured of the benign approach from the South of Ireland and from all the signatories to the Good Friday Agreement.  There is a necessity to ensure that this continues.  There is also a necessity to identify and address social or economic difficulties that may have arisen or are an ongoing source of aggravation.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that any such difficulties are being addressed adequately?  I agree entirely with the shared island approach.  Are there other issues that need to be advanced in that area?</p></speech>

Let us use a "benign approach", as the Deputy put it.  I would say that we must be proactively constructive in developing good cross-Border initiatives and economic alignment.</p> <p>  I was very struck by the meetings I had with the various council groups.  The north west regional group really impressed me because they leave politics outside the doors of their councils in Derry, Strabane and Donegal.  They look at themselves as an integrated region.  They look at what can be expanded and how they can get investment into the region.  Those are the kind of questions that they ask themselves and they create strategies around that.  I want to support that type of initiative.  We have made it very clear that we are there to support those kinds of initiatives.  The shared island fund gives us some type of financial capacity to support those initiatives over and above the rhetoric.  People have said for years that they would do this and that, but now we have put flesh on the bone to try to give real support to a number of cross-Border initiatives.</p><p>That would benefit citizens on the island of Ireland and help people to have a better quality of life.  I think we can do an awful lot on the active transport piece, on the industrial side, in respect of broader economic co-operation and, above all, education and research.</p></speech>

Is it intended to continue a vigorous campaign at home and abroad to ensure that new markets, both import and export, are a continuous objective and that everybody is seen to be on the one track, working towards that?</p></speech>

The Secretary General and his team in my Department deserve commendation for the work they did in regard to Brexit over a period of time, as do the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and others.  Our objectives were achieved.  We do not like Brexit and we think Brexit was not a good idea.  What we need now is to do a deeper analysis of how Brexit is working out in practice, both in terms of Britain and the British economy, and how that will impact us.  The early signs are of significant reductions in trade levels and the question is will that be sustained.  We see a dramatic increase in direct routes to the Continent.  We do get early signs of a change and we need to be very hands-on in terms of analysing and keeping on top of that because it will affect our SMEs and will affect our economic relationship with Britain.</p> <p>  There is still a lot of work to be done.  We have managed to land it in a zone which is the best possible scenario in terms of our objectives, given the fact there is trade co-operation agreement and a no-deal has been avoided.  I would prefer even greater alignment in some areas between the UK and the EU but a better relationship is developing and that is working.  Recent meetings between David Frost and Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi have been positive so far but there is a lot of work there too in terms of the EU-UK relationship.  From Ireland's perspective, a strong, constructive, positive relationship between the EU and the UK is something we eagerly desire because it would benefit us as well.</p></speech>

This has nothing to do with the individual concerned; it has to do with the issue of transparency.  In October 2019, the Government was specifically asked by the Public Service Pay Commission to consider re-establishing a special review body similar to that which had reported in 2007.  The Department at that time was arguing that the then pay rates were determined on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis, similar to what happened on this occasion.  If we bear in mind how that &euro;82,000 was reached and the decision that was made on it, and I do not know the background to it, there were other employees within the HSE who were refused increases and increases were withheld from them.  It would appear report No. 42 was overlooked and that it did not deal with the matter, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 was not considered and, as a result, there are still a significant number of retired staff and others who are continuing to work in the HSE who are battling for pay increases that they were due.  The Taoiseach might compare this to the process the Army and the Defence Forces are going through to have their pay and conditions examined.</p><p>The Taoiseach can understand why there would be anger and upset over the decision that was so easily reached about the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  In Mr. Fraser's reply, he was explaining how these appointments and transfers were made.  He said it is usually dealt with by the use of an oral procedure to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the appointments process, and that it was usually dealt with at the end, as a last item on the agenda of Government business.  This is what the members and I are asking about: the transparency of the process, where the &euro;82,000 figure came from and the issues that are relevant to that increase, to do with other workers within the HSE, who did not get their increases when it was reported that they should, and who continue to fight for them.</p><p>I put it to the Taoiseach that giving someone a huge increase in their salary does not necessarily mean that projects like the children's hospital are going to come in within budget or, indeed, that all of the other ills of the Departments and the overspends that are recorded by the Comptroller and Auditor General are going to end.  I have not seen a massive improvement in the context of the clients of the HSE who are looking for their services to improve.  I have seen huge commitment from the front line but I have seen the waiting lists grow and grow.  It is similar with regard to the reforms that were necessary in the Garda.  We have not seen much of those either, despite the fact we gave the increases.  Giving someone an increase does not always necessarily mean they are going to transform and reform, as the Taoiseach suggested.</p><p>It is important we know the process by which the initial temporary appointment was made and the process by which the salary increase of &euro;82,000 was reached.  In addition, what it was benchmarked against is very important for us to consider.  I would again ask the Taoiseach to review the correspondence we have received and to come back to us then with his views on matters, to see if they have changed in any way.</p><p>I want to turn to the Estimates, in particular the Estimates in regard to the tribunals.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n went through some of these figures already.  They have cost the State considerable amounts of money.  I wonder if it is the intention of the Government to review all of these costs and the outcomes to date, with a view to amending legislation or dealing with this ongoing cost, which is like a runaway train that cannot be stopped.  What is the Taoiseach's view on that?</p></speech>

That does not depend on one position and I take the Chairman's point on that.  I understand where people are coming from and people are entitled to have different perspectives on this.  There has been a restoration of FEMPI, not fully or completely in all circumstances but in a substantial number of circumstances, and that will continue.  Work is under way in terms of the Army and Defence Forces.  Part of the programme for Government is to work on that and to set up a commission in respect of the future of the Defence Forces, and we have taken some early steps in regard to some aspects of the Defence Forces.  We are going to move on those things.</p> <p>  Obviously, the initiation and development of the children's hospital was before the current Secretary General arrived but, nonetheless, it is illustrative of the scale of projects that can come under the remit of the Department of Health, and that needs to be borne in mind as well.  I think there are about 90 non-commercial State bodies under the aegis of the Department of Health and, overall, we are talking about 125,000 people employed in health services more generally and &euro;22 billion allocated.</p><p>There have been huge increases this year in terms of services.  The &euro;600 million for the winter initiative alone was unprecedented and very effective during the winter period.  There have been 5 million additional hours for home care packages, a dramatic increase in home care provision this year and one that will have to continue, in terms of the demographic and other needs and improving our home care packages more generally, both in quality and-----</p></speech>

Neither do I want the impression to go out that there has been no increase in services at all in health this year.  The opposite is the case.  There has been an unprecedented increase in health service budgets this year across the board, in terms of acute services, home care packages, diagnostics and primary care.  The key now is to embed that into the future of our health service so that we use the lessons of the pandemic to have a stronger health service into the future.  That will require leadership at all levels.</p> <p>  In terms of cost, there is no question that in Ireland the original idea of setting up commissions of investigation was that they would reduce costs compared to the tribunal of inquiry model which had proved to be very expensive.  Commissions of investigation are proving to be lengthy and expensive as well.  People have legal representation, are entitled to protect their good names and so forth.  Hence, some investigations can take far too long.  I do not disagree with that.  We will review the situation, but the Oireachtas needs to review it as well.  </p> <p>  As an Oireachtas, we decide whether these investigations are necessary.  We have had some investigations that have been completed quickly, but that has not always been the case.  This area needs review and we will do that.  I have no doubt the Oireachtas will deal with this through the various committees or at party level.  All of us should reflect on the facts the Chair outlined, a view with which I do not necessarily disagree.</p></speech>

I am mindful of time.  I refer to the salary increase for the Secretary General position in the Department of Health.  Is the Taoiseach concerned it will lead to a cascade of claims at the top levels of the Civil Service, not just at Secretary General level, because once one person gets an increase surely the rest will look for it down the line?  Will it also impact on other senior officers, such as principal officers and other senior grades?</p></speech>

This meeting has been convened to consider the 2021 Revised Estimates, Vote 38 - Department of Health.  While the committee has no role in actually approving the Estimate, there is an opportunity for it to make scrutiny of the Department's budgetary performance more transparent.  The briefing prepared by the secretariat illustrates the difference between the 2020 and the 2021 financial allocations subhead by subhead within each programme.  In addition, briefing has been provided by the Department of Health, which goes into more detail and offers further analysis and focus on those subheads.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and his officials who are presenting remotely within the precincts of Leinster House.  We are meeting this afternoon to consider the 2021 Revised Estimates.  I thank the Minister for providing a briefing note related to the Estimates.  I propose the Minister makes his opening remarks after which I will invite members to contribute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1028" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#A00400"><p>I welcome this opportunity to address the Chairman and members of the select committee on the Revised Estimates for 2021 for my Department, which is Vote 38.  Unlike other Votes, the Health Vote is not configured along programme lines.  My Department continues to work towards the development of programme budgeting and changing the structure of the Health Votes to reflect this.  It is going to take some time as financial systems in the HSE have to be adapted to allow for this in the context of a financial reform programme that is under way.  In line with Government policy, and in the context of Covid-19, budget 2021 provided an unprecedented level of investment.  The investment supports the resilience and preparedness of the health service to increase capacity and permanent staffing levels, to progress the implementation of a number of national strategies, and to advance the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of universal healthcare.</p> <p>  I am delighted to have secured a further &euro;4.039 billion in funding on top of the 2020 allocation.  The level of funding provided will enable the advancement of a number of important priorities this year, including the protection of vulnerable groups, service users, patients, health care workers, and the wider public in the face of Covid-19, in line with national and international public health guidance; the delivery of increased levels of healthcare to our people in community and primary care settings, encompassing the mainstreaming of the Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund initiatives; the delivery of the ambitious capacity enhancement and reform plan in line with the health service capacity review of 2018; improving access to mental health services, including progressing the implementation of the Sharing the Vision policy; improving access and enhancing specialist disability services with a focus on implementation of the Transforming Lives programme; continuing projects, including the development and adoption of an integrated financial management system by all statutory and larger executive-funded voluntary services, alongside further development of activity-based funding for hospitals and community services, together with enhancing procurement governance and systems.</p> <p>  The provision for the Health Vote in the 2021 Revised Estimates allows for a significant expansion of the health sector workforce, with an increase of 16,000 whole-time equivalents over the original January 2020 estimate of public service numbers.  The allocated pay budget has increased from &euro;7.95 billion to &euro;9.055 billion in 2021.  The impact of the latest Covid-19 surge in the first quarter of this year has had an obvious impact on service delivery.  Some areas, such as additional home support hours, are behind where we would have hoped they would have been at this point, but the HSE is working to bring these back on track.  Demand for the nursing home support scheme is also down on estimates, but this has not impacted on waiting times for applicants.  It is expected that, all things remaining as they are, certain pent-up demand will see expenditure reach estimated levels by the end of the year.</p> <p>  The Health Act 1947 was amended to provide for a system of mandatory quarantine at designated facilities.  This system of mandatory hotel quarantine is necessary to prevent and mitigate the risk of Covid-19, particularly variants of concern.</p><p>The Government has established a proportionate and carefully balanced system for mandatory quarantine, which is necessary to address the risk posed by travel from states where there is known to be sustained human transmission of Covid-19 and, in particular, variants of concern, or from which there is a high risk of importation of infection or contamination with Covid-19 and, in particular, variants of concern.  This is necessary to protect the public, our health system and our vaccination programme. </p><p> The cost of mandatory quarantine was originally estimated at &euro;7 million with costs to be recouped from the people placed in quarantine.  However, as further capacity and hotels are added this estimate will inevitably increase.  Funding to meet these costs is being provided from within the departmental allocation and will not impact on the allocation to the HSE.</p><p> The programme for Government reaffirmed its support for universal healthcare via Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare is being funded and is on track to improve access, expand eligibility, improve the patient experience and bring care closer to home.  In 2021, there is continued commitment to Sl&aacute;intecare with &euro;1.353 billion being provided to fund programme reforms, including increased acute and community bed capacity, providing enhanced community, social and primary care services and improving access to care including a new access to care fund. </p><p> The move to a public-only health system is a key priority for the Government and central to the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of universal healthcare.  The programme for Government provides for the introduction of the Sl&aacute;intecare contract.  Arrangements are currently being finalised to facilitate the introduction of the contract in the coming months, following the enactment of the Public Service Pay Bill 2020, currently referred for Committee Stage.  My officials will write to the representative bodies shortly inviting them to discussions on the contract.</p><p> There has been significant growth in consultant numbers recently, with numbers increasing by more than 200 in the past year to 3,470 but I recognise that further progress is required.  I want doctors to stay in the Irish health system and for those who have emigrated to return home.  As part of budget 2021 nearly 600 additional consultant posts are being created.  The introduction of the Sl&aacute;intecare contract will give us an opportunity to grow consultant numbers and move towards universal healthcare in a public-only system.  The introduction of the contract also represents a significant opportunity to address the current number of temporary and unfilled consultant post and I have requested the HSE to develop a plan to achieve this.</p><p> Following intensive engagement, my Department, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, have reached an agreement to the introduction of a fundamentally reformed and strengthened model for public health in Ireland in line with international best practice.  This will require the implementation of a consultant-led and consultant-delivered public health model.  Implementation of this model will enable recruitment and retention of public health consultants.  It will deliver an agile, dynamic, intelligence-led public health medicine service to protect the population from health threats, promote health, improve health services and tackle inequalities in health. </p><p> Women&rsquo;s health is a priority for the Government.  Commitments made in the programme for Government include specific support for the women&rsquo;s health task force and the development of a women&rsquo;s health action plan.  Budget 2021 allocated a dedicated multi-annual &euro;5 million women&rsquo;s health fund to implement a programme of actions from the work of the women&rsquo;s health task force and appropriate activity is being identified for implementation and funding.  The first two funded proposals, which were announced last week, are &euro;1.4 million for two community-based ambulatory gynaecology services governed by Tallaght University Hospital and University Maternity Hospital Limerick and &euro;.6 million for the expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital, which creates specialist service for very complex cases.  These proposals will significantly increase access to these services for women and support their care at the earliest point. </p><p> Some &euro;20 million is being provided to progress the implementation of the national cancer strategy, including surgical and medical oncology; rapid access clinics and early diagnosis and radiotherapy.  The national cancer control programme is allocating initial "once-off" funding to each hospital group to assist with the costs associated with their efforts in service recovery and continuity.  This funding will support measures to increase resilience and address clinic backlogs.</p><p> I now turn to the 2020 outturn.  The gross provision for the Health Vote in 2020 was &euro;20.875 billion, comprising &euro;19.801 billion in current expenditure and &euro;1.074 billion in capital expenditure.  This &euro;20.875 billion represents the gross funding position for both the Department of Health and the HSE and includes additional funding of &euro;1.777 billion made available for current expenditure in 2020 in response to Covid-19 and &euro;547.5 million granted by means of a Supplementary Estimate.</p><p> The initial 2020 capital allocation was &euro;854 million.  In response to Covid-19, an additional allocation of &euro;220 million was made bringing the total capital allocation that year to &euro;1.074 billion.  The total cost of Covid-19 supports provided by Government to the Health service in 2020 was &euro;2.5 billion.  Among the key measures covered by this expenditure was testing and tracing; supporting nursing homes and home support; enhanced GP services; community assessment hubs; caring for people in acute services; private hospital capacity; expanding and protecting our health workforce and essential workers; expanding physical infrastructure including isolation facilities; and maintaining access to essential health products, equipment and services.  These measures continue to be relevant in 2021 as the pandemic continues </p><p> In framing the 2021 budget, the Oireachtas allocated significant further additional Exchequer funding for the health sector.  I thank committee members for their support in this.  In 2021, gross health funding is &euro;22.13 billion comprising &euro;21.081 billion in current expenditure and &euro;1.048 billion in capital expenditure.  This represents an increase of &euro;1.28 billion, 6.5%, on the 2020 post-supplementary current expenditure budget and recognises the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing a health service that seeks to improve the health and well-being of the people of Ireland.</p><p> While the 2021 capital allocation is &euro;26 million below that of the final 2020 figure, it represents a significant increase on pre-Covid-19 allocations and reflects continuing investment to meet the infrastructural challenges in responding to the pandemic.  The capital funding for health in 2021 will contribute to the delivery of modern health facilities and equipment to improve and expand service provision and capacity across the country, both key aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare and Project Ireland 2040.  While the scale of this funding is significant, the value of the investment in protecting our people in the face of the Covid-19 is unquantifiable.  This Government is steadfast in our commitment to protect everyone and to enhancing the resilience of our health service.  This commitment is evident in the level of funding made available in 2021.</p><p> The issue of health funding is a major policy challenge internationally, as committee members will be very well aware.  Despite welcome funding increases over recent years, the need for effective financial management remains crucial.  The health service is dealing with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the increasing costs of health technology.  The costs associated with these service pressures will increasingly need to be managed, not solely through annual increased Exchequer allocations, but also through improved efficiencies, productivity and value from within the funding base in 2021 and beyond. </p><p> Demographic pressures, including a rise in chronic diseases and ageing populations, are major challenges to health funding internationally.  The additional funding secured over recent years provides a substantial basis for the health service to maximise the level and quality of service delivery while also implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.</p><p> A significant increase in funding for the health services has been achieved this year.  Much of the recent increases have been Covid-19 related.  The health system responded quickly and efficiently to the Covid-19 emergency.  Additional spending has facilitated the necessary and rapid introduction of testing, provision of essential personal protective equipment; enhanced support to critical health services; and the introduction of additional hospital capacity and community services.  Oversight structures are in place to ensure this significant investment is approved, monitored and reported in line with agreed sanctioning processes and financial procedures.</p><p> The programme for Government places a major focus on health service reform and investment in our public health system.  Building upon and learning from the Covid-19 response will be central to the Government&rsquo;s approach.  In addition to Covid-19, dealing with a growing and ageing population, more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the increasing costs of health technology, will all continue to pose a financial challenge into the future.</p><p>Improving the way services are organised and delivered and reducing costs in order to maximise the ability of the health service to respond to growing needs must remain important points of focus.  It is essential that those managing and delivering the service continue to demonstrate good practice in the year ahead by delivering the best possible healthcare within the limits of resources that have been made available by the Government.  I thank my colleagues and the Chairman.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1031" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister for the presentation.  May I touch on one or two issues?  First, additional funding was provided to the private nursing homes to deal with the pandemic.  I did not see any figure for public nursing homes and community hospitals.  I believe there are 119 of them.  Could we have a breakdown of the additional funding that had to be made available, particularly to increase the level of care so the facilities could deal with the new demands and challenges posed by Covid.</p> <p>  Second, I want to touch on the expansion of home care.  The pandemic has created new demands.  As the Minister said, the number of people over 65 is going to continue to grow over the next ten years.  The number is about 720,000 now and it will be 1 million by 2030.  On the rolling out of additional home care supports and the regulation of the home care providers, what progress will be made during 2021?</p> <p>  The final point I want to touch on concerns Sl&aacute;intecare, to which the Minister referred quite a bit.  The Sl&aacute;intecare team produced a report on the three elective hospitals for Cork, Galway and Dublin.  It is a totally watered-down proposal.  I am getting no response from anyone regarding where we are going on this.  We put considerable money into new healthcare facilities in Dublin.  The population of Cork has grown by 130,000 over recent years and it is a question of new hospital beds, yet a Sl&aacute;intecare report is suggesting that Cork should have only a day facility, which could not cater for anyone with diabetes or other underlying conditions.  Where are we going with this Sl&aacute;intecare report?  Where is there provision in the budget for 2021 to deal with these issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1032" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#C00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for those questions.  Regarding the public nursing home supports, I will ask that a note be provided to the Deputy.  Obviously, a substantial amount of support was provided to the nursing homes across the country, and this was supported by Nursing Homes Ireland.  I will get a detailed note not just on the money but also on the additional capacity provided through the community healthcare organisations.</p> <p>  On the expansion of home care, we have a very ambitious target for this year, that is, to add an additional 5 million hours.  Some &euro;150 million for additional expenditure was allocated.  Of this, &euro;140 million was for the provision of the hours and &euro;10 million was for the provision of what is called the interRAI system.  We are fundamentally changing how home care is provided in the country.  The interRAI system will essentially allow for the individual assessment of patient needs and their care requirements.  There are many advantages to it, including around transparency, but I am very keen on the fact that it helps in terms of health equality.  It will allow us to ascertain what parts of the country have the level of service provision they need and the parts that need additional support.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned regulation.  I actually brought a memorandum to the Government today and we got agreement on the drafting of the heads of a Bill on the regulation of home care.  It is a really important move.  There is a major focus on it.  The Deputy is very aware of this, not least because he and Deputy Higgins tabled a Bill on it.  There was much progress today.  We will be drafting a very comprehensive Bill on the regulation of home care services and also expanding it, essentially bringing into line the regulation of nursing homes and the regulation of home care because there needs to be more of a continuum.  My view, which is shared by many members of the committee, is that we need to maximise home care over nursing home care, not that there is not a role for nursing home care.  Of course there is, but it is a question of keeping people at home as much as possible.  A really important step was taken today.</p> <p>  The Deputy continues to advocate very strongly regarding the elective facilities, including the elective hospital in Cork.  Some of the thinking of the Sl&aacute;intecare team is that the elective hospitals could be day care only.  The thinking is that if the quality and speed of care are maximised for less complex procedures, it frees up inpatient beds and acute beds for complex care.  However, I am aware that there are strong views on this in Galway and Cork.  The Deputy and other Deputies have expressed them, and some in the clinical community have done so in regard to wanting a mixture of inpatient and day care beds in any new elective hospital.  No decisions have been made on that.  The thinking is still being worked on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1033" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#C00400"><p>Regarding the elective hospital, how long is this issue going to be kicked around the place?  Consider the case of South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, Cork, for example.  The building has been in place for 150 to 200 years.  It cannot be modernised unless major work is done.  We either go down that road or build a new hospital on a greenfield site.  The elective hospital proposed by Sl&aacute;intecare is a day facility.  A facility operating for six days per week for 50 weeks of the year will not be able to deal with a large number of patients because many patients coming in for minor enough procedures will also have underlying conditions.  For how long will this debate go on?  We are now into year four of talking about elective hospitals but with no clear plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1034" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#C00500"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I share his frustration.  There has been much talk about these elective hospitals for a long time.  I would much prefer if we were farther along.  What I can tell the Deputy is that the Sl&aacute;intecare team is working hard on it.  It is examining the various sites and models of care.  As I know the Deputy will understand, much of this work, because of the pandemic, has not moved at the pace we would all like.  The Deputy's points are well made and I will feed them back, as I have done previously.  I will feed them back again to the team looking at both the sites and the model-of-care options for the elective hospitals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1035" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#C00600"><p>May I just touch on the National Treatment Purchase Fund?  In talking about that, I am also talking about the treatment abroad fund, which is different.  People are now being encouraged to travel abroad for some medical treatment although there are facilities in the South to deal with some of the treatments being provided abroad.  What are we doing to deal with this issue, so we can keep the work here and make sure it is done in a timely manner rather than requiring people to travel long distances?  Is adequate funding provided for the National Treatment Purchase Fund?  The problem is that our hospitals will all be under increased pressure due to the backlog of work not done in 2020.</p><p>How can the Minister make sure there is catch-up, particularly where there are facilities where this work can be done?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1037" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#D00200"><p>As much work as possible should be done within the public health system.  We should not have the waiting lists that currently exist.  The question is what do we do about the far too many men, women and children who are still waiting while we build the permanent capacity of the public system to be able to meet demand,.  The answer is that it is a combination of things.</p> <p>  As the Deputy stated, the treatment abroad scheme is used.  If we had the level of capacity we ought to have here, the scheme really should not be needed.  I will give an example.  Funding is being provided for an ophthalmology unit in County Cork, which will be able to deal with many people with cataracts who are currently travelling to private hospitals in Northern Ireland for cataract operations.  To me, success is people no longer needing to travel but, rather, being treated in the unit in County Cork or another HSE hospital.</p> <p>  In the short term, to make progress on waiting lists we need to use a combination of things.  We need to use the treatment abroad scheme.  We need to provide additional funding to the HSE, both in terms of permanent capacity, such as the ophthalmology unit, but also in terms of additional short-term capacity, such as running operating theatres out of normal hours, payment by procedure within HSE hospitals and using the private system to treat as many people as possible as quickly as possible. The total funding being allocated this year is substantial.  We have an access to care fund of &euro;210 million.  There is an additional amount of &euro;30 million to the NTPF, bringing the total amount for the fund up to &euro;130 million.  There is &euro;33 million for alternative care pathways, which is part of the Sl&aacute;intecare work but essentially will help to tackle waiting lists.  There is the acute hospital service restart fund of &euro;35 million and cancer screening of &euro;10 million.  In total, that comes to approximately &euro;418 million.  It is the intention to bring the waiting lists down as quickly as we can and using every available mechanism.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1038" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#D00300"><p>One of the problems relating to the NTPF is that people are being sent out for assessment and the assessment comes back and then they have to be referred again.  Has reform been made in that regard, that is, the situation whereby people who are referred, are referred not only for the assessment, but also for whatever procedure is required?  One of the complaints I am getting in respect of the fund is that the system is too complicated and needs to be reformed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1039" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#D00400"><p>The Deputy is correct.  There is a bit of a catch-22, which is that if one has to wait too long for a procedure, one can use the NTPF, but to do so, one has to get an assessment for which one has to wait too long.  It is a catch-22 and too many people are left outside the system.  They cannot access the service they need through the HSE and they cannot access it through the NTPF because they cannot access the assessment through the HSE.  We are taking a fresh look at it this year.  We are looking at the &euro;130 million in the NTPF and the additional &euro;210 million for the access to care fund, as well as those other pots of money, and asking how we can do this better.  For example, one of the things we are doing is expanding access to diagnostics, which was not available previously.  The Deputy is entirely correct.  The current situation can be improved and it is our intention to do that.</p></speech>

Have particular areas been prioritised in that regard?  There are several areas in which there is a shortage of consultants.  Have those areas been prioritised?  What particular areas have the Department and the HSE decided to focus on?</p> <p>  I refer to amending legislation relating to people who were not regarded as being on the specialist register that was put in place.  However, the regulation has not been put in place by the Department.  When is that likely to happen?</p></speech>

The first is that the HSE is hiring on an operational and clinical basis to the high-priority areas.  Second, there is a relatively new team within the Department of Health, namely, the workforce planning unit, which is seeking to determine where the gaps are.  Believe it or not, there is not yet a model that tells us how many of each specialty we need.  As we know what we have, such a model would identify the gap.  There is significant work ongoing in the Department, again under the auspices of Sl&aacute;intecare, on the area-based healthcare analysis to determine what we need in each specialty in each area, what we have and what is the gap or the number we will hire.</p> <p>  I ask the Deputy to remind me of his final question.</p></speech>

Amending legislation was put in place to allow them to join the specialist register but the regulation to allow that to happen has not been put in place.  These are consultants who were appointed but are not regarded as being on the specialist register.</p></speech>

With regard to the headline figure, that is, the total gross provision figure of &euro;22.13 billion, how much of that does he anticipate will form the baseline for next year as we look towards budget 2022?  Obviously, a portion of it is Covid-related and allocated to dealing with issues such as testing, contact tracing, personal protective equipment, quarantine and all of those measures.  I assume some of this will be with us for some time to come; it will not disappear any time soon.  However, there may come a need to scale back these measures.  In terms of the overall expenditure, is it the Minister's intention to keep that figure of &euro;22 billion as the baseline figure going forward into budget 2022?</p></speech>

It is a really good question.  As the Deputy will be aware, the &euro;4.039 billion breaks down into &euro;2.121 billion for Covid measures, &euro;1.163 billion for new non-Covid measures and &euro;755 million for the existing level of service, ELS.  I anticipate the ELS funding will stay at that level by virtue of what it is and the &euro;1.1633 billion for the additional new measures will stay at that level.  Obviously, that has to be agreed by Government but that is what I will seek and what would be normal practice.  The next question is how much of the &euro;2.121 billion relating to Covid stays.  I do not think we know that at this stage.  As the Deputy and I were discussing only yesterday, there will be an ongoing need for testing and tracing and genome sequencing.   There may be an ongoing need for quarantine facilities.  What the experts are telling us is that, globally, Covid will be here for some time, no matter how well we do in Ireland.</p></speech>

There is a commitment this year to slightly more than &euro;22 billion.  Some of that money could be re-profiled and spent in other areas of healthcare, as all present know is necessary.  Is the Minister saying that decision has not yet been made and that it is possible that the figure of &euro;22 billion may not be what will be in budget 2022?</p><p>That is a decision that will be made later.  No policy decision has been made at this time to baseline that figure.  Is that what the Minister is saying?</p></speech>

Two things could happen.  I will be pushing for additional funding for new measures.  At the same time, I hope the funding allocated for Covid significantly reduces.  Where the two of those land in net terms, we will know later this year.</p></speech>

On page 15, under acute services, it talks about a &euro;236 million additional spend on acute beds and says there will be an additional 1,146 beds by the end of 2021 as compared to 2020.  What is the anticipated number of funded beds?</p></speech>

I am reading from the briefing document we got.  If we have different documents and different numbers, it is concerning.  It states that, "The funding provided in 2021 will ensure that the [total] number of funded acute beds in the system will increase by 1,146 by [the] end of 2021 when compared to 2020."  I have pointed out before and point out again that that is not correct.  It is based on 2019 figures.  In 2019, the number of beds we had was just over 10,700.  That was the baseline figure.  Can that be clarified?</p></speech>

Here are the latest exact figures.  The Deputy is absolutely right that total figure we have is as of 1 January last year, so it is essentially two years worth.</p></speech>

We had a discussion on this in the past.  It is right when it comes to ICU beds but wrong when it comes to acute beds.  It gives the impression that there are 1,146 beds for one year, when in fact it is two years.  That is what I want to clarify.</p></speech>

The Department has presented it like this because last year was a very unusual year in that a large amount of Covid funding was used to set up temporary beds.  The beds came into existence last year.  Those beds were one-off beds.  This year, through the budget, we have permanently funded those beds.  Some 611 of the beds were brought into existence physically last year but only funded to the end of the year.  Through the winter plan and this budget, we have turned them into permanent beds for this year.  The total permanent beds we are getting through this budget, which I guess is the question for us all, is-----</p></speech>

That was meant to be in place since last June.  All new contracts were meant to be Sl&aacute;intecare public-only contracts.  Is that happening and what is the take-up?  What engagement has the Minister had with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, on this issue?  Are the IMO and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, buying into these Sl&aacute;intecare public-only consultant contracts?</p></speech>

I do not want to pre-empt what the IMO will say.  The IHCA will have a view as well, and it has a view on various other issues which we have all discussed.</p></speech>

They will give their own view.  I can say we are moving towards the Sl&aacute;intecare contract.  Once the contract is in place, the only contracts that will be given out for new entrants to the HSE are the Sl&aacute;intecare contracts.  Critically, and I think we are all agreed this is a core component of universal healthcare, the new contracts will only allow for public work in public hospitals.</p></speech>

On a related issue, when I talk to hospital consultants, the two-tier nature of the pay is an issue and they want the contracts to reflect that reality.  As, if not more important, is the support they get when in their jobs, including access to equipment such as diagnostic equipment and to theatre space.  While we might have ambitious plans to increase the number of consultants, we also need to increase theatre space because that is part of the problem.  We also have to increase access to equipment.  They tell me part of their daily struggle in their work life involves battling the system to get access to theatre space and equipment.  I argue that, while we are funding additional consultant posts, in tandem with that we should look at expanding theatre space and equipment so we get bang for buck and have an opportunity to put them to full use and reduce wait times.</p></speech>

The whole approach is that we create the new Sl&aacute;intecare contract but, on the Deputy's point, that is not enough.  I would like to see things around the Sl&aacute;intecare contract like funding for research and clinical trials and some of the things the consultants do not have access to at the moment.  That will be part of the talks.  At the same time as putting the Sl&aacute;intecare contract in place, and hopefully hiring 600 new consultants this year, we are expanding acute beds, critical care beds, community beds, step-down beds and rehab beds.  We are expanding the safe staffing model for nursing and the whole point is to take the pressure off the system so that our clinicians can do the job they want to do, have access to their patients to assess them when they need to, diagnose them when they need to and either treat them with the drugs they need access to or in operating theatres.</p></speech>

I put in a parliamentary question on the CervicalCheck tribunal and I have got the costs back.  Before I go into the costs, the most recent response I got back was that there were three cases that have been referred to the tribunal, which seems quite low.  Is that the most recent figure?  Is it accurate?  If so, does it concern the Minister that the number is so low and the take-up is so low?</p></speech>

My understanding is there have been more referrals than the three.  Much interest has been expressed and questions have been asked by the various legal teams representing the women and families involved.  My view is it is a far better option than the High Court.  However, we have to respect the rights and decisions of the women to use the tribunal, the High Court or both.  At any time during the tribunal, the women can elect to leave it and go to the High Court instead.</p></speech>

Sorry, I should have said that.  It refers to an art allowance, construction fit-out costs and consultant fees and it breaks down some of the additional spend, including &euro;140,000 on furniture and fittings.

On the fixtures and fittings and the buildings costs, there was a significant amount of work done to make the tribunal Covid-friendly.  We wanted to make sure any women coming in, some of whom could be immunocompromised, had the appropriate facilities.  For example, the women and families involved can now do all the proceedings from their own rooms.  They do not have to go into the same rooms as the lab or the State.  Work was done by the Office of Public Works, OPW, to create a suitable environment in Covid-19, which many courts also have.</p></speech>

I discussed this in private with the Minister recently and it is useful to have the opportunity to discuss this publicly.  There are concerns about the company which essentially owns the land.  My understanding is it is pre the Sisters of Charity.  Issues have been legitimately been raised regarding the ownership of the hospital and what impact it will have on the running of the hospital.  Will the Minister address that point?  Has the Department at any time considered purchasing the land by way of a compulsory purchase order?  Was it possible to do that?  I assume that would be one way to solve this issue and to make sure both the building and land is fully in public ownership and fully managed by the HSE and the State.</p></speech>

That is an absolute red line.  It cannot happen.  I have looked into this in some detail and have assurances the structure being put in place absolutely does not allow that to happen.  However, I am also aware some very well respected people have a different view.  I understand Deputy Shortall organised a meeting recently on that.  I would be very happy to ask the unit and the lawyers to look at all that evidence.  I think we are all on the same page on this.  This needs to be a public hospital that delivers the public services the Government of Ireland and the HSE deem to be the right services.</p></speech>

An all-party delegation will be seeking to meet the Minister.  These are important issues that need to be answered.</p> <p>  I have a final question.  I do not think the Minister will not have the information to hand but I am seeking a detailed note on this.  As we are examining expenditure, the Estimates and public spending in health, will the Minister ask his officials to provide me with a briefing note on the total private spend on healthcare in our total public healthcare system?  For example, I am referring to the total spend on outsourcing to the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the total spend on consultancy fees.  In the Minister's briefing note he referred to community beds being purchased privately.  There is the issue of locum and agency staff and it is too much to go into in this session.  For the purposes of future sessions and engagements, will the Minister arrange for that breakdown to be given to us?  I might send the secretariat a note of exactly what I am looking for.  I assume the Minister has a sense of it.  He might provide that as soon as possible.  I thank him for his answers.</p></speech>

In a year of negatives, as Covid has been a major negative in everyone&rsquo;s life, it is good we are coming to a point where it has become more manageable.  There are two trajectories almost at intersection point now, namely, the vaccines versus a declining or at least a levelling of the Covid rate.  There is a much to hope for and it is hoped Thursday will allow for a safeish reopening of the country or at least the next step in that process.  It is also welcome that the Government has awarded an additional &euro;4.03 billion to the Department&rsquo;s budget on top of its 2020 allocation.</p> <p>  I wish to come at this from an angle that has not been covered thus far in our deliberations.  Another potential budgetary constraint on Minister Department is the digital green certificate, which is being worked on at European level.  Although it deals with international air travel, my understanding is it will come under the remit of the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  A vote is to take place on it in European Parliament this week.  We know the technical specification of it was agreed and published yesterday by the European Commission. The meat is very much going on the bone.  We will be at the point shortly where this will be put to each member state to ratify and then to decide how they will implement it.  There are three pillars to it.  It will certify those across Europe who have been vaccinated, those who have been PCR-tested and who were negative at the time they presented themselves at the departure gate at an airport, and it will also carry data relating to those who have recovered from Covid.  The European Commission is intimating there will be a six-week lead-in or implementation period.</p> <p>  That concerns me a little with Ireland being geographically peripheral and a little more cut off from Europe, with our nearest neighbours having departed the European Union.  That lead-in period could throw us a little bit off kilter, with opportunities lost to other nations.  Have we as a country and the Minister's Department the allocated finances for this, given we are talking about his Department's budget for this year?  Are the finances in place and, more importantly, is there a team, a structure, and the necessary software in place?  Is everything ready to roll as soon as the digital green certificate is agreed by European Heads of State in order that we can implement it in Ireland?</p></speech>

As with many other countries, the technology is being developed in the background and there is a co-ordinating role from the Commission in terms of making sure it works interjurisdictionally.  in other words, if an Irish citizen lands in Paris, he or she could show a unique code on his or her phone, which the French authorities could recognise as that person having been fully vaccinated and, similarly, we could recognise that in respect of people arriving from other member states into one of our airports or ports.  That work is going on in the background.  Very significant work has been done on exactly this point in Ireland.  Certainly we are looking very favourably at participation in the digital green certificate.  It will be very welcome.  If it works as we want it to work and as the European member states want it to work, for those who are exempted, namely, for fully vaccinated people, it will enable free travel in a way that has not been possible since this virus arrived.</p></speech>

When it is agreed, will we be at that same pace as other nations in terms of its roll-out?  It is important a lead-in period is communicated, particularly to the travel and aviation industries.  Many of our pilots and cabin crew are out of hours, to use a parlance from their profession.  They need to return to training.  They need a lead-in period.  Will we be able to provide a lead-in period and to keep pace with other nations?  I understand Greece, Spain and other Mediterranean countries are eager to get this in place for their tourism markets.  Will we be able to keep pace with them and not be laggards in that regard?</p></speech>

That is welcome.  If I can continue in a European vein, and I spoke on this issue in the D&aacute;il Chamber recently, the Minister leads the Department of Health and he regularly meets his counterparts and colleagues across Europe.  Ultimately, while we have own structures in Ireland, there is the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  I presume as a member state of the European Union we contribute financially to that entity.  It has a budget of in or around &euro;50 million per year, which is paltry considering its American equivalent has an annual budget of $12 billion.  There is not much the Minister can do in that regard but I ask that at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers he would be an objecting voice or at least a voice of concern in the room.  This entity, which was set up following an outbreak of the first ever SARS disease 18 years ago, has proven itself to be largely inept and ineffective.  It is ultimately the source of information for each member state to have its trickle-down of policies in terms of managing this.  Does it interact with the Council of Ministers much?  Are they as a bloc concerned this entity has not been that steady backbone they would have needed it to be for the past 14 months?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1088" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#G00100"><p>There is certainly a clear understanding at a European health minister level that significant investment is required in the systems in place to deal with pandemics, including the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, the European Medicines Agency, EMA, and other groups.  We know that in Ireland, regardless of what happens at a European institution level, significant investment is required.  The public health system here was not fit for purpose in terms of dealing with a global pandemic.  We should have, and now will have, a consultant-led public health system.  We need a much expanded public health system, which we are now doubling, as the Deputy is aware.  We also need much better IT systems.  We need to move on some of the other things that not only are related to public health and the pandemic but also run through the Sl&aacute;intecare system, such as unique patient identifiers.  We are laggards on e-health and that has to change.  Significant investment and work are going into the system to that end.</p> <p>  When it comes to the ECDC, I can tell the Deputy that the public health teams certainly rate its advice very highly.  The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, regularly refers to and interacts with the ECDC on international comparative analysis around public health and Covid-19.  The core question the Deputy asked was whether the European institutions need to be further enhanced and I certainly would be supportive of that.</p></speech>

We as a nation are going to go so far in the coming weeks.  There is a bit of an unknown here but the details are starting to come from the European Commission.  We are going to have an e-health system that will probably be on our phones.  It might be like what we saw a few weeks ago on the "Prime Time" special.  We saw a little snippet of people going around Tel Aviv and Jerusalem in Israel with little digital certificates on their phones that acted as their passports for entry into cinemas, pubs and restaurants.  If we are going the whole hog of having a digital system in place to allow people to present themselves at an airport departure gate, would the Department consider operating that system, which will be up and running, in certain contexts around the country, for example, to allow people to go to matches, concerts, weddings and venues in which large numbers of people will congregate?  If we have the system in place, will we give it a dual purpose and use it on the domestic front as well as at the airport departure gate?  Israel and some other countries have done that.  If we are going the whole hog on software, smart and e-health infrastructure, it would be great if we could use the device in our pockets to gain entry to a place.  Has there been any talk within the Department of a deeper role for that technology in the months ahead?</p></speech>

The EU digital green certificate is built on the exact premise that there are things you can do because you pose less of a risk to other people.  It is less about protecting the individual and more about protecting other people from international travel.</p> <p>  There is a philosophical question to be discussed when it comes to applying similar measures in a domestic setting.  I would be interested to get the committee's view on that.  Is it right or proper to discriminate in terms of access to domestic services, whether that is, as the Deputy said, a concert or something else, based on whether somebody is vaccinated?  There are strongly held views on both sides of that argument.  I would be interested to get a view from the committee, if it were to discuss the matter.  The same question would have to be applied to the legality of creating different levels of access for people based on the situation the Deputy has described.</p></speech>

We drifted away from some of the issues.  The Minister is asking whether the committee will have a look at a particular area.  He might come back to the committee at some stage on a situation where someone who has had Covid is travelling.  One of the requirements at the moment, of course, is that you need a PCR test, but I am told that if you have had Covid within a certain period, the PCR test will come back with a positive result.  That is one of the difficulties.  I have recently been dealing with cases of people who were quarantined because they did not have a PCR test but had been told by Department officials that it was not needed.  That might be something at which the Minister could look and come to back to the committee on at some stage.</p></speech>

I will talk about the reform programme and where we are on elements of it.  Before I do, I will return to the issue raised by Deputy Cullinane about the new national maternity hospital.  As the Minister said, there was a very well-attended briefing yesterday on that issue.  It is true to say there is a lot of concern about the fact the new entity, St. Vincent's Holdings, that has been created to replace St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, is operating on the basis of the same ethical code as St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  The constitution has not been changed and there are concerns about the implications of that for women's healthcare and services that should be provided in a publicly owned hospital as well as the question of handing over or gifting a publicly funded hospital to a private entity.  A cross-party group has been formed.  There is an email on its way to the Minister to request an early meeting on the issue before any final decisions are taken.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to accede to that request for a meeting at an early date.  I hope he is agreeable to that.</p></speech>

I restate that this all boils down to a question of whether services that must be provided for women can be stopped because of a religious ethos.  We know that has influenced things in the past.  My unambiguous position on the matter is that will not be allowed to happen.  I have sought assurances that is the case, based on the new governance structure, and have absolutely clear assurance it is the case.  I know the Deputy has convened a meeting of smart and informed people who have a different view, and perhaps that is mentioned in the email she is sending.  I suggest the group of people the Deputy has convened send on their views, and I will ask for a response from the Department and the legal teams and send it back to the Deputy before we meet.  There can be no question of any services for women being stopped or watered down or anything else because of any ethos.  The Government and the HSE will decide and that can be the only way we proceed.</p></speech>

Other basic women's health services, such as sterilisation services, prescribing of contraception and so on, are not currently provided in that hospital.  It is a matter of concern and I look forward to engaging with everyone.</p></speech>

I will move to the question of expanding services and dealing with issues over recruitment and retention, which are pressing issues in all kinds of disciplines right across the health service.  Is there work going on at Department or HSE level to do essential forward planning to ensure our colleges have enough places to train the people who will be needed over the coming years?  We need to address the kinds of issues that lead to people leaving this country, rather than staying here and working in the Irish health service.  Where is there work being done on that?</p></speech>

A new team called the workforce planning unit was set up last year and those are exactly the issues at which it is looking.</p><p>As the Deputy knows, Laura Magahy leads the Sl&aacute;intecare team.  One of the things they are doing is the area-based analysis to see how many of each specialty we need in all of the areas, which will give us the gap and will allow us to hire in.  At the same time, the whole pipeline coming in is being looked at in regard to different nursing specialties, different medical specialties, different health and social care specialties, how many of these people we need, how many training places there are, how many we can retain here and so forth.</p></speech>

To pick up on the issue of the Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation on three elective hospitals, it is disappointing to hear there seems to be a watering down of that.  This was a key recommendation following on from the experience in Scotland and how it dealt with pressures on its acute hospital sector.  There is a very strong case for having elective hospitals but they have to go beyond day case, or while they could obviously do day cases, there is a need for inpatient cases as well.  For example, one of the key pressure areas is orthopaedics.  That is something that should be done as a matter of course, with people in and out in a matter of days, as some of the private clinics are doing very successfully.  What was done in Scotland was that a private hospital was bought to kick-start that whole new approach.  Has consideration been given to that?  I urge the Minister to ensure we are not just talking about day hospitals and that it is full inpatient hospitals.</p></speech>

What I can tell the Deputy is that it is the Sl&aacute;intecare team that is doing the elective hospital work and its thinking is around the day case.  It is not because we do not need more inpatient beds, and we all know we do.  It is really around providing the most effective healthcare possible.  Part of the thinking is, first, to separate it from emergency departments, so it is planned elective care only and it does not get disrupted by emergencies coming in, and so it is physically separated, for example, like Tallaght is doing with its unit.  Second, the thinking is that if we create it as day case, it is not that we are not creating additional inpatient beds because what we are doing is pulling the less complex care out of the bigger model 4 hospitals, and they can turn some of their day case into inpatient.  However, it is worth reiterating, as I did to Deputy Colm Burke, that no final decisions have been made on that.  I will certainly feed the views of Deputy Shortall and Deputy Burke into the team that are looking at this.  As I said, I know there are strongly held views, both in the community and in the clinical communities in Cork and Galway, that the elective hospital needs to be day case and inpatient.</p></speech>

Two key elements of Sl&aacute;intecare are improving access and removing cost as a barrier.  First, where do things stand in regard to the extension of free GP care for children and when can we expect children up to 12 years of age to have access to free GP care?  My second question is in regard to e-health.  The experience over the past year has shown the huge weaknesses in terms of the hugely underdeveloped e-health provision within the HSE.  Over what period would the Minister expect to implement the full existing e-health programme that was developed a few years ago?</p></speech>

There is a new budget of &euro;58 million and that is looking partly at what the Deputy has referenced, which is e-health innovation.  Obviously, telemedicine was a huge success as part of the Covid response and we are looking to put that on a permanent footing.  There are also some really exciting things happening.  There are pilots going on around the system for things like remote sensors for people at home, so we move the chronic disease management-----</p></speech>

While I appreciate that, an e-health programme was drawn up and the price tag was, I think, &euro;800 million to &euro;850 million, to be developed over a number of years.  The original plan was to implement it over 15 years but Sl&aacute;intecare recommended, given it is so critical to the efficient delivery of healthcare, that it should be implemented over a five-year period.  Where do we stand in regard to that plan?</p></speech>

What I can tell her is that in the Estimates we are looking at right now, there are two pieces.  There is the &euro;58 million for e-health innovation for the new things, and then there is money in capital for the backbone, for the infrastructure and for things like unique patient identifiers and making sure the GP systems talk to the local acute systems or, indeed, to all of the acute systems.  There is a total within the figures we are looking at of &euro;255 million.  I was very conscious of that figure the Deputy referenced, which was an enormous figure as part of Sl&aacute;intecare and was around creating a backbone.  The total we are looking at now is &euro;255 million in annual funding for health ICT just in this budget.  That is about building the backbone the Deputy is talking about.  The &euro;58 million is around innovation, chronic disease management in the community and so forth.</p></speech>

Last year was an <i>annus horribilis</i>in regard to the health budget and this year will probably be the same.  In regard to some of the positive news on the women's health task force, it is very welcome to see funding in regard to the expansion of the endometriosis service in Tallaght, which is positive.</p><p>To clarify the financial position, does the &euro;1.074 billion capital expenditure include expenditure spent on personal protective equipment, PPE, last year in regard to the pandemic?  In fact, the Minister might just explain what the capital expenditure was for.</p></speech>

The capital funding is right through the budget.  There are two big pieces: the Covid funding and the non-Covid funding.  The new Covid measures are &euro;2.121 billion and there is a capital allocation within that of &euro;155 million.  Then, obviously, there are the new measures of &euro;1.163 billion, and the capital funding in there is an additional &euro;13 million.  The capital funding is right through the programme.  If we take non-Covid care, for example, there is capital funding in the &euro;276 million which Deputy Cullinane and I were talking about.  There is &euro;236 million of current expenditure, which is the money to fund the teams, the staff, the nurses, the doctors and so forth, and then there is &euro;40 million of capital funding in there.  It is the same for critical care, sub-acute beds and community beds.</p><p>Deputy Shortall and I were talking about e-health.  There is current and capital funding but a good portion of the &euro;255  million is ICT infrastructure, which is capital funding.  I can get the Deputy a break down, line item by line item, on exactly which is capital and which is current funding in a programmatic way.  For legacy reasons, the way we are presented with the figures is not very helpful in breaking out the capital.  We get a capital line item, but what we really need to know, which is relevant to the Deputy's question, is how the capital line item is allocated according to the different programme areas, such as acute care, community care, e-health and so on.  I will get a detailed note for the Deputy on exactly how that capital funding works across the programme areas.</p></speech>

The pandemic has compounded many issues around mental health, especially eating disorders.  I understand the national clinical programme for eating disorders, set up in 2018, had a certain budget.  In previous years, the budget was underspent.  That would seem extraordinary really.  From what I can gather, there is currently an underspend at this time, especially with the roll-out of this particular programme.  Is that money ring-fenced for the programme, in particular around the hubs, as stipulated under the programme?  Perhaps the Minister will comment on underfunding in the area of eating disorders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#J00300"><p>I share the Deputy's concern.  I will also be talking with some of the mental health clinicians, teachers, school principals and parents.  They have seen a worrying spike in eating disorders among younger people during the pandemic, especially among younger women and girls.  It is really concerning.  With the numbers in front of us, we have a significant increase in mental health funding.  I will come to how eating disorders is dealt within that.</p> <p>  The total increase in mental health is &euro;83.2 million.  There is &euro;23 million in new measures and &euro;15 million in Covid-19 programmes.  Something that is below the radar, which some people would see as a technical adjustment but which is hugely important in getting the mental health services running, is the &euro;45.2 million also being allocated to existing level of service, pay rate funding and technical adjustments.  Essentially, the HSE has maintained a position for the past few years, of which the committee will be aware, where it said that it could not provide the new services because it was not getting a sufficient increase in its base funding for the existing services, which is covered under existing level of service, ELS.  This year we have put a huge amount of funding into ELS to cover the increases required for this year and the historical deficit.  This year we really need to see the health service providers stepping up to add all the new services.</p> <p>  There are a few things happening specifically around the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS.  New CAMHS staff have been funded.  We have an increase of 10% on last year in the CAMHS community mental health budget nationally, which is important.  This is for assessment and treatment.  There are three new CAMHS tele-hubs nationally, which goes back to the conversation on e-health.  There will be a new high-dependency unit in CAMHS in Galway, which will commence construction later this year, which is very welcome.  There is also additional bed capacity being put in place.</p> <p>  Specific to progressing the specialist mental health programmes, four that are getting particular attention are dual diagnosis.  There is a real problem with dual diagnosis whereby a mental health service states it cannot treat a person because he or she is in addiction, and addiction services state that they cannot treat the person because he or she has mental health issues.  We are cracking that nut.  Quite a lot of people who have fallen into the dual diagnosis are being failed.</p> <p>  I fully agree with the Deputy that early intervention in psychosis, eating disorders and mental health intellectual disability is a big focus.  It has become a real problem during the pandemic.  We are funding to scale up in staff, early assessment, treatment, beds and community healthcare provision.</p></speech>

I looked at the Estimates but did not find an allocated budget for the programme.  I understand the programme will commence some time in June.  Is there a budget for the programme?  It is a five-year pilot project but is there an annual budget?  Where are we at with regard to the programme commencing?</p></speech>

We have allocated funding for MCAP this year for the first time.  The Deputy has been a very strong advocate for this and he will be very aware that the programme has been in place for some time but there has never been any funding for it.  This year we are allocating several million euro from the new drugs budget.  We must wait to see what the uptake is.  Several million euro will be allocated, so it is now a funded programme.</p> <p>  I am aware, as is the Deputy, there are some drugs, such as Bedrocan, that are not included in the programme.  While much progress has been made, more is needed.  We are aware that some of the products, such as Bedrocan, fall outside MCAP.  Those who are using them, or their parents, are in an unenviable and unacceptable position whereby they are having to pay for the drugs upfront and then be reimbursed for them on a monthly basis.  It is a huge amount of money.  I have asked the Department to find a way to deal with this.  One of the issues we have with Bedrocan, unfortunately, is around exporting from Holland.  It is not that we do not want to do it; it is just that there are international constraints.  We are working through them.</p> <p>  I am very aware that the MCAP will be very useful for people.  We have put a multimillion euro funding package in place.  There are other outstanding issues, such as the one I just discussed, that are causing real difficulty for people.  This is a difficulty they should not have to experience.  I am working in the background with the Department to put solutions in place to that.</p></speech>

The national children's hospital has not been touched on today.  Do we know how much it will actually cost?  Earlier in the year some of the board members were before the committee to outline some of the difficulties they are experiencing.  We are aware that compensation claims are coming through the courts and that building was closed down for a period.  Do we have a ballpark figure or does the Minister know exactly how much it is going to cost?  It will be a big figure in relation to the Estimates.</p> <p>I do not raise this to frighten people but a conversation is needed around long Covid and people having difficulties with vaccine-associated illnesses.  I am currently dealing with two cases in my constituency with vaccine induced clotting, or VPIT.  This has required blood tests, treatment, in-stay beds, medication and an inability to work.  One person developed a clot on the brain.  There needs to be a conversation around this.  They have told me they have spent a significant amount of money and they are getting bills, having been released from hospital or while still in hospital care.  They are worried about being out of work and out of a job and about mortgages.  Two of these people are women in their 30s.  If a person gets a bill for &euro;1,000 from a hospital, it is a lot of money.</p><p>It is only right that there be some sort of support scheme to address costs incurred because of the side effects of vaccination.  When I recently asked a parliamentary question on the matter, the Department stated that a policy was being developed.  Has any amount been set aside in the health budget for vaccine-related costs incurred by people who have suffered side effects?  The State has indemnified many of the manufacturers and so on.</p><p> The Minister spoke about quarantining.  I am told that there is an avalanche of cases waiting in that regard.  Has funding been set aside for them?  Is he worried about the cases coming down the track?</p><p> I have been on my local drugs task force practically since it was established.  We seek funding every year.  The major challenge this year for many communities, particularly so in Dublin but it is spreading to other areas, is the rise of crack cocaine and its impact.  In November, there was a one-off funding bump of &euro;480,000 for the whole of the State.  That worked out at approximately &euro;20,000 per area, which was a drop in the ocean.  We know the challenges facing people.  Deputies mentioned the impact of Covid.  It is impacting on people who have difficulties with substance abuse, be it alcohol or drugs.  In that regard, has the Minister considered increasing funding for projects for vulnerable people in many of our communities?</p><p> St. Michael's ward in Beaumont Hospital has been closed during Covid.  It provided valuable work on the north side of the city.  There has also been the closure of residential beds and support services in Keltoi in the Phoenix Park, causing significant difficulties.  Alongside the question of funding, the issue of residential beds keeps arising at task force level.  Has the Minister spoken to the Minister of State in this regard?  The latter has been out in some communities looking at the challenges facing them.</p><p> When the Minister appeared before us previously, we asked him about the backlog in scoliosis procedures.  Has funding been found in this Estimate for that group of people, many of whom are young children who, as the Minister is aware, are suffering the horrible effects of scoliosis on their young bodies?  They could be left with deformities for the rest of their lives if their conditions are not dealt with sooner rather than later.  The Minister referred to difficulties at Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin in terms of staffing for the MRI machine.</p><p> The Irish Dental Association appeared before the committee recently.  Its representatives spoke about hundreds of dentists leaving the medical card scheme.  It was concerned that talks had not resumed.  Has funding been set aside in the Estimate for a possible deal?</p><p> One of the positive things that the committee did recently was to publish a report on the impact of vitamin D on Covid and general health.  The report made proposals in respect of nursing homes, front-line staff and areas with large Covid outbreaks and examined the role of vitamin D in building up people's immune systems.  A report from the Department did not go as far as ours in terms of the age group, given that we considered a much younger cohort, but is there funding available in this regard?</p><p> I have asked the Minister a number of questions.  If he cannot reply to them today, perhaps he will in future.  These are some of the main issues that are still outstanding where the work of this committee is concerned.</p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, the capital budget for the children's hospital, including the three satellites, is &euro;1.433 billion.  There will be commissioning costs on top of that.  However, that figure does not take into account the impact of Covid-19.  It would not be appropriate for me to speculate at this time as to what that might cost, given that it will be the subject of ongoing negotiation between the board and the contractor.</p> <p>  I agree regarding long Covid.  We need to get an important message out to people, particularly now as we see case numbers beginning to tip upwards again.  Even though those who are younger are significantly less likely to fall seriously ill or die from Covid, there are emerging cases of long Covid among all age groups.  It is concerning in some instances.  The Chairman referenced several cases.  I am aware of research into potential permanent neurological and heart muscle damage.  Part of the message that we need to get out while we are still in the gap between the most vulnerable people being vaccinated and others getting vaccinated is that, even if people are in a relatively safe category in respect of fatalities, what the Chairman just referenced in terms of long Covid is very serious.  People of all age groups are taking months and months to recover from Covid and are exhausted.  This matter is being examined.  Money has not been explicitly ring-fenced for it, but a substantial contingency fund relating to Covid is in place and can be tapped into.  The Government will not be found wanting in the research, treatment and supports required.</p> <p>  Regarding mandatory hotel quarantine,-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#K00300"><p>I am sorry.  While my question was on long Covid, it also related to vaccine-related illness.  I do not know if there has been a large number of cases, but we are all hearing anecdotally about side effects.  That some people will experience negative effects is bound to happen regardless of what vaccine is handed out to them.  Will there be supports for people in that situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#K00400"><p>We will need to see how that situation evolves.  The current position is that the vaccines are incredibly effective and very safe.  As the Chairman rightly stated, there are side effects within the normal parameters of people being vaccinated.  For the moment, that is the focus.</p> <p>  We are aware of a number of challenges to hotel quarantine.  I can share with the committee that, when the additional exemptions were put in place, particularly for those who were fully vaccinated, a few of the potential cases fell away.  Exemptions are also in place in respect of professional and elite sports.  The cases are being fought in the normal way.  A substantial contingency fund is in place for Covid-related issues, though, and I would not anticipate seeking additional funding from the Oireachtas this year for those issues.</p> <p>  I could not agree more with the Chairman regarding local drugs task forces.  I met the members of the local drugs task force in Ballymun early last year.  The stories they told about the impact that crack cocaine was having on the community there were horrifying.  We are seeing it in parts of Wicklow as well.  People working in addiction services and the drugs task force there are watching the situation closely and are very concerned.  Many of the team members I met in Ballymun had been involved in the response to the heroin epidemic.  They are hardened, seasoned professionals, but they said that they had never seen anything like the damage that crack cocaine was doing.  As the Chairman stated, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, is leading on this matter.  A sizable additional fund has been provided to Healthy Ireland, homelessness and addiction services.</p><p>It is certainly something on which I want to see more and more done.</p><p> There are other issues we are trying to fix in the background.  For example, if a person somewhere in Ireland is living in addiction, there is a fair chance that he or she will receive a rent supplement.  If he or she moves into a residential addiction programme, he or she will lose that.  One of the steps we are trying to take is to have a more co-ordinated approach in the State.  If, for example, that funding can be transferred to the addiction service providers, more and more people can get addiction help.  I could not agree more with the Chairman on the need to fund an increased capacity for the local drug task forces but also for the myriad services around them in order that we can treat addiction as a health, rather than criminal, issue, which is exactly what we want to do.</p><p> The next issue the Chairman raised related to scoliosis.  The current circumstances are not acceptable.  On 26 March this year, a total of 119 patients were waiting on spinal fusion, excluding the suspensions, which was an increase of 20 patients compared with March 2020.  We know that many waiting lists have increased because of Covid and the suspension of some surgery, but 70 patients were on the waiting lists for other spinal procedures, which was a decrease against March 2020.  Nonetheless, the current waiting times for scoliosis treatment, if someone needs to go through the public system, are not acceptable.  It is an area we are examining as we put together the detailed planning around the access to care fund.  All of us who are party health spokespeople or were involved in the Committee on the Future of Healthcare are acutely aware of the untold suffering of young men and women and boys and girls, and the awful implications of having to wait.  It is not acceptable.  There is going to be money available and we are going to crack this so that on the public system, these young men and women and boys and girls get not just the care they need but the care they need when they need it.</p><p> The next issue related to dentists.  I might get the committee a detailed briefing note on that, given that it is not related to the Estimates today.  I am aware that, as the Chairman referenced, the association has stated that more and more of its members are leaving the public list, which, obviously, we do not want.  Again, everything we are doing is about building up our public health system and increasing access, and there is no question but that in the area of oral health, very significant financial barriers are in place.  That is not acceptable and needs to be acted on.</p><p> On vitamin D, I saw the report and thought it was excellent.  All I can do is agree with the Chairman.  On foot of the report from the committee, I sought a review from NPHET of the relationship between vitamin D and Covid, and it reverted to say that while it did not have evidence of a reduction in risk specifically from Covid, it wholeheartedly endorsed taking the recommended dose of vitamin D for general well-being and a strong immune system.</p></speech>

We are probably the only country in Europe where the majority of patients have to fork out the full cost of visiting a GP, which very much goes against the principles in Sl&aacute;intecare of early intervention and lowest complexity of care.  I think it is a mistake not to accelerate that.  I accept there are industrial relation, IR, issues but I urge the Minister to revisit the issue and try to accelerate the extension of free GP care because it makes sense on many levels.</p> <p>  Is the Minister doing anything specific to reduce drug costs in this country, both for the State and for individuals?  As a proportion of the overall spend on health, they seem to be much higher than in most other European countries.  We know from when people used to go abroad that the cost of medicines in other countries is often much lower.  What is happening on that?  It is not a sustainable percentage to spend on drugs.</p> <p>  My final question relates to the proposed restructuring and reform of the HSE.  It was parked for a while last year with all that was going on.  Where are we with that and when does the Minister expect recommendations and action to be taken on restructuring the HSE to make it more responsive and accountable at a regional level?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2021042700002#L00300"><p>On universal access to primary care, including free GP care, I agree.  It is worth saying that the measures we brought in towards the end of last year increased the total number by several hundred thousand children.  The Deputy was critical of it at the time, as is her right, because she wants more to happen faster, but several hundred thousand children - I will seek the actual figure - were added.  It is a serious step in the right direction.  The Deputy will be aware that we have to have the capacity for this in primary care, and we are asking much of GPs at the moment.  Obviously, they have been instrumental in the test and trace system and the vaccination programme.  We are asking for pretty fundamental reform in terms of chronic disease management in the community.  We have got rid of dot matrix printers for prescriptions on the public list system, which GPs are very happy about, as they are about the access to diagnostics within the community.  The Deputy understands this issue very well.  I would like it to move as quickly as possible.  We increased provision by several hundred thousand last year but we have to ensure that the capacity is there as well.  Nevertheless, the Deputy's point is very fair.  We are signed up to universal healthcare and it is exactly what we need.  As she pointed out, we are an outlier.</p> <p>  On drug costs, there are two issues, one of which relates to the new drug budget of &euro;50 million.  It was zero last year, so that is a very sizeable increase.  A backlog of drugs from last year is being moved through at pace by the HSE.  The &euro;50 million will not reduce drug costs but rather provide for free, because it will be through the public system, some new drugs and existing drugs for new treatments, which will help.</p> <p>  A total of &euro;45 million in the budget was allocated specifically for prescription charges.  For prescription charges for the over-70s, it will reduce the charge per item from &euro;1.50 to &euro;1, while for the under-70s, the charge will fall from &euro;2 to &euro;1.50.  The net effect, it is believed, is that it will benefit more than 1.5 million people with medical card eligibility, and the drug payment scheme threshold will reduce from &euro;124 to &euro;114.  It is a &euro;45 million step in the right direction.</p> <p>  The question on restructuring probably demands a longer conversation than we have time for now.  I took a decision last year that during the pandemic, it would not be the right time to move to the regional structures.  It was not that they are not the right way to go, and much work has been done on them.  I think we are all broadly in agreement on the single greatest advantage of making the change, namely, joining up the budgets for acute care and community care because one of the big problems is the siloed budgeting activity.  I took the call that the pandemic was not the right time to do this.  Based on what has happened over the past year, I think that was probably the right call.  What we have not yet answered, and it is the question the Deputy is now posing, is whether we have a time at which we expect to move to the regional structures, given that the pandemic will be behind us soon enough.</p><p>We do not have time but I can tell her that people who are involved and very bought into it are already agitating for us to begin moving in that direction again.</p></speech>

There are several pieces of follow-up work that we will do, be it on the National Maternity Hospital and various technical notes people have.  My view is that this is a really exciting budget.  It is a lot of money.  There is a lot of technical stuff happening in the background in respect of financial reporting and IT systems on e-health and enablers but, ultimately, there are a few really exciting things happening in this budget.  The first is around beds.  It is a massive increase in beds at approximately &euro;342 million in terms of acute, critical care, sub-acute and community beds.  They will make an enormous difference and catch us up on the 2018 capacity review.  The first big chunk of investment is in building out the capacity.  Obviously, that funding is not just for the physical beds.  Arguably, that is the easy bit.  It is also about the staff and all the professionals we put around it.</p> <p>  The second is what I think is an unprecedented investment in community and social care.  This is the big structural change so we have &euro;408 million going into this.  It involves home care packages, community health networks, community specialist teams, GP access to diagnostics and some of the issues Deputy Shortall and I were just talking about in terms of reducing the costs of access to care.  </p> <p>  Significant additional funding is going into disability and mental health, something I know everyone on the committee is committed to.  A new piece about which I am really excited involves nearly &euro;150 million for the national strategies.  Before I sat down with the committee, I came from meeting the people involved in the national trauma strategy.  A lot of funding is now being provided for that.  There is also funding for maternity care and a lot of funding for women's health, paediatrics, dementia, palliative care, the carer's strategy and positive ageing.  The various clinical leads and clinical groups across the system in these really important care pathways have the funding to implement some wonderful strategies that have been put in place in recent years.  There is a big investment in public health and well-being.  The Chairman asked a question about the national drugs strategy, which comes to &euro;53 million.  There are new drugs and various things we discussed.  A really important piece is the access to care fund, which will involve &euro;130 million from the NTPF, an additional &euro;210 million, which is a new allocation, alternative care pathways, and screening and hospital restart grants.  That brings us to in excess of &euro;400 million, which we need to tackle these waiting lists.  </p> <p>  We have probably set ambitious targets right across the board.  We will hit as many of them as we can.  It is entirely possible we will not hit them all.  We have set really demanding targets in so many different ways.  All of our amazing clinicians have been working flat out and are, quite frankly, exhausted from the pandemic and all the additional work they have had to do in the pandemic.  The budget in front of us is really exciting because it allocates money in new ways, be it the national strategies or community and care services as well as building up acute services.  I ask for the committee's patience and understanding as we try to hit all these targets, ultimately to make things better for patients and the public in the year we are having and with our amazing clinicians and non-clinical staff across the system.  They are working so hard and are so tired.  They have done such an incredible job.  As the pandemic dies down, the focus of the committee and I along with that of the Oireachtas, our health service and the Department will quite rightly be on all of these wonderful areas and getting them going.</p></speech>

We are joined this morning by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, accompanied by Mr. Terry Sheridan, Mr. Conor O&rsquo;Sullivan and Mr. Jason Taylor from his Department.  The members have been circulated with the opening statement and briefing material.  I will first ask the Minister to make his opening statement.

Notwithstanding the very significant policy differences I have had with the Minister and his Government, I want to state that the Minister worked very closely with a number of us, including myself and the now Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on a number of pieces of legislation, including legislation which protected student renters.  Notwithstanding the political and policy disagreements, I want to acknowledge the work that he did during his time, in particular in those areas where we were able to find common ground and to collaborate in the better interests of those sections of society that we worked on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021042700002#A00800"><p>I am aware that the Chairman is tied for time so I will keep my remarks brief.  I wish to follow in the vein of Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  I spoke with Deputy Murphy this morning.  Even though we crossed swords quite a great deal, members of the committee worked well together, particularly in respect of student rent.  It is quite coincidental that tomorrow we will begin with student rents again in the D&aacute;il.  I wish former Minister, Deputy Murphy, all the very best.  He is a decent guy.  We had policy differences but he certainly tried his best, was very earnest and was a good person to get on with.  I wish him very well in whatever his new choice in life is and in his new career.</p> <p>  I thank the Cathaoirleach and the members for affording me the opportunity to present to the committee today the two sets of proposed planning regulations which have been circulated.  First, we have the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (No. 3) Regulations 2021, which concern planning exemptions for restaurants to maintain operations as takeaways for the remainder of 2021.  That provision would have expired without these regulations.  Second, we have the Planning and Development (Street Furniture Fees) Regulations 2021, which will waive section 254 of the street furniture licence fees for the remainder of 2021.</p> <p>  A third set of regulations, which do not require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas but about which I also want to advise the committee, is being progressed simultaneously and provides for the erection of awnings, coverings and other similar apparatus for outdoor dining to be a licensed activity under section 254 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, when it is linked with a street furniture licence for tables and chairs under that section.  This means that we will take it out of the planning piece and put it in under section 254.  This will mean that proposals for the installation of awnings, coverings - which we do need from time to time this country, as members will know - and other similar apparatus to facilitate outdoor dining will no longer be subject to planning permission and will instead be dealt with under the street furniture licensing regime in association with the provision of outdoor tables and chairs.</p> <p>  As we all are acutely aware, like many other sectors, the hospitality and restaurant sector and the wider tourism sector has suffered the brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic both last year and this year.  We want them to have a summer where they can make up for lost ground.  They have been subject to both temporary closure and long-term closures for considerable periods.  It has taken a very heavy toll on their own businesses and staff.  I, as Minister, and the Government are committed to providing any necessary supports to assist these sectors as much as is possible with a view to facilitating recovery as the current Covid-19 restrictions are further eased and lifted.  Big decisions are to be made this week with regard to the next phase from May onwards.</p> <p>  The two sets of planning regulations that I am presenting to the committee today, in conjunction with the third set of regulations that I have just mentioned on the provision of awnings and coverings, are practical measures that have merit, are within my remit, can be done and will help businesses.  There is, thankfully, light at the end of the tunnel and with the further expedited roll-out of the vaccination programme and continued business supports, we want to ensure that those in particular in the hospitality and the food sector have an opportunity to recover and that any potential barriers are removed particularly for the summer.  I propose that we then, later in the year, review these regulations further.  </p> <p>  There is one permanent change on awnings and coverings and, second, the extension of the takeaway provisions for restaurants which will allow that to continue until the end of the year, together with the waiving of the fee for street furniture across the country.</p> <p>  In conclusion, I note that some local authorities have already done this which I welcome, but I want there to be no ambiguity across all of our local authority areas that businesses are not to be charged for street furniture and that there are now practical changes in the regulations.  Hopefully we will have a good summer and when businesses open back up again they will be able to utilise the public space that we all enjoy for the safe reopening of their businesses.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

These are entirely sensible amendments to the exemptions and they support that funding of &euro;17 million that was announced through Bord F&aacute;ilte for outdoor dining equipment and the announcement yesterday of a further &euro;15 million to enhance those public, outdoor and open spaces for local authorities.  This goes hand in hand with those measures and it is entirely sensible.</p> <p>  I have one comment on the requirement now that one does not need to apply for planning permission for awnings and other structures as long as they are associated with a licensing application; I ask that care and consideration for protected structures is included in this also.</p> <p>  Do members wish to contribute on this?  I call Senator Seery Kearney to speak and then Deputy &Oacute; Broin.</p></speech>

I congratulate the initiative and the pro-business and pro-living nature of these measures, for the living of our lives in all of the areas and businesses that will be impacted by this.</p> <p>  I have a number of requests for consideration.  First, as to disabilities where we have street furniture now being used to a greater extent, I ask that we consider having some mechanism in place to ensure that we are not inhibiting in any way ease of access for people, particularly those in wheelchairs, or, where there is visual impairment.  We must be accommodating and give these requirements some consideration in terms of where we locate street furniture on the footpath left after its installation, if provision is not made out on the street, as has been very sensibly done in Dublin city.  We need to consider ease of access for people to ensure they are able to sit if there are raised plinths or some such feature.</p><p> If we learned anything from "Claire Byrne Live" on RT&Eacute; last night it is the level of waste.  I would certainly be in favour of considering the added cost and added services that will be required if we allow continuity of takeaway, which is eminently sensible, to ensure that we are maximising the potential covers in sales for restaurants.  At the same time, if there is an associated waste we should make provision for being pragmatic, in the words of Councillor James Geoghegan last night, in how we address that.  We should take the dual approach of, ideally, educating people to bring home their waste but also putting in place adequate bins and ensuring we have that complementary provision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021042700002#B00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  We were all heartened watching the scenes of the opening up of a variety of outdoor activities and certain sports yesterday, particularly for younger people and children.  That is giving people the sense that we are near the exit, which is to be welcomed.  Citizens, residents and businesses have had a hard number of months and anything we can do collectively as an Oireachtas to ensure we make the transition back to some level of normality as easy as possible is to be welcomed.  I fully support the two propositions.  I have some questions and I ask the Minister to come back on them in his r&eacute;sum&eacute; at the end.</p> <p>  Can the Minister clarify the timelines for the extensions about which he is talking?  With respect to the takeaways, can he confirm that the regulations are only for existing, operating and licensed restaurants, as opposed to new businesses that are looking to establish themselves?  Regarding street furniture, while local authorities will not be charging for that, there is obviously a cost involved.  I ask the Minister to outline what the Department is going to do to support the local authorities to address any costs incurred and any revenue lost.</p> <p>  I have two questions about awnings and coverings.  First, when does Minister intend to lay those regulations before the Oireachtas?  Second, some of our villages, and particularly urban villages, have much more stringent planning rules about street signage and signage on buildings.  How is the Minister going to deal with the interaction of those rules?  Those of us from Dublin Mid-West will know that Lucan, for example, has very strict rules about what people can and cannot do.  Is the Minister designing these regulations in a way that will remove the requirement for planning permissions while at the same time ensuring that is restricted where there is a certain heritage element or planning restriction in a given area, so as not to change the heritage character of said village?</p></speech>

As Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, he initiated an awful lot of the policies that we discuss at this committee.  He introduced Rebuilding Ireland, he went for the acceleration of social housing and he laid the foundations for the affordable housing and Land Development Agency, LDA, Bills, about which we are talking at this committee.  I wish him well with the next chapter in this life.</p> <p>  The regulations that are before us to support caf&eacute;s, restaurants and gastropubs are reasonable, sensible and will support small businesses that really need support right now.  It is great to see them backed up by Government funding and we are all looking forward to availing of outdoor dining as the country reopens.  This move will support us all to get back to normality but it will also support jobs in each of our local areas.</p></speech>

He was an exceptional Minister who had a fantastic record of engaging with all people on all sides of the Houses at this committee.  I also thank his staff because sometimes we forget it is the staff who serve the Minister and provide support.  They were a formidable team and I want to record my sincere thanks.  One of the great things about this is that there is life after politics.  Many people come into politics with a lot of experience but they go out with another set of experiences.  I wish him well in whatever he does because he is a gentleman.  He was diligent in his work and was always respectful of difference even if we had difference of opinion.  It is important that we put that on record.  I again welcome the Minister and I would apply the same principles and considerations to him and his staff.  I wish him well in what is a challenging job.</p> <p>  I have one main concern in respect of this matter, about which people will have known over the past few days.  I happen to live out in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I went around with shame on Sunday morning and took 22 photographs, which I sent to my local authority.  What disappointed me more than ever was that the streets were full of bottles, human faeces and urine.  The evidence was clear everywhere.  There are no public toilets.  We have public toilets within the local authority area that have been locked up for years.  People are consuming large volumes of food and alcohol.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire - and I want to be specific because that is where I live and have worked and that is where I know best - we have bye-laws that do not permit any citizen to consume alcohol in a public place.  Those laws have not been suspended.  The elected members of the council took that decision and have continued to keep that stipulation in place.  Therefore, we need clarity.  If we are to have outdoor tables and so on, of which I am supportive, we need absolute clarity that the Department and council officials will be empowered to support the elected members who seek to uphold bye-laws.  We talk about giving power to local councils and communities but if they put bye-laws in place and the establishment does not support the elected members in seeing those bye-laws through, there is a deficit.</p> <p>  I welcome having more outside trade and I welcome the development of the public realm.  I would go so far as to say that that development should not only be temporary.  We could see the potential of keeping some of these public spaces, subject to proper planning and regulations.</p> <p>  I also want the Minister to bear in mind the people who are disabled, the visually impaired and the problems they encounter on some of the many narrow footpaths there are, particularly in areas of architectural conservation and small heritage villages, of which we have many in the north and south of Dublin and all over the country.</p> <p>  I support what the Minister is trying to do but we need to give councils resources to clean up.  Great credit is due to the staff and the grounds maintenance people in local councils who are out there in Bray, on the seafront, Seapoint, Galway, Donegal and Fingal.  They are the people who have to get out at 6 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and clean up this absolute filth, dirt and rubbish that is dumped.  There is a price.  We can talk about greening and recycling and the responsibility of our citizens but that is not happening.  It is not the Minister&rsquo;s problem or my problem but we need extra resources for the council staff.  We have to acknowledge that they may need additional staff on a temporary basis to deal with the cleaning up of these areas.  Ultimately, we have to make the traders and owners of these businesses responsible because while they are rightly gaining and profiteering from their businesses, they also have to be involved in the cleaning up of this mess.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late.  I was in my office and thought we were having this meeting on Teams.  I would have hated to miss the party.</p> <p>  I pay tribute to the former Minister, Eoghan Murphy.  I served with him on Dublin City Council and while I disagreed with his politics, I always admired his energy, commitment and enthusiasm for the role.  I wish him well.  He is a bright and capable person and I hope he has much success after politics.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for these proposals and amendments.  He is true to form.  He has supported businesses during this pandemic through the local authorities.  The decisions and proposals he is making are pragmatic.  My understanding is that while the Minister is waiving the fees, he is not abolishing the process by which businesses have to apply for the permissions.  It is important that that is understood by both the businesses and the local communities.</p> <p>  The issues that have been raised in respect of mobility and access are very important.  The Minister knows this and does not need any of us to tell him.  There is a valid point to be made that, while we are supporting businesses with the waivers and the Minister is supporting them by allowing them to operate a takeaway service, those businesses need to take responsibility for the waste that has been generated from those takeaway services.  Public space has never been more valuable in the city and around the country.</p><p>Our public spaces are there for all of us to enjoy but we must all protect them.  I urge the Minister, through the local authorities and their offices, to communicate with the businesses that are benefiting from the rates waiver and to actively encourage them to engage in responsible packaging and clean-up.  I also urge the Minister to ask the local authorities to review their cleaning schedules for our public places.  The schedule of once a week, or once every 12 weeks as it is in some residential and more suburban areas of Dublin, is not sufficient in Covid times.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could take those issues up with the local authorities.</p></speech>

It is a time when we need to support local businesses and to do everything we can.  It is only part of the issue.  A few members have touched on the fact the whole issue consists of providing the local authorities with resources for extra staff and bins and for more collections.  I was in Cork city centre last Saturday night and there was a fabulous atmosphere in there.  The business community has done its part and the city council is trying to work with it but it needs more resources to make this work.</p> <p>  Cork City Council has implemented a great initiative in closing off a lot of the streets to have more on-street dining, which was a tremendous success last summer.  The side effect of that last year was that it moved disabled parking spaces from where they were on these streets to peripheral streets.  All that was done in the majority of cases was to just paint a disabled parking sign.  That is not good enough.  There are areas in Cork city that have had disabled parking spaces that people cannot access because when they open their doors, it is onto a main road, and there are other examples affecting such people and others with limited mobility.  This is not acceptable for Cork City Council or any local authority.  The local authorities need the resources.  We welcome the initiative.  On-street dining is a good thing and we want to support businesses but we have to make it accessible to all.</p> <p>  I have raised the following issue a number of times in the D&aacute;il.  There is a plan to carry out walkability audits for all local authorities.  I asked Cork City Council if it would carry out a walkability audit in Cork but the problem is there are no resources to do it.  I do not see why people with disabilities must always campaign and fight to get things that every citizen is entitled to, accessibility being one of them.  They have the same rights as everyone else.  We welcome the amendments today but this is only part of the issue.  The whole issue is that of disability.  As other members have mentioned, everyone needs to have the same rights.</p></speech>

I might forward the Minister a copy of the Dublin City Council caf&eacute;s and restaurants working group report from 2015, which looked at this area long before Covid.  It examined the positive impacts of the passive policing elements of having street furniture and so on.</p> <p>  One issue the Minister might look at between now and the end of the year when these amendments will lapse is fully devolving this responsibility to local authorities.  A Minister should not be setting the fees for tables and chairs in each local authority.  That is a power we could give to local authorities to allow them to be more nimble.  In places like Glasnevin, where we want to encourage the use of tables and chairs and where we do not have the same demand, we could have a different policy than we might have on Grafton Street or O'Connell Street.  This is an area where we could enhance local government over time if the right consideration is given to it.  I will be happy to forward the Minister that report.</p></speech>

On the measures to combat excess packaging, I am familiar with some of these high footfall areas where there have been huge problems with litter.  Some of them are well serviced with bins and everything else but there is a massive amount of excess in unnecessary packaging.  Is the Minister is looking at giving powers to local authorities to be able to deal with that or will some other measures be put in place?  That needs to be tackled.  It is worse now than it ever has been.</p></speech>

I will be as brief as possible and any items I do not get to I can return to.  I thank members for their support for these measures.  They are practical and they will help.  There are other issues that have rightly been raised but I will deal with specific questions about the extension of the two regulations.</p> <p>  The extension of the takeaway provision and the waiver is until the end of 2021.  Senator Fitzpatrick has rightly said we are not waiving the process, just the fee.  It means the appropriateness of a set of tables and chairs or awnings would be a matter, under the licensing arrangement, for each local authority to decide upon.  I had asked them about this and I will be issuing a circular next week to every local authority.  I want them to be expeditious in their turnaround of applications as we need to get ready for the summer and the reopening of outdoor dining.  I will be saying clearly to all 31 local authorities that this should be treated as a matter of priority but it is only in the areas where they are appropriate.</p> <p>  Access for those who have mobility impairments, disabilities and are blind has rightly been raised.  Senator Seery Kearney mentioned that at the start.  If it is not appropriate for a table and chairs to be put in a certain area, that permission will still not be given.  We have looked at this in detail.  I mention awnings and the question about protected structures.  That will bring the awnings to be a licensed activity.  If it is deemed that awnings are not appropriate for a certain type of building, the local authority will still be able to decide on that.  I know our heritage towns and some local authorities like Fingal County Council are already looking at a uniform nature of certain awnings in different towns and villages.  I would encourage that to be done.  Our local authorities have quite a deal of autonomy.  Already some of them have moved with the installation of parklets as well.  That happened last summer.</p> <p>  I mention disabled parking.  I am certain Deputy Gould has raised it with Cork City Council and I have seen other local authorities that have dealt with it in a different way.  Disabled parking bays cannot be removed in some local authorities and the same goes for the new age-friendly parking, which I welcome in my local authority area of Fingal.  It is question of what is appropriate and where it is appropriate for these to be taken in.</p> <p>  This is a different summer.  We all recognise the fact that most of the businesses in our hospitality sector, in particular our restaurants, caf&eacute;s or gourmet pubs, are family-run businesses.  Thankfully, a lot of them have been here for generations.  Any help that can be given to help them trade more easily should be given.  We have had in excess of &euro;900 million so far in rates waivers and there will be up to &euro;1.2 billion in such waivers by the time they are finished.  Let us remember we have given a 100% rebate to local authorities, even those local authorities that did not collect 100% of rates.  Local authority budgets have never been bigger.  There are vacancies in local authorities I want to see filled.  I believe in local government and it has performed incredibly well throughout the pandemic.  It has been the tip of the spear of the national response on the ground.</p> <p>  Litter is something I am actively looking at with regard to additional crews and the system of cleaning.  I saw the Phoenix Park, St. Anne's Park, Malahide Castle and all of our beauty spots last weekend.  A small number of people are engaging in disgusting behaviour and showing no responsibility.  They should take their litter home with them.  Even if the bins are full, they should not be packing them up.  Some of the stuff you see is awful and it is our staff who end up cleaning the mess of other people.  I ask people in general to be much more responsible.  I will be asking the local authorities to look at their cleaning schedules and the provision of temporary bins, particularly as we come into the summer months and the two bank holiday weekends in May and June when we know we tend to have more people congregating.</p> <p>  This is an opportunity for us, and we are doing it as a Government and some local authorities are doing it to great effect, to reimagine our public spaces and realms.  It is an opportunity to look at our roads and streets in a different way, to make them friendly for pedestrians, cyclists and families, to start moving the car away from the middle of our towns and villages, and to let people get back into those open spaces.</p> <p>  I know the Cathaoirleach has a lot of work on this morning.  If there is anything I have missed I apologise and we will come back on any specific queries.  I will be moving these motions tomorrow in the D&aacute;il now that I have briefed the committee.</p></speech>

At the private meetings last week, we dealt with many of the amendments that came in.  There are some amendments that we could not agree on at that meeting.  The proposers have asked us to put them to a vote.  To put this into context, there were 54 amendments submitted.  That is an indication of how committed members are and the amount of time everyone on this committee has put into this report so far.  It shows how well the committee works together, that of the 54 amendments, we could not agree on the final wording of six or seven.  Hopefully, we can do that in this session.</p> <p>  The first vote is on additional recommendations to the pre-legislative scrutiny report.  This was proposed by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.

Average rents in Dublin, for example, are &euro;1,700 per month for a standard two-bed.  In fact, in many parts of Dublin city, in particular, rents are now at &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,500.  Purchasing a home is becoming increasingly difficult for larger numbers of people, including young people on good incomes.  A recent report by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland showed that in terms of live apartment-building projects currently under way in Dublin, the all-in development and sales cost is now somewhere around &euro;400,000.  It is important to stress that it is not just first-time buyers who are being locked out of affordable housing.  Many Deputies and Senators are contacted regularly by people at a later stage in their career who, because of the loss of their family home arising from  repossession or a relationship breakdown, are also unable to buy.  This is particularly affecting single people.</p> <p>  The measures we are discussing today and, in particular, the way in which the serviced sites fund, which this amendment relates to, is used is really important because if the serviced sites fund is used in the correct way, it can deliver genuine affordability.  We can use it to assist our local authorities and approved housing bodies to deliver homes at prices people can actually afford.  However, the problem is that if we continue to repeat the mistakes of the past, and if we allow private developers to have access to this finance, the consequence will be twofold.  The purchasers will end up paying higher prices and in some cases large numbers of affordable purchasers will not be able to afford those properties.  Also, the taxpayer will be cross subsidising developers profit.</p> <p>  For clarity, in this instance, I am not talking about private building contractors.  Private building contractors build all public homes.  This amendment does not refer to that.  Nor am I talking about finance.  Almost all public housing is built with some form of borrowed finance, whether it be from Government borrowing, the Housing Finance Agency or other groups.  This is specifically about private developers.  </p> <p>  Briefly, I will give two recent examples of the impact bringing in private developers into affordable housing provision has had, which demonstrates why it does not make any sense.  In my constituency, South Dublin County Council had a significant piece of public land named the Kilcarbery estate.  Members of this committee who were previously with me on South Dublin County Council will know the estate very well.  There was a proposition to build approximately 1,000 houses on that site, consisting of social rental, affordable rental, and affordable purchase.  However, in their wisdom a majority of members of that council decided to sell that land to a private developer.  As a consequence of that the all-in development cost of those homes, which are currently commencing construction, has increased significantly.  For example, the cheapest discounted home on that land will retail for more than &euro;325,000, which is way beyond the affordability reach of many of the people were are trying to target with the serviced sites fund.</p> <p>  The example is one we all know, because we debated it at length in the House previously, namely, O'Devaney Gardens where Dublin City Council, under instruction from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, engaged in a lengthy competitive dialogue with private developers and eventually signed a deal with Bartra.  In this instance, they have access to the serviced sites fund and yet the all-in cost that will be paid for the affordable homes is &euro;360,000.  The buyer will pay &euro;310,000 but will ultimately have to pay the &euro;50,000 serviced sites fund amount back as well.</p> <p>  Compare that to what happens when one allows only the local authorities of the approved housing bodies sector to use the serviced sites fund.  Homes are developed by, for example, &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance, whereby the homes sell for between &euro;160,000 and &euro;200,000.  This is well below, in fact, &euro;60,000 less, than what is happening in Kilcarbery or in O'Devaney Gardens.</p> <p>  This amendment only refers to the serviced sites fund.  We will talk about cost rental later.  The amendment clearly states the only people who should have access to this fund in terms of the developer are not-for-profit agencies, local authorities, approved housing bodies, and community housing trusts.  The consequences of allowing private developers access to this funding is that it pushes up prices, it locks people out from being able to afford these homes and it has the taxpayer cross subsidising private developers very substantial level of profit, which is not a good use of taxpayers' money.  Therefore, I commend the amendment to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021042700002#D01500"><p>In saying what I am saying, it is important to put context on it.  What we envisage is a mix of housing based on what is needed in any given area.  In most cases, the State will be required to develop 100% social and affordable housing, particularly in the Dublin area, which the Minister is on record as having said.  However, there may be areas in the country that have only had social housing built over the last decade.  What we need to do is to ensure there is a mix in a given area, so we do not have areas which are predominately or solely private, predominately or solely affordable or solely social.  It is important in the context of what I am saying is that we are seeking to achieve a mix of housing tenure in any given locality.  We have to be mindful of areas in the country where there has been only one tenure type built over the last number of years.</p> <p>  I suspect the wording in the amendment, which includes the words "private" and "for-profit developers", has been put in there for a reason.  It was put in there to create the impression that Government parties are in some way supportive of this method at the expense of the approved housing body, the housing co-op or the community housing model.  That is not the case and I want to make that clear.</p><p>If we are supportive of this amendment, we may inadvertently exclude low-return funds from entering the State in order to provide affordable housing.  That is a model replicated across Europe; Vienna is held up as an exemplar.  The committee cannot inadvertently put blocks in place that may prevent a mixture of housing types in a given area and tie one hand behind the State's back as it tries to deliver affordable housing.  That is why we cannot support this amendment.  It is not because of the impression that might be given that we are in some way supportive of private development.  </p><p> We need a mix in this country.  We need low-return funds to provide affordable housing so it is not solely the State.  We also have to be very cognisant of the fact that approved housing bodies are on the State's balance sheet.  We have to be mindful that we may be in a financial squeeze over the next number of years.</p></speech>

We are very anxious to conclude our business today.  We are trying to facilitate the completion of the report on the affordable housing Bill so that legislation can be introduced to start to address the housing crisis in a meaningful way, with the provision of affordable housing to rent and purchase by local authorities, approved housing bodies and not-for-profit organisations.</p> <p>  The political motivation behind this amendment is fairly clear but the reality is that the serviced site fund is set up under regulation.  It is a &euro;310 million fund dedicated to supporting the provision of affordable housing not for-profit housing.  The second criterion mentioned in this amendment is private developers.  It is a very broad term to use.  It is used, in this instance, to signal a certain political position but it excludes ethical, sustainable investors.  We are determined to use every mechanism to address this housing crisis, which is one of both supply and affordability.  On that basis, the Fianna F&aacute;il group will not support this amendment.</p></speech>

I agree with previous speakers that a housing mix is very positive and should be encouraged.  I do not see an issue with this amendment in regard to that.  This is about whether we give public subsidies to private developers in delivering affordable housing and whether it is a good way to proceed if we want affordable housing.  This amendment does not preclude low-return funds and ethical investment in housing and affordable housing.  Currently, low-return investment funds and ethical funds are quite successfully investing in social and affordable housing through approved housing bodies.  If this amendment is passed, and followed through in the legislation, that would continue to be the practice.  The question is whether or not we give public subsidies to private developers.</p> <p>  As regards providing affordable housing at a rate people can genuinely afford in terms of their income, rather than a percentage discount off a full market rate, we need to ask whether private developers are good at delivering that.  Are private developers good at that, as opposed to private builders who can be contracted by approved housing bodies or local authorities?  The evidence, certainly to date, is that they are not.  They have a more costly form of delivery than approved housing bodies or local authorities.  </p> <p>  We can see that quite clearly in the example of the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance and what it is building which ranges from about &euro;160,000 to &euro;250,000.  Its houses are coming in at a significantly more affordable cost than those of private developers.  It is worth noting that &Oacute; Cualann contract private builders, but as a developer managing the project it has lower finance costs and lower risk margins.  While it takes a margin, which it uses to reinvest in its next project, its overall profit margin or reinvestment take is lower than private developers.  It is not just &Oacute; Cualann.  Approved housing bodies and, in general, local authorities, are more effective in terms of delivery.</p> <p>  There is the issue of the State balance sheet.  If we are serious about what needs to be invested in affordable and social housing, the only approach that can be taken is one where we are willing to break the EU fiscal rules.  This is in the context of such low interest rates, especially.  Other countries have done this in the past.  It is absolutely justifiable to break fiscal rules in the context of a housing and homeless crisis.  I have no issue with that at all.  Every party in the Oireachtas should support it.  I am strongly supportive of the European Union but there are countries in the EU flouting much more serious breaches in its fiscal rules and the rule of law.  There is no proper action being taken against them so we should have no fear in breaking those rules, if needs be, in addressing our housing and homeless emergency and investing in affordable and social housing.  </p></speech>

Unfortunately, because of Covid-19, there is an unbelievable crisis in terms of family break-ups.  Those who have contacted me include partners, parents, children and grandchildren.  We are looking to provide an opportunity, and to give people a chance, with affordable housing and affordable cost rental.  We have a crisis in social housing.  Tens of thousands of people are on the waiting lists.  We also have people trapped in the middle who are earning too much to be on social housing but cannot qualify for a mortgage.  This is where affordable housing comes in.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is trying to make affordable housing as affordable as possible.  His whole point is to ensure that local authorities, approved housing bodies, housing co-ops, community housing trusts and non-profits are the vehicles that deliver it. </p> <p>  We are talking about allowing private developers in on this specific part.</p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick said earlier the political motivation behind this amendment was very clear.

I have always said I did not give a damn who builds the houses.  I am not hung up on the ideology of it but when we talk about affordability, we must keep costs down.  I have an issue with the subsidisation when the housing co-ops, the community groups, the affordable housing bodies, AHBs, and all the others are trying to build public housing.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin set out the rationale and I am happy to support him.</p> <p>  I was particularly taken by the rationale set out by Deputy O'Callaghan.  Regardless of what happens, this is a pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, and it will be a matter for the Houses.  I accept it is a critical part of the process but there will be many other opportunities.</p> <p>  On the issue of political motivation, we are all politicians.  We are all motivated by our political agenda and beliefs and no one should apologise for that.  In short, I will support the amendment.</p></speech>

The way to do it is to ensure nothing fetters supply and it will be a significant contributor to what makes something affordable or not.</p> <p>  There is an inference in the contributions by Deputy &Oacute; Broin that the criteria for accessing these schemes is an exclusive preserve.  Every committee member supported widening and recommending the widening of criteria, including me, to ensure we have maximum accessibility for those who lost their homes due to the financial crash and those who, for a variety of reasons, find themselves, yet again, without homes.  We all agreed on that, so to allude to it, or exclaim an exclusive preserve of it in public session, when we were in agreement in private session, is disingenuous.</p> <p>  All of our motivation is to ensure a maximum of housing supply.  It is what we need to do and it is why I will not support this amendment.</p></speech>

It is not the case to say the Government is not supportive of facilitating private developers to make profit.  If one looks at the housing policies around social housing, in particular, over the last five to ten years, it has all been about trying to attract high cost, private finance through the provision of profit because the State did not want to directly deliver large volumes of social and affordable homes.  It is why we are in the housing crisis.</p> <p>  Government policies, whether it is the enhanced leasing scheme, local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, excessive tax breaks for real estate investment vehicles or the shared equity loan scheme proposed by Fine Gael and either supported or facilitated through the abstention of Fianna F&aacute;il, say to private developers the Government will give them profit in exchange for development.  There is a cost to it and people need to be clear, which is why I raise it.</p> <p>  The cost is that it reduces the volume of affordable houses delivered and increases the cost.  I take Kilcarbery, in my constituency, as an example.  For a decade, we campaigned for Government to invest with South Dublin County Council to deliver 1,000 homes on the site.  Some 300 would have been social rental, approximately 300 would have been affordable rental and approximately 300 would have been affordable purchase.  It would have given the social mix Senator Cummins proposed, but Fine Gael would not fund it and instead the council was forced, if it wanted to develop the land, to sell it.</p> <p>  The consequence is we will have 30% social housing, which I welcome, but 70% of the homes on the site will be open market unaffordable.  If one takes O'Devaney Gardens as an example - none of the Deputies or Senators on the Government side addressed this point - the consequence of bringing in a private developer with the serviced sites fund is those homes are &euro;60,000 more expensive than if one restricted it to the approved housing body, local government or community housing trust sector.</p> <p>  With respect to the off balance sheet - Senator Cummins knows this - &Oacute; Cualann is the largest supplier of affordable homes with the serviced sites fund and they are off balance sheet.  One can have off balance sheet vehicles with this financing and, therefore, it is not an issue.  It is not the case this amendment would prevent ethical investors.  In fact, last week Cl&uacute;id Housing announced a deal with an ethical investor, a long-term, low-yield pension fund, for the delivery of more than 500 homes, so, again, it is absolutely not the case.  With respect to Deputy Duffy, the Land Development Agency, LDA, cannot access the serviced sites fund, so it does not apply this sense.</p> <p>  The central issue is whether or not we want to continue with the failed Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael housing policy of privilege and private developers using public money to cross-subsidise very significant profit while driving up the price of homes.</p> <p>  Senator Seery Kearney is wrong.  Supply, in and of itself, will not fix the problem.  The supply must be affordable which the Senator's Government has failed to take into account for the last number of years, so we either use the funding-----</p></speech>

I invite Deputy &Oacute; Broin to outline his proposal briefly, which reads as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	The Bill be amended to explicitly prohibit the use of Cost Rental Equity Loan for the delivery of for-profit housing by private developers thus ensuring only Approved Housing Bodies, Housing Co-Ops and Community Housing Trusts and other not for profit vehicles can access the funding. </blockquote></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021042700002#G00800"><p>I want to make two separate or distinct arguments with respect to this.  Obviously it is related to No. 1 in the sense that I am arguing that the cost rental equity loan should not be available to private developers, and there are two key elements here to make that case.  The way cost rental works is twofold.  As members know, you look at the financing, development, management and maintenance costs of the unit and the idea is that whoever provides the unit has to get full cost recovery over a period of time.  However, you can make the rent more affordable if you structure the finance in such a way as to allow the full cost recovery to happen over a longer period of time, thus bringing down the entry level rents to an appropriate point.  This is really significant because the current cost rental schemes that are under development, including the Enniskerry Road cost rental pilot scheme, for example, will have rents of between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,300 per month.  Other cost rental projects in D&uacute;n Laoghaire could have rents of &euro;1,300 per month and, in Cork city, of &euro;900 per month.  That is going to cause a very significant problem for a large cohort of working people not eligible for social housing and for whom we would like to have cost rental as a viable option.  These are often workers who are just above the income threshold for social housing, and we know from very detailed research by the ESRI that they are people who do not experience significant levels of wage growth.  Therefore, the entry level rent of cost rental projects is really key if this is to be affordable.  Mr. Brendan Kenny, the director of housing at Dublin City Council and officials from the Department of Finance told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2019 that if the financing of this is structured correctly, we could bring entry level rents down to between &euro;700 and &euro;900 per month for a one, two or three-bedroom unit, which is substantially below what is currently being proposed as the guiding rent of about &euro;1,200 per month.</p> <p>  The difficulty with bringing in private developers is twofold.  First, it adds a significant additional layer of cost above the cost of financing, building, managing and maintaining because developers are required to have a 10% to 15% profit and risk margin.  That is an extra layer of cost that makes things more difficult.  That 10% to 15% cost margin is taken from four separate reports by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland of private sector development and it is a well-established principle.  There is a more significant consequence of bringing in private developers.  The key about cost rental is that once the financing loans are paid down, let us say over 20, 30 or 40 years, the accommodation generates a surplus.  It generates a revenue stream for the housing provider.  That is how, for example, the not-for-profit and voluntary sector providers in other European jurisdictions actually have a housing stock that is self-financing after a period of 20, 30 or 40 years.  The revenue surplus on the cost rental side helps providers to cross-subsidise social rental as well as to fund future stock.  The best way of delivering cost rental, whether it is through local authorities or other public agencies or not-for-profit entities, is to have social and cost rental units together and when the cost rental loans are paid down, the providers will benefit from the surplus.  Those of us here who have been councillors know the great difficulty our local authorities have had getting adequate resources from central government for the management and maintenance of social housing stock.  That is why they often have to opt for very expensive refurbishment projects and so on.</p> <p>  If we say that private developers can have access to the cost rental equity loan, what we are essentially doing is giving that revenue surplus, which would be about half of the rent that would be paid at that stage, permanently to the private sector at a future point in time.  In that way, we are denying the not-for-profit sector, particularly the local authorities but also the Land Development Agency, LDA, which I do not support, and the approved housing bodies, AHBs, access to that surplus.  Again, this will make the rents more expensive and will deny our local authorities and other not-for-profit providers access to a really valuable revenue stream into the future.  It is completely contrary to the logic of cost rental.  I am not aware of any jurisdiction where for-profit private developers deliver cost rental because the whole point is that it is meant to be about full cost recovery and is not profit driven.  I do not see why we should use taxpayers' money to deliver more expensive rental accommodation and cross-subsidise private developers indefinitely into the future when that funding could be used for more affordable accommodation to the benefit of our local authorities indefinitely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1656" speakername="Mary Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021042700002#G00900"><p>Fianna F&aacute;il will be opposing this proposal.  It is similar to the first one brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in and is political virtue signalling.  We all understand that cost rental means affordable rental accommodation.  As with the serviced sites fund, funding can only be applied to affordable homes that are provided for purchase or rent.  The funding cannot be applied to for-profit housing.  I do not know exactly what is meant by for-profit, which is a really broad description.  I know what the Deputy is getting at when he uses the term but just in case anybody missed it, the LDA legislation and the affordable housing legislation that we are bringing forward are designed specifically to insert the State into the picture, using public lands to deliver affordable homes for purchase and rent and to increase our social housing stock.  That is what the aforementioned legislation is about, very simply, and this type of delaying tactic is very unhelpful.  It displays a complete disregard for everybody who is trapped by the housing crisis, for those on the social housing list and those whose family has broken down because of the inadequacy of their housing conditions.</p> <p>  We will not be supporting this proposal and I would urge the Chairman to call a vote on it as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1574" speakername="Francis Noel Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021042700002#G01000"><p>The Green Party will not be supporting this proposal.  The definition of cost rental is that the renter pays for the cost of construction and maintenance, as well as a profit capped at 3% to 3.5%.  That is the way the Vienna model works.</p><p>I am not sure where Deputy &Oacute; Broin got the figure of 10% to 15%.  I go back to the Government agency that will deliver these, namely, the LDA.  It is a Government agency; it is not interested in profit.  It is interested in delivering public housing on public land.  I do not think it will be looking for that.  There will be a tendering process within which one invites contractors to tender to the agency to deliver the housing.  It will work with the best contractors to give the best price.  There will be profit included with any of those tendering processes but it is not 10% to 15% based on my experience.  </p></speech>

That is profit.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin's proposal is an attempt at grandstanding by presenting for-profit housing by private developers as something that is not in existence in this country.  We are looking to attract special vehicles where there is a low return of 3% or 4%.  That is what builds houses across Europe.  If we are going to get party political about it, as was the case in the first debate on the first motion and if Sinn F&eacute;in wants to tie one hand behind the State's back to make sure we can only provide cost rental accommodation through AHBs or local authorities, it will do that and make sure we cannot scale up the model.  What matters with cost rental is the more units that are delivered over time, the more affordable those units become because they rise in line only with the consumer price index whereas the wider rental market is probably increasing at a higher rate if one looks at it over a ten, 20, 30 or 40-year period.  These cost rental properties will become more affordable for the tenants over time and Deputy &Oacute; Broin knows that.  To tie the State's hands is not what we should be doing here.  We should provide affordable homes and cost rental by any means possible.  Senator Boyhan said that he did not mind who provided housing.  I also do not mind who provides it once people who need it and who are facing high rental costs get it.  That is what we are about on all sides of this committee and we should work together to that aim.</p></speech>

In 2011, I proposed a development of a site involving the building of 800 houses on Old Whitechurch Road that got the support of the majority of members of Cork City Council but was then blocked by the Minister at the time, Phil Hogan.  Affordable housing was part of that plan.  That site is now being developed ten years later.  They are putting in the infrastructure with LIHAF funding.  Not a single house has been built on it so for Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Members to accuse Sinn F&eacute;in of trying to slow down the delivery of affordable housing is mind-boggling.</p><p>The LDA got planning permission last week for the St. Kevin's site in Shanakiel, Sunday's Well for 266 units.  I proposed this eight years ago.  This is the level we are at.  I did not want to come in here and get adversarial but this is where Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are.  I mean no disrespect but I do not know how the Green Party can stand over this because there were Green Party councillors on Cork City Council when I was a member.  We could have delivered thousands of houses years ago so how can others come in here and say that we are trying to slow down delivery?  We want to make affordable housing affordable.  Housing is the number one issue for the people I represent in Cork North Central.  We want to get this done and dusted.  Some have said we want to tie the State's hands behind its back.  For years, we wanted to free the State's hand and that of the local authorities and everyone else to build houses.  Members should go to <i>corkcitycouncil.ie</i>and read the motions I tabled and how Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party councillors voted because most of the time, the Green Party voted with us.  They should go back and look at those motions aimed at delivering affordable housing.  </p><p>Going back to the recommendation, what we are trying to do is make affordable housing as affordable as possible.  This is like a golden egg to private developers-----</p></speech>

We can disagree with those amendments, which is fine, but to suggest that we are tabling them for anything other than the reason that we believe they would improve the policy in the Bill is wrong.  I respect all members of this committee.  I might disagree profoundly with the policies they propose.  Coming into this committee and tabling these amendments is legitimate.  It is not, to quote Senator Fitzpatrick, a "delaying tactic".  In fact, we are making good progress.  For the record, I suggested in private session that I would be quite happy if we took these votes without debate to speed up the process but it was Government members who legitimately, and I have no objection to this, wanted to have this debate publicly.  They cannot then criticise us for wanting to have that debate.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Duffy, the LDA does not have access to this cost rental equity loan.  This is currently a loan for AHBs.  This is how it is designed and, therefore, his reference to the LDA is not factually correct.  The next point in respect of the 10% to 15% figure is really important because it seems some members on the Government side might misunderstand either my intention in tabling this motion or the way these funds will work.  When a private developer is developing, and private developers are a very clear entity, they are required both through their private financing and standard practice to have what is called a profit and margin line on their development of between 10% and 15%.  I am quite happy to send Senator Cummins the four SCSI reports that deal specifically with this.  The reports itemise that and they are from real live development projects over the past number of years for houses and apartments.  The consequence of that is that separate to the cost of finance, which members will also see as a line item in the SCSI reports, bringing in developers adds an extra 10% to 15%.  That is on top of the cost of the finance and other costs.  The key issue is that if we allow that to happen, entry rents would increase.  I have not heard a single member on the Government side respond to my key concern, which is a genuine concern, that opening the door to private developers accessing this scheme, as with the previous scheme, would push up prices.  We have real-life examples where that has happened.  When the row over O'Devaney Gardens was happening in Dublin City Council, there was a proposition that the local authority and an AHB should acquire at full market value additional properties from Bartra and rent them out as cost rental.  Any calculation of what rent repayment would look like over a 40 or 50-year period was &euro;1,600 to &euro;1,800 per month.  That is the consequence of bringing in a private developer.  Thankfully, so far, the Department has refused to fund that proposition because it is not affordable by any stretch of the imagination.  </p> <p>  In respect of scaling up, the reason we do not have cost rental accommodation in this State is Governments have refused to fund it.</p><p>It has been Government policy since 2014.  Deputy Alan Kelly, in the Social Housing Strategy 2020, promised cost-rental.  Rebuilding Ireland promised-----</p></speech>

They can do whichever they want.  The reason why we do not have those units is not because of the absence of legislation but because of the absence of Government investment.  Only a few years ago, we were told that there would be 6,400 affordable rentals and purchase units available by the end of this year because of a &euro;300 million investment in the serviced sites fund and virtually none of it has been spent.  This year, only &euro;50 million will be spent.</p> <p>  The fundamental problem, to correct Senator Cummins, is not that that we are not letting the private sector in.  In fact, that has been our problem for too long.  It is that we are not providing the necessary funding in budget after budget to allow local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts, to deliver at scale.  That will still be the case even when this legislation passes.  Members have to make a decision.  Either they want to drive down the cost of renting or buying these units or they want to let in private developers to maximise profit at the expense of the taxpayer and make these units less affordable.  That is what the parties opposite have already done, voting in Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council with respect to O'Devaney Gardens and Kilcarbery.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1672" speakername="Rebecca Moynihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021042700002#J01800"><p>I am.  Looking at it now, the wording is  perhaps somewhat clunky.  However, what is proposed in the Bill is essentially affordable rental being at a market discount.  Through the affordable housing Bill and the LDA Bill, it is important that we try to link affordability to 30% of net earnings, which is what all the outside experts who have given evidence to this committee on this Bill refer to.  I am open to tightening up the wording on this.  Hopefully it will be tightened up in the Bill.  What is proposed for affordability is a market discount.  It is important that we have a definition linking it to indicators.  There are a number of different indicators.  I picked the CSO net income figure.  The CSO sometimes only does gross income.  I think the Department can come up with words that link affordability to income as opposed to a market discount, so I am pressing this amendment.</p></speech>

One thing that we discussed at the committee was significant ESRI housing research which was published in summer 2018.  It asked a simple question, which is how many households not eligible for social housing support, including people who cannot get HAP, RAS or social housing, have high housing costs.  It did extensive research, going right back to 2002.  It looked at renters and owner-occupiers.  The findings of the survey were startling.  It found that, in general, about 30% of those households not eligible for social housing support have high housing costs.  That was defined by the ESRI as over 30% of take-home pay with some factors taking into account the ability to afford an ordinary basket of goods afterwards.  What was most startling about the survey is that in those two income deciles just above the income thresholds for social housing, 70% of those people had high housing costs, above 40% of take-home pay in many cases.  These are people who are in steady jobs but with low pay.  Sometimes there are one and a half or two incomes in a household.  They are people who, unless something dramatic changes, are unlikely to ever be able to purchase a home and obviously are not eligible for social housing.  We have to ensure that that group of people, who would be a main target cohort for affordable cost-rental, will be able to afford the rent that is being proposed.</p> <p>  The great difficulty at the moment is that some of the rental projects that have been proposed would be charging rent above that 30%, because there is no requirement to have a maximum level.  The best way to deliver cost-rental is to make it affordable cost-rental, with full cost recovery over the lifespan of the repayment of the loans.  The entry level rent should be affordable.  I think having affordable rents linked to a maximum of 30% of net income, if the Senator is willing to take that friendly amendment to insert the words "a maximum of" before "30%", would be eminently sensible.  If we do not do this and find some way of linking affordability with full cost recovery, which I think can be easily done, there will be a big group of people in between the thresholds for social housing and the actual price that is being charged who will be either locked out or have high housing costs.</p> <p>  Since the Government has repeatedly set itself against raising the thresholds for social housing eligibility, on the basis of the most recent oral questions we had with the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, we have to ensure these people get in.  Between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,300 a month is not affordable for large sections of people.  We need rents of between &euro;700 and &euro;900.  This amendment would ensure that that would be achieved, especially in local authority developments.  I fully support it but would recommend those three additional words.</p></speech>

I understand the motivation behind it.  We are putting this legislation before the House for a reason, which is to have a significant intervention in the market to provide affordable purchase and affordable rental.  The programme for Government was put together to respond to the issues which Deputy Gould and other Deputies in this House, including the Minister, have spoken about over the past ten years.  Therefore, in order for us to have that intervention, we have to put forward legislation in these two significant policy areas, for affordable purchase, which we have discussed, and for affordable rental.  It is important that affordable rental is let out by affordable housing bodies and by the State, initially on balance sheet.  In order for us to provide a broad base of affordable properties in the State, provided through a public housing model, we have to scale up.</p> <p>  I believe that a full cost-recovery model is the key to affordable rental.  It is also the key to ensuring that the model can be scaled up so that affordable rental actually becomes the predominant rental model in the market.  For many of the reasons for which we objected to the previous amendments, although I do not suspect it is with the same motivation, I will oppose this amendment.</p><p>I am opposed to this amendment because the linking of affordable rent, in particular through the wording, to "30% of net income" is too specific.  It could, for example, be below or above that.  My view is that it is better to link it with the full cost recovery model which allows for that element of affordability, including supply.  I am therefore opposing the amendment.</p></speech>

In respect of affordability, whether it relates to affordable purchase or affordable rent, the public housing model or any other model, surely 30% of net income would be the maximum.  I would go as far as supporting the point Deputy &Oacute; Broin made in respect of Senator Moynihan's amendment, that the maximum should be 30% of net income.  Let us forget about location.  Housing is either affordable or not affordable.  Affordability judged by what one has in one's pocket at the end of the day.</p> <p>  We must simplify and demystify the debate on housing.  Many people outside these Houses are bellyaching about their commitments to affordable housing.  They should be honest and keep it simple.  Affordability is about what one has as disposable income.  I consider 30% of net income to be a maximum. That is the key message about affordable purchase, rental or whatever scheme.  It is the one line that constantly resonates with people outside.  People talk about whether rents "are linked to our income".  Nothing is affordable if it is not based on net income.  This amendment is perhaps the strongest message that we can send out today.  It is something I wish to echo and hang on to, because it is simple and clear.  We need some clarity in this debate.  We must reflect on what the people outside understand by the term "affordable" and what they are calling for.  They are calling for equity, fairness and affordability.  A figure of 30% of net income is a maximum.  I appeal to all members to reconsider and support what is a very reasonable proposal and amendment.</p></speech>

Cost rental is based on the cost; affordable is where assistance is provided by the State, essentially.  We need to make sure which one is which, when we are speaking to them.</p> <p>  In Vienna, state assistance is given to people who cannot afford cost rental.  It is the first time that cost rental has happened.  There was a concept in 2015, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin told me previously.  This year, we are pushing a lot more out.  I would say that, for the first time, cost rental is happening.  It will be a long time, or 20 years, before we have quite a bit of capacity at cost rental and can see the benefit of it.  However, cost rental is what it says on the tin.  It is the cost of the unit, and the rent comes from that.  Therefore, I assume, going forward, that when this model evolves, the State will come in and assist people to rent those units.  That is what happens in Vienna and it is how it works.</p></speech>

This amendment is definitely one of the most important and I fully support it.  I agree with the rewording suggested by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.</p> <p>  I am genuinely surprised and quite worried that the Government is opposed to the amendment.  I would have thought that there would be a consensus that affordable rental should actually be affordable.  There is a general consensus outside of these Chambers.</p></speech>

That is good.  If there is consensus on that, why would the figure of 30% of net income not be the measure of that?  That is the part that I do not understand.  One could make the argument that for flexibility one might go a bit higher than that or something, but I would have thought that it is a key point to be agreed, there should be consensus on that and therefore the amendment should be supported.</p> <p>  I understand the points that Deputy Duffy made about cost rental being full cost recovery.  That is absolutely a valid point.  I agree with him when he asserted that assumably the State will step in when there is a need to fill that gap.  However, by us passing the amendment rather than assuming or hoping that the State will step in, it will mean that as a committee, we are actually looking for the State to step in if necessary.  It is also linked to arguments made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin that we do need to look at the cost of full delivery and trying to get that down.  It is an ongoing challenge.  I see heads nodding, so there seems to be agreement on that point.  I am left not understanding why we are not agreeing to the amendment.</p></speech>

As a committee, what we have done is to set the parameters and the formula for that mathematical calculation.  We have said that it is going to include full cost recovery, including the full cost of providing and maintaining the unit over the term.  We have also stated that we are going to limit the model to a 3% or 4% return so that high-yielding funds cannot come in and make a quick buck.  We have also agreed that cost rental will have a minimum of a 25% discount on market rents.  In the eight hours of debate that we had in private session, where we agreed more than 40 amendments or recommendations for this report, what we did was set the formula and the model, and that essentially is what determines the rental cost.  That is what cost rental is.  That is what we are trying to emulate across Europe.  It is right that there are other State mechanisms in place should someone need assistance.  We have also incorporated into those recommendations the provision that if people experience a reduction in their income over the term, the State will also allow them to maintain their cost rental property and they will receive State support.</p> <p>  Therefore, it is important in the context of this debate to actually state what we agreed in private session.  The sooner that those recommendations can be published in respect of what we agreed, then this debate that we are having here will not just be seen in isolation.  We have committed, as a committee, to all of the parameters of what the definition of what cost rental is.</p></speech>

I moved a similar amendment to that of Senator Moynihan, although not the same, which stated that "draft regulations concerning the pricing of rental tenancies make clear that it must be based on affordability and not market value."  I believe that Senator Fitzpatrick tabled an amendment then, and we reached a comprise that full recovery would be included over a longer term.</p> <p>  I thank Senator Moynihan because the inclusion of the figure of 30% of net income in her amendment is very important.  I thank her for tabling that amendment, because it goes to the heart of the affordability issue.  </p> <p>  It is something on which we can agree.  We have come a long way in private session in agreeing a wording on this.  We have the wording of my amendment as the basis.  I even think that the figure of 30% of net income could be excessive because we know that for many people, affordability could be anywhere between 24% and a maximum of 30% of their income.  My fear is that the maximum figure would be used as a baseline.  I support Senator Moynihan's amendment.  It goes to the heart of affordability and cost rental.  It is something on which we could agree together, perhaps if the Government parties step back from it.  We did a lot of work on this in private session.  As she said, this amendment delivers the affordability we all want.</p></speech>

Deputy Gould's amendment did not set a precise figure, hence the reason we could accept it and move forward with it.  The difficulty is that we are putting in place a precise definition that fetters the decision making and the discretion of a Minister in a context also where there are many other external moving parts outside of even the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p><p>These include initiatives such as the introduction of the living wage and the movement in that direction.  Fixing anything at 30%, in a sense, may become irrelevant very quickly in the coming years.  While the sentiment of it is there, that sentiment of affordability is already enshrined within the report on an all-party and all-committee basis.</p></speech>

The issue is the arbitrary nature of the 30%.  To take an example, a couple in my county with two children will be over the income threshold if they are earning &euro;510 per week.  If they were in local authority housing, they would be paying a rent of &euro;112 but if we apply the 30% rule, they would be paying &euro;155.  For the sake of that &euro;5 that they are over the income threshold, they would be paying over &euro;40 more.  It is not that we dispute the spirit of the proposal, it is just the arbitrary nature of that 30%.  It is dangerous to ever put a line in the sand.</p></speech>

The definition of a cost rental tenancy is quite clearly laid out in section 96 of the heads of the Bill that were sent to us.  We have also included secure tenancies, tenancies of indefinite duration, permanent affordability and adapting rents to meet people's needs if their income levels change.  I think the affordability of cost rental is well covered by the recommendations so far, and that is what is contained within the heads of the Bill.  I invite the Senator to summarise the proposal and we can then put it to a vote.</p></speech>

The 30% is not an arbitrary figure.  All the experts we had in to the committee explained that between 30% and 35% of net income is the acceptable definition of affordability when it comes to housing income.  In that sense, if we are opposing this recommendation for the Department to come up with a formula that defines affordability, we may as well rename this Bill the market discount Bill, because that is essentially what the Government side has argued.  Market discount is not necessarily affordability, and all the experts who came in to us described what that was.  This recommendation was to go to the Department to ask it to come up with a formula, and I thought that would have been a very reasonable assessment.  I am surprised the Government side is opposing it.  Fundamentally, this shows that the Government side is not concerned with affordability.  Rather, they are concerned with market discount and using market forces in order to shave a couple of euro off housing.</p> <p>  This should have been a straightforward amendment that was accepted, although I am not going to change their minds at this stage.  I would have been open to amendments such as that suggested by Deputy McAuliffe, because I think up to 35% is generally the agreed definition of affordability.  If they are willing to do that and reach a compromise, I would also be willing to move and reach a compromise.  However, I do not get the impression from the deliberate misunderstandings and the deliberate statements from the other side of the House in response to this that they are willing to reach a compromise.  It was very clearly communicated by both the ESRI and the National Economic and Social Council that it was a generally internationally recognised definition of affordability.  I think the Bill should be renamed the market discount Bill because of the response today.</p></speech>

We have to find ways of delivering homes at prices that working people can genuinely afford, both to rent and particularly to buy.  The shared equity loans scheme does not do that and, therefore, should not, in my view, be called an affordable housing scheme and should not be included in this Bill.</p><p>It is significant to note that this is the one element of this Bill that was not under consideration and development by the outgoing Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and his departmental team.  Both cost rental and the serviced sites fund had a long gestation under the last Government and, in fact, no political party advocated a serviced sites fund during the general election of last year, when we all had different propositions around how to deliver affordable purchase homes.  The origin of this proposal lies in two documents that were developed by two industry lobby groups, Property Industry Ireland and Irish Institutional Property, which came and did a round of meetings with housing spokespeople between February and May 2020, after the general election, and I was one of those spokespeople.  Both of those lobby organisations had very well developed propositions and called on the Government to introduce a shared equity loan scheme based on, and similar to, a controversial and unsuccessful scheme that operates in Britain, and which they wanted the Government to do here.</p><p>It is very clear that the proposition the Minister is developing, because he has put so much of it into the public domain, albeit through leaks and unofficially, is based on these two lobby documents.  This is the clearest example I have seen in all of my time in the Oireachtas of private industry writing the policies of Government.  Because of that, it has proven very controversial.  We heard, for example, from the ESRI that it had very significant concerns about this scheme as it is currently proposed.  We received written correspondence from the Central Bank outlining, again, very significant concerns in terms of the scheme as it understands it.  The former Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in a freedom of information request that I received has widely criticised the scheme.  They are all saying the same thing.  They are all saying this is a demand-side scheme that will push up house prices at a time of limited supply.</p><p>Our problem at the moment, particularly in the context of Covid, is that supply is even more limited.  If it was sluggish before the pandemic and the closure of, and then restrictions on, construction activity, it is even more sluggish now.  What we are proposing is to put a pot of money into a fund that will allow hard-working people, desperate to own their own home, to take out a secondary loan, and that secondary loan will be used to buy unaffordable, overpriced houses up to &euro;400,000 in Dublin and lower prices elsewhere, according to the Minister.  There will also be an interest charge and that interest charge will be set at 15-year intervals and will increase over that time.  By my calculation, on the basis of the information that is in the public domain, if people were to take the full shared equity loan of &euro;100,000 on a property of &euro;400,000 in Dublin, by year 30, if they do not pay it down, and there is no obligation on them to pay it down and the Minister has given that commitment, they will have accumulated an additional &euro;50,000 of debt on top of whatever the increased equity value of that 25% stake is.</p><p>Thus a person could actually owe not &euro;100,000, not &euro;150,000 but &euro;175,000 or &euro;200,000.  What this is doing, therefore, is saddling hard-working people with a very high level of debt.  That is why there are a great many people in Fine Gael who are deeply uncomfortable with this scheme.  All the Fine Gael councillors on Dublin City Council called for it to be scrapped because it would push up house prices.  They wrote to the Minister and urged him to transfer the &euro;75 million of finance allocated for the budget this year into the two other funds we have just been discussing, namely, the serviced sites fund and the cost rental equity loan.  We also know from some of the coverage in the newspapers that within both the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance there are real concerns, shared by the respective Ministers, about what this scheme will do.</p><p> This being the case, I do not understand how anybody who says he or she wants to help working people buy their own home could support such a scheme.  If we look at the evidence from Britain, for example, it has pushed house prices in London up by 6%.  While it has led to an increase in supply, it did so on the English-Welsh border where houses are not needed.  The most independent research into that scheme from the London School of Economics has made it very clear that this is about putting money in the pockets of developers and pushing up house prices and it is putting working people at very significant risk of mortgage default and loss of property into the future.</p><p> The last thing I will say is that Fianna F&aacute;il has done this before.  The last shared ownership scheme, which members will remember, and which was closed by Fine Gael, was modelled on something similar.  It was a shared equity product where the cost of the equity and the interest charged increased over a period of time.  That meant people who bought into that shared equity scheme at the end of the Celtic tiger experienced a doubling of their mortgage repayments if they chose to pay it down over a decade and a half.  There was four times the level of mortgage default and mortgage arrears among that cohort of borrowers, when the crash hit its depth after 2010, than there was among regular borrowers.  This, therefore, is not affordable housing, and any Deputy who supports the shared equity scheme is not doing right by hard-working people.  He or she is saddling them with debt and pushing up house prices.  I cannot stand over it and that is why the amendment would delete all the recommendations in the report related to shared equity, it would call for the shared equity loan scheme to be removed from this Bill, and it would call for the &euro;75 million to be transferred to the cost rental and serviced sites funds for genuinely affordable homes.  If the Minister, when he has finalised the scheme and the Central Bank and European Commission have given their views, wants to introduce a separate Bill, let him come and defend that but he should not title it an affordable housing Bill.</p></speech>

There is planning permission for 40,000 housing units in Dublin alone but these approved plans are not being turned into homes fast enough.  We all agree on that.  This shared equity scheme will stimulate housing delivery by stimulating building on these approved sites, and by enabling the State to take a 30% stake in new homes, it will make those homes affordable to people who want to buy.  Therefore it is going to boost supply and increase affordability.</p> <p>  The Opposition is saying we do not know enough about the scheme yet, so we should scrap it, but let us look at what we do know.  We know there is no charge on 30% for the first five years and we know that there is no onus to pay off the 30% until, or indeed if, the house is sold.  We know this will enable people to afford their own home, and that is the main difference between what the Government is proposing and what Sinn F&eacute;in is advocating for.  We want people to be able to own their own home and to sell it at market value to whoever they want.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s housing plan means people would be able to buy a home in a public housing estate if they earn a certain amount under a threshold but they cannot buy the land it is on so they could not sell it on to whoever they want.  They would have no freehold.  This Government scheme will increase supply, increase affordability and give people ownership in the true sense of the word.</p> <p>  Last year, housing supply was less than 60% of what was needed.  We all know that and we all want to increase housing supply.  This will increase supply.  We hear talk of the UK scheme, which the Government has looked at and has learned from, and that is why there are going to be regional caps in this scheme.  We know that and we got that commitment.  It is only one part of this Bill and it is only 2% of the housing budget.  We need to give it a chance.  We need to give it a chance to increase supply, to increase and introduce more affordability and to enable home ownership across Ireland.</p></speech>

The details of the scheme are not actually going to be in the legislation and we all know that.  Therefore what Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others are opposing here is the principle of the State providing financial support to people who are paying more in rent than they would on a mortgage for their own home which they would then own.  They will not be saddled with it.  Nobody is going to come with a gun, put it to their head and tell them to take out this loan.  It is an option.  It is giving people who are paying more money in rent than they would on a mortgage the opportunity to afford their own home.</p> <p>  We completely agree that this is not the definition of affordable housing.  That is why we are bringing forward legislation to deliver truly affordable housing both to purchase and to rent on public lands provided by the State via approved housing bodies and not-for-profit NGOs.  We know what affordable housing is and we will deliver affordable housing, but in the meantime we have also listened to the industry experts.  We also know there are 40,000 planning applications sitting there and the State is in a financial position to support people financially who are paying more money in rent than they would in a mortgage to own their own home.</p> <p>  For that reason we are opposing the amendment.  We want to give the Minister and the Government the power to introduce a scheme that will be calibrated and will have control mechanisms in it, as we all had recommended in this committee and which are included in the report.  This will ensure they do boost supply, that they will increase the supply of new build homes, and that they will provide finance and financial support to first-time buyers, owner-occupiers, people whose relationships have broken down and who have lost their family home, and people who desperately want to get out of the rental trap and own their own home.  I confirm to the Chairman we will not be supporting this motion.</p></speech>

On that, we have heard from the ESRI, the Central Bank and senior officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who have expressed concern that this will increase demand and prices rather than supply.  We know from the UK what happened after a similar scheme was introduced, namely, that in the more than four years since the scheme was introduced there, the share prices of the main construction companies that availed of the scheme increased by 230% over the period.  We know from looking at the price of homes availed of under this scheme that, if we take the east midlands as an example, while the average first-time buyer bought a home for &pound;157,000, homes sold under this scheme were going for an average of &pound;235,000.  In the north east of England, the average first-time buyer was buying in at &pound;109,000 whereas the average home sold under this scheme was at &pound;182,000.  Thus we know from the UK that this has pushed prices up.</p> <p>  We have a history of subsidies and tax breaks which developers have availed of and which have pushed up prices and had very serious consequences.  We also know we already have an issue with house prices in Ireland.  Prices are increasing here at the moment.  Demand is already high so we do not need a scheme to increase demand but one to increase the supply of affordable homes.  We have the second highest house prices in the EU if one looks at it in terms of square metres and we are being warned this measure is going to increase those prices again.  Therefore, I strongly urge committee members to accept this amendment.  We must call this out now and not in a couple of years when the damage has been done.</p></speech>

The Government members have been very clear that they believe this is needed.  Essentially, they are trying to treat this as a supply-side measure.  We had economists and people coming in on an expert level and I thought it was so we could use their expertise; they said this was a demand-side measure rather than a supply-side measure.</p> <p>  The thinking behind this demonstrates how much some of the developer lobbyists have captured the debate.  This will not put planning permission applications into the system because people cannot afford to buy under current construction costs.  Rather than addressing the underlying issue of the high cost of construction, this would, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said, saddle people with higher prices.  I am surprised that after all the evidence from all the outside groups, the Government still insists on continuing with the shared equity scheme without fully publishing the details and the experience in the UK.  It is reasonable to delete this from the so-called affordable housing Bill.  If required, it could return in a different measure.  This is not a supply-side scheme; it is a demand-side scheme that will push up the cost of housing and it will not release more planning permission applications into the system.</p></speech>

I have a tracker rate mortgage and I will pay 100% of the interest on that.  I would love to pay 50% of the interest due on my mortgage over its life.  I am not sure if that fact is correct but if it is 50% less interest than what I would pay, for example, it would be a very good mortgage.</p></speech>

We know other parties, groups and Independents support the removal of the shared equity scheme from the affordable housing Bill.  These are contradictory terms.  I am new to the Chamber but we have seen how insertions can be made to Bills that should not happen and this provision should not be in this Bill.  As Senator Moynihan indicated, we attended meetings where experts were brought before the committee.  I am trying to learn all the time and from our meetings I understand that this measure will not provide affordable housing.</p> <p>  The Government parties contend that this will increase supply but it will not.  It will increase prices and that will have a negative effect on affordability.  If we wanted to increase supply, we should not have driven hundreds of thousands of people from the country because we introduced austerity measures.

I have friends and family in Australia and right across the world but if the country had not introduced austerity measures, those workers would be here and we would not have such an issue with supply because we would have workers to build houses.</p> <p>  In Cork there are projects at a standstill because they do not have the workers.  How many apprenticeship schemes have been rolled out?  The Government wants to use the shared equity scheme to increase supply but we need apprentices and workers to build houses.  People, and not shared equity schemes, build these houses.</p></speech>

Deputy Higgins is wrong to suggest that under Sinn F&eacute;in's affordable housing plan, people will not own their own home.  They will.  The benefit of our plan is that home will remain permanently affordable but under the Government's plan, people will not own their own home because they will have a debt of &euro;150,000, &euro;175,000 or &euro;200,000.</p> <p>  Senator Fitzpatrick is also wrong to say this is only a small part of the Government's affordable housing plan.

There is &euro;75 million for the shared equity scheme and that will be doubled with an extra &euro;75 million from the banks.  That is &euro;150 million.  The cost rental equity loan has funding of &euro;35 million and only &euro;50 million will be spent this year on the serviced sites fund.  The Government will spend almost three times that on a provision to put money into the pockets of developers rather than delivering genuine affordable homes to rent or buy.</p> <p>  Deputy Duffy should understand that this is not meant to be a mortgage.  This is on top of the Central Bank approved mortgage of 3.5 times salary so somebody must pay a full mortgage over 30 years and still have a debt of &euro;100,000, &euro;150,000 or &euro;200,000.  That is the inequity in all this.  We have seen how the help-to-buy scheme increased house prices.  Fianna F&aacute;il extended it and it has increased house prices since.  Worse still, 60% of the people who got it did not need it.  This is not affordable housing but instead it is Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael doing what they always do in housing policy, which is putting money in the pockets of developers.  Shame on all of the Government members.</p></speech>

As a committee we set out a work programme at the start of the term.  This is our second such meeting.  The first session on sexual offences and victim testimony was very successful, and I thank the Vice Chairman for chairing it.</p><p>Today is the second module of our work programme.  It is really interesting line-up.  The purpose of the meeting is to have engagement with a number of stakeholders who have made written submissions to assist the committee in its consideration of the topic of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  Our proceedings today are divided into two sessions.  In session 1 the committee will engage with<b></b>Mr. Max Schrems and Dr. Fred Logue.  In session 2 we will engage with representatives from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties - Dr. Johnny Ryan will give a presentation - and the Data Protection Commission team.</p><p>All witnesses are appearing virtually before the committee today from locations outside of the Leinster House precinct, and they are all welcome to our meeting.  We are joined in this session by Mr. Schrems and Dr. Logue.  You are both very welcome to the deliberations today and I thank you for participating.  I do not think I have spoken to either of you directly before but I am familiar with your work.</p><p>When we begin the engagement I will ask members and witnesses to mute themselves while not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  I also ask that they use the button to raise their hands when they wish to contribute.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent or are switched off to avoid interference.</p><p>Before we take the opening statements, I want to advise members and witnesses of the following in relation to parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses and members should note there is a long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such directive if given by the Chair.</p><p>For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  It is an unavoidable part of the Covid pandemic that we are having virtual committee hearings, but unfortunately it limits the privilege witnesses can enjoy.  We are where we are in terms of the pandemic.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to any evidence they may give.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  For members who are participating remotely, I ask them to keep their devices on mute until they are asked to speak.  When speaking they should have their camera switched on and be mindful we are in public session, and when they are not speaking they should please mute themselves again.</p><p>In addition I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate in the meeting from outside of the precinct will be refused.  We know the position in terms of the interpretation of the Constitution that the Houses of the Oireachtas have directed.</p><p>I remind members and witnesses that they should respect and strictly adhere to the subject matter scheduled for discussion today.  Any deviation on this topic will rest with the Chair.  We have an agenda, a topic and have received witness statements in advance.  I ask members to confine their questions and engagement to those topics.  Unfortunately, it is not permitted to stray into wider affairs because of a variety of decisions, Standing Orders, etc.  </p><p>The provisions of Standing Orders in relation to matters which are <i>sub judice</i>place an onus on members to avoid, if at all possible, comment which might, in effect, prejudice the outcome of any legal proceedings which may be in being.</p><p>Therefore, I will not permit discussion or questioning that relates to current litigation.  I will take all that as noted by all participants.  I thank them for their attention.</p><p> The format of the meeting is that we will have two sessions with, effectively, two parties in each session.  I will invite each witness or organisation to make an opening statement to a maximum of five minutes.  Once the opening statements have been delivered, I will call on members in the order they indicate to put their questions.  We will have one round of questions and, if time permits, a second round of follow-up questions.  Unfortunately, the duration of the meeting is limited to two hours, as is the norm at the moment with the pandemic, etc., so I ask all participants to be as focused as possible in their contributions.  </p><p> With those preliminaries addressed, I am delighted to call on our guests to deliver their opening statements.  Mr. Schrems has the honour of going first.  He is very welcome.  I look forward to the engagement with him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1324" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Max Schrems" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to appear.  I particularly thank it for holding this hearing because the issue goes far beyond Ireland.  It is really a fundamental rights issue for the whole EU, given the situation that Ireland has.</p> <p>  I first engaged with the Data Protection Commission, DPC, when its office was located above a Centra supermarket in Portarlington and it was staffed by 20 employees.  That was a long time ago.  Since then there have been nine court engagements at the European Court of Justice, ECJ, over two cases.  In particular, there has been the big change involving the GDPR, which was meant to make the fundamental right to privacy enforceable and a right on which people can rely.  In that spirit, it is remarkable that the Government has allocated far more resources to the DPC.  It is now one of the best-resourced digital protection agencies in Europe, which says a lot.</p> <p>  Much of the law in this area is not new.  Much of the content of the Data Protection Act 1988 derives from a convention agreed in the 1980s.  Most of the law is the same as that contained in the 1995 directive.  As such, it is not new.  However, the big difference is that the GDPR should have brought about enforcement that does not exist just on paper, but reaches reality somehow.  </p> <p>  An interesting point is that in spite of the DPC being very well funded, it has very few results to show for that funding.  Even the submission of the DPC to this committee kind of openly acknowledged that, albeit in rather diplomatic language.  It received 10,000 complaints but handled only 4,700 of them, meaning that 53% of complaints go somewhere unknown.  Only a handful of complaints are investigated.  Most of them are referred to as being "concluded", which is a euphemism for the DPC not deciding those complaints.  It is interesting that the DPC argues that it will build momentum in 2021 and issue six or seven decisions this year.  That implies that 99.93% of all complaints will not be decided.  This fundamental right in Europe is just not reachable and actually enforceable for 99.3% of the people who rely on it.</p> <p>  In comparison, in Austria, my home country, which is not really known for big tech, the regulator issues approximately 850 decisions per year.  The Austrian regulator has a budget that is 15% of that of the DPC.  There is a lot of input into the DPC but very little output.  In Austria, 142 fines were issued, for example.  Data protection agencies in other countries have similar numbers.  The data protection agency, DPA, in Spain is very similar to the DPC in terms of budget and the like, but it has issued more than 700 decisions so far.  </p> <p>  It is interesting that the DPC states in its submission that there may be cases that, although they are of imminent relevance for the given individual, are not relevant for the wider public and that, apparently, is why some cases are not handled even though everybody has a fundamental right to privacy.  This is not just a European issue.  We have received many emails from Irish citizens who have experienced exactly these problems.  </p> <p>  A significant part of the background in this regard relates to a certain fear of law.  The DPC stated that the GDPR is principle-based, there is no fixed template how to really apply the law and that enforcement all too often gives rise to challenges.  Apparently, that is a reason not to enforce the law.  I understand that many members of the committee are lawyers.  As a lawyer, applying a rather abstract principle in the law to a given fact pattern is the daily business of law, so I was a little surprised that is, apparently, one of the big issues or, at least, it is the argument we have heard so far.  In my personal experience, there is extremely poor understanding of material and procedural law in the DPC.  Some cases have been pending for more than eight years.  The cost to the taxpayer of the case that was lost twice at the ECJ and heard before nine courts so far has been in excess of an estimated &euro;6 million.  We can see there are very few positive things coming out of the DPC.</p> <p>  I do not want to just criticise; I also wish to suggest solutions.  There is obviously the option of the DPC having three heads, rather than one as is currently the case.  The additional two positions could be filled by people who have the expertise in material law, GDPR and procedural law to enable them to solve these issues to a certain extent.  There is much uncertainty regarding procedural law.  That is partly because there is no written procedural law in Ireland, whereas in many other countries one usually has case law on which one can rely.  That could be clarified by the DPC.  It currently refuses to clarify many of these issues, even in ongoing litigation.  It is then haunted by this because the likes of Facebook rely on these uncertainties in the procedure to block cases with judicial reviews and so on.</p> <p>  Funding is another reason giving rise to a fear of litigation.  Litigation is very expensive in Ireland compared with in other member states.  That may be a reason to avoid it.  However, enforcing the GDPR partly gives rise to fines of billions of euro, which would leave a net budget surplus if the GDPR were to be enforced.  It would be interesting to see whether certain funds that would accrue in this regard would be allocated to the actual enforcement work itself.  In France, for example, the value of fines issued exceed by far the costs incurred by the DPAs.</p> <p>  Those are some of the possibilities that should be explored.  I am sure there will be further opportunities to engage on the details of these issues.</p></speech>

We will return to him with questions in a few moment.  I invite Dr. Logue to take five minutes to set out his stall.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1326" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fred Logue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#B00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members.  I am a principal solicitor with FP Logue and have a specialist information law practice, which includes data protection.  In contrast with Mr. Schrems, I am here to share my everyday dealings with data protection issues of a more routine nature.  Although they may be more everyday issues than those with which Mr. Schrems is concerned, these issues have significant importance for individuals and their daily lives and involve dealing with financial institutions, workplace surveillance, data retention, adoptees seeking their early life information, social welfare issues, access by the police, access to police records and so on.  These are issues that cover the vast swathe of our lives.  It is through this lens that we can get a good picture of how data protection is being enforced in Ireland.</p> <p>  It is worth pointing out that data protection rights are kind of radical because they create a legal relationship between a data controller and a data subject simply because the former processes the personal data of the latter.  That exists irrespective of any other legal relationship such as contract, statute or common law, for example.  It applies more or less equally regardless of whether the data controller is a public or private body.  Mere processing of personal data gives rise to a legal relationship.  That fact is missed by many data controllers.</p> <p>  The GDPR and the law enforcement directive are the primary EU law measures that give effect to that legal relationship.  They do so by imposing obligations on data controllers, giving rights to data subjects and providing enforcement mechanisms.</p><p>The DPC in Ireland has the primary responsibility for enforcement.  It is tasked with resolving disputes between data subjects and controllers.  I echo Mr. Schrems that it is tasked with doing so in every dispute; it is not a discretionary jurisdiction under EU law.  The commission has extensive powers under EU law to carry out those tasks.  </p><p> Unfortunately, my overall experience is that compliance in Ireland, particularly with access requests, is poor and that GDPR and data protection is poorly understood by the people tasked with implementing it in many organisations, public and private.  Even worse, few public authorities seem to be aware that they have a responsibility to ensure the effectiveness of EU law and they cannot hide behind Irish law which conflicts with EU law.  I believe compliance is poor because enforcement is ineffective and virtually consequence free.  The possibility, in my experience, of a DPC complaint does not appear to be something that motivates many controllers to comply with their obligations.  I echo the observation by Mr. Schrems that complaints are taking way too long, they are way too expensive in terms of money and time, there are no documented procedures and what procedures are in place are too complex and do not lead to efficient or fair complaint handling.  In fairness to the DPC, when it gets to a decision, it is not too bad, but by the time one gets there, usually the complaints procedure has failed to serve its purpose and the reasons for it have evaporated.  </p><p> The DPC could be forgiven for taking longer for more complex cross-border complaints such as that outlined by Mr. Schrems, but my experience is that the issues that have been highlighted in the presentation by the first speaker also apply, even to the most routine complaints at national level.  I also think that the procedures are not fair, particularly in light of the recent Zalewski judgment of the Supreme Court.  It is only a matter of time before that comes to court in Ireland.  I am also uncomfortable that the DPC has very informal consultations or engagements with controllers.  Often, it is involved in designing processes and products and services that it then is called on to investigate.  A recent example of this is the national smart meter programme, where it seems the DPC has been involved since 2012 in its design but now is being called on to investigate it.  We need the DPC for the rule of law and to ensure people's rights are vindicated.  The eyes of Europe, and possibly the world, are on us.  It is important that these problems are resolved in a way that gives rights their full effect in this jurisdiction.</p></speech>

In the interests of transparency, I should say that Dr. Logue, as a solicitor, is acting for me in a small legal matter.  I want to pick up on something he mentioned in his submission.  Paragraph 12 references that several cases have emerged where the data controller deleted or destroyed information after the complaint was filed.  I am conscious that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have a duty to seek out and preserve all evidence bearing on the guilt or innocence of an accused.  Does this not apply to the commission or to other judicial bodies here and is that a problem that we as a committee need to fix?</p></speech>

We have seen Germany take efforts to bring enforcement against Google without involving Dublin and, recently, Italy side-stepping Dublin in regard to TikTok.  What else is happening in Europe that we should be aware of that will likely further isolate Ireland?  I ask Mr. Schrems to give an example of where policies and procedures in a data protection controller are working very well in a European context and what is the main difference between it and us?  What are we doing wrong and what can we do better?</p></speech>

I invite Dr. Logue to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1335" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fred Logue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#C00900"><p>The Deputy is correct in regard to the deletion of personal data subject to a dispute and a subject access request.  I have seen that in at least two or three cases.  First, it is a breach of the GDPR because personal data have to be retained for as long as is necessary for the purpose.  For the purpose of a subject access request, it is necessary to retain it.  In terms of the DPC, it does not get a copy of the personal data that are being disputed.  It is asked to adjudicate on a dispute over access to information, but it does not ask for a copy of the information.  I find that unbelievable, to be honest.  Second, in one particular case I asked the DPC to use its powers to order the controller not to destroy the personal data because the controller had told us that it would destroy the personal data upon a certain event happening, which was relatively likely.  It took nine months to get the DPC to even engage with that and in the end, it would not exercise its powers.  The DPC speaks about fair procedures and it having to take time to ensure fair procedures, but fair procedures also have to be applied in regard to what the data subject is trying to achieve.  That is an important point.  There is nothing in place that, first, prevents the information being deleted, second, the commission is not taking copies of the information that is being disputed.  That needs to be looked at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1583" speakername="James Lawless" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#C01000"><p>I thank Dr. Logue and I invite Mr. Schrems to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1337" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Max Schrems" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#C01100"><p>We have the same experience with access requests.  It is impossible for DPAs to figure out what data are available unless they go on premises and take the hard drives out of computers.  Otherwise, they would never know what is stored.  That is a matter of logic.  We have seen other DPAs do that, but we have not seen the DPC do it.  For example, we have big cases in regard to Facebook, in respect of which Facebook still does not provide all the data to our understanding.</p> <p>  On the question regarding bypassing, that is definitely a big issue.  We are an organisation that does strategic litigation.  One of our biggest questions when we file a new case is how can we bypass the DPC.  There are different routes and options.  There are possibilities with class actions that are coming up in two years and there is a collective redress directive that allows GDPR class actions to be filed wherever the individual claimant is.  There is a possibility that the DPAs will no longer see the main establishments in Ireland as main establishments.  There are disputes around that.  The jurisdiction of the DPC is based on the fact that a big international company claims domain establishment in Ireland.  We saw companies, rather randomly, declaring the main establishment in Ireland for one purpose and not for another and going back and forth each year on where their main establishment is.  That is then used to dispute that there is a main establishment in Ireland in the sense of decision-making from a GDPR perspective.  That then leads to not them having an exclusive jurisdiction of the DPC.  We had a case like that in Norway, which was about Twitter to a certain extent and the issue of main establishment.  More and more DPAs are saying that they believe that a particular company in Ireland is not a main establishment; it is something else such as a subsidiary and it is not really making any decisions.</p> <p>  On e-privacy, there is now a live debate on how to reform e-privacy without the one-stop shop.  If the DPC becomes the one-stop shop for e-privacy as well, the fear is that we will have the same problem that we have in regard to GDPR and so consideration is being given to establishing a different system for e-privacy.  I personally am against that because I think it makes sense that the law is consistent and that we trust each other in the European Union, but right now that trust is hard to explain to people in Brussels.  In terms of a last bypass, increasingly there is an appetite for an infringement procedure against, in this case, the whole Republic of Ireland.</p><p>This is interesting because it is an independent body but that is how EU law works.  It would then be basically an infringement procedure against Ireland which the European Parliament, or at least a committee of it, has asked for.  It is very likely this vote will go through.</p><p> The answer which is much harder to give is as regards the countries where everything works well.  The GDPR is something that is very hard to enforce for people and it took a great deal of resources.  We saw a great deal of hiring of the good people to the private sector so the data protection agencies, DPAs,  were just brain-drained to a certain extent.  There are all of these issues.</p><p> However, we see countries where, if you look at the numbers, they are definitely more efficient.  In Austria we have a huge funding issue but you get your case decided.  They even have to decide within six months by law.  They do not always make that because they simply do not have the personnel right now but they are at least trying.  Spain is quite interesting because they have similar numbers to the Data Protection Commission, DPC - similar complaints numbers, similar budget numbers and similar staff numbers - and there are five to six decisions that are popping out of Spain daily with exactly the same GDPR that needs to be enforced as in Ireland.  We had very positive results in Norway.  The quality of the staff is very good, as is the decision quality, which is well argued and everybody understands how the decision was arrived at and what it means.  It is very likely these decisions will never be overturned because they are very solid.</p><p> In Germany certain DPAs are doing quite a good job.  Germany has 17 DPAs.  Everything is federated in Germany.  There we see it is a bit different in each state.  For example, Hamburg is usually very proactive.  Some of the decisions are, however, pulled back by the courts, which is something the DPC argues regularly, as well, especially on the European level.  It is interesting that the commissioner argues that Irish procedural law would hold her back from doing her job, while on the Irish level it is usually argued that it is GDPR, or European law, that is the big problem.  It seems on each level of debate, the other level is always guilty of the problem.  We see that in some countries the courts are very hard on the DPAs, which is very different from the situation in Ireland where the courts have allowed many decisions to stand, especially in comparison with litigation in other countries.  It is a problem in Germany that certain courts try to push back against the idea of privacy.</p></speech>

I move on to our next questioner.  Deputy Costello got first mover advantage in terms of a little bit of latitude on time, but I will have to move quickly through the questions and questioners and I ask everybody to keep it snappy because we are, unfortunately, under pressure for time, although we have had a very valuable contribution and engagement so far.  Senator Malcolm Byrne is next up.</p></speech>

I have two questions, one each for both Mr. Schrems and for Dr. Logue, on the operation of the DPC.  Mr. Schrems asked about moving from one commissioner to three here.  I certainly would favour that and I ask that he speak further to that view.  It follows Mr. Logue&rsquo;s point that one of the challenges is that the DPC gets caught up with many individual cases and does not spend a significant amount of time on its own volition inquiries.  Does Dr. Logue feel there is a better way to strike that balance between dealing with those big picture queries, such as the ones that Mr. Schrems was talking about, dealing with the Facebooks and the TikToks, and distinguishing that from the individual queries?</p> <p>  On the general point that Mr. Schrems made bout the decisions that are being made on data at a European level, and we are going to be dealing with biometrics, facial recognition, and data gathered in all sorts of other ways, to what extent do both witnesses feel policymakers, decision-makers and legislators such as ourselves understand the importance of data privacy and regulation?  If they do not feel we understand that, what should be done to address that?</p></speech>

I will return to the witnesses to answer those points.</p></speech>

Bodies like the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, handle between 5,000 and 8,000 complaints a year, and make decisions on them.  They have the same kind of budget as the DPC and have that investigatory and supervisory role as well as an adjudication role.  It can and is being done in this country.  They hold hearings around the country and have appellate jurisdictions.  Even the RTB has a telephone mediation service that deals with and closes 25% of the disputes over the phone through professional mediation.  The model is already there.</p> <p>  There should be some sort of functional separation between the quasi-judicial part and the more administrative part.  They are quite different skill sets and this should be looked at.</p> <p>  The committee should be looking at the Zalewski judgement which recently reviewed the Workplace Relations Commission's procedures.  In data protection, for example, there is no penalty for giving false evidence to the DPC, there is no cross-examination and you cannot have a hearing or test the evidence.  If someone says he or she cannot find something or he or she has looked for it, there is no way of determining whether that is a fact.  The jurisdiction needs to be kept with the DPC and not go into the courts.  They are not set up for that level of detailed adjudication on these things.  We just do not have a court system that can handle that.</p> <p>  To answer Senator Byrne, policymakers and people like our legislators have a very good grasp of privacy and data protection.  It is a testament to the members of this committee and to the wider body politic that they take a great deal of care and are very interested in ensuring Ireland retains its position as the leading jurisdiction for data protection in Europe.</p></speech>

Mr. Schrems, do you want to give a brief reply to that also?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1344" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Max Schrems" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#D00700"><p>Exactly.  On the number of heads, there are a couple of reasons for that.  One good reason is conflict of interest.  If, let us say, the brother of the current commissioner is bringing a case, who would even decide on that case because she would be inherently conflicted?  We have these situations.  That is very much connected to the advisory part which has just been mentioned.  We have cases where the DPC has advised Facebook in ten meetings how to, in my view, bypass the GDPR.  We filed a case exactly the very first day of the GDPR about that bypass only to figure out later that there were previous engagements.  We are not allowed even to see these engagements or to know what they are.  They are apparently half a State secret.  It leaves a very problematic situation.  It would not allow us to appeal any decision on the basis of that prior engagement and the independence issue.  If there are multiple heads, there could be options to separate these parts from each other and thereby ensure there is no conflict.</p> <p>  On the complaints numbers, the view of the GDPR and of European DPAs is that there is an easy access to justice if you have a complaint.  The whole idea is there is a free procedure that is easy for every average person to use to get his or her access request or whatever it is.  Obviously, free procedures in such areas draw a lot of attention from people who just submit stupid complaints and probably not the most relevant ones.  That is common across the EU.  Every DPA has that problem, but there are ways of getting rid of them.  We see numbers where probably a third, 25% or 20% of these complaints do not make it into actual handling and 99.9% of cases do not see a final decision.</p> <p>  That leads to something of a negative spiral.  The companies in their webinars and their rationale are risk-based.  They are basically thinking that if it costs &euro;1 million to comply with the GDPR but there is no realistic scenario in which they are going to get a penalty, then it makes business sense that they do not really comply with GDPR.  If I know the regulator is doing that regularly, it ends up in a negative spiral where there is less compliance and more complaints which lead to an even greater clogging up of the system.  This is a bit like the situation where if we are on the street and we all feel that there is terror all over the place, clearing the street is very hard.  Once that situation arises, if when someone oversteps the law the police are always there and present, people then usually self-police and comply with the law from the get-go, which does not require any complaints or DPAs, and so on.</p> <p>  One country where that worked quite well is France.  There are hefty fines that are meant to be seen as dangerous.</p><p>In France, for example, it was decided that websites have to display cookie banners that actually state "Yes" or "No" and not "Yes" or an endless maze of options.  Once the data protection authority there announced that, we saw in our statistics that we were running that most of the cookie banners in France were suddenly compliant with the law.  It did not really need complaints and it did not need enforcement.  It just needed a credible threat of enforcement and that is how law works in general.  That is how we work in most other areas.</p></speech>

Is the rationale for the call for three data protection commissioners connected to a conflict that may exist in having just one DPC or are there other specific governance and procedural improvements that would stem from having three DPCs?</p> <p>  My questions for Dr. Logue concern the functional separation between the administrative support functions of the DPC and the quasi-judicial functions.  He mentioned the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  Do we need two distinct public bodies to carry out these two separate functions adequately?  He mentioned that the RTB and other organisations carry out these functions effectively.  I ask him to say a bit more on that aspect.  It was good of him to mention the functions of the RTB for comparative purposes.  In terms of the type of cases to be dealt with, would there be much difference in trying to create that within the commission?</p></speech>

Quite honestly, if I ran my NGO the way that the DPC is run then I would probably be fired by my board but the DPC is independent so that is not an option.  An option would be to add more people and that would act as a counterbalance, which, from my perspective, is the more important part.  There are benefits, like these independence issues, that come with the addition of more management personnel.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fred Logue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#E00700"><p>I think there should be just one DPC.  The benefit of expanding the commissioner level is because of the different skill sets.  One needs either a very experienced lawyer or somebody with judicial experience to get the quasi-judicial side, at least, back on track.  The procedure is not proper quasi-judicial procedure.  There are no hearings, no evidence on oath and no engagement between the parties.  It is very protracted paper-based decision-making.</p> <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, holds 20 hearings a day and deals with a raft of employment and equality legislation.  The WRC has much more coverage than the DPC yet it can manage to do this.  The DPC has talked about amicable resolution.  I have never figured out what that is, apart from the DPC telling people to ask a second time for the stuff they have already been told they cannot get.  The RTB says it gets rid of a quarter of its cases based on telephone mediation conducted by professional mediators.  The RTB and WRC are not exactly the same thing, but those two bodies are proof that the concept works.  Given that the DPC is supposed to have expertise in data protection law, it grates when one hears the DPC say that data protection is very complex.  It does not give us confidence that our regulator and adjudicator is fit for purpose when it thinks data protection is complex.  It is not that complex, in my view.  It is complex because the scales might be tipped back in favour of ordinary people.  That is not complexity.  It might upset powerful interests, particularly within the State or big business, but that is what the GDPR and the regulator are supposed to do.</p></speech>

He has more or less answered my question with what he said about there being an emphasis on mediation, cases being decided within six months, and having five or six decisions made in six months like in Austria and Spain.  Is there anything else in either of those countries, or in Norway, which we could use to have more of an enforcement situation rather than negotiation or an informal engagement?</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for Dr. Logue.  What is his view on the increasing use of trackers on the cars of employees by telecoms organisations, for example?  Does he think that police records and the PULSE system are adequately controlled?</p> <p>  In terms of local issues, particularly in County Kerry and I will not mention anything about the courthouse, there are GDPR concerns about litter.  For example, in rural areas on private lands there are well known littering, dumping and fly-tipping areas.  Following decisions made in Dublin about public spaces - it was suggested that it did not comply with GDPR - councils have declined to put cameras on private land which could be monitored by individual landowners in association with councils.  Does Dr. Logue believe one can monitor fly-tipping areas in compliance with GDPR requirements?</p> <p>  Over the years the planning officers of county councils would give a briefing and discuss three or four planning applications, which may or may not be of concern to councillors.  That practice was ended due to GDPR concerns.  Does Dr. Logue believe the practice could be reintroduced to have a discussion and get the views of local authority members?</p></speech>

A number of local authorities use GDPR in a sense that, maybe, was not envisaged.  I would say that section 40 of the Data Protection Act 2018 enables public representatives to engage in certain ways with local authorities but local authorities have not interpreted the legislation in that way.  I am interested in hearing the opinion of Dr. Logue on that as he is a local expert on this matter.  Did the Deputy address his questions to either witness or both witnesses?</p></speech>

I made an access request and did not get an answer.  There is not much legal knowledge needed to decide such a case.  Most data protection authorities work with a digital system here, as far as I am aware, so there is a case management system that escalates stuff the right way.  Usually, for example, in Austria we work with textblocks on that because these decisions are all the same and one saves time for important stuff by getting quick decisions, although they are of high quality because these textblocks are reviewed by lawyers.</p><p>Everybody knows that they are accurate and that the courts have upheld them, so they are reused over and over again.  That is how hundreds of decisions can be produced with very little need for oversight.  There is very little need for later litigation if the quality is good at the beginning.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1359" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fred Logue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#F00300"><p>The good news is that two answers cover all of the questions.  The GDPR has become the new health and safety or insurance.  It has become an excuse for not doing things we do not really want to do.  There is absolutely no reason a planner cannot discuss a planning file with a public representative, regardless of section 40.  It is just a normal thing.  Advocate General Bobek has made an observation about using the GDPR to obstruct the protection of personal data rather than for its protection.  That is just a symptom of poor compliance, particularly in the case of public bodies.  As more disputes arise and as more sanctions are imposed, that should improve.</p> <p>  The second thing is a list of things that can or cannot be done.  Under the GDPR, one can do most things but one has to have certain things in place.  There has to be a legal basis.  That is fundamental to the data protection regime.  If one processes personal data, one must either have the consent of the data subject or it must be necessary for some purpose listed in the GDPR.  It can be necessary to fulfil a legal obligation.  For example, with regard to the enforcement of compliance with litter or waste legislation with CCTV, as long as the legislation in place meets the standards of EU law and the GDPR, this is allowed in principle.  What happens, however, is that we do not put such legislation in place or that the legislation which is in place is deficient.  Bodies, reacting to public pressure because CCTV is popular, then try to work around the legislation or try to shoehorn provisions into legislation which is not fit for purpose.  The problem could easily be solved if we just had proper legislation.  The legislation has to ensure a proper legal basis for the action and provide for safeguards against abuse.  At the other end, there also has to be good compliance with data subject rights.  For example, if I want to know if I have been captured on CCTV, I must be told.  Notices must be in place.  Employers who are tracking their employees must tell those employees and there must be a legal basis for doing so.</p> <p>  To answer the first three of the Deputy's questions, if we just implement the GDPR in the way it was designed to be implemented, none of those things would be disallowed in principle and we would find out which ones are disallowed through the legislative process.</p></speech>

Before I bring in the next speaker, for the information of members I will mention that Deputy Pringle and Deputy Creed are the final two speakers I have noted for this first round.  May I ask Dr. Logue a supplementary follow-up question?  He mentioned the need for better legislation.  Is he suggesting that the Data Protection Act 2018 should be extended or amended or is he suggesting legislation to deal with ancillary scenarios or how the GDPR is to be implemented in various sectors or contexts?  Is he suggesting a code of conduct?  I believe codes of conduct already exist for certain sectors.  Is he suggesting that legislation in which the GDPR is featured should become part of other sector-specific legislation?  What exactly is he suggesting?  Will he finish on that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1361" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fred Logue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#F00500"><p>In principle, it can be both.  If powers exist to make regulations which facilitate data processing, this can be done under the 2018 Act.  Things like CCTV will probably need their own sectoral legislation.  The use of CCTV is pretty limited at the moment under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and this does not really work for the enforcement of legislation regarding traffic or litter.  It was really meant only to allow for An Garda to carry out public order investigations.  When passing legislation for sectors, the procedure does not involve checking to see whether specific data processing provisions are required.  I am not sure how it works, but it would be beneficial if a recommendation was made to build into parliamentary procedures a requirement to check at an early stage whether such provisions should be included rather than finding out when something goes wrong after the legislation has been passed.</p></speech>

I believe, in some cases, there is conflict between laws, including some of the legislation to which Dr. Logue alluded.  I suppose that is part of the tapestry.</p></speech>

If the police implement those correctly, and if there is enforcement and supervision in that regard, in principle there should not be a problem.</p></speech>

I have two quick questions, which are directed to both witnesses.  In the figures provided to us by the Data Protection Commission, there seems to be a discrepancy in the definitions of "concluded" and "resolved" with regard to the status of cases.  What is the witnesses' understanding of those two terms as they relate to cases taken up by the DPC?</p> <p>  It was said that there is a very significant backlog of cases.  It seems to me that court proceedings may be required to clarify certain issues.  Would that have the effect of resolving a lot of cases in one go?  I am sure repeat cases would come up and that a court decision would influence whether they moved forward.  Would such proceedings clarify a lot of issues?  Would they streamline some of the work that needs to be done?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Max Schrems" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#F01100"><p>I am mindful of time.  The term "resolved" is also one of my biggest questions in life.  There seems to be a sort of Bermuda triangle somewhere.  We have heard from people involved in cases that the DPC no longer comes back to them but rather says that it will not investigate the matter further.  We have seen random answers in emails or have been told about them.  If one looks at the numbers, these are the cases that must be categorised as resolved.  That is my understanding of the terminology.  There is a problem there.</p> <p>  With regard to the clarifications, I am mindful of how long the courts can take.  I have been involved in litigation for eight years now.  Court proceedings are probably not the easiest way in which to clarify matters.  There are certain parts of the Irish Data Protection Acts that could be clarified such as procedural issues with regard to the steps involved and how long things can take.  There could be options there.  It is common in other jurisdictions for these things to be clarified in the legislation.</p> <p>  The other option is for the DPC to have a multi-stakeholder hearing and to clarify its procedures itself.  There is some beauty to that idea because the commission knows what it is doing procedurally, at least with regard to the steps involved.  There are publications which say there are 12 steps to the procedure and others which say there are six.  Now there is litigation in which the commission has said that it is a one-step procedure.  That is exactly what Facebook used in its judicial review as regards the DPC.  It said that it did not even know what the procedure is, so it is all unfair.  Unless that is clarified in that way, it may be quicker to clarify it in law or in instruments issued by the DPC itself rather than by putting it to the courts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1368" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fred Logue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#F01200"><p>If complaints take three years rather than three months, there will automatically be 12 times more complaints on the books.  One sometimes gets an email out of the blue after a year saying that one's complaint will be closed automatically if the commission does not hear from one within 14 days.  Nobody knows what "resolved" or "concluded" means.  With regard to these administrative things, if something changes or something new comes in, litigation occurs which clarifies the matter and it settles down after a while.  There has been litigation with regard to the Residential Tenancies Board, the Workplace Relations Commission, the Information Commissioner and a whole load of such decision makers, but things just settle down and, ultimately, there is very little litigation because people know where they stand legally.  By blocking that, we are just prolonging the length of time it takes for things to settle down.  We should just let it go.  We should make decisions and have them reviewed and then, in a year or two, it will start running a bit more smoothly.</p></speech>

Their opening remarks and the replies to questions to date have been peppered with reference to big data, big business, big tech and big brother.  My questions are borne out of constituency experience.  Unfortunately, there are not many big tech or big data companies in my constituency.  However, we have many public-facing small businesses.  I want to ask a critical question.  Is our core legislation fit for purpose?  I am asking the question because the European Commission report from 2020 stated that compliance costs were a bigger issue for small and medium-sized enterprises.  At the same time, the Commission gave no comfort to those enterprises in recommending any difference in approach.</p> <p>  The witnesses in their references talked about data controllers.  What if a person is the chief cook and bottle washer of the local hospitality industry, small medical practice or small retail enterprise?  When these people get correspondence from the much-maligned Data Protection Commissioner, it puts the fear of God into them.  They do not have an in-house solicitor to which to refer the complaint.  I imagine these people take no comfort whatsoever in the submission from Dr. Logue, especially where he says he believes that more use has to be made of fines and compensation as a matter of routine.  I am not saying all these aforementioned SMEs are compliant, but in most cases they attempt to be and they may be non-compliant by default.  From my experience many of the complaints are vexatious.  There may be people who want to be part of the compensation culture that Dr. Logue seems to be promoting in his submission.  He seems to suggest people should be compensated.  Section 109(2) of the 2018 Act refers to proposals for amicable solution.  A small business may get a letter calling for a proposal for an amicable solution.  They may be informed that if that does not materialise the case will move up a step in terms of how the Data Protection Commissioner will deal with it.  That is a threatening procedure to a small business.</p> <p>  This goes back to my question.  Is the legislation fit for purpose?  It seems it fails to differentiate between small entities and what appears to be the primary focus of the concerns of the witnesses, which relate to big data, privacy, big tech and big brother.  Yet, many small businesses are caught up in all of this.  They may wish to be compliant but the cost of compliance is in many respects beyond their resources.  I have seen examples of where this is graphically brought home by the correspondence they receive from the Data Protection Commissioner.  I believe they are easy prey.  They will be unable to take their case to the High Court, the Supreme Court or the Court of Justice of the European Union for comfort.  They will be shivering in their boots while they are anxious to be compliant but bearing the costs disproportionately.</p></speech>

It was a really interesting question and somewhat different to the flavour so far.  That is an interesting angle and a good contribution.  I will call on Mr. Schrems and then Mr. Logue to wrap up this session.  What do you say to that, Mr. Schrems?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1372" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Max Schrems" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#G00400"><p>I will try to be as short as possible.  My answer will probably surprise the committee.  I feel the same.  That is one fundamental problem of the GDPR.  It does not differentiate exactly.  I come from a family in which my mother has a small business and I am now running a NGO with 15 people.  We have the same red tape issues as many SMEs.  This came, however, from the lobbying of industry.  The industry wanted a one size fits all law that does not differentiate to a certain extent.  It came especially from the conservative side in the European Parliament.  I advocated at the time for the need to differentiate.  Big tech companies, in particular, wanted to have a one size fits all law because it means they will be under the same law as a local business.  The hope was that the bar would go down for them but the bar is now too high for a smaller business.</p> <p>  The way to solve it is basically how most data processing agreements deal with it.  There is amicable resolution in most countries of which I am aware.  This usually means when a company gets an angry letter from the Data Protection Commission and the company complies and answers the access request, then the case is simply ended with a notice and warning.  That is it.  Oftentimes we have fines of &euro;500, &euro;200 and so on.  That is reasonable in these situations.  With a small SME I have a right to get a copy of my data, so I do not think there is much of a difference.  It can be done in enforcement and can be applied.  The GDPR foresees this to be reasonable under Article 83, if I am not mistaken.</p></speech>

I ensure that does not happen simply by being compliant.  Fines are not my idea.  The European legislature has put in fines that are persuasive and effective.  I wish to point out as well that in Ireland we have lower fines for public bodies than private bodies.  That was a decision of the Oireachtas.  Perhaps members should be talking to their colleagues in the Oireachtas about why they have gone soft on public bodies relative to private bodies.</p> <p>  At the end of the day, we need legal certainty.  If we have legal certainty, then we can easily comply.  We need strong enforcement so that the people who do not want to comply are not undercutting the people who do invest in compliance.  At the end of the day we are talking about protecting individual people and their rights.</p> <p>  I did not talk about big tech in my submission.  My opening statement referred to basic everyday rights relating to employment interaction, police surveillance and adoption.  There was nothing about big tech.  All my clients are ordinary individuals who have been wronged by public and private sector bodies.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses to our meeting.  I will give them a moment to take up their positions.  I see Dr. Ryan and Ms Dixon.  They are both very welcome to the session.  I believe Ms Morgan is also joining us from the Data Protection Commission, DPC.  I see her smiling in the corner.  I thank all three witnesses for their attendance and participation in this session.  I look forward to the engagement.  I remind the witnesses to unmute their devices when they are speaking to the committee and when they are not contributing they should mute themselves.We have established that everyone can hear me.  I will leave the housekeeping at that.  We are all used to it at this stage.</p><p>This is session 2 of our meeting, which is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders who have made a written submission to assist the committee in its consideration of the general data protection regulation.  Before the opening statements are taken I will give some quick advices on parliamentary privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely, outside the Leinster House campus, which is the case with the three witnesses in this session - all the witnesses today are remote - there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  There we are, the pandemic has us meeting remotely, but at least we can meet.  The witnesses should be mindful that the privilege does not extend to the same degree as it would ordinarily.</p><p>Members are advised of the same.  Rather than read the long version of the caution to members, I will take it as read, because I know they have been to several meetings at this stage and they are aware of the rules on privilege and parliamentary procedure and good practice.  I remind members to avoid commentary on any matters relating to current proceedings which are <i>sub judice</i>, as that might prejudice the outcomes.</p><p>The format of the meeting is that I will invite each organisation to make an opening statement of a maximum of five minutes.  Once the opening statements have been delivered I will then call on the members of the committee in the order that they indicate.  There will be one round of questions at any rate and we will see how we get on before I talk about supplementary questions.  I will call on the speakers in the following order: Dr. Ryan and then Ms Dixon.  They have five minutes each.  If Ms Dixon wishes to share time with her colleague, she is welcome to do so, or she may wish to take all the time and her colleague can respond to questions as they are asked.  It is her prerogative.  I will go to Dr. Ryan without further ado.  We are mindful of time as we are, unfortunately, subject to a strict timeline because of the pandemic.  We have a two-hour cap on the time for meetings.  Dr. Ryan is very welcome to this forum.  We are delighted to have him with us.  I look forward to hearing what he has to say.  He has five minutes to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1380" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Johnny Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#H00200"><p>It is a pleasure to join the committee today.  I represent the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, Ireland's oldest independent human rights body.  We have worked on data protection for decades.  Until recently, I was a senior executive for a Silicon Valley tech firm, where I worked with the inventor of JavaScript.<br/><br/>The GDPR gave the DPC powers to proactively investigate the misuse of data about us, and stop the misuse.  It can &quot;obtain access to any premises&quot; and compel evidence.  It can even force the biggest companies in the world to change what they do with our data.  Although we all know there is a privacy crisis, the DPC does not appear to be using these powers to protect us.  Three years ago, I blew the whistle to the DPC about real-time bidding, RTB.  It is the largest data breach ever recorded.  It allows data brokers to build illegal dossiers about us based on the private things we do online.  This exposes us to manipulation and enables foreign interference in our elections.  The crisis is so acute that one of my evidence bundles to the DPC featured on the front page of the <i>Financial Times</i>, and it was not a quiet day.  Despite this, three years on, this week the DPC told me it has not even completed a &quot;statement of issues&quot; of what it should investigate.  I want the committee to consider this sobering statistic: in the three years since the GDPR was applied, the Data Protection Commission has asserted its lead role in 196 cases, but delivered decisions, even draft decisions, in only four.  In other words, the DPC has failed to resolve 98% of cases that are important enough to be of EU-wide concern.  That means Ireland is the bottleneck of GDPR investigation of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple, everywhere in the EU.<br/><br/>We at ICCL have warned the Government that the DPC's failure to uphold the rights of 450 million Europeans creates strategic economic and reputational risks for Ireland.  Although this is a small and peripheral country, the GDPR gave Ireland the chance to become the key location for digital regulation.  That will not happen if the DPC continues to draw criticism from the European Court of Justice, the European Parliament, the authorities of Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, and Hungary.  That is documented.  Even last week, at a US event that I was speaking at, the CEO of the UK Competition and Markets Authority was also critical of it.  This is a chorus of criticism.  DPC inaction has forced other EU member states to sidestep Ireland on GDPR enforcement.  If this continues, we will lose our relevance as a regulatory centre.  It also jeopardises a new European Commission proposal that Ireland should become the super regulator for more key parts of the digital economy.  I refer here to the new artificial intelligence package and the proposal on online content, the Digital Services Act.<br/><br/>The consequences of the DPC's problems are not limited to Europe.  As members are probably aware, in the United States, two weeks ago Senator Ron Wyden introduced an important draft Bill to designate jurisdictions with inadequate data protection enforcement.  We know from the drafters of the Bill that it intentionally targets the DPC's enforcement failure.  If Ireland is so designated because of the DPC's problems, then every significant company here will be prevented from processing data of customers in the United States until they obtain an export licence from the US Department of Commerce.  That will be hard because the same restrictions that will potentially be applied to US data are the ones that are currently applied to nuclear material.  That would devastate the digital sector.  The Government must ensure that Ireland meets its GDPR obligations.  We at ICCL propose two urgent steps.  First, like Max Schrems, we suggest the appointment of two new commissioners, as provided for in the 2018 Data Protection Act, and that the Minister should use her power to designate a chair of the commission.  The second is to establish an independent review of how to reform the DPC.</p><p>Its problems may be due to more than just a lack of investment.  The ICCL revealed a few months ago that a major reform inside the DPC is chronically delayed, five years after being announced and having cost the taxpayer more than &euro;1 million so far.</p><p> I urge all members of this committee to call on the Government to rebuild our DPC to protect us in the data age.  We must restore Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a regulatory leader.  This is a once-in-a-generation moment of opportunity, like that taken by Frank Aiken in leading the world on nuclear non-proliferation in the middle of the last century.  We must not squander that opportunity.  I thank the committee.  </p></speech>

Ms Dixon is next to give evidence.  I am aware that the spotlight has been on her office for most of this session and, indeed, the last.  We want to work with her and hear what she has to say.  She will have the opportunity to respond.  She should set out her own stall.  This is a solution-based exercise.  Ms Dixon has the floor and is welcome to tell us what the solution might be.  She is welcome to the meeting and I thank her for giving of her time.  We look forward to hearing what she has to say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1383" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Dixon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#J00300"><p>On behalf of the DPC, I thank the committee for this opportunity to engage with it and contribute to its review of certain aspects of the GDPR.  The review comes at an important juncture in what are still the comparatively early implementation stages of this new legal framework.  There is nobody in the EU who has not been touched by the GDPR.  Many people are impacted professionally, in work contexts, and as individuals in terms of how it is applied in the processing of their personal data.  For all legislators and the DPC, as a specialist regulatory body, there is an additional dimension to our relationship with the GDPR.</p> <p>  The aims of the GDPR are to ensure that the fundamental right of everyone to have their data protected is upheld, that processing of personal data serves society, that data protection is not held out as an absolute right but is considered in relation to its function in society and balanced against other fundamental rights, and that the law is implemented in a uniform way across the EU.  </p> <p>  In our dialogue this evening, we may, depending on time and questions raised, end up talking about everything from CCTV and children&rsquo;s data to pseudonymisation and much more.  A law that applies to the processing of personal data applies in almost endless contexts and scenarios, which, by default, means the DPC&rsquo;s regulatory range is equally boundless.  </p> <p>  That range of contexts and scenarios reflects itself in constant high volumes of inbound work to the Irish DPC.  Last year alone, we had more than 10,000 cases.  Some 60% of the complaints lodged with the DPC last year were concluded in the same calendar year.  We also handled 42 applications for the approval of binding corporate rules, dealt with more than 6,000 security breach notifications and progressed 87 full-scale statutory inquiries.</p> <p>  Given that everyone has a perspective on the GDPR in light of the myriad ways in which all of us interact with and experience it, it is reasonable to expect that there are equally numerous perceptions of the GDPR&rsquo;s relative progress since its implementation.  With the previously referenced range of contexts to which the GDPR applies, it naturally follows that its advantages and improvements are felt differently by different stakeholders.  This is why it is far too simplistic to review the GDPR at this stage in terms of straightforward success or failure, and the committee is right to consider instead the headway that is being made to administer this principles-based regulation proportionately across all of these varied contexts.  The GDPR does not spell out sector-specific infractions in the way that other legislation might.  Since the regime is principles based, every potential infringement has to be examined and evaluated on its own merits.  No two cases are the same.  At this point, a little under three years into the application of the regulation, there is as yet little established case law to guide these evaluations.  Thus, each review requires first-principles analysis.</p> <p>  The DPC has a particular role under the GDPR in terms of being the lead supervisory authority for the many Internet and technology companies with European headquarters in Ireland.  The complexities of the decision-making involved in the one-stop shop, which multinational corporations may avail of under the GDPR, mean that the pace of delivery is not solely within the domain of the DPC.  We recognise that collective momentum in this area must increase but equally highlight the structural constraints of the co-decision-making processes provided for in Chapter VII of the GDPR.  </p> <p>  A consistent and comprehensive approach to measuring the outcomes and comparative effectiveness of regulation and enforcement by EU data protection authorities under the GDPR is not yet in place.  In that vacuum, opinions abound and criticism is constant.  Informed criticism must be embraced, of course, not feared, because it drives improvement and contributes in a very tangible way to the delivery of better outcomes.  As such, I welcome the committee&rsquo;s engagement with the issues at hand and its initiation of a dialogue in which we identify what is working well and what is not.  Where things are not working well, we examine ways to improve them.</p> <p>  The committee will have seen from the written submissions of certain of the witnesses that issues relating to the enforcement of the regulation by my office have attracted, and continue to attract, particular and trenchant criticism, much of it directed to the idea that, as an emanation of the Irish State, the DPC is deliberately refusing to regulate, or has deliberately been constituted so as to be incapable of regulating, certain multinational companies operating within Ireland, for the same kinds of reasons as those said to explain Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the taxation of Apple and other such companies.  One contributor expresses concern that poor performance on the part of the DPC presents a significant economic and reputational risk for Ireland.  Both call in aid observations said to have been made by regulatory and political commentators across Europe and beyond, none of them favourable.</p> <p>  These are extremely serious charges for my office and for the Government and, in light of certain of the charges, for the State as a whole.  For the part of the DPC, I reject the charges made and the unfounded bases on which they are made.</p> <p>  Against this sort of challenging backdrop, I hope, through a dialogue with this committee, that some of the noise can be dialled down and that some meaningful insights may be gained into the assessment of the GDPR in practice and the performance of my office as a statutory regulator.  I accept that, given the range of issues to be considered and the complexity of at least some of them, we will not achieve all of that this evening, but I look forward to making a solid start and wish to assure the committee of my commitment to ongoing engagement between us on these issues and such others as the committee regards as being important, and as its workload allows.</p></speech>

I will lead  with two questions and then go around the room to facilitate the members.  We will try to be short and sweet in our questions in this round.  The witnesses will have the same time as the previous witnesses but the members may have to be speedier.</p> <p>  I have a big-picture question and a practical question for Ms Dixon.  The first deals with the elephant in the room, which she deals with herself in her submission, namely, the threats from abroad to data protection in Ireland and the threat it is said these pose to our economic strategy and attractiveness as a digital hub for many companies.  The concern, which I have expressed at meetings of this committee, is that if other member states and other regulatory fora begin parallel and competing processes of regulation, as has been evidenced by witnesses at the previous session and as has been testified in the European Parliament, various courts around Europe and various other parliaments, and if these processes of regulation grow legs and become practice, it will threaten our attractiveness as a one-stop shop.  It is not a conversation we are starting; the conversation is already under way and we are joining it at this meeting this evening.  It is important that we tackle it.  I share Ms Dixon's view that there is a serious concern for the Government and the State as a whole.  I hope we can work together to tackle it.  It is very much a live concern.  How does the DPC respond to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1385" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Dixon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#J00500"><p>I thank the Chairman.  Let me say at the outset, in case I do not get to say it later, that there is no question but that the DPC recognises that improvements have to be made.  In particular, we take the points made earlier about processes and the need to streamline them.  We have already engaged in trying to make the processes more streamlined for all stakeholders.  We accept the points arising, in part, from the processes in respect of delay, and all of us want to speed up.</p><p>However, the difficulty, and I will respond to the specific question, for the DPC is that clearly as a regulator, we are uniquely surrounded by an enormous range of stakeholders.  We handle the complaints of thousands of data subjects but, equally, potentially handle the complaints of millions of EU data subjects.  We regulate hundreds of thousands of entities - public and private sector, Internet, big tech and voluntary - and in some cases, individuals in terms of their data processing.  We recognise the oversight of this Oireachtas.  Equally, there is the European Parliament.  There are 37 EU data protection authorities, if we count in the regional data protection authorities and so on, so we are at the centre of a very large range of stakeholders, each with their own expectations.<br/><br/>The problem, some of which we have seen this evening, is that it seems very easy for those who are determined to criticise the DPC and fail to recognise what is being achieved - I am not sure anyone reads our annual report because I have not heard any of it reflected in what is being discussed - to rely on very sensationalist statements that, unfortunately, are based on complete inaccuracies.  We have heard about Bermuda triangles, things being Kafkaesque and so on.  They are great headline generators but the reality is far removed from them.<br/><br/>The Chairman asked me a question about criticism from abroad, including Europe.  While we respect the European Parliament in terms of its oversight role, it is well documented in the correspondence I have published how the European Parliament's Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, LIBE, Committee conducted itself and failed to engage with the DPC in coming to the views it expressed in resolutions.  I remind the committee that the European Parliament is a step removed from what this Parliament would be in terms of looking at what a national data protection authority would do.  There is a particular onus on it to ensure its information is accurate, which did not occur.  Let us put the criticisms from other EU data protection authorities in context.  If we go back and look at the original proposal from the European Commission for a new regulation in 2012, we can see that the same data protection authorities that are criticising Ireland and the one-stop-shop were on record as rejecting the concept of the one-stop-shop and any role for the Commission in encroaching on regulatory roles that were the purview of national data protection authorities prior to that so it is no surprise there is a political element to the criticisms being made.<br/><br/>The Chairman raised the issue of parallel processes.  The Chairman said that this was evidenced from some of the witnesses but, in fact, there is no evidence to support this in the way that has been suggested.  One of the witnesses has called an aid a completely erroneous interpretation of the opinion of the Advocate General of the Court of Justice of the European Union from January of this year in a case called Facebook <i>v.</i>Belgium Privacy Commission.  Advocate General Bobek did not criticise the Irish DPC or call it out for regulatory inertia.  In fact, the Advocate General said that the GDPR, and its implementation and enforcement, is in its infancy and criticised those who were seeking to undermine it with speculation regarding under-enforcement of the GDPR.  The references to that opinion are completely erroneous and do not give any indication that there is a sidestepping of the DPC.<br/><br/>Other issues that have been raised have been around the Italian regulator's urgency procedure in the case of TikTok.  Again, this is not a case of sidestepping the Irish DPC.  There has been engagement with the Italian regulator on this case, which relates to harmful content.  It relates to a regulatory remit that the Italian regulator has that is not within the remit of the Irish DPC.  I could go on but I realise the Chairman wants to let other people in to answer questions.  There are layers of detail to all of these issues.  A superficial skimming of the surface in terms of all of these criticisms, and I realise we will not have time to get into all of them this evening, is dangerous.  It is very hard to get to the point where we can have a reasonable conversation, which the DPC is fully open to, where we can look critically at how to measure the effectiveness of regulation under the GDPR and eliminate this type of exaggeration we are hearing.</p></speech>

I have heard of methods, resources and technologies that could be used.  In her presentation, the commissioner spoke about a principle-based approach and said that every case is unique.  Might there be an opportunity to fast-track some of the more minor cases or more repetitive type of requests?  Must there be human input in all cases?  Could we have a rules engine?  There is technology like TIBCO and Fair Isaac.  There may be workflow software.</p> <p>  It is a slightly different point but working as a data protection lawyer at the time, pre-GDPR, there was a case file on the DPC website a couple of years ago.  It was a case study hub.  There was a distillation of principles, in the way common law does in other areas of law, so that the wheel was not always being reinvented.  I am not saying the DPC does reinvent the wheel every time.  To what extent is there an opportunity even for a preliminary opinion to be delivered by a process of codification?  I think one of the statements said that the volume of cases dealt with last year was 10,000 and I think the commissioner alluded to more.  What level of technology can be employed?  Could there be some degree of codification with the right to review, etc., for those who want it to be escalated?  I saw it myself under the pre-GDPR regime, although I appreciate the current regime is slightly different.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1388" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Dixon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#K00300"><p>It is interesting that the Chairman referenced the case studies because they are a particularly useful way to communicate with lots of controllers who are looking to understand how to comply.  In our annual report this year, we published a range of new case studies.  In addition to the case studies on our website, the Chairman might have seen that we have published all of the decisions we made under the 2018 Act, including the eight decisions so far in respect of which we have imposed fines.  Regarding those cases, we are getting feedback from stakeholders that they find it particularly useful.</p> <p>  There has been significant conflation of the issues of complaint handling and enforcement.  If one looks under the GDPR, one can see that complaint handling is a separate function and the only obligation on the DPC now is to handle a complaint to the extent appropriate.  They are not necessarily the same thing.  When I was referencing the fact that no two cases are the same, what I was really reflecting is that around those larger-scale enforcement cases, we are really having to go back to first principles.  I think everyone on the committee knows that the most frequent complaint type the DPC receives year in, year out is a complaint about the exercise of the right of access.  Each year, it represents at least 30% of the complaints we receive.  It is probably the most important right that individuals seek to access.  I am interested in the Chairman's ideas regarding ways to make it faster because we wish we could do so.  In every case where an access request is made that a company refuses, or the individual perceives he or she has not received all the data, we cannot see any fast-track route to resolving that other than engaging in often iterative contact with the controller to ensure the data is finally released.  It is worth thinking about and we would really like to talk about it further with the committee.  It is not particularly obvious how technology could assist.</p></speech>

I notice in the Data Protection Commission's annual report 2020 is referred to as being a platform or a stage for moving forward.  I also acknowledge what the commissioner said today and I welcome that she said data protection is not an absolute right.  Very often it is used by officialdom to stymie matters rather than to allow them to proceed.  I welcome that attitude towards it.</p><p> I wish to ask Ms Dixon about the compilation of databases and whether it is legitimate for any organisation to take a number of publicly available and legitimate databases and consolidate them to create a super database that may be used to extrapolate other information from it.  What rights are afforded to individuals to know essentially whether they are on that database, what information it has about them, what information it has extrapolated about them and what remedies are available to them in obtaining that information or any predictive scores or trends that might have been identified?</p></speech>

In a hypothetical scenario, it is difficult to imagine what legal basis any data controller would have to create a centralised database from varied sources without the knowledge of data subjects.  The first question to be asked is what is the legal basis for the creation of the database - the procuring of it from other sources.  Under Article 14 of the GDPR, if a data controller obtains data indirectly, not directly from the data subject, the data controller has an obligation as soon as possible thereafter to inform the data subject.  Typically, that would be an obligation on the data controller.</p> <p>  Fred Logue Associates earlier also referenced Advocate General Bobek from a Rigas case from the Court of Justice of the European Union from 2016.  That is a case where in his opinion the Advocate General said it was these data sets that were of primary importance and the primary purpose of data protection law, and the reason it is of primordial importance.  I am not sure what is behind the hypothetical scenario the Senator presented but it would certainly be something that would be of interest to us, as a regulator, in terms of how it could be compliant.</p></speech>

Consolidating them compiles a great deal of information about the voters.  Is it legitimate for that information to be brought together without the knowledge of those voters and perhaps for extrapolations to be made from that, including, for example, voter intent or predictive scores about how people might vote?  Is there is a legitimacy to that and, if so, is there an obligation on the data controller to inform those persons on that register?  What remedies are available to them in the event there may be a shortcoming in respect of data protection obligations?</p></speech>

Clearly, there is a very specific context, as the Senator referred to data collected and compiled for electoral activities.  There is provision in the 2018 Act that allows for it, although it is not a free for all.  First, one would have to check if that provision created a legal basis sufficient for what is taking place.  Second, that provision does not eliminate, as the Senator said, the obligation on any controller to ensure transparency with respect to data subjects and to ensure those data subjects will be able to exercise all rights that may be relevant to them under the GDPR.  It is not possible to give a definitive answer because the devil will be in the detail of how it is done.  It is theoretically possible to legitimatise it.  Equally, it is possible it would fail in actual implementation on every single one of the principles and, therefore, it would be important to step through it in the actual detail in order to answer the Senator's question definitively.</p></speech>

This is a highly complex issue.  As our time is limited, I will quickly put my questions.  It is important we critically examine and review these issues.  Hopefully, as the Chairman and the commissioner, Ms Dixon, said, this will be the first of several conversations we will have.  It would be good to invite the commissioner to come before the committee again as soon as possible to discuss some of these issues.  As Ms Dixon said, there are some policy measures could that change.  We have heard talk of the need for a multi-stakeholder consultation to help develop clear processes.  We have also heard talk from the witnesses of an independent review of the commission, how it operates and of its procedures and investigations.  Under those, we could also consider the number of commissioners.  Perhaps one commissioner could split off to examine the day-to-day administrative work, one might have a slightly more specialist role and a chair could help review the policies and procedures.</p> <p>  Is an independent review or a multi-stakeholder engagement something the commissioner would be happy to engage in or to have set up?  What is her view on having additional commissioners to help her do the job and deliver on these complex tasks?</p></speech>

The first issue he raised is that of an independent review of the DPC, although he also mentioned a multi-stakeholder forum.  I am not sure if that was raised as being one and the same.  I would make a few points about having an independent review, quite apart from the various levels of scrutiny the DPC is under in terms of reviews of its decisions by the courts, the presentation of its annual report, which is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas every year, and the governance scrutiny under which it operates with internal audits, the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and so on.  An important point to mention is that we have rolled out a further iteration of our consultation on our strategy as a regulator, our enforcement and our regulatory strategy.  Stakeholders may wish to be aware we published that next iteration last week.  We would be very happy to receive inputs, comments, critiques and ideas regarding that regulatory strategy, which will serve as a forum of review and reflection for the DPC.</p> <p>  An independent review of the DPC is something this committee may wish to form its own views on.  I would suggest, in line with my earlier comments, it is very important that if a review was set up that it would seek to do more than skim the surface.  It would have to engage with the idea of correctly and comprehensively measuring the effectiveness of regulation and enforcement to the extent that it would have to engage with the European element of the role the DPC has and it would need to have the capability to do that.  In setting it up, there would probably need to be a consultation with the European Commission on it.</p> <p>  Given the very particular independence of an authority like the DPC and the role we have in regulating personal data processing by Government, there might be question marks over the Government establishing an independent review, lest it should be considered that it was trying to stymie enforcement actions against itself and so on.  We are always open to the idea of review and the input of ideas but it would need some consideration.  I am not sure exactly what the committee is considering when that question is put to me.</p><p>In terms of three commissioners, it is quite correct that section 15 of the 2018 Act future-proofed itself by providing for additional commissioners.  In the experience of the DPC to date, that is not where any bottlenecks have occurred.  Albeit almost three years have now passed, but we are in the earlier stages of the GDPR with a broad base of newly-opened investigations under the 2018 Act, not all of which have progressed to decision-making stage at this point.  The appointment of additional commissioners is a matter for the Government.</p></speech>

Many people have talked about what needs to change and happen around the funding issue.  The DPC was allocated &euro;19.1 million in the budget when the commission was looking for much more than that.  Given the importance of the office, I find it unacceptable that the allocated funding was approximately half the amount requested.  What shortfalls happen in the absence of that funding?  What does not get done because of those funding challenges?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1583" speakername="James Lawless" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#M00300"><p>I will add my voice to that question.  This committee reviews the Estimates and the voted spend for Ms Dixon's office, and I asked a similar question at the Estimates review earlier this year.  It is a matter that is of great interest to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1406" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Dixon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#M00400"><p>The DPC has stated that its funding needs to continue to increase and acknowledges the incremental increases in its funding over the past five years.  Given the scale of the challenges the committee has heard so much about, there is no doubt that we need to continue and increase the funding of the commission.  In fact, looking back at the budget we have been granted over the past couple of years, we have generally been granted close to what we required on the pay side of the budget.  We have not had to forgo any recruitment.  Particularly in light of challenges that we faced in recruiting last year and slower than expected recruitment because of the need to move testing and interviewing processes remotely, we did not use up our full budget.  We have managed to continue to recruit as much as we can each year within our pay budget.  On the issue of recruitment of staff, the Senator will have seen in the pre-budget submission we made that the real issue is around getting sanction at the grades and salary levels we need for the specialists we require at the DPC and at senior grades who would report directly to me, as commissioner.</p> <p>  There has been a bigger gap in the funding we have been granted for non-pay-related functions.  The types of things we have ended up forgoing, and which were forgone anyway because of circumstances, relate to the office space the DPC has been seeking to procure for years.  We had hoped to move all our Dublin-based staff into a new Dublin headquarters.  That has not happened because, despite the Office of Public Works, OPW, identifying a suitable new building off Baggot Street to house the DPC, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform declined sanction for it.  As a result, we did not require all of the non-pay expenditure that was allocated in that direction.  </p> <p>  Our funding does need to increase.  We also need to increase our capability to recruit staff at the grades and levels we need in order for us to do more with our non-pay budget.  We have drawn up a large tender that will be published shortly, work on which started last year because it is a big project.  It is a request for tenders from multiple suppliers to supply advice across a range of technologies and Internet technologies, and to conduct forensic testing on behalf of the DPC related to some of our Internet investigations.  We do not have the types of resources and expertise needed to draw up that large tender document, nor can we recruit staff to do it, as a result of which things take longer and we spend less on the technology advice we need to procure.  Those are the types of budget issues we are facing.</p></speech>

I will jump to Senator Malcolm Byrne.  I remind members of the time limits, particularly for those who have spoken.  There are two members offering who have not been in and they may get a little more latitude.  Senator Byrne has spoken and now has a second bite of the cherry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#M00600"><p>I will be direct in my questioning.  This dialogue is important.  I will ask a question following on from that asked by Senator Ruane.  Ms Dixon might outline the particular skill shortages and levels of staff shortages.  Are there particular commercial or regulatory lawyers or specialists in particular areas of technology on the skills side that are missing?</p> <p>  I also have a more general question about the decision-making process within the DPC for Ms Dixon and Dr. Ryan to consider.  I read the annual reports of the DPC and one of the issues I observed in 2019, for instance, was that the top four organisations against which complaints relating to data breaches and privacy had been made were the pillar banks.  I wrote to Ms Dixon's office at the time and suggested that her office should consider an inquiry, of its own volition, into the area of banking, breaches of data privacy and the whole area of data protection in the banking space.  This also relates to Dr. Ryan's point on real-time bidding and the complaint he made which, in my view, is a particular important issue, looking from the outside.  I would like to hear from Ms Dixon and Dr. Ryan about what they think the decision-making process should be with regard to the prioritisation of particular complaints.  Why should the real-time bidding complaints take priority over others?  I suggest an own-volition inquiry into banking.  How are those decisions made?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1409" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Johnny Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#M00700"><p>I thank the Senator.  In the early days of the GDPR, our DPC and its staff very often used the refrain that the GDPR is risk-based.  The idea there is a sensible one, that is, that the things that cause the most risk and the deepest harms to the most people deserve the most scrutiny.  However, those things are hard to do and it is easier to go after the small fry.  That is a problem.  It is why we need independent consideration of how to fix this problem.</p> <p>  One thing I have noticed at this hearing is that our colleagues at the DPC will, it seems, reject any criticism as unfounded.  Criticism is political if it comes from another authority.  It is tied to stories about tax and so forth, even though it was not.  It is improper if it comes from the European Parliament.  If an Advocate General of the European Court of Justice has opined about "persistent administrative inertia" of Facebook's lead authority, which is the DPC, that criticism is also rejected, contrary to fact.  We are all concerned that fundamental rights are hanging in the balance and the real hazard that we slide towards a dystopia.  We must engage with these matters.  The Senator is asking a question that appears to need an independent look.</p></speech>

His contribution is valuable and he has not answered many questions, as the session has fallen.  Ms Dixon is also welcome to reply.</p></speech>

I note the ICCL continues to repeat something completely erroneous.  It is not just an erroneous interpretation.  I am not sure whether there is a misunderstanding on the part of the ICCL.  I am happy to submit to the committee a summary of the Advocate General Bobek opinion.</p><p>I believe when it sees it the committee will be satisfied it does not say what the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, suggests and it does not make any criticism of the Irish Data Protection Commission, DPC.<br/><br/>I notice a number of the comments I made earlier have also been mischaracterised, but let me get on with answering Senator Malcolm Byrne's question.  He asked about the kind of skills they are lacking.  In large part the issues relate to the ability to retain the skills we have brought in.  We have brought in top-class litigators.  We cannot pay them at market rates, so if we cannot hope to pay them at market rates or anywhere near a reasonable rate and position them at a grade where we can retain them, we will lose them.  The issues are around that ability to pitch recruitment at a level where we will attract the right type of candidates.<br/><br/>Regarding technologists, it is difficult also because we will never have technologists who know all about every type of technology.  As we know, all of the platforms are proprietary and you would have to work in them to know everything about them.  That is why we are satisfied the route we are going down in terms of the request to publish for the multiple supplier framework is the right route to address that as well as bringing in sufficient in-house staff to know the right questions to ask but also to know when we need outside assistance and the form of outside assistance we need.<br/><br/>The Senator asked a question about banking.  We have engaged with him on this question previously and we know he understands that, the way enforcement is set up under the GDPR, we have to enforce against named cohorts and therefore we cannot do an investigation <i>per se</i>of the sector.  We could certainly audit big players in the sector and then conduct individual investigations in respect of each.  It is actually an area where we have a particular focus on an ongoing basis because of the quantities of breaches reported with which we engage.  We have two statutory inquiries open currently with regard to individual banks.  We have made a number of decisions in individual cases for which we will publish the case studies regarding banks.<br/><br/>The Senator's real question was about how we decide the priorities.  Why might we decide to focus on banking?  Why would we decide that RTB is important?  I go back to the publication of the  DPC strategy that is open now for consultation.  We welcome all stakeholders' views on this issue of prioritisation, but in general we look at the types of harms that may be at issue.  We look at the number of affected data sets.  Those are the two primary considerations when we consider where to deploy what will always be resources that are much more scarce than the issues we are facing.</p></speech>

I will move rapidly through the remaining speakers.  Deputies Kenny, Carroll MacNeill and Pringle are the remaining questioners.  We are over time at this point and to be fair to staff and the supporting person at the committee also I do not want to detain us any longer than is necessary.  I call Deputy Kenny to put his points.  I will then call Deputy Carroll MacNeill and Deputy Pringle will conclude our session.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#N00300"><p>I thank both witnesses.  There seems to be an issue of resources.  Despite what Ms Dixon is saying, the issue is we have so many genuine complaints from people that their issues are not being dealt with, the DPC is taking a very long time to respond to people, and it is taking a very long time for any progress to be made.  To say there is no issue with resources or whatever is not correct.  Covid-19 may be having some impact on it.  I do not know.  Perhaps this year is different but it seems to be an issue that is ongoing from previous years.  If the workload is increasing, that needs to be spelled out and Ms Dixon should say it is increasing.  If, as she said, she has difficulty sometimes trying to recruit more people, that suggests either she expects the workload to increase or she has recognised there is a problem and she needs more staff to make the situation more efficient.  All of us would support that.</p> <p>  We need to get these issues resolved because all the elected representatives here have come across various situations where members of the public have complained about the way they are being dealt with, particularly the length of time it is taking, and that they are not getting the kind of response they would have expected to get.  There must be a level of acceptance that we need to be working together.  If somebody says there is something wrong or points out a problem, it is not healthy to get defensive about it immediately because there is a problem.  We can all see that and that needs to be recognised.  That is my first point.  I am not making it to be accusatory or difficult but it needs to be said.</p> <p>  The other issue is one that was very much in the headlines in recent months and concerned many people who were suffering major trauma.  I refer to the issue of the mother and baby homes, how the records were going to be sealed and the issues around that.  There was a need for clarity as to whether the sealing of records in those cases would have been a breach of legislation, especially EU legislation.  I would like to get both witnesses' view on that.  I will leave it at that as time is short.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked two questions and I ask both witnesses to respond to each of them.  Ms Dixon might like to start.</p></speech>

He raised a number of particularly important questions that I wanted to circle back on to address.  In terms of some of the inaccuracies about what has been presented, I do not think I would be doing my job if I did not inform the committee there are significant inaccuracies.  It is not a question of not accepting criticism or that there is a problem.  The DPC is entirely open to the idea that improvements have to be made.</p> <p>  There are a couple of comments to make about complaints.  One is that under the previous regime in Ireland, almost uniquely in Europe, under section 10 of the Acts, the DPC had an obligation to investigate every complaint and to produce a decision if the complainant so required.  There was a particular backlog, therefore, once the GDPR commenced, that had to be worked through where we did not get to apply a risk-based approach or an examination of the extent appropriate.  We were obliged to conduct an investigation.  That is one comment to make.</p> <p>  It is important to say that 60% of the complaints we receive in any calendar year are resolved in that same calendar year.  Some of the points raised before the committee this evening regarding complaints are not obligations of the DPC under the GDPR.  I am aware that gives rise to dissatisfaction, and some of the dissatisfaction members have heard from their constituents may relate to that.  However, there is no obligation on the DPC under the 2018 Act to produce a decision in the case of any complaint.  We are obliged to seek to resolve it amicably and then otherwise produce an outcome, which may not be a decision.  We heard that Logue Associates would prefer if there was a decision in each case and requests that there would be, especially because he says individuals may want to seek compensation, but that is not an area within the remit of the DPC.</p> <p>  Regarding the issue of mother and baby homes and the sealing of the records, that was clearly a very complex matter because the legislation that gave rise to the commission of investigation derived from 2004 and was pre the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights coming into legal force and pre the GDPR.  Later on, issues arose in terms of the application to the GDPR and the rights of individuals to the processes that had been laid down.  The DPC is on record as saying a blanket sealing of the records was not justified and that individuals had rights of access.  That is the position now where the archive has transferred to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and that Department is giving effect to the rights of individuals.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Kenny for the statement and question.  As happened many times in the past, the ICCL has been supportive of the DPC.  It was strongly supportive in the case of the public services card and so on.</p><p>My colleagues, who were very active on the mother and baby homes issue, were supportive of the DPC's action in that particular case also.</p></speech>

I appreciate all of the different perspectives but there is an unusual tension.  It is very obvious to see.  Having watched some of these interactions with public bodies for some time at this stage, I am aware it is never as straightforward as observers may sometimes try to say it is.  I am a little concerned about the tension and the dynamics going on here.  Even just checking the decision referred to by Dr. Ryan, and he referred to paragraphs 114 and 135, and while I appreciate Dr. Ryan and the commissioner are deeply involved in this and work on it every day and that I do not, my reading of this, however, is that it is not the same criticism of the Data Protection Commission that Dr. Ryan attests.  I am very happy to take more detailed submissions on these different points but I just want to strike a note of caution on this.</p></speech>

I am coming to it from the perspective of constituents and from consumers who find all of this very difficult.  They are, in large part, aware of the general rules but not necessarily what they cover, how to access them and so on.  This includes the Article 5 rules for data being stored only for as long as necessary, or the big differences between buying something and getting data.  A person who buys a barbecue online, for example, may give his or her data for that purpose but there is an end point to that transaction.  There are, however, other things that may be more open ended.  Article 6 is around the legality of collecting and processing personal data and the question of consent being specific and unambiguous.  It is very much a proactive consent, as far as I understand.  Article 17 is the right of erasure, if that is the correct term, or the right to be forgotten.  I am concerned about the burden placed on citizens to be aware of their rights in relation to this and the burden placed on them around finding out about who is the right point of contact, about providing identification required to the data being held, about seeking rationale for the retention of the data, and about challenging the rationale or obtaining help.  It is very difficult, especially if people do not know that the data are held about them.  To what extent can more be done proactively to help consumers and citizens be aware of how to navigate the process?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, a decision was made in the implementing law not to allow NGOs to represent large bodies of people and proactively act on their behalf.  That is a real pity.  In the medium term we should definitely look at that again.</p> <p>  On the first point, I was saying not to take my word for it.  I was going to say to take Helen Dixon's counterpart's word for it.  That court case arose because of a case taken by Willem Debeuckelaere.  Until last year Mr. Debeuckelaere was the commissioner for the Belgian Data Protection Authority and wanted to act against Facebook.  There is a quote from him on page 8 of my written submission, which is an extensive quotation that might put it into context.  Representing bodies of people is essential.</p></speech>

As a committee we must deal with what is out there.  While there are differences, perceptions can sometimes be stronger and they can have consequences also.  It is important to deal with facts but it is also important to address issues that arise.  The commissioner is attempting to do that, but perhaps as part of the body of work to be done there is a bit of marketing to be done too if this is the case.  We do need to address those issues in every sense and that includes in the court of public opinion.</p> <p>  I will say to all witnesses, including the two witnesses in session with us now and those from earlier, that if there are other points that have not been addressed in the oral exchanges this evening, if there are other points the witnesses wish to make that have not been covered tonight or they feel could be covered in more detail, or if they want to reply to a particular point that was made, they are more than welcome to submit written submissions to the clerk of the committee for circulation to the committee members.  That option is there and I would advise the witnesses to take it up.  I would certainly find it useful to consider some of those points.</p> <p>  I now ask the commissioner to come in on the second question, and I will then move on to Deputy Pringle for the final question of the evening because we have gone over time.</p></speech>

It is very much acknowledged that the burden placed on individual data subjects to understand their rights and to know how to exercise them is considerable.  There is a whole body of academics now who say the very central concept of the GDPR of giving the data subject back control such as control to exercise rights and control to decide whether they consent actually results in putting an unsustainable burden on them.  That is, nonetheless, the central purpose of the law.  Aside from the Data Protection Commission publishing more and more guidance on how individuals can exercise their rights, I believe the much more important thing we can do is to guide controllers to be compliant and transparent, and as helpful as possible to the public in explaining how data are processed.  We see time and again that poor communication leads to a lot of the issues between controllers and data subjects.</p> <p>  It is also important to mention the new role under the GDPR of the data protection officer that must be appointed by public sector bodies and which many private sector organisations are also obliged to appoint.  The DPO officer's role, or that of the office, is to act as an important link between members of the public, the individual and the organisation, and to make all of this simpler.  The DPO helps the person to exercise his or her rights.  A big focus and a priority for the Data Protection Commission is to support this new role of DPO and to teach DPOs how they can be more effective in supporting individuals.</p></speech>

Deputy Pringle gets to have the last word, certainly among the members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1437" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#O01900"><p>I thank the Chairman and hope I will be brief.  It is unusual for me to be at a meeting where a body has got such negative responses and submissions compared with previous ones.  To my mind this is a sign there must be something wrong with it.  For Ms Dixon to come in and give the committee such a strident defence of it shows there is something wrong with how the system is working across the board.  I take on board, however, what Ms Dixon has said on the figures given by the earlier contributors, and that they could be misplaced.</p> <p>  I was looking at the executive summary of the commission's annual report.  It says "Over 60% (2,186) of complaints lodged with the DPC in 2020 were concluded".  The number of complaints received by the DPC was 4,660.  This only works out at 46% and I wonder where this discrepancy comes from.  Maybe I am reading it wrong or not reading it right.  There is an anomaly there in the DPC's own figures that I can see.  It is difficult to see where that arises from.</p><p>Perhaps Ms Dixon could address that.</p><p> One of the previous contributors spoke about the ways of addressing some of the problems.  I take from what Ms Dixon said that she does not accept there are any problems.  It was said that the Department has the power to make regulations, that under the data Act the conditions could be clarified or that Ms Dixon, as commissioner, could an hold a briefing for representative bodies and interested people and outline how she deals with complaints and things like that.</p><p> How does the commissioner view those issues - issues of clarification and clarifying the role for everybody - because to my mind, and I am no expert on this and I come to it relatively cold, there does appears to be a problem.  Whether that problem is totally one way or the other, which is not usually the case, there appears to be a problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1439" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Dixon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021042700002#P00200"><p>That is an interesting observation.  I agree with Deputy Pringle that if everyone is making a complaint, and the same complaint, then there has to be an issue.  I think I am on record several times this evening as saying that we acknowledge improvements are necessary around processes and the issue of delay.  That is accepted and I think those improvements will happen.  We have already started to initiate them.</p> <p>  Given the fact there are significant criticism this evening, I would say that, in line with what I said earlier, as a regulator, we are uniquely positioned at the centre of an enormous range of stakeholders.  I know this committee was limited in its time in terms of how many hearings it could conduct on GDPR and when it could conduct them but there is a whole range of data protection practitioners, academics and others who the committee is not hearing from this evening.  I am not sure whether members would hear the same perspectives or imbalanced set of views.  In fact, there could be a broader set of hearings possible at this time.</p> <p>  In regard to the statistics, I will look up the figures the Deputy referenced - the calculation of the percentages - and we will submit a written note clarifying what he thinks may be a miscalculation on our part.  If I understood the Deputy's last question correctly, he asked whether I should conduct oral hearings as part of complaint handling.  Did I understand that correctly?</p></speech>

One was that the Minister had the power to make regulations that would speed up the process or that the data Act could be amended to clarify conditions in terms of speeding up the process.  Another option was that the Data Protection Commissioner could hold briefings for interested parties in how complaints could be dealt with and so on that might clarify some of the issues as well.  I wonder what Ms Dixon's views are on that.</p></speech>

I understand fully his question now.  As I mentioned earlier, we have put out our strategy for consultation.  That will be one way we will hear views on these issues of the conduct of complaints.  We have already taken on board the suggestion by Fred Logue and Associates on publishing details of our processes and we plan to do that shortly.  In regard to the making of regulations, we will certainly give that consideration.  We could codify what we publish as our processes in regulations, if that would give greater legal certainty.  We are certainly listening to all the feedback in regard to processes.</p></speech>

I thank all of them for a very comprehensive engagement.  It was quite a detailed exchange but at the same time it felt like we only skimmed the surface.  This is an issue which is fundamental to the Department and very close to the interests of this committee as well.  I am sure we will return to these issues on subsequent occasions over the lifetime of this committee.</p><p>I thank Dr. Ryan, Ms Dixon, Mr. Schrems and Dr. Logue for their helpful and specific exchanges.  I reiterate to all the witnesses who took part that if there are points that need to be clarified, supplemented or added to, they should feel free to send them in writing to the clerk for circulation to the committee.  We will consider them as part of our later deliberations and reviews.  That concludes the witness-engagement part of the meeting.  I also thank our staff because we ran over time.  I thank them for their patience and perseverance in supporting us through that.</p><p>I will move on to some housekeeping matters.  I propose we publish all opening statements on the committee website.  Is that agreed to?  Agreed.  That concludes our formal business.  All housekeeping matters and comments have been deferred to our next joint meeting.  As there is no other business, this meeting of the joint committee is adjourned <i>sine die</i>.</p></speech>

The witnesses will be joining the meeting remotely via Teams.  I welcome Ms Mary O&rsquo;Connor from the Federation of Irish Sport; Ms Helen O&rsquo;Rourke of the Ladies Gaelic Football Association; Ms Sin&eacute;ad McNulty from the Camogie Association; and Ms Gemma Begley of the Gaelic Players Association.  This topic and discussion have been eagerly awaited by members and, I am sure, by the public and the witnesses as well.  We are delighted to have the witnesses here and I thank them for joining us, though I am sorry it has to be remotely.  We love to have people actually present but in the absence of that we are delighted to have the witnesses with us remotely.  I thank them for all the trouble and effort they have gone to with their presentations.</p> <p>  I will invite witnesses to make their opening statements, followed by questions from members of the committee.  The committee may publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.  I will call first on the Federation of Irish Sport; second, the LGFA; third, the Gaelic Players Association; and finally, the Camogie Association.  Opening statements are limited to three minutes per organisation, in order to ensure everybody gets an opportunity to make their statements and that members get the opportunity to ask questions.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  If witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to any identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  As our witnesses today are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, they should note that there are some limitations on parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members again of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to attend where he or she does not adhere to this constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to attend from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  I also ask members to please identify themselves when contributing, for the benefit of the Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report, and to mute their microphones when not contributing in order to reduce background noise and feedback.  Members should use the appropriate button to indicate a raised hand when they wish to contribute.  I remind everybody joining today's meeting to ensure their mobile phones are in silent mode or, better yet, switched off.</p> <p>  With the housekeeping out of the way, I am delighted to get to most important and substantial part of the meeting, which is the guests who are with us today.  They have three minutes each for their presentations.  I will remind them when their time is up, in order to give everybody equal opportunity.  I call Ms O'Connor to make her opening statement on behalf of the Federation of Irish Sport. </p></speech>

For those who may not be familiar with the work of the federation, we are an independent representative body for 110 sporting organisations across Ireland, including 81 national governing bodies and 29 local sports partnerships.</p> <p>  The very successful 20x20 campaign began in October 2018 and concluded in October 2020.  Some 76 members of the federation signed up to the campaign.  Over 600 clubs across 45 sports in 32 counties, and, indeed, nine countries, signed up to the 20x20 clubs charter, and 28 out of 30 national universities on the island of Ireland signed the 20x20 third level charter, committing to one or all three of the key metrics, namely, the increase in media coverage, participation, and attendance for women in sport by 20% by the end of 2020.</p> <p>  In the first year of the movement, Nielsen found that participation increased by 13%, attendance at high-level events increased by 17% and media coverage across online and print publications increased by over 50%.  However, it is important to note that we were coming from a very low base.  In 2018 just 3% of print sports coverage, and 4% online, was dedicated to women&rsquo;s sport.  After the first year of the 20x20 campaign, this had increased to 5% and 6% respectively, so there is still a long way to go.</p> <p>  Attendance and participation could not be measured in the second year of the campaign due to the absence of sport during the pandemic, but the cultural shift could be.  According to Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes, 80% of the total population, and 84% of men, are more aware of women&rsquo;s sport now compared to before the campaign launched in 2018, with 76% saying women&rsquo;s sport is seen as cooler now.  Of those aware of 20x20 campaign, 73% said the movement changed their mindset positively towards women in sport, with 68% saying they support girls and women in sport more than before because of the campaign. </p> <p>  In an effort to be succinct, some of the issues facing women in sport in Ireland were highlighted in a 2018 report entitled We Are Sport, commissioned by Sport Ireland.  It stated that the six core barriers for women in sport were confidence, prioritisation, motivation, education, influencers, and structures.  In 2019, Sport Ireland published a women in sport policy to tackle the issues outlined in the aforementioned report under the headings of coaching and officiating, active participation, leadership and governance, and visibility.  The progress made since the publication of the 2019 women in sport policy, under the direction of Sport Ireland women in sport lead Nora Stapleton, is outlined in our submission.  I am aware that the committee has seen this already so I will not go through the bullet points.</p> <p>  It is worth noting that, as sport and physical activity reopen in a meaningful way as the year progresses, it is envisaged that there will be a phase of uncertainty.  Some sports will be more affected than others, such as sports whose natural environment is indoors as well as contact and team sports outdoors.  It is also fair to say there may be additional issues specific to women and girls as the return occurs, and they will need to be addressed as they arise.</p> <p>  Media representation will remain a key issue until there is an equal share of content across all formats of media consumption, including radio, TV, and print and social media channels.  However, the ongoing support of State and non-State media outlets for movements such as the 20x20 campaign is significant and can be capitalised on.  Initiatives such as Sport Ireland&rsquo;s media training programme will also help to facilitate a pipeline of talented female candidates for media work in these outlets.  This is a great example of where initiatives can knit together.</p></speech>

I am sorry to speak across her but we have run over time.  We are very curtailed.  Back in the day, before the pandemic, we would have had meetings that could go on for hours but we are restricted to two hours tonight.  I want to make sure we get to tease out the issues as much as possible.</p> <p>  I thank Ms O'Connor and call Ms O'Rourke from the LGFA.</p></speech>

We are a 32-county, volunteer-led organisation with a global presence in all five continents.  We have just surpassed a record 200,000 membership.  This rate of growth is exponential.  To give an example, our membership in 2007 was just over 132,000, a 32% growth in that short timeframe.  The interest and attendance at our showpiece event, the All-Ireland final, has grown year on year.  In 2013, the attendance was 25,103, while, in 2019, this attendance had more than doubled setting a record attendance at 56,114.  This was the seventh year in a row of an increased attendance.  It is testament to our players, mentors and members for all their hard work and effort.</p> <p>  We are extremely grateful to all those who have come before us since 1974 and laid the foundations and groundwork for those of us who have followed.  We have set ourselves ambitious targets in our strategic roadmap.  We believe there are many opportunities to continue our growth and development with the right supports and resources.  Our aim is to provide the opportunity to all girls and women, no matter what their age, location, skill level or ambitions might be, to play football should they want to do so.  We ensure programmes like Gaelic4Mothers&amp;Others, Gaelic4Teens and Gaelic4Girls to provide these initial gateways to participation in our sport having an impact on all communities.</p> <p>  With this growth, however, also comes challenges and the 20x20 campaign brought some of these to the forefront for women&rsquo;s sport and united sports across the country.  We are fortunate to have TG4 as our sponsor for the past 20 years.  Our media coverage on television has increased annually.  Like all sports, however, we continue to strive for greater presence in print media.  We supported the 20x20 campaign wholeheartedly and we set targets to increase attendances and participation levels.</p> <p>  We want to continue as a leading sporting body.  To enable us to do this, we urge all committee members to look at greater funding for women&rsquo;s sport.  In 2020, the LGFA generated funds of just over &euro;4.7 million, comprising &euro;4.2 million in self-funding and &euro;485,000 from Sport Ireland funding.  In 2007, we were 24% funded by Sport Ireland compared to just 9% in 2020.  Despite this, our membership has increased by 32% in the same period.  Currently the association, based on existing funding available, operates a small workforce of 14 full-time staff.  We operate the inter-county player grant scheme in co-operation with the Camogie Association and the Women&rsquo;s Gaelic Players Association.  The targets are team-based and the benefits go to the teams.</p> <p>  A further area of much debate is access to facilities due to increased playing numbers.  There have been improvements in this area with the majority of our county games played in county grounds and further double-header fixtures with GAA games.  However, the sports capital grant scheme is realistically out of reach for ourselves.  The majority of our units simply would not have the initial funding required to enter these schemes to allow us to develop our own grounds and facilities.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairperson for the invitation to address the committee.  I hope from this brief statement it can see the breadth of work completed by our association to promote women&rsquo;s sport and with minimal funding.  We fully support objectives of creating an equal playing field financially for players at inter-county level.  I must highlight the importance of funding for projects and initiatives supporting the additional 97% of our membership also.  They form the basis from which our inter-county players are selected and will greatly benefit from further investment.</p></speech>

In December 2020, the WGPA joined its male counterparts in the GPA to became one association, which is committed to equality in Gaelic games and will actively work to pursue equal investment, recognition and opportunities for all players.</p> <p>  Last year, the WGPA launched the Levelling the Field report which showed that female inter-county players complete some form of training on almost six days per week; travel on average 80 km to and from their team sessions; 69% pay their own gym fees; 93% do not receive any compensation for travel costs; 85% need flexibility in their work to play inter-county; and 92% take part in club and community-based role model activity.  Ultimately, the report showed that female players are committed to their sport but are out of pocket due to it.</p> <p>  Male players show comparable time commitment to training but receive compensation for costs incurred through a GAA-GPA expenses system and Government funding.  The Covid-19 pandemic has only heightened the difficulties for female players, who are now required to travel individually to training and games to comply with the Covid guidelines.  The 2020 Government grant scheme for female inter-county players allocated &euro;700,000 to inter-county teams while male players received &euro;3 million in individual grants.  That is a funding disparity of 77%.  On a per player basis, males received an average of &euro;1,282 each, compared to &euro;424 invested for each female.</p> <p>  The majority of female inter-county teams do not own their own pitch and consequently have to pay to use a GAA or public facility.  These are direct costs to teams on an annual basis as a result of the organisational structures within our games.  This context illustrates some of the main challenges faced by female inter-county players, namely, the individual financial strain, a lack of adequate high performance supports, barriers to accessing facilities.  The latter two require Government funding to at least contribute to an improved playing environment for female players.  However, the funding gap and experiences of male and female players remains significantly different.</p> <p>  This presents a significant opportunity for the Government to lead the way in creating equality in sport by making an equitable investment in all inter-county players.  Sport Ireland is also committed to a vision for sport where women have an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential.  The female scheme acknowledges that female players are high-performance athletes in their sport who require support.  Independent evaluation of the female grant scheme showed a hugely positive impact of the scheme.  At the same time, it recommended an enhanced and broader allocation of funding to further improve standards.</p> <p>  Closing the funding gap would be due recognition of female inter-county players who are the chief exponents of our indigenous games, as well as local role models who prompt participation in sport.  There would be no stronger public message on the role of women in Irish sport than acknowledgment from the State through equitable funding that our female athletes are valued equally.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im l&aacute;ns&aacute;sta an t-&aacute;bhar seo a chur chun cinn i dTithe an Oireachtais.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet this evening.  It is positive to see the issues relating to women&rsquo;s sport being considered by this Oireachtas committee.  I welcome the attention and priority that women&rsquo;s sport has been given by the Government over recent years in the national sports policy, the women in sport policy, as well as associated leadership funding and initiatives through Sport Ireland.  These are all positive steps in the right direction.</p> <p>  I come with the perspective as CEO of the Camogie Association, the national and international governing body for camogie since 1904.  It has 100,000 members across the world.  The association wants more people playing camogie more often and in more places in Ireland and internationally.  Yet it is more than that.  It is about creating a positive experience, providing high-quality coaching, high-standard facilities, high-quality officials and excellent volunteers.  All these elements, all of the time, will ensure that girls have a positive camogie experience.  If one aspect fails, the risk is that we lose that player perhaps forever.</p></speech>

In camogie, we have demonstrated the impact of investment and focused interventions on women's sport with wonderful progress being made in counties such as Cavan, Kerry and Mayo providing living proof.  The costs for a young person starting out in camogie can be &euro;100 to &euro;130.  This can a limiting factor for some parents and many schools and clubs, which has been further complicated by the Covid-19 restrictions.</p> <p>  The key transition stages regarding drop-off in women's sport constitute a predominant issue.  Teenage girls fall through the cracks and leave sport at transition stages from primary to secondary school through to third level and into the workforce.  We need to extend the lifespan of female sports participation and engagement through the development of more recreational camogie opportunities with coaches and, most importantly, facilities available to support these additional players and recreational teams.  There is a need for early intervention and engagement with girls during primary and second level education to prevent this drop-off.  </p> <p>  Volunteers are the lifeblood of our association.  Without them, there would be no camogie.  Recruitment, retention and ongoing support and upskilling of volunteers represent a challenge, particularly as the demands continue to increase.  There remains much work to do to eliminate the gender gap in participation and even more so when it comes to volunteering where significant disparities exist.  </p> <p>  Women's sport needs to be broadcast and seen.  Our athletes train as hard as the men do yet they do not achieve the screen time resulting in reduced investment by sponsors and broadcasters, which, in turn, impacts the sports.  Broadcasting of sport has a long way to go to achieve parity.  Recent research showed a high of 10.5% coverage of women in sport in March 2021 with the remainder going to their male counterparts.  Women&rsquo;s sport needs to be broadcast with high production values and excellent commentating.  Irish broadcasters have made huge moves in this regard but more needs to be done.  </p> <p>  As a national association, we plan prudently every year to support our members and deliver on our ambitions.  Our work is focused and our output for investment is high.</p></speech>

The list of actions in Ms McNulty's submission makes for interesting reading.  Her idea of a task force on women's sport is not something we should pursue; rather it is something we must pursue in 2021.  Can she expand on what the task force should be looking at?  Would it be broad enough to include consideration of underage sports and retention, broadcasting and funding proposals such as players' expenses and access to sports capital grants?  Would she like the task force to consider these types of issues?</p></speech>

When the committee consults with members of national governing bodies, NGBs, it will probably find more.  There is no clear data on the actual spend on women's sport.  It is not broken down by NGB.  It is very clear for the LGFA and the Camogie Association because they are single-gender sports organisations but we do not have that information in the case of others.  Long-term sustainability is key.</p></speech>

What were the main reasons for that?  Was it work at grassroots level, broadcasting coverage by TG4, support from high-profile sponsors or something else?  I am asking this in terms of good practice and how it could be replicated somewhere else.</p></speech>

We are not yet 50 years in existence so we were able to look back at the other associations, learn and see how we could do things differently.  The main growth came just over 20 years ago when TG4 came on board as a sponsor.  It was the visibility of our sport.  We always believed we had a good product but that if we could get that product into households, parents would see it was a great sport for girls and schools and teachers would see it was a very suitable sport to play within schools where they could have large numbers playing.  We believed that to sustain a national profile and at inter-county level, we needed solid foundations at grassroots level with underage sport.  In recent years, we have been very lucky with fantastic sponsors such as Lidl that have had money to invest in marketing campaigns that made our sport very visible.  It has a lot to do with members and volunteers we have had over the years.</p></speech>

It is scandalous that women at this level are not receiving similar levels of funding to their male counterparts and it is an issue that must be addressed.

Growth in women's sport has been exponential.  I remember going to ladies' All-Ireland finals in the early 1990s when only the Hogan Stand was open and only 10,000 people might attend those games.  We now have record crowds in excess of 56,000.</p><p>To put it in context, it was the second biggest attendance for a ladies sporting event in the world that year, with only the FIFA World Cup being bigger.  That did not happen by chance.  It happened because of people, such as Ms Helen O'Rourke.  I dealt with Ms O'Rourke in my days as a journalist with GAA magazines such as <i>Gaelsport</i>and <i>HighBall</i>.  I know the work that has gone in over many decades.  I praise Ms O'Rourke, Ms McNulty and all associated with the work that has gone into that.<br/><br/>I have three questions.  I will pose them and then get the  answers.  My questions are first to Ms O'Rourke, in terms of assets, second, to Ms O'Connor and Ms Begley, in terms of financial support, and, third, to Ms McNulty, in terms of the visibility.<br/><br/>On the assets, I note that the growth of the women's game over the past number of decades has been considerable.  Ms O'Rourke touched on it in her presentation in terms of assets.  On trying to resolve that, is it a case of us looking at a merger between the Ladies' Gaelic Football Association, LGFA, the Camogie Association and the GAA to eventually resolve that broader issue of assets and making sure there is equal access to the assets across the country?  The distinct identity of the LGA and the Camogie Association have provided a different edge and have allowed the associations to grow because the advertising campaigns have been far edgier.  The commercial partnerships have been far better as well.  I am not advocating for it but I am asking the question.<br/><br/>Second, on resources, and this question is to Ms O'Connor and Ms Begley, the figures set out, in terms of the disparity, with &euro;1,363 for a male inter-county player and &euro;424 for a female one, are disgraceful.  What steps are being taken on a timeframe for trying to achieve parity?<br/><br/>In terms of broadcasting and visibility, and this question is to Ms McNulty who touched on it in her presentation, I pay tribute to TG4 which has been a ground-breaker in giving that visibility.  One of the greatest programmes on television at present is &quot;Laochra Gael&quot;.  Two of TG4's recent programmes on which they touched were on my mind coming here this evening.  The first was its programme on Briege Corkery, a former team mate of Ms O'Connor.  People such as Ms Corkery and Ms O'Connor have been ambassadors for the game, in both camogie and ladies' football.  By highlighting these achievements, they are acting as ambassadors and drawing more people to the game.  The second focused on Johnny Pilkington, one of the legends of Offaly hurling.  At the end of that programme, Mr. Pilkington was bucking a ball around with this daughter, Kate, and talking about dropping her down to training that evening, realising there was only one person there to train a squad of more than 20.  He eventually chipped in and he has been there ever since.  We need legends of the game, such as Mr. Pilkington, out front and driving this promotion and coaching as well.  I would be interested in Ms McNulty's views on that.<br/><br/>Finally, before I let the respondents answer my questions, I want to praise my own team, Meath, and Mr. Eamon Murray on their success last year.  It will be great to see playing senior football next year and taking on the Dubs.</p></speech>

In relation to the assets, we have worked closely with the GAA in recent years.  We are all very aware that we have something unique in our sport and are very conscious of being in a position to develop it.  I suppose where we are coming from with working to a closer alignment is having it work organically because we all have one chance at this.  We have one chance of having one association.  It will have to work.  We are working on a way of getting there organically, with initiatives.  Much of our development with young people is done together.  We recently announced a player pathway for all codes, male and female, across that.</p> <p>  When I talk about assets, if one looks at the growth in our game and growth in camogie in recent years, there is the same number of GAA pitches around the country.  In many of the small parishes, there is still the one field but the numbers have multiplied due to the number of girls and women playing sport there.  We are expecting everybody to fit into the same number of pitches and it is not feasible.  It does not work.</p> <p>  On the relationship we have with the GAA, we are all GAA members.  We are all part of a club.  We have our own club and we have our own facilities, but with the continued growth that we expect over the coming years, more facilities are required for the Gaelic games family.</p></speech>

It is immediate.  One is looking for a quick turnaround on this.  Inter-county players are as committed now as they will be next year.  The sooner the better.  In regard to the task force, there is a review of this.  Any inter-county ladies footballer or comogie player who is giving her time to play for her county needs to be recompensed.  We need to look at the historical inequity as well if one is to try to get equality for our players.</p></speech>

There are only so many weekend hours available to broadcast games and it is a challenge for our broadcast partners to schedule games.  That does not impact on our print media and on other alternative media.  It is about trying to make sure there is parity.  Some 10%, as a peak, is fairly low, considering in 2004 research was done by former Deputy, Jimmy Deenihan, on this in a previous joint committee.</p> <p>  We need to look at having female sport broadcast at peak times, at free-to-air broadcasting and at other mechanisms of broadcasting women's sport so that our athletes can be role models for the young people who are watching television.  We want to get them out playing the sport but the reality is they engage with social media, television and print media, and we need those role models to be visible to people.</p> <p>  An additional challenge for our camogie players, of course, is that they are behind helmets during their games and they are a little less recognisable walking down the street than some of our other colleagues.  There is a need for investment and perhaps some positive discrimination in terms of peak times for television coverage of women's sport.  That may not be a popular recommendation but it is one that needs to be looked at.</p> <p>  We work closely with our partners in the LGFA and in the GAA to get screen time, where possible, with our broadcast partners in RT&Eacute; but it is not always possible.  It is a very competitive market for those peak screen hours on television.</p></speech>

It is fair to say from their opening statements that the 20x20 campaign has probably done more in the past two years than what possibly would have been achieved over the past 20 year.  It has certainly increased awareness in Ireland and internationally about the value and importance of women's participation in sport.</p> <p>  I appreciate that women players across all sports put in an equal, if not greater, effort in their chosen sports to ensure that they perform to the best of their abilities and I would second Deputy Munster's proposal on setting up a task force to address the inequality that is present in terms of how men are perceived.  I speak as someone who comes from an inter-county background and worked with the Gaelic Players' Association, GPA, for more than 15 years.  We need to change the language in terms of how women are treated and respected.</p> <p>  I have some generic questions.  The Ladies' Gaelic Football Association, LGFA, mentioned issues around access to sporting grounds for training and matches.  I would like to get an understanding from Ms O'Rourke of the difficulties of the LGFA in accessing capital grants and what plans the association has to resolve this.</p> <p>  In terms of the foundations or the building blocks to ensure there is equality of opportunity for women at elite, club or participation level, what would be the required funding structures to support women in sport?  Each organisation in its opening statement referenced funding streams.  If there are any recommendations, I would very much welcome them.</p><p>Talking about the sports capital grants, if we were to go about it as an association by ourselves, we would not have the finances to back up what is required.  We currently support clubs and counties in a position to access this funding.  We support them in the statements because in recent years everybody is working to access or improve facilities at a local level, taking into account that young girls and women are playing this sport.  We support those applications.</p><p> Some counties in the past number of months have invested in or are planning in investing in their own facilities, which really is not possible for the majority of our counties and us as an association.  Our support must lie with the current structures that are in place.</p></speech>

Everything we take in as an association goes back out in the operation.  We also administer an injury fund as an association to ensure every player, no matter what age, is covered in the event of injuries.  We have a very strong and good injury fund that is part of the investment with players.  Our finance system is membership-led and whatever we take at the gate for all-Ireland finals, for example, goes back to the running of the association for the coming year.  Our membership stream finances the association.</p></speech>

There is also women in sport funding that has come on stream since 2019.  There are 41 organisations that received funding for women in sport projects.  Ideally, we would like to see an increase in funding and budget for the women in sport policy to be developed and the number of bodies receiving specific women in sport funding to be increased.</p> <p>  It is very important that there should be an understanding that core funding goes to the whole organisation but there is specific women in sport funding.  That pot of &euro;3 million must be substantially increased if we are to meet the requirements of women and girls playing sport in this country.</p></speech>

Our annual turnover would not facilitate investment in facilities in the same way as the sports capital element does.  For example, in an average year pre-Covid, we had approximately &euro;2.5 million in revenue.  Looking at putting floodlights on a pitch, we would be looking at approximately &euro;500,000 for a good quality installation.  Even for us to underwrite developments that units are seeking year on year, it would be really challenging.</p> <p>  An unequal investment in women's sport will be required over the next number of years to bring it to level it needs to be at.  Women members across the different sports codes in the country have invested in their club membership and facilities development over the years.  The facilities are not yet there to match the needs of the growth in women's sport that we are now seeing.  We require unequal investment so as to provide facilities and ensure our core funding.  Ms O'Connor referred to specific investment in project-based funding, including that of women in sport.  There is also the motivate, nurture, aspire, MNA, programme, that may have helped Mr. Pilkington in coaching his young daughter.  We can certainly pass on the details to him about that.</p></speech>

We have requested an increase, a portion of which we would like to see going to player travel expenses.  It was flagged as a direct cost to players and it is something we would like to see incorporated into the future structure of funding.</p></speech>

I have a question for Ms O'Connor.  Much of the focus has been on GAA so far but will she share a case study or example of one of the other governing bodies that have successfully increased the participation of women in sport and any specific lessons that could be drawn across all the sporting codes from that?</p> <p>  We will shortly consider the online safety and media regulation Bill.  The witnesses spoke earlier about the drop in participation of young women, particularly those in their late teens and going to college.  I would like to hear a little of the discussion around the extent to which the witnesses feel body shaming and the impact of social media on young women is a factor.  It is about ensuring they can continue to take part so what measures could be taken and what concerns should we raise with social media companies in this regard?</p></speech>

I can give an example from the local sports partnerships.  There are 29 of them in the country and in 2020 they had over 109,000 girls and 64,000 women participating in sports programmes led by the local sports partnerships.  It is the type of impact that funding can have when local sports partnerships are resourced to deliver progress for girls and women in sport.</p></speech>

There was one good example from ladies football recently when Ms Vikki Wall spoke very candidly about her experience.  It was great to see that leadership, which was very refreshing.  It was a great message to send out to young girls to stand up and say everybody is welcome.  It was a really good challenge for all of us, including those watching the games or online, and it reminds us to be respectful because there is a person behind the online presence.</p> <p>  More could be done and there is much social activism by athletes across the world.  It is very popular.  We would love to see this problem being tackled and players continuing to take a lead on it.  The Senator is correct that much more work could be done on it.</p></speech>

There is much work to be done and there has been much discussion, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, of building the resilience of young people.  I know from my experience at third level that there is an impact on young men as well as young women.</p> <p>  The camogie organisation has invested in a dedicated player welfare and inclusion co-ordinator who is doing specific work on body image, including with Bodywhys.  The Healthy Ireland concept has a cross-departmental approach with education, health and sport working together to deliver particular programmes.</p><p>What would be worth looking at, similar to the Healthy Ireland initiative, is an interdepartmental or cross-departmental approach with education, health and sport working together to deliver on particular programmes.  That is worth investigating and investing resources in because such a collaborative approach would yield wisdom from three different Departments with three different lenses which would be useful in terms of pulling information and programmes together.  Investment should be made specifically to help young people to overcome difficulties.  </p><p> On the issue of regulation, we could have another full committee meeting on that topic.</p></speech>

I am the Fine Gael spokesperson on sport in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I have been very heavily involved in the GAA at a local, county and national level for many years.  In terms of sport overall, having been a local authority member I am very supportive of the local sports partnerships.  They are an excellent model on the ground and provide the right channel through which to funnel funding to increase participation levels.  Do the witnesses have statistics on the male versus female participation levels across all sports?  Reference was made earlier to the lack of media promotion of camogie and ladies' sports in general and in that context it would be prudent for the federation, on behalf of all sports, to make a submission to the Future of Media Commission, which is looking at all forms of media.  I suggest that the witnesses make a submission to the commission on the lack of promotion of women's sport in the media.</p> <p>  I am delighted that the GPA and the WGPA have amalgamated.  I sat on the board of the GPA for two years on behalf of the GAA.  It is an excellent representative body and I am delighted that it is working so well.  However, it is unacceptable that ladies travelling the same highways and byways, going to training and putting in the same effort are not being recompensed.  This must be addressed immediately.  </p> <p>  On the question of assets and sporting facilities, I am a strong believer in the one club model.  That is the way forward, to be quite honest.  It makes sense that we all use one facility and pool our resources to maximise the benefits for all.  I would not like to see a situation where there is a pitch somewhere that is just for ladies GAA.  A pitch should be a pitch for all and we must work together.  I would love to see a situation where all of the organisations are under a single umbrella, which is the GAA family.  We should have one GAA that represents all players of all GAA sports.  Do the witnesses see that happening within the next three to five years?  I feel very strongly about this and would love to see it happening.  Where do the witnesses see things going over the next three to five years?</p></speech>

We work very closely with the GAA.  Often there is a perception out there that we live in little individual bubbles and do not communicate but everything that we do every day, as associations, is linked in to the GAA.  The one club idea is an example of how well that has worked in recent years.  That concept is being promoted throughout the country and we are trying to build it up more.</p> <p>  From a national point of view, we have made super strides in the past three years in particular and I would envisage greater links being forged in the GAA family over the next three to five years.  I see us all being tied together more closely as a Gaelic games family but in a format that will help everybody so that we are all able to promote and develop our own games at the level required.  If one looks at the size of the associations, all three are very large.  To pull everybody together would require a huge amount of work in terms of things like changes to playing rules, dealing with female versus male players and so on.  We are currently working on a format whereby we can be one body but also be very cognisant of differences and where the female associations can be developed to the same level as the male association.  That is what we are working on.  As I said previously, we are all GAA members and are all part of the GAA family.  We want to see a more united and stronger Gaelic games family in the coming years and within three to five years I can see greater unity developing.</p></speech>

As Ms O'Rourke has outlined, for the last three years we have had a memorandum of understanding with the GAA and that has seen progression and development in leaps and bounds.  It may not have been visible until 2021 because Covid delayed a lot of the launches of joint projects last year.  We have been working on a joint coaching initiative and a player pathway coaching framework, for example, at a national level.  Work is ongoing at both club and national level, including with the one club initiative.  We are not suggesting that there is a specific need but that there is a need for more facilities to accommodate the increased number of female players.  The GAA was established with male members and had X number of facilities.  We have seen huge growth in the ladies' games and we need additional facilities to cope with that growth.  If it happens under the one club model, that is absolutely perfect but again, there are issues around managing time, equity of access and so on.  We also have situations where clubs are not joined up.</p> <p>  There will be huge progression over the next few years in the Gaelic games family.  I welcome the suggestions that will come from our members around areas they think we can do more on.  We launched our national development plan last year and got great insights from our members on ways to work more closely together with the GAA and we are continuing to do so.  Our relationship with the LGFA has never been stronger.  We have been able to iron out lots of issues and things that were happening ten or 15 years ago are not happening now because of that increased engagement.  That is benefiting all of our members at all levels across the associations and we will continue with that engagement.  There is a really positive attitude to collaboration across the Gaelic games family.</p></speech>

They have spoken very eloquently about the importance of the visibility of their sports, particularly on television.  I am a League of Ireland fan and for years we have been without coverage of games.  This year it struck me that with the launch of the streaming app, what I was really looking forward to was access to the club and the team I support and being able to watch them live when they are playing in Ballybofey or Derry.  Are the witnesses content that enough is happening to make games available to the hardcore fans who really want to be there, as well as in terms of providing access to the more high-profile games about which they have spoken so eloquently?</p> <p>  There has been a lot of talk about centres of excellence.  I refer to places like the Garvaghey Centre in Tyrone and the centres in Derry and Clare which have also been in the news.  Not mentioning any centre specifically, are the witnesses satisfied that women are getting equal access to those centres of excellence?  </p> <p>  Today the GAA launched its strategic plan for 2021 to 2026 but there was only one woman on the steering group involved in the production of that plan.</p><p>There is only one woman involved in that steering group.  Are the witnesses concerned that the issues that have been raised today may not be given priority in terms of that review?</p><p> Those are my three questions, if any of the witnesses wishes to respond.</p></speech>

Now that there is such powerful equipment, such as handheld devices like phones, people are becoming increasingly innovative around streaming.  That can only auger well for female sport.  What struck me, when the pandemic hit first and there was no live sport, was that when sports shows were trying to fill the void and were going back to archive footage, there were very few female sport archives into which they could delve, beyond footage of the likes of Sonia O'Sulllivan and Katie Taylor.</p> <p>  The pandemic has shown that we can be very innovative.  The streaming of sport is becoming more common.  That is going to help the visibility of women's sport at a local as well as national level.  That type of work should be supported.  Last year, the Federation of Irish Sport took on the opportunity to showcase sport, working with national and governing bodies around specific events and games to highlight what could be done with live streaming.  We need to see more of that.  We will certainly be leading on that in supporting organisations in the live streaming of both male and female sport.</p></speech>

Both Ms O'Rourke and I also sit on the GAA's Coiste Bainist&iacute;, so we are present at the most senior table of the GAA's organising committee.  As far as the strategic planning goes, we have been invited to participate and I have already had the opportunity to participate in one of the sessions guiding the strategic plan. Therefore, there are definitely many opportunities for us to participate there.  While it is disappointing that there is only one woman involved, it is not necessarily a symbol of who will be consulted as the process goes through.</p> <p>  In terms of streaming, the Camogie Association started streaming around two years ago now.  Last year, thanks to the Covid-19 resilience funding that we received, we were able to stream all, bar one, of our championship fixtures.  That was down to the additional funding that we received from Government, which we were able to allocate to streaming.  Because people were not going to be attending games, we had no income from gates.  That came from Government support instead.  We have allocated an amount of money for streaming this year, but it will cover approximately half of the fixtures to be played in our fixture schedule.  It is like any of these things - now that we have done it, our members expect it and we want to provide it all of the time, but it does require resources.</p> <p>  On the centre of excellence, I will defer to Ms Begley and her colleagues, who I know have been doing some research on that.  Perhaps she will want to comment on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1514" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021042700002#G00400"><p>Ms McNulty has covered the fact that we are engaged with the GAA in its strategic plan for the coming years.</p> <p>  On streaming, we covered all of our games last year.  Much of that was due to the fact that we received additional funding.  In respect of this year, we have plans for the coming league season and what is to be done, which will be announced shortly.</p> <p>  In relation to some of the queries that we receive in respect of the centres of excellence, in many counties there is fantastic access.  Of course, there is a cost.  For facilities like that, none of us expects to get something for nothing.  We expect to contribute towards that.  In relation to that, all of the centres for excellent would have got capital grants.  In areas where the female players do not have that access, there is an onus on Government, that has awarded the capital grants, to follow up on the applications for female access to ensure that the access is there.  Overall, there is good co-operation in most of the centres of excellence.</p></speech>

While there is a one-club model option available at club level, there is no similar framework or template available for a one-county model.  I think it was in the last GAA strategic plan.  Perhaps it will be revisited.  It is pertinent to the Senator's third point around the new strategic plan.  It would be a welcome priority if that option was available to further co-operation and collaboration at county board level.</p> <p>  In the experience of the female teams, there are teams that do not have consistent and fair access.  There are times when female players are used in fundraising campaigns, as alluded to by Ms O'Rourke in respect of capital grant applications.  There are times when females feel hard done by and it is an issue that warrants a closer focus and mechanisms for providing fair and equal access to female county players on a consistent basis.</p></speech>

One of the questions I want to ask is the following. Can the witnesses provide an update on the feasibility assessment of the integration of the three organisations, and did the witnesses have any input into it?</p> <p>  I coached both ladies football and camogie.  The one-club model is fine, but it is as Ms Begley said a moment ago.  I remember us having to go out to train after nine in the evening, fitting ourselves in or having to go out early in the morning.  If it was raining, they would not allow us to train because the male footballers and hurlers wanted to train then.  There is an issue with access.  I believe that Armagh is the only county in which the ladies gaelic football team has its own grounds.  That definitely is an issue, and always has been.</p> <p>  It was always a bugbear of mine that the ladies are only regarded as associate members of the GAA, which means that in most clubs they do not have a vote, for example, in the AGMs and the election of the chairman, which is very important.  It is something which should definitely be pursued.  I never agreed with it.  It has always been an example of inequality.</p> <p>  Following on from the 20x20 campaign, which seemed to be so successful, is there anything similar planned?  Something like that would work.  Obviously, the coverage in the media is disappointing.  We have a national broadcaster in RT&Eacute;.  Do the witnesses think it should show more women's sport?</p></speech>

We have made great strides in that.  There will be more to be seen on that in the coming months and years.</p> <p>  In relation to membership and the one-club model, I would say that most of our members are also full members of the GAA.  While I am a member of my local ladies club, I am a full member of the GAA with voting rights.  We encourage ladies to become full members rather than associate members.  </p></speech>

Because of the way 2020 turned out, we have not had the opportunity to press that as quickly as we could, but it is being worked on currently.</p><p>RT&Eacute; is one of our broadcast partners and it has made a significant commitment to increasing the amount of women's sport that it shows and also the female commentators that it engages on its various sports programmes, as we have seen in recent years.  All of the broadcasters have opportunities to increase their broadcasting.</p><p> With regard to the review, to which Ms O'Rourke referred, what is under way at the moment is a review of the inter-county funding scheme for female inter-county players, and a comparison with the male players.  That is under way and we are awaiting results.</p><p> On the issue of one club, my understanding is that, once they join the club, the majority of people would be full members if it is one club.  Where there is a separate camogie club and GAA club, there may be different membership options available, so perhaps there is a disparity in the make-up of different clubs across the country.</p><p> With regard to the 20x20 campaign, at the closing of the campaign, we knew it had encouraged clubs, units and individuals to continue to make pledges and continue to commit to the ethos and ideals behind the 20x20 campaign.  We would all have loved to reach our full potential in delivering on those in 2020 but it will come.</p></speech>

It was a huge success and what it did is that, for the first time in the history of women's sport in Ireland, it unified everybody into coming together.  Large organisations and smaller, niche and emerging organisations were all part of the one piece of infrastructure in this country, and it was a huge success.  At the moment, we are not looking at another campaign but we realise it was a real success, and that is a credit to the founders of the campaign, Heather Thornton and Sarah Colgan.  We are considering trying to maximise the position of women in sport around a different type of campaign.</p></speech>

On sports capital, we talked about high performance but I would like to get feedback on the local level and see whether licence agreements are working, and whether, when a club signs up with a ladies team as part of its application through a licence agreement, there is fair play subsequently.  Perhaps the witnesses could come back to me on that side of things.</p> <p>  Leading on from that, in regard to sports capital, do the witnesses think a land purchase grant for ladies teams and ladies sports should be considered in future rounds of the sports capital programme, rather than just development grants?  Would initial purchase grants for land help clubs that cannot find a partner and cannot be part of an established club in terms of capital?</p> <p>  I want to ask about the sports monitor.  Over the years, we have seen that the figures in regard to women's participation are improving, which is positive, although there is a long way to go.  As we head into the middle of 2021, do the witnesses feel that the targets set out in the national sports policy need to be reviewed and need to be more ambitious?</p> <p>  The issue of the rescue package secured last summer was touched on.  I was in the Department at the time and would not have envisaged then where we would be now, heading into May 2021.  How much more do the witnesses think is needed and do they feel further investment from the State is required at this time, especially due to Covid?</p></speech>

With regard to the sports monitor, in terms of the participation rates and what is outlined in the national sports policy, obviously, all indicators are that active participation is on the rise.  However, we are in the middle of a pandemic when people cannot go about their normal business, so people have readjusted and instead of having a work-life balance, they are having a life-work balance.  What I would like to see is some type of campaign to stimulate that behaviour in a sustainable way beyond Covid.  I am sure that when we get back into normal life, people will get caught up.  We need to try to ensure that those who are active now and who were not active before can be enticed to stay active by either going to formal exercise and being a member of a club, or by being active on their own or in small groups, with supports from those like the local sports partnerships.</p> <p>  In terms of further investment, the federation is currently carrying out a Covid-19 impact survey with all of our members.  When that survey has been collated, interpreted and shared with the committee, it will make for interesting reading.  It is important to point out that we are four months into the year for our sports organisations and they have not been able to generate income in the way they normally would.  We will be working with the Department officials around a second resilience fund.  It will be needed but, as we all know, when we invest in sport and physical activity in this country, we do get a return on that investment, which will be very important going forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1526" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad McNulty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021042700002#H00600"><p>As Ms O'Connor noted, the move to individual sport and recreational activity has been strong, and that has been the pattern for a long time.  Much of the dropout from team sport happens in teenage years and females move into individual sport.  On the impact of Covid-19 on team sport, it is going to be years before we see the impact of that on underage players and whether underage players are going to return to the sport.  With equipment-based sport and stick-based sport, there is the question of the impact of the loss of a year's playing time and whether the loss of skill level is going to be detrimental to the sport.  Additional effort is required to ensure people return to team sport.  A significant impact and effort is required in the development of recreational team sport.  We need that sense that when people are retired from sport, finish their college career and are in the workforce, they can actually go back and do recreational sport.  We have seen it take off with tag rugby, softball and games like that.  We should invest in recreational forms of Gaelic games.  It does come back a little bit to facilities and whether people are going to prioritise a championship game for an adult or juvenile team against a recreational activity.  That is part of the ongoing challenge but it is going to need investment.</p> <p>  From a resilience funding point of view, we had no gates last year at county level for club championships or at national level.  Again, there have been four months without games activity this year and no sign of dates for when we will be allowed to welcome people back to watch our matches in person.  There is a huge need for resilience funding.  Last year, the funding for the inter-county championships ensured that those games happened and that series happened.  This year, we are trying to run all of our competitions, from leagues through to championships, and support will be required.</p></speech>

Support has been proposed within our overall Government grant but there is no confirmation on that yet for 2021.</p><p>If a short-term subsidy or support was available, it would be a priority and most welcome to help the running of the games for the season ahead</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1529" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021042700002#J00200"><p>The funding we received last year was very important, as other speakers have alluded to.  When we received it last year we were ready for the championship and we were able to pay travel expenses for the players.  This is a challenge that we as associations must look at over the coming years.  When one talks of equality and equity of investment from Government to our inter-county players, the associations must also look at that.  I am aware that the ladies football and camogie do not have the same commercial power that the GAA has to invest in the GPA so that is going to be a challenge for our associations over the coming years.</p> <p>  On the facilities, given that we are looking at moving closer to the GAA and moving closer as one organisation with all the codes involved, I believe the way to go is to look at the facilities for all within that so it is not separating the women's games out to facilities on their own.  This would only put a divide between us while we are trying to come closer together at this point.</p> <p>  I also fear for the participation of our youth and teenage players who have missed out on a year.  Last year, with more people working at home and more people who had been working in Dublin moving back to their homes around the country, we actually saw an increase in adult membership.  What will happen the youngsters, however, who have missed out on so much?  It is important to get them and the teenagers back into enjoying the game again.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for their contributions, which were very informative.  There were lots of positives and other things that we should not be proud of.  The significant disparity in funding is simply not good enough in this day and age.  We need to change this and address the disparity from a policy point of view.</p> <p>  I want to speak to the really exciting growth in women's sport and increased attendances.  As a spectacle, it is excellent and it holds its own.  I have tuned in to many of the women's camogie and GAA matches and it is incredibly entertaining.  The skill level is through the roof.  Being from Cork, we have relied on the ladies' teams for success over the past couple of years.  I have certainly been very much tuned in to it as a spectacle more so over recent years.</p> <p>  I have a question for Ms O'Connor, or any of our witnesses who wish to take it.  What can be learned from other codes?  We have seen in athletics that two of Ireland's biggest success stories are Sonia O'Sullivan and Phil Healy.  Ms Healy has been making incredible inroads recently with personal best after personal best.  It appears to be very much equal footing for male and female in the athletics.  I am not sure if that has always been the way but it certainly is the case since I have been watching sport.  I wonder if this is because it is an Olympic event and an international sport?  What we can learn from tennis, for example?  This is a sport that comes from a place where there was significant disparity between male and female participants but is now almost reaching the stage of parity.  It is not perfect yet but Serena Williams is just as well-known as Roger Federer.  While I am not sure how well paid Ms Williams is, there is almost parity of recognition there.  Winter sports is another good example.  In winter sports such as alpine, cross country or biathlon skiing there is almost equal parity in TV coverage, crowd attendance and participation.  Have studies been done into how that was achieved and why this is the case?  Is there something we in Ireland can learn from that?</p> <p>  On the growth of Irish women's sport and Irish women's rugby, my sister played for Ireland in the Rugby World Cup in Edmonton, Canada, in 2006.  It was a very proud moment.  Since then, women's rugby has gone from strength to strength.  I am not sure if that is because she left the team, but they have had huge success.  I just wanted to give a plug to her while I was talking about it.</p></speech>

He made a very good point.  These are also individual sports, but if one considers the Gaelic games family, the ladies football game is in its infancy.  It is not even 50 years old yet, whereas its male counterpart is significantly older.  There is learning and sharing of knowledge, but the one thing we should not get mixed up in is comparing ourselves to other sports, or comparing sports with sports.  There are different ingredients that make them up.  Sport in Ireland is growing exponentially among females.  It is important that they see the opportunity to participate as equal to men.  That starts not even in primary school, it starts at preschool.  The national sports policy also points in that direction.  We have a lot to take on board but there is a lot of sharing of knowledge by the NGBs and we are working together.  Athletics have been working with ladies Gaelic football to develop physical literary skills.  We are in a good place and it can only get better.</p></speech>

We are doing a lot right in Ireland.  Let us consider Australia, which is a sports mad nation, and the role that ladies Gaelic football has in the development of the Southern Football League, SFL there in recent years.  Players we have brought up from youth to develop their skills are now playing a major role over there.  Australia is looking at how we got to the level that we are in this country.  Their teams are basically where we were 30 years ago.  They want to develop the coverage, numbers and network of clubs we have.  There has been a sharing, especially this year, of a number of our players who have gone to Australia.  They are able to play there and to develop the game over there and come back here.  The same has happened in rugby in recent years, when one considers the number of players who have come through Gaelic games and who then go on to rugby and so on.  There is a lot of sharing going on and a lot of development within the associations.  We have done a lot and achieved a lot in a number of years.</p></speech>

The new structure of the organisation and the governance structure is about representing all players equally.  We feel there is a piece in the visibility area so that male and female players are represented equally.  Everything that we do now is pushing the agenda for male and female players as well.  I hope it sends a very strong message out and will continue to lead in that visibility piece.  Some research was done in the UK, where the Women's Sport Trust projected that the women's sports industry would grow to &pound;1 billion by 2030.  Key to that was the visibility piece.  Projecting all players equally on an equal platform is, we feel, a very worthwhile contribution to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1535" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad McNulty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021042700002#K00100"><p>In terms of the sports mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan, the male and female competitions tend to be scheduled at the same time and coverage is joint equal.  There is a piece around that.  When we consider what has happened internationally with Title IX in the US where there was forced investment in women's sports and the same amount has to be put into women's sports as male sports when it comes to education at a sporting college or publicly funded education, that changed how sports appears and is funded in the US.</p> <p>  With the Gaelic games family, the work that has been put in at a voluntary level has to be acknowledged, and that is what, over 120 years, and longer for the men's game, has brought the depth and breadth of club interaction and the value of our sports in our local communities across every village in the country, whether it is a camogie stronghold or a football stronghold.  The power of Gaelic games is there due to the voluntary status, the amateur status of the game and the contribution of everybody over the years.  Camogie and hurling have earned us UNESCO status, which is remarkable and we do not celebrate it enough.</p> <p>  Where we have seen shifts, for example, in tennis, they have come when they have balanced up the prize funds.  We still do not have it in golf and other games, but where the prize funds that are available are the same and the competition is deemed to be of equal value, then you are getting a higher perception of the value of the sport for broadcasters and de facto for everybody else who is watching as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1536" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1555" speakername="Chris Andrews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021042700002#K00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their interesting presentations.  The questions and answers that followed have been interesting and enlightening.</p> <p>  I have personally benefited hugely from the LGFA and the Camogie Association because I have two young daughters and they have gone through the system, including the Cumann na mBunscoil competition in schools.  They played for Ballinteer St John's GAA club and attended Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;osag&aacute;in where they participated in the camogie schools finals, which was great.  They were part of the Dublin camogie development squad and they were part of the Dublin minors for a short period.  Now, they are in Holland where Mary Gavin is looking after them in Den Haag GAA club.  Any investment in camogie or any sport is fantastic and is repaid fivefold.</p> <p>  I noticed that as my daughters progressed with their sports only two of their mentors were female and one of their female mentors joined the football club, which was great.  However, all the rest of the mentors were men.  I am not disparaging anything because everyone was great to my children, including Mr. Paul Beecher and Mr. Pat Martin who, sadly, passed away not too long ago.  When I watch games I see very few women mentors.  Have the organisations present looked at attracting more women mentors?  I ask because when one cannot see it then one cannot be it.</p> <p>  I think Ms Begley mentioned the disparity in the funding of men's and women's games.  Everybody has said that the disparity is completely unacceptable.  Ms McNulty, in her presentation, called for the establishment of a task force and I agree.  I also believe that we must prioritise an increase in funding for ladies' sports, particularly for the LGFA and the Camogie Association.</p> <p>  As Deputy Mythen alluded to, I remember the times when women would be pushed off their pitch when the men arrived.  The men also get a choice of times and dates while the girls had to play on a Friday night, for example.  We must change the unfairness and inequality and there is quite a while to go.</p> <p>  In terms of mentoring, have the organisations considered ways to increase the number of women mentors for ladies' teams?  I thank the witnesses for their patience.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1537" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021042700002#K00300"><p>The LGFA is very conscious of the lack of female mentors and female referees and we have very much looked into it in recent years.  We ran a very successful leadership programme that included mentoring and officiating at games and bringing young women through that.  In many ways it is a confidence thing.  Now, as inter-county players and club players retire, we are looking at ways to make it easier for them to get involved, give them the skill sets and education to get involved with teams, and have the confidence to coach teams across all levels.  I think it goes right down to the underage levels and if it could start there.</p> <p>  When we looked at this a few years ago, one of the initiatives we started was Gaelic football for mothers and others.  We found we had a lot of women who just brought the kids to the gate of a club and left because they did not grow up with ladies' football and knew nothing about the sport.  It was not for them at the time so they felt they knew nothing about it.  By starting that scheme, it gave them the skills.  It is all recreational football.  What they do now is they get involved with their local clubs and helping out with the teams there, and through that we get others too.</p> <p>  We also have programmes to bring inter-country players through to the next level where there is mentoring.  We have noticed we have had good success at school level and club level with that in recent years.  We also see now the odd county manager or county trainer coming through.  It is happening and it will be a process but it is also to build that confidence and the education part that goes with it for these women.</p></speech>

It is great to hear about his daughters' involvement through the ages, and I hope they are still getting involved over in Den Haag.  Mary Gavin will look after them well over there.</p> <p>  Similar to Helen, we recognise it is an issue.  As mentioned in the Irish Sports Monitor study, there is a huge gap in volunteering and participation.  The gap is much larger even in volunteering than in participation for women than it is for men.  The type of programme we have created to try to bridge that gap is something called the MNA programme, so it is motivate, nurture and aspire, where we educate parents and young people to play together first, then we teach the parents some of the basic coaching skills, and then we train them up as full-on coaches.  We assign them a mentor within a club so they can learn, develop and build confidence in the skill of coaching and, it is hoped, stay involved in the club.</p> <p>  That is funded by Sport Ireland.  It has been a hugely successful and popular project with more than 150 clubs participating.  It is through dedicated and focused initiatives like that that we can make the changes that need to happen.  We receive a grant of &euro;20,000 per year to run that programme.  To scale it up and have people run and co-ordinate it, it would need a little bit more help and more people on the ground to deliver it.  The overall issue is one we want to tackle and are committed to tackling in our new national development plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1539" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021042700002#K00500"><p>Under the Women in Sport policy, Sport Ireland has just released a Women in Sport coaching research report.  Nearly 2,500 female coaches completed the survey.  A total of 86% of them felt there was a lack of a female coaching network, so Sport Ireland is now going to work on that.  It is very important to look not just at the foundation level.  There is a glut of female coaches at young levels but there is a distinct lack of elite female coaches at the higher levels and from a high performance point of view for both international and national teams.  I know Sport Ireland has just set up a women in coaching working group with plans for an elite female coaching network.  That is very important.  We need to have elite female coaches training our elite teams, both male and female.  That is a good piece of work that is going on at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1540" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gemma Begley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021042700002#K00600"><p>I will comment on what we would do to support players to get back involved.</p><p>First, it is an awful commitment to your inter-county playing career.  It is probably natural to step back for a couple of years anyway.  We have already outlined the commitment required in terms of work flexibility and the number of training sessions per week and things like that.  There is, therefore, probably a natural lull for the female inter-county players.</p><p> In terms of some of the things we do, the Jim Madden GPA leadership programme is there to help develop those skills within the females and males together.  It is a joint programme.  We also have good partnerships with the likes of Setanta College in training players up with sport science disciplines, in particular, to get them involved, it is hoped, through back-room teams and into coaching pathways within the sport to bring them back in.</p><p> As I said, there would be a slight understanding of accessible ways to get female former players back involved supporting teams in a way that is doable for them when their life stages have nearly moved on at that point.  It would be good to see more work and growth in that as well as mentoring opportunities, as I said, with a lesser time commitment.  It will be very welcome.</p></speech>

It has come to my contribution.  I thank the witnesses very much and most sincerely for their presentations.  I hope they feel they have got plenty of time to expand on the points made in their presentations.  I have a couple of questions with which I would like to begin.</p> <p>  First, I was very struck by Ms O'Rourke's opening statement in which she stated that in 2007, she received 24% funding by Sport Ireland compared with just 9% in 2020 despite membership having risen by 32% in the same period.  Will she expand upon that?  Will she provide us with any sort of information on any engagement she has had with Sport Ireland on core funding and what response she has received?  Will she expand upon that point to give us an insight on why that is?  It seems a very surprising that their funding would drop.</p> <p>  Again, I thank Ms McNulty for acknowledging Cavan's win of the Nancy Murray Cup and, of course, their premiere final in 2020, and her acknowledgement of our star, R&oacute;is&iacute;n O'Keeffe, from Lacken Camogie Club.  I believe the county camogie and ladies' football teams are still waiting on championship dates while the men's have already been set.  Will Ms McNulty comment on or give us any insight into that?  Also, are the minor championship girls going to get their opportunity to play this year?  I believe that will be the case for the boys.</p> <p>  I really want to make the observation that one thing I have not heard mentioned today is the local sports partnerships within our local authorities.  I know, particularly in counties Cavan and Monaghan, they have been wonderful in terms of initiatives and encouraging and engaging the participation of women of all ages in sport, from the recreational to perhaps the more competitive.  I acknowledge the work of both local authorities and the local sports partnership.  I believe they are working with Sport Ireland - somebody might like to comment on this - in terms of promoting women in sports through what I believe is called the Her Sport initiative.  Perhaps the witnesses know something about that on which they can expand.</p> <p>  I certainly agree with Ms O'Connor's comment that a life-work campaign rather than a work-life campaign makes far more sense and creates more balance in our lives.  A campaign like that would have huge benefits, not just for women's participation but also for mental health.  Coming out of Covid-19, it is something we should seriously consider.  I congratulate Ms O'Connor on leading the charge in the 20x20 campaign.  Can she give us any bullet points on that or have any main lessons been learned on that?  She might like to make some comments on those.</p> <p>  We are coming near the end of the presentations today.  In terms of Ms Begley's organisation, are there any final comments or observations she would like to make?  That is my line of questioning.  I will begin with Ms O'Rourke if that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1545" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021042700002#L00500"><p>In my opening statement, I mentioned our membership figures in 2007.  Between 2007 and 2020, there was a 32% increase.  When we started off as an association in 1974, there were no grants available initially for how we were going to build the association and get the finance required to run the initiative and run the game.</p> <p>  It was, therefore, basically built on a compulsory membership structure, which we have every year, including a compulsory injury fund structure.  That 32% increase we would have seen would have brought a big difference to our association financially over the years, whereas the Sport Ireland funding has remained static.  In those years as well, the country went through a recession where funding for sport was stalled and it was quite limited.  We would always be knocking on the door of Sport Ireland seeking to increase our core grant, which has been increased gradually in recent years.  It is still not to the level of the participation rates we have as an association, however.</p> <p>  With regard to the championships, we are currently working on dates.  What we have been working on, however, is the previous Government announcement on the opening of the adult inter-county teams going back training and getting prepared for national leagues.  It is, therefore, getting confirmation we are moving to the next step but there is work going on.  We hope that within the next two weeks, we will have that structure and get the announcement we can proceed with championships, etc., over the coming months.  That is being worked on behind the scenes with the counties and the opportunity available to play them this year, it being a unique year.</p> <p>  Last year when the pandemic hit, we had to make decisions on the minors.  We took the decision that underage competitions had to be stalled.  Some of them had gone as far as provincial level in the schools, but as regards national level, everything was done with safety first and it will be the same again this year.  If there is an opportunity, and there is permission for our underage teams to go back to inter-county football, of course, we will be looking at running the minor league this coming year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1546" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad McNulty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021042700002#L00600"><p>Similar to Ms O'Rourke, we are waiting on Government guidance.  We are all anxiously anticipating the announcements that are due on Thursday evening as regards any development in a return to sport for adults and the permission to run further competitions.  So far, we have been given recommendations and guidance to plan for national leagues and put those structures and dates in place, which we have done.  We have contingency plans in place depending on the recommendations that come from Government over the coming weeks.</p> <p>  The biggest challenge we have, and again it is one I ask the committee to consider how this might run into the future, is operating as a 32-county organisation.  We operate in two different jurisdictions and, right now, the Government guidance and public health guidance in both jurisdictions is dramatically different, which causes difficulties for our members.  In Ulster, for example, we have three counties that are actually not in Northern Ireland.  When Northern Ireland makes changes to competition regulations or participation regulations, it will change and impact the wider province.  That is definitely a challenge.</p> <p>  Our ambition is to run as many, if not all, competitions that would normally be scheduled in a year.  That was our ambition at the start of the year.  We sent out a draft fixtures schedule in December.  Obviously, the fact that it is now 27 April and we have not managed to have any competitions yet, although we look forward to starting our Littlewoods national league on 15 May, will limit what we can do.  We are guided by what age groups and cohorts can come back to training and in what way, what competitions we are permitted to allow, when inter-county travel will be permitted and where Gaelic games are seen on the performance pathway.  At club level, we have recreational teams and at inter-county level, our teams are elite.  Yet, according to the national sports policy, we are slightly between the lines there.</p><p>Therefore, we rely on Government direction on that.</p><p> We have great relationships with several local sports partnerships and other organisations.  We work with the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, on wheelchair camogie.  Our liaison with local sports partnerships is particularly strong in Waterford at the moment.  I made contact with all the sports partnerships before Christmas and I look forward to establishing new initiatives with them over the coming months and years.  I thank the Chairman for that recommendation.</p></speech>

We need to do the research, formulate the campaign, utilise the information received, target the groups and use what is at our disposal, including the media.  We established media partnerships that worked.  When we were targeting, we used human sentiment.  I think we were able to unify a large force behind us and that is why the campaign was a success.

It has been great since we integrated.  Since December it has been really positive.  The interaction with the male players has been brilliant.  Obviously, equality is a core pillar of the new organisation.  Collectively we are here today calling for equitable funding as one of the outputs.  We feel it is a worthwhile investment in the female players.  The games need to be the best product they can be to give the players the best chance to be the best players they can be.  The growth of the games, the increase in participation and increased coverage represent a sound investment for the future of our games and a worthwhile recognition of the top exponents of our national games.</p></speech>

It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely from outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  With regret, I will not permit a member to participate where they do not adhere to this constitutional requirement to be physically within the precincts.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members participating via Microsoft Teams to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contributions to the meeting.</p> <p>  I now ask Ms Anne Graham to make her opening statement.  She has five minutes and I again thank her for agreeing to appear at such short notice.</p></speech>

I understand the committee wishes to focus upon the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2019 and, in particular, the potential legislative provision for the use of e-scooters.  To assist me in dealing with the committee's subsequent questions, I am joined by Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO with the authority.</p> <p>  The authority recognises that e-scooters and e-bikes can contribute to the increased use of sustainable transport and provide an alternative to the private car mode.  However, these new forms of transport do give rise to new issues that require careful consideration in developing an appropriate legislative framework.  Some of the issues that are relevant to those considerations include the quality of road surfaces, given the small wheel diameter of e-scooters and the more significant implications of road surface defects for e-scooters than for other vehicles; minimum age requirements for the use of e-scooters on public roads; whether certain safety equipment such as helmets should be mandatory or discretionary; the speed limitations that should apply to such vehicles; whether e-scooters should be required to use cycle tracks instead of the main carriageway where such cycle tracks are provided; and the types of roads and specific traffic lanes that e-scooters should be permitted to use.</p> <p>  Many of these issues involve balancing competing demands and seeking to achieve the optimal equilibrium in respect of those demands.  This is particularly so when road space is constrained and perfect solutions such as separate facilities for e-scooters are simply not feasible.  However, in carefully addressing the relevant considerations, an appropriate legislative framework can be put in place to support the operation of this new form of micro-mobility.  That concludes my introductory statement.  I trust that I can answer any queries that arise.</p></speech>

I now call on Mr. Walsh to make his opening statement.  I thank him for coming at such short notice as well.  He has five minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1560" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021042700002#B00500"><p>I should just clarify that I am not within the precincts of Leinster House.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend today.  I am joined by my colleagues, Pat Maher, director of network management, and Dr. Suzanne Meade of TII&rsquo;s road safety section.</p> <p>  I understand that the committee is undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2019.  The section of the general scheme specific to TII is in Part 6, which relates to making provision for variable speed limits.  I will first describe the work that TII is undertaking in this area and I will then go on to set out what is required in the Bill to support this work.</p> <p>  Since 2014, TII has been developing, and is currently constructing, a project on the M50 referred to as enhanced motorway operation service, eMOS.  This project will allow for the availability of lanes and the applicable speed limits of relevant stretches of roads to be controlled in a dynamic way.  This system of motorway control will improve safety and efficiency and reduce environmental impacts of traffic.  We think of this as dynamic traffic management.</p> <p>  The eMOS system is needed to address the increasing numbers of collisions and levels of congestion on the M50.  In 2019, M50 operations crews attended 1,161 incidents, which represents an average of 22 incidents each week of the year.  The M50 is congested.  In 2019, an average of 350,000 trips were undertaken on the M50 each day.  This represents an increase of 40% on 2011 figures.  The objective of eMOS is to improve safety for both road users and the people who respond to collisions and other incidents on the M50.  This improvement in safety will be achieved by establishing speed limits that are appropriate to the traffic and weather conditions and by closing lanes when required.  This level of control will also contribute to a reduction of carbon and particulate matter emissions through the elimination of "stop-start" driving.</p> <p>  The eMOS project has a budget of &euro;80 million and a benefit-to-cost ratio of 2.8:1.  The business case for the project has been reviewed and in accordance with the public spending code and has received ministerial approval.approved </p> <p>  Implementing eMOS involves the installation of 380 dynamic lane control signs on 98 gantries over 38 km of the M50.  Fibreoptic cabling, connecting to roadside weather stations and traffic sensors, will transmit information to computers at the TII&rsquo;s motorway control centre.  These computers will continuously run algorithms to determine the appropriate speed required to achieve the safest and most efficient operating conditions for those 350,000 trips undertaken on the M50 every day.</p> <p>  This dynamic speed limit and lane control system is used on motorways in the UK, in continental Europe and in North America on the approaches to major cities.  The M25 around London, the M6-M40-M42 Birmingham box and the motorways of the Netherlands are good examples.  These systems are reliable and have provided significant improvements to the safety and emissions performance of those roads.</p> <p>  Work on construction of the required infrastructure has been ongoing, almost entirely at night, for the past two years.  Work on this project relates to critical transport infrastructure.  TII personnel and contractors have worked continuously throughout the Covid-19 restrictions.  I will take this opportunity to acknowledge their work and, in particular, to thank the foreign specialist workers who have observed all quarantine restrictions and, as a consequence, have been away from their families for periods longer than initially planned for.  The work of construction and installation has progressed well and the system will be capable of going live by October of this year.</p><p> In the context of the Bill, what is required to support this work?  The setting of speed limits is a reserve function of local authorities.  The M50 motorway passes through the administrative areas of the four Dublin local authorities.  It is not feasible to seek the approval of each local authority to dynamically set and revise speed limit zones in response to rapidly changing traffic or weather conditions.  TII is not a road authority for this purpose and does not have powers to set speed limits on national roads.  The Bill must provide TII with those powers.  The Bill must also provide it with the ability to close lanes when needed.</p><p> The power of TII to provide, manage and operate the eMOS system needs to be clear.  A legislative framework that allows the system to be deployed and enforced in a practical and effective manner is required.  The legislation must reflect the dynamic nature of the system.  Speed limits will be set by the motorway control centre based on the outputs from the system, which will take into account a wide range of factors, including the computer analysis of weather and traffic conditions.  The motorway control centre staff must also be empowered to restrict the availability of traffic lanes through the use of red X and lane divert arrows displayed on over-lane digital signage.  This is required to improve the safety of road users, emergency services personnel and road workers.</p><p> This system will only be as good as the enforcement relating to it.  TII recommends that the approach reflected elsewhere in the Road Traffic Acts regarding the correctness of equipment should be applied in respect of this system.  There should be a presumption, capable of being rebutted in court, that the system is working correctly in the context of a prosecution.</p><p> The conclusion of the committee's work in the context of the pre-legislative scrutiny relating to this Bill will go a long way towards providing the legislative framework required to allow this project to deliver the benefits that it is capable of.  I invite all members who might be interested in seeing how the system is intended to operate to view a demonstration of the system if that would be of assistance to their considerations of this important legislation.  I am happy to attempt to answer any questions that the committee may have.  If my colleagues or I cannot provide a comprehensive answer today, I will provide a response as soon as practicable.</p></speech>

We spent many months talking about road haulage but the reality is that over the past 18 months, e-scooters have become an increasing feature on our roads.  The first time I saw one was probably about two years ago in Dublin.  It was a head-turner and a novelty factor but suddenly they are everywhere.  Another form of transport, if we can call it that, is probably less official than the e-scooter.  Hoverboards are being used by teenagers and young people quite a lot.  They may not be as formal in terms of a mode of transport but they are certainly being used by some children going from friends' houses to the local shop or even to school.  They should not be omitted from our discussions.</p> <p>  I read the briefing note.  It is quite interesting how this is being regulated in different countries.  The first thing we need to look at is some kind of age limit.  In some continental European countries, a person must be 14 to 16 years of age to operate an e-scooter.  They are great.  We have seen people be able to travel independently of their parents in and around their communities.  However, there are hazards associated with them.  A person needs to be a certain age to have the level of responsibility necessary to take these vehicles out on the open road or cross busy intersections.  Anything that brings about regulation in that regard is good.</p> <p>  Something that falls under different road usage is sulky racing.  This is a big feature throughout Ireland.  We are being told that section 47 of the Roads Act 1993 regulates the use of carriage driving and horse racing on open roads yet the reality is that throughout the country, including my constituency, every so often, four or five pick-up vans or jeeps barricade a motorway going four or five vehicles wide, set up a racecourse in front of all the traffic, hold all the traffic behind them and have lucrative and heavily betted on races on these motorways.  A message needs to be sent.  This is something this committee needs to do a bit of work on.  Deputy Mattie McGrath tried to bring in tighter legislation on this two years ago.  It is another abuse of our roads that this committee needs to look at.</p> <p>  I have followed the issue of dynamic speed limits with interest.  I hope I am being accurate but a major flaw in our speed limit system is the fact that local authorities get to review speed limits every five years.  This is a source of significant frustration for communities and the politicians who represent them.  It needs to be somewhat more fluid.  As politicians, we are continuously lobbied by schools or housing estates that are located in areas which, for one reason or another, have become unsafe and they want the speed limit lowered but that has to be agreed by council engineers and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The window relating to carrying out review in that regard is every five years.</p> <p>  We were informed recently that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a hugely impressive plan for Lough Dearg, with funding of more than &euro;70 million for enhancements.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland stated that by means of co-operation with the NTA, there would be an enhanced Local Link bus route around the shores of Lough Dearg taking in the Clare and Tipperary sides with a stop in Portumna in Galway.  Could Ms Graham provide an update on that?</p> <p>  We have been discussing motorway safety.  One major road safety hazard on motorways that I know of - other representatives from Clare might want to speak about - is the N18 junction exit for Barefield.  Motorist travel on a motorway at 120 km per hour, with some even exceeding that speed, and suddenly they must come off it at a 60&deg; angle and onto the off-ramp for the Barefield exit.  It is so sharp.  Cars have lost control there.  This also needs to be in the mix.  Yes, we should be talking about dynamic speed limits and enhanced speed regulation coming into Dublin, which is the biggest arterial route in the country, but we also need a focus on that junction.</p></speech>

Enforcement is another issue.  I am not sure what I can usefully say today other than TII does not condone the racing of horses on motorways.</p> <p>  In terms of the junction functionality and the safety of the N18 at Barefield, I cannot comment on the specifics of it but I can undertake to come back to the Deputy.  Certainly our safety section reviews the circumstances of any accidents on the network and if there are engineering measures that can be undertaken to improve matters, we will undertake them.</p><p> In terms of developing design standards over time, we have sections of motorway in the network that were designed to a particular standard at one time, and those standards may have move on since.  If there is a need to review the layout at certain junctures, we will undertake to do it.  I can come back to the Deputy directly on this point, if that is satisfactory.

The e-scooter issue is very specific to the technology that is now available.  We had hoverboards come into play three or four years ago and there could be some newfangled product coming out in the next year or two.  We may need to ensure the legislation is less prescriptive and more future-proofed in terms of meeting the requirements in respect of low-powered, double-axis linear vehicles.  It needs to be more encompassing of what the next product might be.</p></speech>

Has Ms Graham given any thought to what recommendation she might make on an age limit for the use of e-scooters and e-bikes?  Is the NTA looking into what is being done on age limits in other European jurisdictions and globally?  Obviously, people need to be of a responsible age to be using these types of vehicles.  Has the NTA done any review of what the speed limit should be for electric vehicles in general?  They are very low to the ground and concerns have been raised regarding the impact of the quality of road conditions.  If a user were to hit a bump travelling at a particular speed, he or she could end up in great difficulty.  Injury or possibly even the loss of life might arise from using the vehicle irresponsibly.  What are the witnesses' views in this regard?</p> <p>  We see people using these vehicles on a regular basis on the streets of Dublin.  Their use is not strictly confined to cycle lanes.  Would the witnesses recommend that these devices be used only in cycle lanes, or should they be permitted on open roads?  Should they be limited, for example, to a particular classification of roads in urban areas?</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Wash for his presentation.  I welcome his practical suggestion that TFI would invite the members of the committee to look at the eMOS system.  It seems we are only catching up with other European jurisdictions in implementing this type of technology.  It seems to be very complex.  What type of driver education does TFI intend to introduce around what looks like a fundamental and dramatic change in how the M50 will be used?  High-tech, cutting-edge technology will be employed to deliver the new system, with speed limits changing based on volumes of traffic, weather and so on.  For someone who travels to Dublin occasionally but not on a regular basis, it could be a real culture shock to find that parts of the M50 have a limit of 100 km per hour or 80 km per hour instead of 120 km per hour.  What level of educational awareness campaigning do the witnesses envisage taking place as part of this change?</p> <p>  The Chairman might ask the witnesses to respond to those questions.</p></speech>

That advice note is also available on our website.  It mostly looks at what the practice is internationally.  The author of the report, Dr. Suzanne Meade, is with me here today and I will defer to her on any specific questions relating to it.</p> <p>  We have been engaging with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, for the past couple of months on the introduction of the eMOS dynamic traffic management system.  The authority is very good at conducting campaigns of public awareness around road safety and proper driver behaviour.  We will be working in close collaboration with it to roll out a campaign.  We need to be sure about when that campaign will go into operation and that it does not happen too far in advance.  At the moment, we are looking at May or June to start a media campaign around what the new signs will mean and how people should behave when they are activated.

I will ask my colleague, Mr. Creegan, to assist me in doing so.  The NTA made observations to the Department of Transport, particularly in regard to e-scooters, at the Department's request.  They were just observations from our point of view.  We suggested that the age limit should be approximately 16 years of age for the use of e-scooters on a public road.  We also suggested the types of roads that should be considered for their permissible use.  Mr. Creegan will provide some details in this regard.</p></speech>

The pitching of the limit is linked to age limit and where the vehicles are used.  The three issues are linked together.  If the vehicles are only being used on cycle tracks, for instance, and are limited to use by older persons, one can go to a higher speed limit.  Somewhere between 16 km per hour and 25 km per hour seems to be common, with 20 km per hour being a possibility that falls in the middle.  That is the range that is happening internationally.</p> <p>  In terms of where the vehicles can safely be used, we are very comfortable that they can be used safely on cycle tracks if a speed limit is in place.  They can also be safely used on low-speed roads, particularly local roads with a speed limit of 30 km per hour, which is where they are more likely to be driven.</p><p>It gets more difficult after that as to whether one wishes to add roads to it and what particular lanes of the roads these vehicles should and can use.  There is no perfect answer there; it is a question of discussion and debate as to what is done beyond cycle tracks and local roads with 30 km/h to make it a coherent offering for people.</p></speech>

What assessment has taken place on the benefits of this system?   From his opening statement and a brief look at these types of system, they claim improvements and can point to improvements around capacity, journey times, and emissions.</p> <p>  On safety, I notice the stocktake report from March 2020 in Britain.  Our equivalent committee in Westminster is undertaking a review of smart motorway systems.  There are particular concerns regarding all-lane running or hard-shoulder running.  Will that be incorporated into the M50 system?</p> <p>  Picking up on Deputy Carey's point regarding information, reports in Britain and elsewhere refer to the need for clarity, for consistency across the system, and for people to be aware so that we do not end up in a situation, as seemed to be in Britain, where 20 years after introducing the technology, it has to be seriously examined. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1587" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021042700002#E00500"><p>On the benefits of the system, we produced a full business case, which is where the 2.8 benefit to cost ratio comes from.  It takes in a lot of factors.  The easiest way to illustrate it is that currently, during congested conditions, a trip from the M1 to the M11 in uncongested conditions takes 22 to 24 minutes.  In congested conditions it can take in excess of 70 minutes, three times as long.  An awful lot of stop-start driving is occurring.  It has been demonstrated on many road networks that if we can achieve continuous driving at an appropriate speed, many benefits can be gained, including a reduction in accidents because there are not the varying speeds across all the road users and there is a much better result in air quality in both carbon emissions and particulate matter.  We have curves on the performance of internal combustion engines.  At higher speeds, the curve is relatively flat, a minor change in operating speed at 100 km/h has very little difference for particulate matter or carbon emissions but at lower speeds, when going from below 10 km/h or 20 km/h, it is a much steeper curve.  There will be benefits from that.  If the committee wishes to see the business case, we can provide it.  It enumerates all these things.</p> <p>  On the concerns from the UK committee and smart motorways, it is a different issue.  As the Deputy points out, it is the all-lane running and the dangers to two road users in the event of them having a breakdown.  We are not introducing all-lane running.  We are conscious of the safety concern.  </p> <p>  We agree about information and clarity.  We are doing our best working with the RSA and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has also been involved.  It will be a pretty comprehensive education programme, I hope.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

Giving people advance notice if this is the road we are going down and TII's own preparations to ensure that every contingency is in place to try to have it implemented as smoothly as possible and that people are aware of what we are getting into in order that they have consistency is an important consideration in its introduction.</p> <p>  I will move on to Ms Graham and Mr. Creegan.  I return to e-scooters.  I am looking at the documents we received from the RSA and the Department.  It seems that an e-scooter with a saddle will not be covered.  That seems like an unnecessary anomaly that will cause a difficulty straight away.  More significant is the question of what roads are appropriate.  I understand that the proposals are for cycle lanes and bus lanes only.  Do Ms Graham and Mr. Creegan have an opinion on road conditions and how they should be considered?  I am conscious that some of our bus lanes, in particular, have large potholes or drains that may be a hazard.  Is that a consideration?</p> <p>   I think Mr. Creegan said that he thought within areas with a speed limit of 30 km\h would be an appropriate restriction.  There are many roads in urban settings that do not have cycle or bus lanes.  Is it appropriate to have them there too?  It seems, under the current proposals, that would not be provided for.</p></speech>

Again, that comes into the description of whether it is a bike or power bike.  That is something to be looked at in more detail when the legislation comes forward.  As Mr. Creegan indicated, we have considered the appropriate roads to be used.  We believe that a case could be made for e-scooters to be used on low-speed local roads up to 30 km/h, not just to confine them to cycle lanes and bus lanes.  We have made the point that road condition is something to be considered, not just for e-scooters but also cyclists who tend to cycle on the edge of the road where there is the potential for gullies and the like.  That is why in a move to provide better infrastructure for cyclists, it could also provide better infrastructure for e-scooters.  Our preference would be, where possible, that where there is a cycle track alongside a bus lane, that the bus lane would be reserved for buses only and the cycle lane is for cyclists and e-scooters, if they are provided for in the legislation.</p></speech>

As Ms Graham pointed out, we would not take a view on the issue of insurance, but we have noted in our review what has happened in other jurisdictions.  Some countries have required the user at purchase point to get insurance and register the vehicle.  That could be considered.</p> <p>  The point about the use of bus lanes referred in particular to areas where trams would circulate.  E-scooters have very small wheels.  While some cyclists may get caught in tram lines when crossing at a particular angle, it is much more likely that an e-scooter's smaller wheels will get caught.  That is a particular risk to this new form of transport.</p></speech>

It would have to be decided on a case-by-case basis.  Due to the head time between buses, some bus lanes are extremely busy and one would have to question whether there was enough room to cater for cyclists or e-scooters in the first place.  It is a question of examining the infrastructure and determining whether there is enough space and whether the bus service is so frequent that it would be problematic.</p></speech>

Something we are considering in terms of BusConnects is that, where possible, and certainly on the major routes into this city and major bus lanes, cyclists be removed from bus lanes by providing segregated cycling facilities.  It is not just about safety, but also about ensuring the efficiency of the bus system.  In some locations, a bus can only travel at the speed of the cyclist it is behind because there is not enough space for them to operate side by side.  The same would apply if e-scooters were allowed onto bus lanes.  Where there is a facility for cycling alongside bus lanes, in particular the busiest ones, we believe that e-scooters should not be permitted in those lanes.</p></speech>

Given the proximity of some junctions on the M50 to one another, how will this system work?  Will this increase congestion?  When one is travelling along the M8 and M7 and coming up to Naas, the speed limit drops to 100 km/h when one reaches the ball at Naas, although there are no plans for a variable speed limit at that point.  In the context of the proximity of junctions and congestion, how will that work out?  I will ask one more question at the end, if I may.</p></speech>

That is the easiest way of looking at it.  The purpose of analysing flows is to enable continuous smooth flow.  That is what will determine the appropriate speed limit to be applied at a particular time.  The Senator is absolutely right that the proximity of junctions on the M50 contributes to those circumstances we are trying to dynamically control.  One of the things we have seen recently is that, when traffic volumes on the M50 dropped due to the Covid restrictions, there was a disproportionate drop in the number of accidents on the motorway.  This is proof positive that, as congestion levels rise, there is a disproportionate rise in the number of accidents and incidents on the motorway.  We need to deal with this.  The causes are the volumes of traffic and the weaving required because of the close proximity of junctions on that particular stretch of road.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.  It is not our intention at the moment to roll this system out to other sections of the network.  It is an expensive system and it would be more difficult to justify in a business case in respect of other sections.  There are no plans for that at the moment but this Bill, if approved and enacted, would allow for it in due course.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions, following on from the information given, particularly that given by Mr. Walsh.  This variable speed limit proposal is very interesting.  There would be both positive and negative consequences to it.  This is being implemented on the M50 and will probably end up operating on the M1 and in Cork on the N40 in Senator Buttimer's constituency and on the N25 in my own.  These are highly congested motorways and dual carriageways on which this technology will probably eventually become commonplace.  Is it a two-way street in the sense that the limit on different sections of roads such as the M50, which will be empty at 11 p.m. or 12 midnight, might be increased from 80 km/h up to 100 km/h or from 100 km/h to 120 km/h  at those times, given that it is a motorway grade road?</p> <p>  Everybody who comes up to Leinster House from the south of the country will know, and others listening today will also know from travelling to matches or going to Dublin or elsewhere in the country via the N7 whether for business or pleasure, that the section of the road beyond Naas and up towards Citywest has a speed limit of 100 km/h rather than 120 km/h.  Some people who work in transport whom I have asked have told me that the reason for this is that this section is not technically motorway.  My response to this is that the limit on the N25 in Cork between Carrigtwohill and Dunkettle, which is a national road and a dual carriageway, is 120 km/h.  I will put that question to Mr. Walsh first.  Is it a two-way street or is this just another way of slowing cars down and reducing speed limits, which obviously reduces the efficiency of the national road network and which could damage the economy with regard to people driving small goods vehicles and so on?</p></speech>

The system only imposes a lowered speed limit when congestion or weather conditions require it.  At all other times, the default speed limit will apply - 100 km/h, 120 km/h or whatever the current design speed or speed limit on that road is.  Reduced speed limits will not be introduced at times when the congestion or weather conditions do not require them.  I hope that is clear.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1638" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021042700002#G01800"><p>In response to that, I do not believe it is a bad suggestion.  It definitely might be worth looking at.  Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting many taxi drivers from around the country.  Many members of the committee were on that call.  One particular concern for many of them were the new changes to speed limits in Dublin.  This is of great concern to them because, obviously, when one is a taxi driver or operating a hackney service, time is of the essence.  If we are to install this multimillion euro software to control speed limits, we should consider increasing the limit from 100 km/h to 120 km/h in a safe manner at night on roads that are capable of allowing for such a speed limit, which is the same limit as prevails across the entire national motorway network with the exception of the M50 and the N7, which is classified as a national road.  That is a suggestion I would like to put forward.  It would be wise to consider it now while work is ongoing.  I will finish with Mr. Walsh on that point.</p> <p>  It is great to have Ms Graham here again.  I know there is a lot going on in the NTA at the minute with regard to sustainable travel.  I thank her for meeting me recently.  With regard to the changes coming down the line in respect of e-scooters, we have all been contacted by people who work in this industry and hope to get involved in e-scooters from an economic standpoint.  I have a concern with regard to road safety.  As the CEO of the NTA, is Ms Graham confident that the RSA's current curriculum for new drivers coming on to the road in Ireland is at the standard required to ensure the safety of people operating e-scooters, or propelled vehicles as I believe they are currently described by the Department of Transport?  Does it need to be changed to reflect these coming changes?  I will give my own perspective in the time I have.  Compared to many on this call, it is only recently that I secured my full licence.  We have to do an awful lot more to teach drivers how to share the road with people who are cycling or using e-scooters.  The number of people utilising sustainable travel is booming.  I refer to cycling and the use of other devices.  From my recollection, there was very little on the driver training curriculum at the time I was doing my driving test with regard to sharing roads, particularly in densely populated urban areas.</p></speech>

I am not familiar enough with the driver curriculum to answer because it has been many years since I did my own driving test.  It is certainly something we will consider, in conjunction with the RSA.  It would be more appropriate for the authority to respond on that question.  If the Deputy has identified a gap, we will certainly have a look at it and engage with the authority on the education of car drivers about more vulnerable road users.  We will check that out.</p></speech>

For many people, it has been many years and, in some cases, decades since they got their licence.  I wonder where we are heading with that.  Is it something that is putting people in danger unnecessarily?  There is definitely work for the Department of Transport to do in this regard.  There is also work for the semi-State bodies, including the NTA, TII or the RSA, if its staff are listening in today, to do with regard to improving driver safety to protect cyclists and people using e-scooters.</p><p>I do not want a situation where people are unnecessarily killed or injured because of a lack of education and awareness.  Much debate goes on in areas on whether people should wear helmets.  Above all, we need to try to prevent a situation whereby people put vulnerable road users - that was the term used - in unnecessary danger.  That certainly needs to follow on from this and I hope it would be welcomed by people who are lobbying for cycling and e-scooters.</p></speech>

People can see the collegiality with which the committee operates.</p> <p>  I will start with Mr. Peter Walsh.  On some level with eMOS there is probably an element of being won over in the sense of a variable speed limit.  There is not much point in asking the TII representatives whether this will be reviewed in the sense that this will be on the basis of minute by minute and hour by hour.  This will be reviewed on every timeline from the point of view of producing best results in real time.  We have all been on the M50 when it has been in free flow and when it has been a car park.  Obviously, if there were applicability to other serious parts of infrastructure in future, it is something that will come and that needs to be welcomed.</p> <p>  There is an element of this that relates to the providers.  The TII representatives mentioned algorithms that will be operated for best-case scenarios.  There might even be some artificial intelligence and learning so that what works one day is improved for the next day.  I am seeking an answer in respect of providers and whether they have been tried and tested in doing work like this previously.  I am keen to ensure we get the best bang for our buck.  There have been various difficulties at times with State procurement of IT systems and we should try to avoid that.</p> <p>  The TII representatives might have to reply to me in writing in answer to another question.  It has nothing to do with this topic and I apologise for that.  The issue was brought up to me by National Broadband Ireland, NBI, and Eir.  It relates to TII and local authorities when they deal with infrastructure.  One example is when there is a plan put in place for poles.  Then, site investigation forces a change and there is a requirement for a new road opening licence.  That can involve a delay of between two to eight weeks at times.  Obviously, that can be significant.  Could this be streamlined to a degree?  At this stage I would like to think that even the Department of Transport has had communication with TII on the matter.  I am talking about where planning permission is signed off in the end.  It is simply that we do not need necessary works being held up, especially as regards the roll-out of broadband and communication systems.  If I have time, I will go to Ms Graham with another question.</p></speech>

I will defer to Mr. Pat Maher, our director of network management.  Mr. Maher has been looking after that project for several years and will address that question.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the national broadband initiative and road opening licences.  Mr. Maher might be able to address that in part as well because it is something we were dealing with recently.  If necessary we will come back in writing with further elaboration.  I will hand over to him.</p></speech>

The main IT system that drives variable speed limits and lane control has been procured.  We ran a competition last year.  The tenderers involved were all highly experienced people and included service providers and software developers and operators across Europe and North America.  I am satisfied that their expertise and competency in this matter is well-proven.  Mr. Walsh outlined the approach earlier.  This technology and the application of these systems are used widely in the developed world.  The people who are doing this work for us as we speak are active not only in Ireland but in other areas with this technology.  I hope that answers the question from the Deputy.</p> <p>  The second point related to the NBI roll-out, etc.  TII is not directly responsible for road opening licences.  We are part of the process involving the road management office, RMO, which was the office set up by the Department of Transport to deal with road opening licences generally.  I am aware that there have been certain issues in respect of changes and consequential delays due to the process involved in issuing updated approvals.  My understanding is that, insofar as this affected a particular section of national road, the matter was resolved expeditiously.  I understand that the people in the RMO who operate what is called the MapRoad Roadworks Licensing system are aware of this.  I cannot speak on behalf of the people in NBI but I know that, having spoken with them, we resolved the particular issue that arose in respect of national roads.  We are happy to stay in contact on this.  We have an input into the process.  I assure the committee we are aware of the need to avoid any undue delays in the process of the roll-out of broadband.</p></speech>

We probably should communicate with all stakeholders on this to ensure the matter is actually resolved or getting resolved.  I appreciate what Mr. Maher said in respect of stakeholders and the two bodies I referenced.  I note he has signed off in respect of how the systems are tried and tested or at least in respect of the people who have produced them.  That is most welcome.</p> <p>  Ms Graham has put down the questions we all have on what type of e-scooter system we are going to have.  She has given an indication on what she sees; it is probably as far as she can go.  At this stage a study has been made of best-case scenarios across Europe on what has worked and what has not.  We will all have to take that into account as the legislation goes on.</p> <p>  I am going to jump ahead to a question that had come up last week when we were dealing with Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and even prior to that.  It relates to looking at ticketing from a certain point of view, especially in respect of Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, that would suit the new remote working scenarios.  People may only be commuting for two days out of five and so on.  At times, rail tickets can be highly expensive.  I am keen to deal with that issue.  The organisations say they have engaged with the NTA but we have not yet seen any solution or a roadmap in respect of this.  I would appreciate if I could get an update on the matter from Ms Graham.</p></speech>

We are also aware that perhaps a change in travel patterns might result post-Covid.  We are open to being able to provide a more flexible ticket.  There are three main issues.  One is that a technology change will be required.  It will have to be developed significantly to provide a particular type of ticket.  The idea is to provide something other than the structured monthly and annual tickets.  The idea is a replacement for those given that people may only be travelling for two or three days per week rather than the full five days.  They will not get value out of their monthly or annual tickets in the new environment.  Technology development has to take place.</p><p> The other issue is that the monthlies and annuals are Taxsaver schemes so they are actually tax benefits and there is a requirement to change the legislation to allow for a tax benefit for a different form of salary sacrifice.  We have engaged with the Department of Transport on how and whether that could be brought forward as a change in taxation and in the finance Bill later this year.</p><p> They are the two main issues.  I am trying to think of the third because I do not have the response in front of me, but there is a lead-in time in trying to deliver a solution for travellers between the technology and the change in legislation required such that it is unlikely we would have that solution in place this year.  We would, however, like to have some solution for travellers for next year.</p></speech>

I really appreciate it.  It is great we are down to the nitty-gritty of pre-legislative scrutiny on the issue of e-scooters.  An awful lot of work has been done on this, and we cannot lose sight of that or fail to recognise work that was done by the previous transport committee.  Members of the previous committee such as Noel Rock did an awful lot of work on this to get it to where we are today.  To what extent has the proliferation of e-scooters as we see them taken the NTA and TII by surprise over the past year, particularly the past few months?  It seems, as Deputy Cathal Crowe mentioned in his initial contribution, that they are everywhere now and have really become part of the transport infrastructure in the big cities, at least, but I presume everywhere else.  I am excited by them.  I am excited by anything that could deliver solutions for that last kilometre or first kilometre of a journey or commuting journey.  Has the NTA looked at studies on modal shift here?  We need to get people out of their cars and to reduce gridlock.  Air quality in Dublin and our other cities is really poor.  Are e-scooters the solution to this and, if so, to what extent?  If we are to meet our emissions targets of 7% annually for the coming years, Ireland's towns, cities and villages will look very different.  Are e-scooters a part of that look, in the witnesses' view?  Has the NTA conducted a detailed analysis of this in other territories, and has it reviewed this in the context of its deliberations?  Has any analysis been conducted as to what this would mean for vulnerable pedestrians such as people with disabilities and people who are visually impaired?  I met recently with Labour Disability, which has issues with the BusConnects designs and how some of the buses stop, and then there is a cycle lane and a pathway and the challenges that throws up.  Where do e-scooters fit in there?  It may sound like I am getting parochial, but on big projects, be it BusConnects or MetroLink, which is coming down the tracks, to what extent have e-scooters impacted the planning and the production of the railway orders that are coming up?  I would be interested in the witnesses' thoughts on that.  It may not be written in the railway orders but surely there must be some kind of consideration of how these will impact these major projects.</p></speech>

No, certainly the NTA has not been taken by surprise, given that we have seen the use of e-scooters throughout Europe and in other jurisdictions and the fact that there is scooter sharing in many cities throughout Europe as well.  It is therefore not surprising they are available in Ireland.  The Covid situation has probably accelerated this a little in terms of personal travel more than travel on mass transit.  I will defer to my colleague, Mr. Creegan.  I am not aware of any modal shift analysis that has been done on e-scooters, but we recognise their mobility.  They are now part of  sustainable mobility within our cities and towns.  It is really about how we make provision for that for the future in the most appropriate way from the point of view of road safety, etc.  Yes, we have to look at the impact on vulnerable pedestrians in particular.  It is a matter of looking at where it is appropriate for them to be used.  Are footpaths or shared facilities appropriate, given the fact that there are vulnerable pedestrians in those locations?  That certainly should be considered as part of the legislative scrutiny.  I will defer to my colleague.  As far as I am aware, e-scooters have not impacted the production of the large projects, railway or MetroLink, but Mr. Creegan might be able to confirm that.</p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, they are a relatively new mode.  It may be a little early to draw conclusions.  We are aware that people have looked at this in different jurisdictions.  Nothing jumps out at me as a definitive figure that could be relied on to say ,"This is what you will get".</p> <p>  As for the major projects, we are aware of e-scooters but they do not change the planning process or the overall scheme designs for those projects.  We will consider and accommodate them but they do not make a big change to infrastructure provision-----</p></speech>

Regarding MetroLink, we have included in the business case a mapping of areas beyond the range of pedestrian users of the system, so we have included maps that would indicate what would happen if someone came by bicycle.  That could be interpreted as coming by e-scooter as well.  We see an e-scooter as a vehicle or device that folds up and is carried onto MetroLink.  We are not addressing the parking of them as part of the project or anything of that nature.  We see it as expanding the scope of the projects and potentially creating more value in respect of the MetroLink project, but we have not relied on it in the calculation of benefits in the business case or anything of that nature.</p> <p>  As for research, Dr. Meade might be able to help, but I am not aware of any.</p></speech>

I do not have too much to add beyond what Mr. Creegan, Ms Graham and Mr. Walsh have contributed.  As Mr. Walsh alluded to, e-scooters increase the range people are willing to travel by another mode.  Therefore, they have the potential to be more attractive to replace single car trips, which is to be encouraged.  The other thing to mention is that this is an opportunity and if we are getting a new mode of transport to use cycle lanes, we will possibly have to consider that.  I refer to increased volume in those circumstances, a new use for them and their facilitation.  Another thing has come from the introduction of these facilities, particularly shared type use.  Approximately three companies would like to enter the market in Ireland.  That is the question of the uses in pedestrianised areas and on footpaths.</p><p>For older users in particular the vehicle, not only when travelling but when parked, can create a hazard.  That is something that potentially should be looked at to avoid that safety hazard and to accommodate it.</p></speech>

Some of the companies mentioned are providing solutions in terms of how e-scooters would be parked and so on, which are worthy of consideration.  I have to leave now to attend another meeting but I am happy I had the opportunity today to engage with the witnesses.  There are exciting possibilities and opportunities in terms of e-scooters and other forms of active travel that will help in meeting our emissions targets and major infrastructural projects such as MetroLink.  We can all pull in the same direction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1665" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021042700002#K00300"><p>I have a couple of questions for the witnesses, but I would first like to thank Mr. Walsh for the invitation to the committee to view the eMOS system.  In the next week or two, post the lifting of some of the level 5 restrictions, the clerk will engage with him to set up a date for that visit.  It would make sense for the committee to do that.</p> <p>  I would like to touch briefly on a few areas.  Senator Buttimer referenced Dr. Meade's analysis on e-scooters.  We are scrutinising legislation which is effectively a road traffic Bill and yet a substantial proportion of it is around e-scooters and scramblers.  The committee has written to the Department of Transport inquiring as to the timeframe for implementation of this legislation because there are elements of it that are being held up owing to the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny of the e-scooter provisions.</p> <p>  There is clearly an urgency around legislating for e-scooters, e-bikes and quad bikes in terms of safety.  In that context, I refer again to Dr. Meade's analysis.  In Dublin, in particular, there has been a huge increase in the number of people cycling, which I have noted while sitting in traffic in a taxi on route to catch a train home, and I am surprised more cyclists are not seriously injured on the roads in Dublin.  Dr. Meade makes a telling observation, namely, that she believes e-mobility should not be permitted to use bus or tram lanes and yet cyclists are allowed to use them.  How does one reconcile that?  I would have thought bus and tram lanes are as dangerous for cyclists as they are for those on e-scooters.  We need to have a discussion around how we make roads safer for cyclists, pedestrians and vehicles.  There is a massive roll-out of cycling infrastructure, which I welcome, but I am concerned about safety.  I am concerned that many of the cycleways are very narrow.  I am concerned also about cyclists using bus lanes, although I accept the need for people to be able to get where they are going.</p> <p>  My first question is to Dr. Meade.  Is there a body of work to be done on a safety code around driver and cyclist interaction?  How does she reconcile people on e-bikes not being permitted to use bus lanes when cyclists can do so?  I would welcome a response from Dr. Meade on those two questions.</p></speech>

In road safety, we would look at everything, not just the infrastructure.  A very pertinent point was made by Deputy O'Connor about education.  It is not only about infrastructure and the vehicle someone will be using, be that an electric bike and so on, it is about driver education.  I will answer the Chairman's question in general rather than be specific.  The safe systems approach would examine every element, including other users, infrastructure and whether we are providing enough segregated infrastructure for the number of people that are using it.</p> <p>  On how one reconciles the use of bus lanes by cyclists and not e-vehicle users, in my response to Senator Buttimer earlier, I said that, perhaps, a case-by-case response is needed.  In some cases, bus lanes are very infrequently used, while in other cases they are very frequently used.  Perhaps in light of the comments made and the sheer frequency of buses, they are also not suitable for cyclists.  My next point goes back to the point made by Deputy O'Connor that this is a relatively new piece of the transport infrastructure environment here.  The question is whether drivers have caught up to it.  E-mobility is a relatively new addition to our road space, so the awareness of other roads users is very important.  Other countries would take education on board.  In that regard, I refer to Dutch Reach.  For the benefit of those who do not know what that is, it is about drivers opening a car door with their left hand such that they have to turn their head and check for cyclists.</p></speech>

Have TII and the NTA done a body of work around the fast and exponential roll-out of cycle lanes, which is to be welcomed?  How can we build a sustainable model that respects the cyclist and the driver?  The creation of cycle lanes in areas that are exceptionally busy has created chaos for traffic.  In some cases, it is clear that an additional lane is required at particular junctions, but that has not happened to date.  Cycle lanes are welcome but how do we expand on this roll-out on a sustainable basis?  This issue falls within the remit of the NTA in terms of cities and urban settings.  I ask Ms Graham to outline what body of work the NTA has done to ensure we have a model that builds the infrastructure for cyclists as opposed to taking over existing lanes.  In that regard, I refer to the issue that arose in Limerick city recently, with which Ms Graham is probably familiar.  In terms of a sustainable model, is the NTA doing a body of work around that?</p></speech>

We try to develop the cycling infrastructure in accordance with the manual, which is currently under review to take account of the current circumstances.  There could be e-scooters and powered bikes on that infrastructure as well and that has to be taken into account in a design manual.  Our focus is on providing the safest infrastructure that we can in a particular location.  It also depends on the speed limits on a road because the higher the speed limit, the more one is inclined to get-----</p></speech>

My question is more specific.  The NTA is rolling out cycle lanes, which, as I said, are to be welcomed.  In some cases, that roll-out is by means of  reducing existing traffic lanes from two to one.  Is that a sustainable model?  I would like an answer to that specific question.</p></speech>

When a traffic lane is removed, that impacts on car traffic movement.</p><p>If we are thinking about where we are going in terms of trying to reduce our reliance on the car and moving to more sustainable transport modes, then the more people one has travelling by sustainable transport, whether it is cycling, walking or public transport, that will be more sustainable and it will reduce our carbon emissions.  Yes, it is a appropriate to look-----</p></speech>

Yes, it is part of our remit to be able to do that and to provide the infrastructure in our cities, in particular in Dublin, to be able to deliver that.  If there is a requirement on a particular road where it is difficult to get a priority for bus as well as include a car lane and a cycle lane, then of course we would look at the widening of that road to ensure one gets the appropriate infrastructure.  That is what I was trying to illustrate in terms of BusConnects as that is where we have widened roads but where one is talking about quite large volumes of cyclists and bus travel as well as large volumes of car traffic.  It depends on the location but our ultimate goal is to encourage more use of and to provide for more sustainable transport use in towns and cities.</p></speech>

The NTA is revising the Limerick Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy, LSMATS, and will offer it for public consultation again.  I am very keen on the strategy.  Ms Graham has mentioned sustainability.  Let us say there is a huge backlog of traffic because one of the lanes has been removed, which means my constituents cannot get to work on time.

Limerick City and County Council will select the preferred option and bring it to the public in June or July.  That is the timeline that I remember from the last update but I might come back to the Chairman with more details.</p> <p>  I wish to avail of the opportunity to correct something because I may have given the incorrect impression earlier to Deputy O'Connor when he asked about changing the speed limit at night on the M50 to 120 km/h.  I did not mean to imply that we would look at speed limits beyond the designed speed limit for the road.  When we went to three lanes on the majority of the M50, the design speed limit was 100 km/h.  What we would be introducing in terms of dynamic traffic management would be lower speed limits depending on congestion or weather conditions or a combination of both.  When not required, we would revert to the design speed limit or the design speed, which happens to be the limit as currently imposed on the M50.  I hope that I did not give the impression that we would be looking at things in a new thinking way.</p></speech>

We do not have a policy in this regard but we have a duty to deliver a safe and efficient network of national roads.  The safety and efficiency of the roads are our focus.</p> <p>  There is a common understanding that we are going to have more active travel or cyclists on the network, so we are working with the Department of Transport to come up with a common approach.  The Department is considering the introduction of greyways and speed limits.  It is fine to have cyclists and motorists in the same shared space but beyond which we need a degree of separation and that will vary depending on whether the speed limit is 60 km/h, 80 km/h or 100 km/h.  In conjunction, we have discussed with the Department the possibility of developing a national cycle network, and we will work with the NTA on that as well, to create a strategic framework and shape a national cycle network so that each local authority and roads authority, when developing projects, as a sponsoring agency, could be guided by the framework and work to deliver the entire network as opposed to disconnected pieces.  That work is ongoing and under consideration as part of the review of the national development plan.  We will see what level of support the framework will have coming out of the NDP.</p></speech>

It would have to be considered and we would have to see whether we are in a position to provide it, but I cannot give any guarantees that we will do so.

Deputy O'Connor spoke earlier.  Several of us went to a meeting with taxi drivers that was organised by the three main groups.  They have issues with the fact that they have missed out on several supports.  Their main request is Government support to deal with the ten-year rule and its regulation.  One issue that came up in the meeting was the scrappage scheme for a taxi driver who is going electric.  The contention of the groups was that it was not fit for purpose.  The contention is also that in large parts of Dublin and especially outside Dublin we do not have the infrastructure to facilitate electric cars, especially an increased number of electric cars.  That infrastructure would be vital for taxi drivers.  Has there been much interest in the scheme?  I know that it is applied by the NTA.  Do the officials have a view on it?  Is Ms Graham free to give that view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1701" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021042700002#M00900"><p>It is a Department of Transport scheme that we administer on behalf of the Department.  I am trying to think of the figures.  I believe we have at least 200 applications for the scheme to date.  It is in and around that order but I can get an exact or more appropriate figure for the committee.  I do not really want to comment on the scheme as it is a scheme of the Department, but we are seeing applications coming through from taxi drivers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-27a.1702" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021042700002#M01000"><p>That is positive.  I would appreciate if Ms Graham comes back to me with an exact figure.  It was the contention of several of the groups that it was not necessarily fit for purpose.  Like many schemes that are introduced, it will need to be looked at and improved anyway.</p> <p>  I have another question for Mr. Walsh.  He referred to building cycle networks.  There needs to be an element of common sense in respect of some of our towns.  We are not starting where we would like.  One example is Dundalk.  Cycle lanes were introduced at one stage that created major logistical difficulties in the sense that fire engines were unable to get around corners and so on.  There were some improvements of Clanbrassil Street and further on into the St. Nicholas Quarter and so on.  No cycle lane was introduced there on the basis that a shared space would make more sense.  It is down to logistics.  A more common-sense framework needs to be designed beyond that.</p> <p>  We are talking about trying to deal with some of the issues in rural Ireland with regard to connectivity and so on.  Have something been considered?  What about facilitating the likes of Bus &Eacute;ireann from a point of view of something that is almost hybrid compared to the systems we have?  We need fixed-time services but we also need services that can deal with fluctuating demand.  This is somewhat similar to what Mr. Walsh is trying to introduce in respect of speeds and requirements on the motorway.  It is a system that can deliver on the basis of need.</p></speech>

As the Deputy may know, we are working on Connecting Ireland, which is about improving the connections between our towns and rural parts of Ireland.  We will be going out for public consultation on an improved network of services later on this year.</p> <p>  Services are currently operated by the Local Link offices on our behalf.  There is a combination of fixed schedule services as well as demand responsive services.  These were primarily set up to provide services to isolated rural areas where the demand is lowest.  It ensures that there is a connection at certain times of the day.  It can be a door-to-door service to bring older vulnerable users into their local towns.  It is a model we have in operation with our Local Link services.</p> <p>  I imagine the model the Deputy is thinking of is more urban-based.  There may not be demand for a scheduled service in an urban area and I think he is talking about the potential of looking at a demand responsive service mixed with a scheduled service.  That is something we would like to pilot if we were in a position to do so.  It would probably start in Dublin, where there are potential gaps, although we do not see many gaps in our proposed BusConnects network.  There is the possibility that areas could be better served by a demand responsive service.  It requires subsidisation.  It is simply that we have not been in a position to pilot this in the past two years given where we are with funding.  However, it is definitely something we would like to pilot in future.</p></speech>

We were talking about the need for education of other road users.  There is a significant role for the RSA and I am keen to acknowledge that.  We work with the authority in educating road users.</p> <p>  I will take the opportunity of having the microphone again to correct a date I gave to you earlier, Chairman.

The Chairman had pointed to specific elements of information about the different options he wanted to be brought into the public domain next time around.  Limerick City and County Council took that on board.
