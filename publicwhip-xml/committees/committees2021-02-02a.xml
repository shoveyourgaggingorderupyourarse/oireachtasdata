    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021020200002#A00200"><p>I remind members that in the context of the Covid-19 restrictions, only the Chairman and staff are present in the committee room and all other members must join remotely from elsewhere within the parliamentary precincts.  The secretariat can issue invitations to join the meeting on Microsoft Teams.  Members may not participate in the meeting from outside the parliamentary precincts.  I ask members to mute their microphones when they are not making contributions and use the "raise hand" function to indicate they wish to speak.  Speaking slots will be prioritised for members of the committee.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the challenges facing the agrifood sector as a result of Brexit.  I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, Mr. Paul Savage, assistant secretary with responsibility for Brexit, Ms Hazel Sheridan, senior superintending veterinary inspector and head of port operations, and Mr. Rob Doyle, deputy chief veterinary officer and director of imports controls division.  All are joining remotely from a witness room in Kildare House.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I have an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they will give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Those participating in the committee meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protection afforded to those participating within the parliamentary precincts does not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p><p>I ask the Minister to make his opening statement.  In the past 24 hours, members have seen media reports illustrating the way Brexit and trade can be impacted.  There was a serious development in Northern Ireland overnight.  There are various issues.  The committee has received submissions from various stakeholders in the beef and dairy divisions.  The questions of committee members will be mostly based on the questions posed by those stakeholders and the problems they are encountering in the first month of trading in the Brexit scenario.  The Minister appeared before the committee in recent weeks on the issue of fisheries and the problems that sector is experiencing as a result of Brexit.  We will concentrate today on the agrifood sector.  The committee appreciates the Minister taking the time to address it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021020200002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee on the impact of Brexit on the agriculture industry.  I am joined by officials from my Department: Mr. Paul Savage, assistant secretary; Mr. Rob Doyle, director of veterinary services; and Ms Hazel Sheridan, head of import controls operations division.</p> <p>  The decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union and, with that, the customs union and Single Market brings about fundamental changes in the relationship between EU member states and the UK.  These changes will be felt in particular by member states such as Ireland that have traditionally had a close trading relationship with Great Britain.  As of 1 January 2021, and even with a deal that avoided the imposition of tariffs on trade, the seamless arrangements that characterised our trading relationship with the UK are, unfortunately, a thing of the past.  This has particular implications for the Irish agrifood sector, given the highly integrated nature of supply chains between ourselves and our closest neighbour.  Trade with Great Britain in animals, plants and products of animal and plant origin is now subject to customs formalities and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks.  The focus now for Ireland will be to work to ensure that our obligations are discharged in a way that facilitates trade in both directions to the maximum possible extent while also maintaining the integrity of the Single Market.</p> <p>  The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, together with the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, means that Ireland&rsquo;s key objectives in the Brexit process have been achieved, particularly the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, which includes the avoidance a hard border on the island of Ireland, as well as the best possible outcome for trade and the economy, notably tariff-free trade with the UK and the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s place in the Single Market.</p> <p>  For the agriculture sector, the avoidance of tariffs and quotas was especially important.  Members should remember that, in the absence of an agreement, Ireland would have faced a combined impact of between &euro;1.37 billion and &euro;1.55 billion on our agrifood exports to the UK and between &euro;715 million and &euro;970 million on our agrifood imports.  The beef sector, in particular, would have faced a punitive tariff rate equivalent to 72% on our beef exports of &euro;1 billion per year.  By agreeing the trade and co-operation agreement, we have avoided this very difficult no-deal scenario.  However, the agreement, unfortunately, will have a significant impact on the fishing industry.  This was a very difficult compromise and the Government will work to ensure that the fisheries sector and the coastal communities that depend on it are supported through the period ahead.</p> <p>  My Department has ensured that financial and other support measures have been put in place over successive budgets to support farmers and the agrifood sector to deal with Brexit.  These supports have included direct aid, capital funding for the food industry and the provision of low-cost loans such as the Brexit loan scheme and the future growth loan scheme.  Supports have also been provided to Bord Bia and Teagasc to assist food companies to prepare for Brexit, including through market diversification and innovation.  Businesses should continue to avail of the broad range of supports in place, including financial, upskilling and advisory supports such as the Bord Bia customs readiness grant.</p><p>While the UK will remain an important market for our agrifood sector, market diversification remains extremely important and we will continue to work with industry and our growing network of agricultural attach&eacute;s abroad to achieve that.  In this regard, the new &euro;100 million investment scheme agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be crucial to assist our meat and dairy processing sectors to diversify into new markets and products.</p><p> In addition to domestic supports, the European Commission recently shared the proposed initial allocations to member states from the Brexit adjustment reserve, which is valued at a total of &euro;5.4 billion in current prices.  The initial allocation proposed for Ireland is more than &euro;1 billion in current prices, almost a quarter of the initial 2021 allocation of &euro;4.2 billion.  Ireland's proposed allocation reflects the extensive engagement that the Government has undertaken to present the unique, adverse and disproportionate impact of Brexit on Ireland.  There is still some work to do to ensure that the proposed allocation is maintained through the forthcoming negotiation process in the European Council and, subsequently, with the European Parliament.  The Government will be very focused in this endeavour and will ultimately seek to use the final allocation to support in the most effective way possible those sectors that have been most affected by Brexit. </p><p> I will turn now to some of the more immediate and practical impacts we have been dealing with, and will be dealing with over the coming months.  The Government has put substantial time and financial, human and IT resources into preparing for Brexit.  However, we have been very clear all along that, even with an EU-UK deal in place, the seamless trading environment we had become accustomed to would not continue.  As I mentioned earlier, operators must engage with a range of customs procedures and regulatory checks and controls on their trade with the UK that did not previously apply.  These will cause delays and increase costs for businesses and, unfortunately, they are permanent.</p><p> My Department, in conjunction with the other key Departments and agencies involved, including the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Health and the HSE, began planning for the imposition of import controls on consignments coming from Great Britain as soon as the result of the UK referendum was known.  This was because, regardless of what trade deal was done, controls would come into force for consignments coming from Great Britain at the end of the transition period, in the same way as these controls apply to all other countries trading with the European Union.  In the case of live animals, animal products, plant and plant products, including food, two types of controls are required, namely, customs controls and sanitary and phytosanitary, or SPS, controls.</p><p> SPS controls consist of documentary, identity and physical controls that must be carried out at specialised facilities called border control posts.  There are currently four approved border control posts in Ireland, at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort, Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport.  In terms of volume in the years leading up to 2021, 90% of the SPS goods coming into Ireland from Great Britain came through Dublin Port.  The frequency of SPS controls is laid down in EU legislation.  With some exceptions, all consignments of animals, plants and plant and animal products, including food, coming from Great Britain must now be accompanied by a health certificate, signed by an official veterinarian in the case of animals and animal products, and signed by an official plant health inspector in the case of plants and plant products.  On arrival at the port, certain commodities must undergo identity checks.  Some commodities will also have to undergo physical checks.  The rates are related to the risk posed by the product.  These can vary from as low as 1% to as high as 100%, depending on the exact nature of the consignment.  These checks will take time.</p><p> The border control posts at Dublin and Rosslare have been operating well within capacity during the first month of the new trading arrangements.  Trade volumes started very low and are still not at the levels experienced in the years leading up to 1 January.  In general, many business operators are making very good efforts to comply with the SPS requirements. That said, the requirements are not simple.  In some cases, the supply chains are very complex and the rules were not necessarily designed for the type of trade that crosses the Great Britain-Ireland border.  Issues remain in terms of business operators providing advance notification.  Advance notification is critical to ensuring trucks are not delayed on arrival at Dublin and Rosslare ports.</p><p>Issues also remain concerning the accurate completion of health certificates and consistency between SPS and customs documentation.  This is the single biggest change in agrifood trade flows between Great Britain and Ireland witnessed since the Single Market was created in 1993 and, as such, presents a significant challenge for all stakeholders adjusting to this new reality.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is working closely with business operators to help businesses adapt.  Following on from extensive engagement undertaken through a range of forums and communications channels leading up to December 2020, the Department is continuing to assist operators in practical matters, such as the submission of documents and the resolution of technical difficulties.</p><p> From 1 January, exports of animals and certain goods to Great Britain have also required export health certification.  Brexit has equally resulted in some changes in requirements concerning live animal exports to Great Britain, including a 40-day residency period for cattle, sheep and pigs on the holding of origin.  Animals also cannot have passed through a market and must be consigned directly from the holding of origin or through an assembly centre.  In addition, two sets of documents are now required for the transport of live animals to or through Great Britain, which is another unfortunate consequence of Brexit.  Operators now require transporter authorisation, driver certificates and vehicle approvals for both jurisdictions.</p><p> The UK has adopted a phased approach to the introduction of import controls, with further phases commencing on 1 April and 1 July.  Officials in my Department continue to engage with the UK authorities on their exact requirements.  Significant challenges may lie ahead, but work is ongoing to ensure the Department can meet upcoming UK import requirements from 1 April, and this may require an additional 4,000 to 6,000 export certificates to be issued each week.  Officials in my Department will be communicating with the industry on the detailed requirements soon.  The industry too will have to play its part in ensuring that trade can be facilitated.</p><p> I refer briefly to two topics mentioned in the committee&rsquo;s correspondence about today&rsquo;s meeting, namely, live exports and mixed milk.  On live exports, there was a drop in the number of calves exported in 2020, mainly related to Covid-19 issues and the fall in demand from the food service sector in Europe.  The Department is engaging with all stakeholders regarding the 2021 calf export season, and officials have, for example, met with live exporters and Dutch importers last week.  Officials also met with NGOs which expressed concerns about this trade.   I have met with the ferry operators on several occasions as well to impress on them the importance of this trade to the agrifood sector.</p><p> On mixed milk, the agrifood sector in Ireland relies on inputs from or processing in Northern Ireland, particularly milk for dairy products.  Under the Northern Ireland protocol, Northern Ireland remains in the UK customs territory.  This means that goods from Northern Ireland will not be considered as inputs of EU origin for the purposes of preferential tariff arrangements under European Union free trade agreements with third countries.   The implications of this situation are that certain current Irish agrifood exports to third countries may unfortunately incur tariffs even where a free trade agreement is in place between the EU and that third country if they do not meet the product-specific rules of origin for that product.  This is especially problematic for the agrifood sector and is of particular concern to the dairy and drinks sectors which are so closely integrated North-South.  There is no issue, however, in respect of the trade in such goods within and between the EU and the UK.</p><p> I hope this overview gives the members of the committee a good sense of the potential impact of Brexit on the agriculture industry.  I and my Department will continue to work to minimise this impact on the sector, and we will continue to engage closely with all stakeholders in this regard over the coming period.  I look forward now to taking questions and to hearing the contributions and comments of the members of committee.  I and my officials will respond to them.</p><p> I take this opportunity as well to commend the tremendous work undertaken in respect of Brexit by all those in the Department.  Brexit happened at a challenging time, and none of us predicted that the negotiations would continue up until Christmas Eve before a trade deal was completed.  While this agreement was massively welcome and brought much relief, it also caused serious challenges in respect of being able to prepare fully for the changes which took place on 1 January.  I commend the work and the time and effort put in by officials over the Christmas period and into the new year to adjust to the new situation and ensure that we were prepared in every way we could be.</p><p>I acknowledge that.  I and my team will now endeavour to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021020200002#E00200"><p>I concur with the Minister's comments on Department staff and officials.  We all dreaded what 1 January would bring.  Thankfully, while we are here discussing problems, it has not caused huge market turbulence yet.  We have to recognise that fact.  We are trying to overcome difficulties that a Brexit deal was bound to impose on us.</p> <p>  I will raise a number of matters before I open up the floor to other members.  Mixed milk is particularly problematic.  For one or more of our processors, it is a major issue.  A huge amount of some of our processors' milk originates in Northern Ireland.  Over 60% of one of our major processors' milk comes from Northern Ireland.  The Minister talked about trade agreements and said processors could incur tariffs under EU trade agreements with third countries.  We had turbulence in the marketplace and aids to private storage, APS, were needed, as was our intervention.  How would that work for Northern Ireland milk?  In reality, it is impossible for some of these processors to segregate their product.  Is there a solution to this?  Northern Ireland milk has traditionally come to the Republic to be processed and the investment has been made in the South.  It is a very significant investment indeed.  While I understand the problem that is there today, what are the market supports, and have we a possible solution to this scenario?  Segregating our milk for these processors is not an option.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021020200002#E00300"><p>It certainly has been a matter of concern for our dairy industry.  Obviously, we are an all-island dairy market and producer.  It is entirely integrated.  That is one of our strengths and, likewise, that feeds through to our dairy processors, who have a lot of mixed milk coming into their operations.  It is something they were concerned about and something that I, as Minister, and the Department raised as part of the Brexit negotiations.  The terms and conditions of many of the third-country free trade agreements that were in place and that predated Brexit had already been set.  The fact that Northern Ireland remains part of the UK customs territory is central to defining the origin of that milk in some of those free trade agreements.  I am very committed to trying to resolve this in time but it will involve having to look to the renegotiation in due course of those third-country agreements in order for the issue to be fully resolved.  Thankfully, since the start of the year, things seem to have been operating reasonably well so far.  This is not an issue for many of our main markets outside of the European Union.  Within the EU and the UK it is not an issue either because milk can be traded freely, but it certainly is an issue for some third-country traders.  I will ask Mr. Savage, the assistant secretary, to comment further on this issue.  He has put a lot of time and effort into the technical detail of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Savage" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021020200002#E00400"><p>Rules of origin, as the Minister said, are clearly an issue that has arisen in the context of mixed milk and product from the North and the South of Ireland qualifying under EU free trade agreements.  There was an issue with changing that situation in the short term in the context of the requirement that the Commission would essentially have to renegotiate all existing free trade agreements, which, of course, is a very difficult task and not one the Commission considered in the context of trying to conclude the negotiations with the UK in the lead up to the end of the year.  To try to renegotiate all those agreements would be a very difficult thing for the Commission to do in any event.</p><p>It carries the risk of other issues being raised in potential attempts to renegotiate those agreements.  There is a danger of opening up a hornet's nest of other issues being brought onto the agenda, including by third countries.  There is an understandable reticence on the part of the Commission to engage in detail on that.  However, we have an engagement with the Commission on this.  There is also the possibility that, in finalising free trade negotiations in future, the rules of origin and preferential access issues could be resolved or addressed to our satisfaction.  That would be in the case of negotiations that are ongoing now or may be undertaken in future.  This is something towards which we need to look.</p><p> It is probably worth saying that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has been engaging with the Vice President of the European Commission, Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic, on a number of issues relating to the implementation of the agreement.  Rules of origin is one of those issues on which discussions have been taking place and engagement will continue for the foreseeable future.</p><p> Access of products that might contain Northern milk to European common market organisation, CMO, supports was mentioned.  There is an issue for us in that regard, as the Commission has indicated that there would be a question over the eligibility of such products, which come from outside the customs territory of the EU, for those market support measures.  We have engaged with the Commission on this point and sought to try to secure access for the products.  The Commission says that it is not possible because of the associated rules of origin issue, but we are continuing to engage on it.</p></speech>

A number of members wish to contribute, the first of whom is Senator Paul Daly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021020200002#F00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and the representatives from the Department.  My first question is on mixed milk and will follow on from something that has been put on the agenda, including by the last line of the Department's document on market tools.  How would that issue affect all Irish products?  If Irish milk products need to go into private storage or intervention, how will the percentage of southern product in mixed milk products be ascertained?  How will the conundrum be solved?  This issue needs to be built into the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  There must be some way of getting recognition for Northern Ireland milk.  By virtue of the facts already stated, this sector is probably the one that will need the most EU support and initially be affected most by Brexit.  It is vital that we have access to the market tools.</p> <p>  The Minister's presentation addressed a number of other issues.  Regarding the new SPS export health certificates, EHCs, and custom control requirements when importing from and exporting to the UK, has the Department done any speculative work on how those systems will function when at full capacity?  While I do not know whether it is possible to say that there is anything positive in Covid, it has given time for teething issues to be highlighted and has limited the quantities of imports and exports in January and now into February.  This reduced market has given our hauliers, exporters and importers a chance to come to terms with the new rules and regulations.  If and when we return to full capacity or as close to what used to be the normal trade flow, how will we handle the situation?  Have those tests been conducted and are contingency plans in place?</p> <p>  While I welcome the Brexit adjustment reserve, I will add the caveat that it needs to be spent wisely.  Where we can overcome problems diplomatically, we do not need to throw that money at them in the hope of finding a solution.  I will cite the example of the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme.  While I welcome the Minister's application for an extension of the reference area for the nitrates reduction under the scheme, I would not like to see any of the Brexit adjustment reserve being used with conditions placed on it in the same way they were placed on the scheme to reduced nitrates or have any other effect than what it says on the tin, that is, an adjusted reserve and a replacement of lost earnings due to Brexit.</p><p>That is vitally important.  Will the Minister elaborate on or indicate how he think the events of the weekend can affect this and what he thinks will be the outcome of the Article 16 fiasco?  It seems to have had a knock-on effect on the dock workers in the North.  Will there be an immediate resolution to this problem?  Agriculture and agrifood exports and imports to and from the UK will be hit most by this.  The Minister's presentation may have been penned before much of what happened in the past 24 hours and I would like to hear more on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021020200002#G00200"><p>I thank Senator Daly.  I take on board his concerns and the point he made about the issue relating to Northern Irish milk.  As Minister, I am aware of it and we hope to continue to address it.  Mr. Savage outlined the challenges and issues relating to market supports, etc.  As agreements to trade internationally with third countries fall due for renegotiation, it will be important that we try to address the issue.  It is a challenge as matters stand.</p> <p>  On the contingency for capacity, I will deal with that first and then ask Ms Sheridan, head of our import controls and operations division, to come in and provide an update and full overview on how things are going, on throughput and on the contingency planning we have done.  We have very much been planning for this.  The Senator is right that it has been greatly facilitated so far by the fact that throughput is down significantly in comparison with previous years.  I will ask Ms Sheridan to address that point shortly.</p> <p>  On the Brexit adjustment reserve, the markets and prices have thankfully remained fairly solid so far.  There is no doubt that Brexit is presenting additional challenges in the context of exports to Britain.  We will monitor the situation closely.  The Government has been clear from the outset regarding how it worked with the agrifood sector to prepare in advance and also that we would stand ready to work with it as Brexit evolved afterwards.  I am monitoring the situation closely .  The purpose of the Brexit adjustment reserve is to support those sectors that are most impacted.  Thankfully, we achieved 25% of the total allocation.  That is a reflection of the fact that people at European level understand that we are particularly exposed.  There is ongoing engagement with Europe about how that money can be spent.  I will be engaging with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance on the latter.  It is important that the money is used effectively.  My specific focus, priority and commitment is that farm incomes will be central in how we look at the year ahead and at the impact of Brexit.</p> <p>  Thankfully, the issue relating to Article 16 was resolved.  This should not have happened in the first instance.  It has been recognised at European level that what happened was both a mistake and misguided.  In many ways, we were blindsided by it in the context of how it evolved in the context of the dispute relating to the AstraZeneca vaccine.  I do not foresee this mistake being repeated.  On foot of the Taoiseach's engagement with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and Prime Minister Johnson, and that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney's, engagement with Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and Minister Michael Gove, the matter has been resolved.</p><p>It certainly was not helpful.  We all know how challenging and sensitive the Brexit situation is from an all-island point of view and a Northern Ireland point of view.  The North-South protocol is a really important mechanism by which Northern Ireland, while remaining constitutionally part of the UK and part of the UK customs regime, has access to the Single Market as well.  There are opportunities for Northern Ireland around that and it is really important that it has access to both.</p><p> That does not come without its challenges but it is really important that we work together to try to ensure that it operates as smoothly as possible and that the importance of it is respected.  While the incident at the end of last week was not helpful, it was resolved quickly.  It is important there is really strong recognition among ourselves, Europe and the British Government of the importance of the North-South protocol from a Northern Irish point of view.</p><p> On the point about contingencies, current capacity and planning for scaling that up, I will ask Hazel Sheridan to come in on that.</p></speech>

In answer to the question about preparations for operation at full capacity, infrastructure, staffing and IT systems have been put in place at both Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and at Dublin Airport.  They have all been constructed based on analysis of 2019 and 2020 data flows.  What has been put in place is capable of dealing with trade if it had remained the same as it did in 2019 and 2020.</p> <p>  At the same time it seems unlikely that that will be the case.  This is the biggest change, as the Minister said, that the industry has had to undergo since 1993 and it is likely that it will result in changes to supply chains and to trade flows.  However, the infrastructure, staff and IT systems are in place.  As the Minister said, at the moment we are operating well within our capacity and, as the Senator referenced, that has been helpful in getting people up to speed with the requirements.</p> <p>  There was no way of testing what this was going to look like in reality because there was no way of asking businesses to complete customs formalities and SPS formalities ahead of 1 January.  There was no way to test the capacity of the UK to issue heath certification or to test the capacity of people to understand what was needed on the certificates and all of those issues.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, there is no substitute for doing the business itself and that is the phase we are in.  Certainly there is a lot of complexity in that and there is much learning for businesses, for the Department of Agriculture and the Marine and for other agencies, as to how we can improve things and how we can do things better.  We continue to work with businesses in seeking to do that and we are seeking to address any issues raised as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  We are working well within capacity and have lots of spare capacity at the moment.  We are ready to go whenever that increase in business happens.  It is very difficult to say what the business will look like.  We are in very new territory and it will take quite a significant period of time before we can assess the full impact of the UK now being outside the Single Market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021020200002#H00300"><p>I thank the Minister and his staff for coming in and for the comprehensive overview.  I have a few points and a few questions.  The Minister mentioned the agricultural attach&eacute;s.  He might at some future date update the committee with a briefing note on the work of these attach&eacute;s, particularly post-Brexit.  It is not something I want done today but the Minister might update the committee on that because they are doing important work.</p> <p>  The Minister referred in his opening statement to the unfortunate and significant negative impact of the agreement on fisheries.  We all accept that now and the reality is that we need to be aware of the supports that are going to be put in place, the ongoing supports that are there and what the Minister intends to do.  I ask the Minister to keep the committee abreast of that because it is going to have a really crucial impact on coastal communities and it is of very serious concern.</p><p> We had a submission from the Irish Livestock Stakeholders Association.  Every member of the committee would have gotten it.  I was particularly interested in the issues it raised on the export of livestock, the challenges that go with that and possible impediments coming down the track.  We know that livestock is being ferried through Rosslare.  We know that is an 18 hour journey and it has an impact on animal welfare.  I want to acknowledge the Minister's Working Together for Animal Welfare document circulated in the last day or two.  It makes really interesting reading.  Clearly, we have an issue in terms of working in partnership with all the stakeholders, science and experience-led public policy.  The Minister identified that as part of his five point strategy on this.  However, we have to get the message out that we believe in a consistency of approach in terms of evaluation and assessment of animal welfare.  We also believe in a vibrant export and agricultural food trade.  That is the challenge and that is the balance to be struck.  The Minister dealt with it very comprehensively in his Department's new Working Together for Animal Welfare strategy which I commend to all the members.</p><p> I go back to two things.  This Irish Livestock Stakeholders Association recommends a number of points.  I want to take up two of them.  One is the opening of a super lairage in County Wexford.  It proposes the development of a super lairage in Rosslare Europort.  A large lairage will reduce the journey times for exports and aid and improve animal welfare.</p><p> What is the Department of Agriculture and the Marine's role in all of this in terms of support?  How can we deal with that?  Clearly, there are huge opportunities in Rosslare Europort and I am conscious of the work Deputy Verona Murphy is doing in this regard.  It is an important area.  I would be interested in that.</p><p> This group also talked about the export of calves moving from 14 to 21 days, with stronger, higher quality and healthier calves leaving Ireland.  That is what we all we want.  This is an area and a challenge.  It is one I would like the Minister to deal with because it is important in terms of livestock.  He addressed all this in his statement.</p><p> The Minister might tell us how he is progressing and what his plans are for the establishment of the first chair in animal welfare and veterinary ethics at UCD school of veterinary medicine.  This is one of the priorities the Minister has set out in his strategy.</p><p> What is important is that the message is clear.  We rely on the export of live cattle for the economic viability of agriculture in this country.  We need to bring everyone on board with us to develop that.  We see challenges, of course.  Europe and other member states were talking about curtailing this area.  The Irish Livestock Stakeholders Association which represent the industry needs to be listened to.  I ask the Minister's Department to look at its submission because it makes some valuable points.</p><p> I do not have time to tease out many of the other submissions.  However, there are issues there and I ask the Minister to address them.</p></speech>

They play a really important role, particularly in being able to work and maintain existing markets abroad and work with our export companies to try to develop new markets.  They also work very closely with Bord Bia on ensuring the Irish team abroad collaborate and have a clear strategy to try to develop and maintain the markets we have.  I will get the Senator a note on the numbers we have.  We have been expanding the footprint and will continue to prioritise that in the time ahead.  I will get Senator Boyhan exact details and an update on progress in that regard.</p><p> The Senator also touched on fisheries, on which the committee and I engaged in depth two weeks ago.  While it was very welcome that we avoided a no-deal scenario, Brexit has undoubtedly had an impact on our fisheries sector and the wider economy.  It is important that we support the sector and coastal communities in the time ahead.  As the Senator pointed out, the Government is committed to investing in them in the time ahead.  I am in the process of putting in place a task force to advise on how we can best support the sector immediately and in the years ahead.  The work of the task force will very much inform how we go about investing and supporting the sector.  I will certainly keep members up to date on progress.</p><p> The Senator also referred to the importance of live exports.  I concur with him.  In parallel, the importance of animal welfare standards was emphasised, not just in respect of live exports but also in respect of the agrifood sector more widely.  I concur in this regard also.  The Senator referred to the recent publication of Working Together for Animal Welfare - Ireland's Animal Welfare Strategy, which I launched last week.  As the Senator and other members know, animal welfare is central to the ethos of our farmers across the country, who take great care of animals.  It is essential that the Government and Department make sure there are no exceptions and that there is robust oversight and regulation.  All animals must be treated according to the highest welfare standards.  That is essential.  No more than in any other walk of life, one has to ensure there are no exceptions and that, where there are, there is enforcement.  We all agree that Irish farming and agriculture very much value the welfare of animals.  It is central to what farmers do but, equally, the Department and I, as Minister, are committed to ensuring there is oversight and that there are no exceptions to the norm.  I am committed to robust enforcement if anybody does not maintain animal welfare standards to the level we expect.  The strategy I launched last week very much speaks to that.</p><p> The live animal trade is an important aspect of our livestock sector, particularly the beef sector.  I have engaged closely with the sector over recent months in preparation for the spring period, in particular, which is a really important period for live exports.  My officials and I will continue to engage strongly on this to prepare and to make sure the trade is facilitated in every way possible.</p><p> Reference was made to the prospect of lairage at Rosslare or elsewhere in County Wexford.  The provision of lairage and handing facilities is a matter for the trade itself.  It is really important that live exporters work together and collaborate.  I encourage them to continue to collaborate on ideas for developing facilitates.  </p><p> On the progressing of the first chair in animal welfare and veterinary ethics at UCD, my Department has been engaging with the university.  It is a really good and important initiative.  I will revert to the committee with an update on the timeline for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021020200002#K00200"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for being here.  I have been raising Brexit issues, including fishing, all along.  Obviously, I have been talking to the west Cork Irish Farmers Association chairman, Mr. Donal O'Donovan, and to Mr. Dermot Kelleher of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association.  I met representatives of Individual Farmers of Ireland last night and they are seeking a meeting with the Minister.  He might take that up with them in the near future.</p> <p>  The Brexit fund of &euro;5 billion, of which Ireland is to get &euro;1 billion, must be activated to compensate for any losses, including those associated with sterling volatility.  Agriculture and food production are very exposed, and we must ensure as much funding as possible for farmers.</p><p>Chilled and processed meat such as sausages, burgers and mince from the UK, which is now regarded as a third country, cannot access external markets.  Ireland is a food exporting country.  Cheddar cheese from Carbery should be actively entering these markets.  This needs to happen immediately and the Government should be doing everything it can to make sure it does.</p><p> How will the Minister ensure the least well-off farmers, in particular sheep and beef farmers who are going through a difficult period, will access the &euro;105 million Brexit fund?  Does he have any ideas in this regard or can he disclose how that will happen?</p><p> A separate &euro;100 million was granted to food processors.  Will conditions be attached to this fund to ensure, for instance, that low income farmers also benefit from it?  Will a process be put in place ensure it is not handed out automatically and we do not find out afterwards that it did not get to where it was needed most?  In my discussions with agriculture groups, they have made the valid point that when the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, started around 1994, anyone on &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 was eligible and, therefore, anyone on &euro;18,500 should, by right, be eligible for any new REPS-type deal.  That is not happening.  Unfortunately, many farmers are still on such low incomes and get very little to survive on their farms.  The &euro;105 million investment is important.  I ask the Minister to tell us what his plans are in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021020200002#L00200"><p>Ireland will receive a quarter of the Brexit adjustment reserve fund, which will amount to just over &euro;1 billion.  I will be monitoring progress and the impacts of Brexit.  The academic assessments in advance of Brexit made estimates of what its cost implications and impacts on the agrifood sector would be.  Various projections and assessments were made in advance.  This is not a test run - we did not have a chance to have a trial run - but a real-life emerging situation and I am closely monitoring what the impact will be.</p> <p>  I want to ensure that the first priority in the year ahead will be to try to protect farm incomes.  In doing that, I will be monitoring how Brexit evolves.  Thankfully, prices and the markets for various meat sectors have held up well.  We all hope that will continue but I will closely monitor the situation.</p> <p>  Working with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, I achieved an 11% increase in the overall agrifood budget in the most recent budget in October 2020.  This will ensure we can underpin farm incomes in the time ahead by ensuring many of the schemes we had in place can continue.  It will also provide some fresh and additional funding, particularly in the environmental space, for new schemes to support farm incomes and deliver public goods in the process.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, last week I engaged in a public consultation to get farmer feedback on a new pilot environmental scheme.  I am interested in hearing the views of members on that.  The significant increase in the budget of 11% was an important platform from which to try to protect farm incomes in the year ahead.  I will closely monitor the sector to assess how best we can support it over the course of the year, particularly in accessing the Brexit adjustment reserve.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the &euro;100 million capital investment scheme for food processing and the dairy and meat processing sectors.  There are conditions attached to that.  The scheme is about adding value to food processing and ensuring we diversify product.  It is about trying to ensure we increase the value of our products and that farmers see a return from it.  The maximum grant aid available under that &euro;100 million capital investment fund will be 30%, so most of the investments will be less than that.</p><p>The objective is to encourage the processing sector to invest in the sector in a way that adds value and that develops and diversifies products and markets.  All of that is necessary because we need a healthy and robust processing sector that maximises the value of the food that is produced on farms, that ensures incomes are as high as possible and that we get maximum value on the international markets for the food we export.  I believe that addresses all the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions and ask him to note them.</p> <p>  At present, factories or operators that make meal bins export them but they are having serious problems acquiring the materials from the UK.  The farming community buys an awful lot of machinery from auctioneers such as Cambridge Machinery Sales but as many as one in three tractors for import must be stored in yards in England because of problems importing them.  Although officials in the Departments concerned and customs officials have stated there is no problem, truck drivers have experienced deep frustration when they tried to bring in this gear.  Has the Minister met the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to discuss the problems?  </p> <p>  Ireland has got &euro;1 billion and factories will receive &euro;100 million of that.  Where does the Minister envisage the remainder will be spent to benefit small family farms?</p> <p>  Some State agencies have contracts to supply milk to the HSE, for example.  Is there a danger that Brexit will put pressure on milk contracts?  We have heard about the seed potatoes issues.  Has the issue been sorted? </p> <p>  As the Chairperson outlined, there is talk today that officials in Northern Ireland will be pulled away and for safety reasons, the EU is rightly pulling some of its officials away dealing with imports of animals and food.  Will that situation create a big problem?  Last night, I heard RT&Eacute;'s Tommie Gorman say that a lot of this situation stems from the Article 16 problem concerning Ursula von der Leyen and company last week.  Will the Minister get a complete explanation of what went on and how the cat was thrown among the pigeons in that regard?  </p> <p>  The Minister went on media and said that he wrote to the European Commission asking for the deadline for the reduction in the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme to be extended.  Has he got any news about the scheme?</p> <p>  The Minister said that he wanted feedback and today I read about the new schemes that he has proposed.  I would always say to those who criticise his Department that it is fairly efficient at giving out money.  I read somewhere that schemes will be based on progress and whether something grows.  If we go down the road of consultants doing locally led schemes, then there will be less money in the pockets of farmers.  In fairness to the Department, if there is a scheme that stipulates one does X, Y and Z then one gets one's money and, in my opinion, the Department administers schemes more efficiently in respect of the overhead costs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021020200002#M00300"><p>I thank Deputy Fitzmaurice.  On the importation of farm machinery, there is ongoing and close engagement between my Department officials and officials in the Department of Transport and the Revenue Commissioners on the importation of all products, and I know about the challenges concerning farm machinery.</p><p>There have been many adjustment challenges, particularly as people adjust to the paperwork that is now involved and to ensuring they have prepared for what is required to meet the thresholds and the paperwork obligations.  It is something on which we will continue to try to support importers and exporters closely.  In order to do that, it is essential that all Departments are working closely together and that certainly is the position.  It does not mean there are not challenges; unfortunately there are.  That is a reflection of how Brexit was a really bad idea in the first instance and was only going to lead to challenges from a trade point of view.  However, we are determined to ensure trade flows as smoothly as possible and with everyone working together, in many ways it has gone as well as it could thus far.  As others have already pointed out, scale is down.  It will be scaling up but we will continue to work closely together to support everyone, across all sectors, in meeting the additional challenges.</p><p> On the &euro;1 billion Brexit adjustment fund, my objective in everything I do is ultimately to support farm incomes, to ensure they are as sustainable as possible and to maximise them.  That is why the &euro;179 million in additional funding in the most recent budget was aimed at supporting farmers directly, because that is my number one commitment.  In that context, it is important to have a robust processing sector as well and that it is invested in.  It is important for such investment to be about adding value to what farmers produce at farm level and ultimately be about trying to ensure it underpins farm incomes in the best way possible.  That is my objective in terms of how we assess and monitor farm incomes in the year ahead.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned milk production.  The challenge there with mixed milk is from the perspective of a third country or non-EU market.  There are some challenges in that regard and the sector is trying to manage them as best it can.  As time moves on, we certainly will seek to ensure the third country issues can be addressed as trade deals come up for renegotiation.</p><p> On seed potatoes, there was an issue with seed and ware potatoes.  Ware potatoes can now be imported into the country.  There remains a situation with seed potatoes where the SPS certifications are not provided for.  As a lot of the seed potatoes used domestically are imported from Scotland, that is a particular challenge.  The British Government is currently engaged with the European Commission on an application to cover seed potatoes for import and it remains to be seen what will transpire.  Undoubtedly there is an opportunity for us to try to reboot the seed potato industry domestically.  In the north west and in my own county in particular, there was always a strong tradition of seed potato production.  It is one that has fallen away in recent years but I am looking at the opportunities there to see how we can try to develop that further.  The engagement between the British Government and the EU Commission continues on the importation of seed potatoes.</p><p> With reference to EU checks in Northern Ireland, safety comes first and I think we all recognise that.  Full documentary checks continue in respect of imports.  It is important we recognise what the North-South protocol achieved.  Northern Ireland remains constitutionally part of the UK and part of the UK customs union but the protocol provides the opportunity for Northern Ireland to be fully part of the Single Market as well.  That leaves Northern Ireland in a unique position whereby it has access to both markets.  The North-South protocol and those checks are important for facilitating trade in both directions.  We will therefore work with our Northern Irish counterparts on supporting that and it is important that everybody takes a measured approach in the time ahead.</p><p>The Article 16 debate at EU level in the past week was not helpful.  As I said earlier, the European Commission has recognised that it was misguided and it was recognised as a mistake.  It is not something we will see in the future.</p><p> On the extension I have sought to the BEAM scheme from the Commission, the Deputy will be aware that a significant number of farmers are behind in meeting the 5% nitrogen reduction criteria, which was required of them by 1 July this year.  My objective is to always do everything I can to support farm incomes and to ensure that farmers are supported from a departmental and a policy point of view.  This was a welcome scheme, which was co-funded between the EU and the Exchequer.  More than half of the farmers are on course to meet their obligations to reduce their nitrogen use by 5%.  Some of them have taken significant action to achieve that.  Many other farmer did not join the scheme in the first instance because the 5% would have put them off and they decided to not avail of it.  Those who are on course to meet the 5% reduction by 1 July will be unaffected by the request I have made to the Commission.  If the extension is granted, it will allow for a new reference year from 1 January to 31 December this year so that farmers can reset and achieve the 5% reduction over the course of 2021.  I am hoping for an early answer from the Commission, but we have not yet received confirmation on that being granted.  I will be asking my Department to work with the representative organisations to engage with farmers, emphasising the importance of them engaging with their agricultural advisers on how best to take the action now to minimise the challenge of meeting that 5% reduction over the year ahead.  If that reduction is not met, it means that the money already paid out to individual farmers will be repayable and this is not a situation I want.  This is why I have sought this second opportunity for farmers to reset to try to ensure the money stays in their pockets.</p></speech>

On the situation at the ports in the Six Counties over the past 24 hours where staff were withdrawn by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in the North, and now staff have also been withdrawn by the European Commission, will the Minister clarify what are the implications of this?  What will it mean if staff cannot go back for a prolonged period?  Of course I join in extending our support to the workers and condemn any intimidation or harassment of the workers.  In that context, has the Minister spoken with his counterpart in the North?  I am aware there has been a change in the past 24 hours but has there been any direct correspondence or engagement on the issue with the Minister there, the Department or the European Commission?</p> <p>  The Minister's statement refers to financial and other support measures that have been put in place, and specifically direct aid.  We are now in the new, post-Brexit scenario.  What direct aid does he propose to provide for farmers?  Reference was made to the &euro;100 million investment scheme that was agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment but many farmers rolled their eyes at the thought of processors being able to avail of a grant when there are no new supports in place, and when it appears there are no criteria for the processors' engagements with the farming community.  Perhaps the Minister will outline for us whether it is his intention to provide direct supports to our primary producers in the short to medium term.</p><p>Regarding the BEAM scheme and the Minister's application for a referral, the question is whether we have left it too late.  The Minister, when an Opposition spokesperson, would have raised this issue before the summer last year because he would have heard, as we all did, from farmers who were finding it increasingly difficult to meet the reduction criteria without losing more than what they were set to gain from the scheme.  Why was there a delay?  What other measures can be put in place to support farmers who may not now be in a position, even with revised criteria, to meet the terms and conditions of that scheme?</p><p> With respect to the Brexit adjustment reserve fund, I am a little concerned by the remarks that we have heard here today.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s progress in ensuring that the draft scheme suggests that we will be in line for approximately &euro;1 billion but the reason our arguments were so strong related to agriculture.  The potential impact of Brexit on Irish farmers and the agrifood sector was set out in lights in terms of the challenges that Brexit would present to Ireland.  If we get to a scenario where a Brexit adjustment fund does not reflect that reality, it will be an absolute failure.  What we need to ensure, in the first instance, is that this reality is recognised and that other Departments do not pull a fast one over the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in other words, that we and Irish farmers secure a very high proportion of that fund.  I wonder if the Minister can put a percentage on the proportion of that &euro;1 billion he sees coming to agriculture, in particular, to our primary producers.</p><p> On mixed milk, when it came to arguing for the need for a backstop and for an Irish protocol, one of the issues that was easy to articulate to European negotiators and others within the political institutions was the issue of milk production because it clearly operates on an all-island basis and requires co-operation and interaction, North and South.  The figures speak for themselves.  We have a scenario where that sector, despite all of that, could be the one that is impacted as a result of the outworkings of Brexit.  The problems have been well-articulated; the solutions less so.  People need assurances in the first instance that the Government has informed its European counterparts that there will be no support for any new trade deal that fails to resolve this issue at that stage but also that we will go back to the Commission and say that existing trade deals need to be amended to reflect the fact that we have a milk product among the best in the world that can be sold across Europe and in Britain without tariffs or conditions, and the same should be the case for any third country that the EU has a trade deal with.  I am not convinced that argument is being made forcefully enough at this time and it should be.</p><p> I welcome the comments that have been made in respect of the issues relating to trade, logistics and the potential for disruption.  I hear that the templates and the proposals put in place are reflective of a 2019 level of demand.  Could we get some assurances that they will also facilitate surges?  January has been a particularly quiet month in trade and that has allowed us to put in place the transitional arrangements in a way that has not resulted in large delays.  The fear is that this will result in some form of a backlog at some stage in the future.  Can we have assurances that this will be addressed?</p><p> A number of contributors at our earlier hearings referred to the need for credit export insurance.</p><p>I would welcome the Minister's views on whether we will be in a position to put such a measure in place for our exporters, considering that many of our counterparts across the EU have such an insurance in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021020200002#Q00200"><p>On the Northern Irish ports, this is an emerging situation.  As I said, the first priority here is the safety of staff.  The type of threats we have seen are to be condemned by all.  There are still full documentary checks in place and we will work very closely with our Northern Irish and EU counterparts in the time ahead.  It is important that we all work together to calm the situation and recognise that the objective of the North-South protocol is to ensure access for Northern Ireland to the EU Single Market and the UK market and that it remains part of the customs union.</p> <p>  On direct aid for farmers, as I said, in the most recent budget I delivered an increase of &euro;179 million in direct support to farmers and in fresh funding for farm schemes.  My number one objective is farm incomes.</p> <p>  Deputy Carthy pointed out the investment in the processing sector in the time ahead, which will amount to &euro;100 million over the next five years or &euro;20 million per annum until 2025.  That will be about ensuring value is added to product and encouraging private investment in the processing sector.  </p> <p>  The most crucial issue at all times, from my point of view, is supporting and investing in farm incomes.  That is why I achieved an increase of &euro;179 million or 11% in the budget.  If people express concerns to the Deputy, he should remind them of that important support provided in the recent budget and of its importance to farm incomes.</p> <p>  The &euro;1 billion provided under the Brexit adjustment reserve will be important in supporting the overall economy, particularly the agrifood sector, in adjusting to Brexit and its impact.  I am monitoring that very closely and I stand ready to support the agrifood sector from the reserve as the situation evolves.</p> <p>  Well over half of farmers are on course to meet the current reference year with regard to the BEAM scheme.  However, we are now more than halfway through the reference year and it is clear that many farmers are not in a position to meet it.  I am hopeful that the new reference year will be approved at European level.  This will make the 12 months of 2021 a reference year and give farmers an opportunity to adjust to meet the 5% threshold.  The terms and conditions are the same now as they were when everybody signed up to the scheme.  While the terms and conditions have not changed, I hope that, with the approval of the European Commission, the reference year will change.  This will give farmers who are having difficulty meeting the threshold a second chance to do so in 2021.</p> <p>  We will do all we can in the time ahead in regard to mixed milk and the trade deal.  We will work with the European Union to have third country trade deals readjusted to make best use of the opportunities available.  We would like to address that issue to ensure this works and does not become an issue or is removed as an issue over time.</p> <p>  The benchmark taken for throughput at our ports was 2019.  Significant resources have been provided to meet the increased administration required with regard to importing and exporting.  This will depend on how volumes evolve.  In many cases, they are less than half of what they were previously.</p><p>There is no doubt they will increase again and if additional resources are required, they will be put in place to adjust to that.  </p><p> Regarding export insurance, there has been engagement over the past year between the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Deputy is right.  It is an area where there is currently no system in place but we continue to assess it in terms of what the opportunities and potential would be for such a scheme. </p></speech>

The issue of live exports was raised earlier and I want to come back to it.  There are issues regarding calf exports, lairages and so on that we are going to have to discuss, probably in the next few weeks.</p> <p>  What is the Minister's opinion on live exports, particularly to the UK?  I am referring to in-calf heifers and breeding animals.  These are top-quality beef and dairy animals that are going to the UK market only.  They are trying to build up their herd to same genetic standard that we have at the moment.  There has been great trade in these animals over the past few years and the new regulations are becoming a major impediment.  The Minister might elaborate on what can be done regarding that impediment because in the next six to eight weeks, the majority of this trade, particularly in in-calf Friesian heifers, will take place.  He might elaborate on how we can deal with that issue, particularly in the short term.  </p> <p>  Another issue I am coming across is delays in imports through ports, particularly parts for agricultural machinery, milking plants and so on.  There have been significant delays.  The usual turnaround time for a part for a Case tractor or Manitou machinery could be anything from one to three days; now it is seven to ten days at a minimum.  That is what the importers are telling us, which is a major issue for the industry.  This has not been streamline and a protocol has not been put in place.  What needs to be done to make sure that this can be streamlined so parts can be brought into Ireland?  The irony is that many of these parts are being transported from Europe to the UK and then to Ireland.  This trade issue is having a significant impact on getting those parts on to the island. </p> <p>  The last issue is slightly different.  It is about CAP.  The Minister might elaborate on the status of the talks.  The Brexit deal has been completed.  Rightly or wrongly, we are where we are with it.  There is going to be a rebalancing in the talks regarding CAP payments over the next two years.  The Minister might give an update on the negotiations and the timelines pertaining to that.</p></speech>

I will ask Ms Sheridan to come in on the Senator's second point about parts for machinery and the challenges in that regard.</p> <p>  The Senator's third point related to the CAP and where it is at.  A general approach was agreed both by the EU Council of Ministers and by the European Parliament on what the next seven-year CAP programme should look like.  It is currently in a trilogue process between the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission, to finalise the programme for the next seven years.  Hopefully, that process will conclude soon.  </p> <p>  We will have to submit our national CAP strategic plan to the Commission by 1 January next year.  This year is going to be important in developing our strategic plan.  I will engage in great depth with farming organisations and farming representatives over the next number of months on the design and nature of our plan.  There will then be public consultation on it in the second half of the year before we submit it at European level.</p><p>Once our national strategic CAP plan is approved, including the nature and type of scheme in Pillar 2 and the nature of our eco scheme, which will be a requirement under Pillar 1, 2022 will be about developing and preparing for those schemes, getting information out to farmers and working with them to prepare for the schemes to be in place from January 2023 when the new CAP will go live.  It will be a five-year programme, given that 1 January 2023 will be approximately two years later than this month, which was when the programme was due to kick off.  There will now be a two-year transition period, and I have announced that many of the outgoing schemes will be continued throughout that time to ensure there is no impact on farm incomes as we await the start of the new CAP.</p><p> I might ask Mr. Doyle to speak on the live export of animals, including to Britain.</p></speech>

Brexit has had the unfortunate consequence of bringing about new measures in respect of trade with the UK.  For example, there are additional residency requirements for animals, in that they must now be on the holding of origin in Ireland for 40 days prior to export, which is an increased length of time.</p> <p>  A second issue that is causing considerable challenges relates to drivers' vehicle approvals and transporter authorisations.  Brexit has meant that drivers' qualifications are no longer recognised between Ireland and the UK.  We have negotiated a solution for that with the UK, which will recognise Irish drivers' qualifications under the common travel area.  The information is on our website, including an email address to which a driver can apply with evidence of his or her qualification.  Regarding transporter approvals, the transporter must apply for approval in the UK.  There are links to that information on the website as well.</p> <p>  Another challenge is that an Irish-approved vehicle must now receive UK approval.  We are aware of the issue, which does not affect just us.  We had a meeting on it with the French this morning.  It is a challenge for other member states as well as ourselves.  We are engaging with the Commission on it.  We are also engaging with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland and the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to try to find a way forward, but it is a challenging situation.</p></speech>

In my part of the world, cows are calving at an awful rate and there will be significant pressure on live exports of in-calf and calved heifers in the next two to three weeks.  Is Mr. Doyle able to indicate a timeline for a solution?</p></speech>

We are working on it.  We have approved a number of UK vehicles.  That some transporters are approved in Northern Ireland presents another option, in that they are able to travel between Northern Ireland and Britain.  We are working to get as many vehicles approved as we can to allow trade to continue while we negotiate with the Commission, Northern Ireland and the UK, but it is a complex and difficult situation that has been created by Brexit.  We must respect the rules of the Common Market and we cannot engage in a bilateral solution with the UK.  Whatever we do has to be line with Commission rules.  While I agree that this situation is regrettable and it is a challenging space, we are working hard on it.</p></speech>

We are aware of the issues in respect of machinery parts.  We and our colleagues in Revenue met the freight forwarder association last week on this and other issues.  The problems are being caused by a particular reliance in Ireland on groupage.  A groupage container can have a large number of different consignments requiring a large volume of documentation to be submitted.  Businesses are now contending with that challenge.</p><p>It is primarily on the Revenue side of the operation.  There is a Revenue solution of which business operators can avail.  I am not completely <i>au fait</i>with that because it is quite a complicated arrangement but the information was passed on to those involved and Revenue is encouraging businesses to engage with the process.  That solution is available.  It is difficult, and the Minister made that point already.  We are working closely with businesses to resolve the issues that only came to light once the UK was outside the Single Market.</p></speech>

I have engaged in consultations with the dairy industry, hauliers and Meat Industry Ireland and I will make some observations and ask a few questions on foot of those.</p> <p>  In the context of mixed milk, it is estimated 4 billion l of milk from the North and the South go into various dairy products.  That is a massive amount.  Has the Department an idea what percentage of the market will be effected by the loss of access and competitiveness now that this milk cannot be sent to Japan, Canada and Korea, for example?</p> <p>  Hauliers have raised issues such as the duty on produce coming into the UK and then to Ireland.  Companies need clarity because many are being faced with charges that they did not expect.  Then there are duty-paid terms.  It is stated that UK multiples have pushed back on Irish food producers and are making them more responsible for the payment of the import tariffs.  That will add extra costs for consumers.  Can this matter be tackled in any way?   Do we know the percentage of the trucks that were forced to turn around from UK ports due to incorrect paperwork?  What aspects of the paperwork process are proving particularly problematic?</p> <p>  On Meat Industry Ireland, businesses are now faced with burdensome additional paperwork and export processes.  The new customs SPS checks, delays and disruption in logistics mean that the direct route to continental Europe is adding a cost of &euro;500 to &euro;800 per truck.  Some hauliers are being forced to travel back from Great Britain with their trucks empty and this is giving rise to an increase of &euro;600 in the cost per journey.  It depends on the routes, but we understand that the costs are increasing by anywhere from 25% to 40%.  The consequences of this point to the need for new trade, but what can be done to cut these huge extra costs?</p> <p>  Further capacity is needed in the direct sailings from the Republic of Ireland to continental Europe because the new capacity, while welcome, is well below the volume of traffic that had been using the UK land bridge.  Meat Industry Ireland states that the reopening of the Chinese market for Irish beef is a major priority for the beef sector here.  The possibility of new markets must be explored and action must be taken to deal with competition from cheap imports.  Has the Department done any work in opening up new markets?  Can we get an update on talks that have taken place in this regard?</p> <p>  On Article 16, what is the extent of the disruption that took place at the weekend?  Will it have an impact down the supply chain or at other ports?  Is the Minister concerned that threats such as those witnessed in the ports at Belfast and Larne could be seen at other ports in the UK?  As the checks and certification requirements become more rigorous on 1 April and 1 July, is he worried that any difficulties could further inflame tensions?  Does he believe that the actions of the EU at the weekend have served to confirm in the minds of those who do not trust the EU or the intent behind the Northern Ireland protocol that their concerns have been realised?  Is he concerned about the future of the supply line arrangements?</p></speech>

We are monitoring that closely across the agrifood sector.</p><p> On reopening the Chinese market, that has been a priority and something I have been working on as Minister.  I met the Chinese ambassador recently to try to move the issue forward.  The Taoiseach has also recently written to Premier Li to try to make progress and seek to have it reopened.  It is an important market for beef and other agrifood export lines.  It is something we are focusing on and doing our best to make progress on.</p><p> On Northern Ireland ports, the safety of staff is paramount and there is an onus on all of us, North and South, to work to reduce tensions in this regard.  The North-South protocol is ultimately about ensuring Northern Ireland has access to the Single Market as well as to the UK market.  That requires processes to be in place to achieve that.  We will monitor it closely and work to ensure issues are resolved, in particular, that there is a responsible approach and attitude and that any tensions that are emerging are dialled down.  Does Mr. Savage want to come in on the point about the duties?</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned mixed milk and the percentage of markets that might be affected by that in terms of getting product into places like Japan, Canada and so on.  We have been engaging with milk processors over quite a long period regarding the potential impact of rules of origin on this type of exports.  As for precisely what the differentiation might be in terms of impact on individual markets, we do not have full details on that.  In the context of engaging with processors, that would be considered commercially sensitive in terms of sharing that with the Department.  We do not have full figures on those but the key thing from our point of view is that we have continued our efforts to engage with the European Commission on this issue and to try to find a resolution.  I mentioned earlier that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is in ongoing contact with Commission Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi on a number of issues arising from the withdrawal agreement and means of origin is among those.  Those contacts will continue because they are of a political rather than technical nature.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned duties or charges on products coming in from Great Britain.  I think he might be referring to issues around the use of distribution centres in GB for the processing of products coming from EU markets, brought to centres in GB and then separated or repackaged for onward movement to Ireland or other member states.  There is an emerging issue there relating to rules of origin because, from a Commission point of view, once a product goes into those types of distribution centres, it is deemed to have gone into free circulation so there is no way we can say such products are definitively of EU origin, from the Commission's point of view.  We have been engaging with stakeholders on this and have spoken with Food Drink Ireland and others around the difficulties being encountered.</p> <p>  Where movements are coming from the EU via GB, for instance, into Ireland, the easiest way to resolve the difficulties is to ensure they move under a customs transit procedure.  That is the most straightforward way to do it in order that they remain in the customs system and within customs control.  It means moving them to a customs warehouse or a customs bonded facility where any separation or mixing or matching of product might take place before onward movement.  We have engaged with operators on that front and this is around adjustment of supply chains in the context of reaction to Brexit because, not just in the agrifood sector but across all sectors, there are issues arising related to rules of origin where Great Britain is used as a hub, either for transport of product or as a step in the process of moving product from one location to another.</p><p>Again, operators and the operational supply chains will have to adjust over time but one solution in this area is to ensure that goods are moved under customs transit arrangements.  </p></speech>

The first concerns the situation in meat plants.  We have seen a number of reports on newly emerged clusters in recent days and weeks.  We know, from previous experience, the challenges that can present when clusters emerge in meat plants as we try to exit from restrictions .  My first question is whether rolling testing arrangements in meat plants are continuing and if so, to what extent.  How is the Minister's Department engaging with the Department of Health to try to minimise the instances of outbreaks within meat plants?</p> <p>  Second, what the hell is going on with mink farms?  We know that in November, the CMO issued very clear advice to the Department that all minks should be culled because of the great public health risk that they present.  The Department accepted that recommendation.  Yet, here we are in February and it appears that nothing has happened.  There is a veil of secrecy.  I know that freedom of information, FOI, requests as to what is going on behind the scenes have been refused.  The citation has been "commercial sensitivity".  In what was clear public health guidance provided to the Department, I ask the Minister to give a clear reason that has yet to be acted upon.</p></speech>

I know that unfortunately, supplies of the vaccine are extremely scarce.  Our milk processing facilities operate at capacity - some would say even beyond capacity - from the last week of April to the second week of June.  A cluster in a milk processing facility would have serious repercussions for capacity through the month of May in particular.  Is there any possibility that workers in milk processing facilities can be upgraded in respect of when they are due to get the vaccine?  I know that many sector groups are looking for reclassification and to get themselves up the list.  However, milk processing facilities are at maximum capacity for about six weeks and a cluster in one of those plants would have serious repercussions during peak season.</p></speech>

The plants also continue to work closely with the HSE and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in respect of the protocols that are in place.  As with wider society in recent weeks, there have been particular challenges for all in respect of infection rates and the increased challenge of trying to ensure that the significant infection rates do not impact upon employees.  The serial testing is continuing.  It has been important in respect of trying to address risk and in identifying where there might be positive cases.  It will continue in the time ahead.  I recently met representatives of the industry to discuss the issue and emphasised the importance of continuing to take all precautions possible.  I acknowledge that the industry has been making tremendous efforts in that regard.  The last number of weeks have been really challenging for all businesses that have had to continue to operate, including meat factories, given the high infection rates that have been prevalent.</p><p>We also know from last year about the particular challenges regarding meat factories, such as the high number of people who work in them and the importance of the precautions in place, as well as the importance of continuing serial testing to reduce the risk, assist with infection control and keep staff safe.</p><p> In regard to mink farms, the Chief Medical Officer indicated his concern and his request that mink be culled, given the emergence of the Danish strain of Covid before Christmas.  As Minister, I established that it would require new primary legislation for that to be carried out.  I met mink farmers at that stage to relay the request I had received from the Chief Medical Officer and our intention to pursue it.  In the interim, there was ongoing testing of both mink and staff at the farms to protect against the risk of the strain spreading.  More recently, the Chief Medical Officer indicated that he is no longer concerned by the risk mink pose and that he is no longer seeking the culling of mink from the point of view of the risk of Covid.  Nonetheless, there is a clear commitment in the programme for Government to phasing out mink farming in Ireland, so I am proceeding on the basis that we are seeking to close mink farming in the country.  There is ongoing engagement between my Department and mink farmers and I will soon come forward with primary legislation that will facilitate proceeding with a cull and bringing an end to mink farming in the country.</p><p> On milk processing and the vaccination programme, I recently met representatives of Dairy Industry Ireland and the CEOs of the dairy companies and co-operatives to discuss a number of issues.  I am aware of the importance of peak supply and of the workers who work in the industry.  As members will be aware, an expert committee has been put in place.  It is managing and overseeing the roll-out of the vaccination process to ensure that those who are at highest risk are vaccinated first, and all the pertinent information on essential workers has been fed in to it.  It has put in place a strategy and process for rolling out the vaccines as quickly as we receive them in a way that addresses those who are most at risk from a health point of view and prioritises healthcare staff.  Essential workers in the food industry will also form part of the prioritisation categories in the place that is regarded as most appropriate in the roll-out, from the committee&rsquo;s point of view.  It is a matter for it to decide on and it has the relevant information it needs on the various professions and the necessity of the work that various workers carry out.  First and foremost, the priority is protecting people's health and especially that of healthcare professionals.</p></speech>

I will take the Minister at his word that testing is ongoing, but why is there so much secrecy?  Workers in these plants have contacted us with concern about their working conditions and members of the public in the area ask us questions continually.  It seems we have gone back to the very start, whereby everything is kept hush-hush.  If all this testing is ongoing and everything is clear and above board, why is more information not coming out?</p></speech>

We are all familiar with the situation in Bandon, where 67 people were diagnosed last week.  The big issue is the lack of information that was given to the community.  Obviously the plant has issues, as it is only working at a certain level of capacity at the moment.  For the town of Bandon and the surrounding area to have so many people, unfortunately, tied down with Covid, and I have not taken into consideration close contacts, it had a big bearing in what happened there in the past ten days.  That kind of information is key.  Other Deputies have mentioned the need to convey information to communities, which is very important.  Leaving it up to the meat plants to decide to inform communities about what is happening is not good enough.  The community of Bandon only heard that nearly 70 workers at a local plant were diagnosed as having Covid last week through a leak to the media.  We need to work on protocols because they are not there at the moment and it is literally left to how one particular plant or organisation wants to deal with the matter.  Without a shadow of a doubt some places are better than others but some just close up shop and say they have nothing to report as Covid is not an issue.  We need to have some direction in order that information is given to communities in the event of an outbreak .</p></speech>

In terms of communication, there are protocols for staff to self-isolate and take precautions.  The difference with meat factories is that we have ongoing serial testing as an additional aid to oversee infection rates and to work with the factories to ensure they are minimised.  I take on board the feedback from the Deputies and Senators.  We have, working in conjunction with the industry, emphasised the importance of protocols.  They have gone to very significant lengths to put in place protocols to ensure their staff are kept safe and it is paramount that this continues in the time ahead.</p></speech>

Farmers pay a levy when they buy plastic bale wrap.  Such plastic is stacked up everywhere because it is not being sent to the UK at the moment.  As this appears to be a total mess at present, we must do something in this country to address the problem such as using it to make pallets.  The Department must examine the matter because there is a looming problem with the amount of used plastic that has accumulated on farms.</p></speech>

Following the initial advice of the CMO, the Department proceeded on the basis that we would proceed with a cull.</p><p>The run-up to Christmas is pelting season, when approximately 80% of the mink in the country are pelted.  We engaged with the farmers to indicate that there would be no breeding afterwards, we would bring forward primary legislation in this regard and, in the meantime, we would closely monitor risk from a testing point of view.  In recent days, the CMO made clear the risk from a variant is no longer a priority from his point of view and that there was no need for a cull from a health point of view.  Regardless, we intend to proceed with the programme for Government commitment to bring mink farming to an end.</p><p> With regard to the comments of Deputy Fitzmaurice and the Chairman on the plastic levy, I am certainly examining it and I will take on board their suggestions and feedback and consider them.</p></speech>

I know there are other issues but these are the three main ones we would like the Minister and the officials to take from the committee today.</p> <p>  I reiterate the comment made at the start of the meeting that great work has been done in ensuring we are able to continue to trade.  I will not say it is in a seamless fashion but it is as seamless as it can be following the divorce that has happened between us and the UK.  Great credit is due to everyone that we have not had market turbulence and that we continue to trade.

I remind them that apart from myself and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are participating remotely and all members are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  I am pleased that we are able to commence our pre-legislative scrutiny of the competition (amendment) Bill 2021.  The principal objective of the Bill is to transpose the EU's European Competition Network, ECN, directive that will make the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPG, and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, more effective in overseeing and enforcing competition law.  The directive was adopted in 2019 with a transposition deadline of 4 February 2021.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, recently sent the general scheme of the Bill to the committee asking that we prioritise our consideration of this matter.  Today, we are receiving a first briefing on the matter after which members can indicate how they wish to proceed with our conversation on the matter.  </p> <p>  From the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I welcome Ms Clare McNamara, who is accompanied by Ms Gr&aacute;inne O'Carroll and Mr. Se&aacute;n Smith and will make an opening statement explaining what is involved after which members can discuss this matter.  The witnesses are participating remotely.  In line with normal practice, members have been provided with opening statements from the Department.  </p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.</p><p>However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal prosecution from proceedings as a witness physically present does.</p><p> Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> I now invite Ms Clare McNamara to make her opening statement.  As her written statement has been circulated, it may be helpful to just highlight the main issues in it.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Gr&aacute;inne O&rsquo;Carroll and Se&aacute;n Smith.  We very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to the committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the scheme and to assist it in any way we can.  I will outline the background to the scheme and set out its main provisions after which we look forward to hearing the members' views and answering questions.<br/><br/>The Bill has three broad aims: to transpose the ECN+ directive which will make the CCPC and ComReg more effective in overseeing and enforcing competition law; to introduce other powers additional to the EU directive to assist in this regard; and to do so in a way which establishes a clear and uniform regime for businesses and national competition authorities so as not to have differing requirements under national and EU law.<br/><br/>In terms of the background to the scheme, it is useful to recall some important milestones along the way.  In 2013, the European Commission began its assessment of the functioning of Regulation 1 of 2003 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 101 and 102 of the treaty.  The Commission highlighted divergences in national powers, procedures and sanctions available to national competition authorities, which has resulted in uneven enforcement of EU competition rules.  It is important to note that the Commission made direct reference to the inability of Irish NCAs to impose civil fines.<br/><br/>Arising from the findings of the Commission communication and following additional stakeholder engagement and consultation, the Commission presented its formal proposal for a directive on 22 March 2017.  It was adopted and subsequently published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union </i>on 14 January 2019 with a transposition deadline of 4 February 2021.  As the directive introduces the concept of administrative sanctions there were constitutional matters that had to be considered before the general scheme could be finalised.  The directive also introduces other measures that are novel in the Irish legal context such as periodic penalty payments, interim measures and leniency provisions.  Legal advice was needed on these also in order to progress the general scheme. <br/><br/>Given the time limitation, I ask the committee to please excuse me for not going through the scheme provision by provision, but I will summarise as far as possible.  The scheme aims to ensure the full and accurate transposition of the ECN+ directive.  Parts 1 to 7, inclusive, of the scheme of the Bill deal directly with that transposition.  <br/><br/>Part 2 of the scheme deals with the competent authorities themselves, including their independence and resourcing, as well as ensuring they conduct their investigations in accordance with the fundamental rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.<br/><br/>Part 3 of the scheme deals with investigations, including powers to inspect, requests for information and powers to summon witnesses.  This Part also deals with, in head 13, the concept of interim measures which is where the competent authority, if concerned that certain behaviours or actions could result in a very serious breach of competition law, can impose interim measures seeking the ceasing of such practices in advance of the completion of the overall investigation.  The remainder of this Part of the scheme covers such matters as expedited appeals against the imposition of interim measures, the statement of objections and actions arising from same, structural and behavioural remedies and binding agreements or commitments.  <br/><br/>Part 4 of the scheme is entitled sanctions and covers administrative fines, including their calculation, maximum amounts, court confirmation of fines, the appeals system and the concept of periodic penalty payments.<br/><br/>Part 5 of the scheme covers the immunity programme, incorporating the leniency programme, and sets out the process for immunity from administrative fines, the conditions whereby such fines may be reduced, the general conditions for leniency, the forms of leniency statements, markers for application for immunity, summary applications for leniency and the interplay between applications for immunity from administrative fines and sanctions on natural persons.<br/><br/>Part 6 of the scheme covers mutual assistance.  All heads in this part set out the requirements of the competent authorities in terms of co-operation with competent authorities in other member states.</p><p>That includes requests from other member states for the notification of preliminary objections or the enforcement of decisions such as administrative sanctions or periodic penalty payments.  Part 7 of the scheme sets out the procedural provisions such as the role of the competent authorities before the courts, the access to files and admissibility of evidence.</p><p> Part 8 of the scheme covers provisions unrelated to the transposition of the directive.  These heads deal with such matters as creating a criminal offence in the case of bid-rigging at the request of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and recommended in the Hamilton review, powers in the area of covert surveillance as well as giving it additional powers to allow for the taking of summary prosecutions in the event of gun-jumping in mergers.  Some of these heads also clear up some inadvertent errors in existing legislation such as correcting cross-referencing errors.</p><p> I am happy to discuss the provisions of the scheme in more detail and to respond to questions from members of the committee.</p></speech>

I thank our witnesses for giving their time and for the presentation given by Ms McNamara.  Does Ms McNamara believe that our national competition authorities, NCAs, have the necessary resources to tackle white collar crime?  I am referring to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.  Does Ms McNamara feel that it has the resources to tackle white collar crime considering a huge amount of the resources on transposition will be directed to consumer related matters?  Does she think there is a need for additional resources or does she believe the resources are adequate for the moment?</p></speech>

In looking at its budget ask, two areas were considered - resources for dealing with Brexit and the fallout from Brexit, particularly around consumer protection, market surveillance and product safety and specifically in the area of this Bill and the additional powers it will give the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.</p></speech>

I have spoken to, as I am sure have all the Deputies and Senators at this meeting, small bidders, small builders and people who would be bidding for these contracts.  They will say it is their view - this is their view as relayed to me - that bid-rigging happens and that it happens in State contracts.  The issue was raised with me in relation to large-scale projects where one might have a number of people bidding for those contracts.  It came very much to the fore in the building of a hospital.  I will not name it but I am sure we all know the one I am speaking about.  Has Ms McNamara conducted any research into bid-rigging to prompt this and the transposition?  Does she have any information to back up the fact it is happening and that there is a need for us to stop it in respect of State contracts in the first instance but then more broadly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare McNamara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021020200002#C00600"><p>Yes, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, has evidence that bid-rigging is happening, particularly in public procurement.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, has been asking for bid-rigging to be made a specific offence in law for quite some time.  It made a submission to us and to the Hamilton review group.  As it turns out, at the same time as we were considering putting it into this Bill, the Hamilton review group report said it needed to be made a specific offence.</p> <p>  It is important to note cartel behaviour is criminal behaviour.  Bid-rigging is a form of cartel behaviour.  It is where firms bid in a procurement process but agree among themselves which firm submits the most advantageous tender.  This enables them to attract a higher price because the bidders that agree to lose submit inflated bids or agree not to bid at all which in its own way is also bid-rigging.</p><p>It is taken very seriously.  The CCPC's experience is that because it is not treated as a separate offence, for example when it comes to taking court cases, the practice is to regard it as a form of price fixing or market sharing.  It was considered in some court cases to go beyond the existing scope of anti-competitive behaviour because it is not a specific offence.  That is why we are trying to make it clear in this Bill that this is criminal behaviour.  It is a specific offence and will be dealt with in that way.</p></speech>

What interests me more is whether we can put a money amount on how much will be saved as a result of this.  There is recognition from the CCPC that this is a serious problem.  As Ms McNamara says, it happens with public contracts.  It is not the fault of any one person or whatever.  It is most likely because of the size of the contracts.  Those contracts are so lucrative that it is certainly in the interests of people to ensure they get them.  I will not put it any stronger than that.  Has Ms McNamara an estimate of what kind of money we would be looking at saving if we could stamp out this practice?  At the end of the day, the taxpayer is on the hook for many of these projects.  Making it an offence is one matter but it would be interesting if we could quantify what the savings that might accrue to the State as a result of it could be.</p></speech>

I am afraid it would not be possible to identify the quantum of costs to the economy of bid-rigging.  It is only when it is an offence and the CCPC is able to start prosecuting a specific offence of bid-rigging that we might be able to work backwards to assess what the costs have been to the economy in the past.</p></speech>

We had the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, in here two weeks ago.  It was looking for similar additional powers.  Obviously, Ms McNamara feels that more powers are needed.  It is in this Bill.  I am trying to hone in on something.  With the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and others, for instance, there is quite a high bar in terms of that surveillance.  Obviously, it goes through the Garda.  There is a structure.  The courts must be involved or else a superior officer.  It seems that these powers would be granted outside of that process.  It raises the question that we are only looking at similar powers now.  The CCPC will have similar powers to the CAB.  How will that operate?  These powers will operate separate to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is no provision for the use of those powers to be overseen in any way by either a judge or a member of the Garda.  Could Ms McNamara talk about that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.84" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare McNamara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021020200002#D00500"><p>I can assure the Deputy at the beginning that the CCPC would only do so under a warrant from the court.  I accept it is probably not clear from the general scheme.  Also, the CCPC would only be doing this in very restricted circumstances, purely in the investigation of cartels because cartel behaviour is criminal behaviour.  It would only be in the investigation of cartels and it would always require a warrant from the court.</p> <p>  It would only be in exceptional circumstances where they need to do it immediately and do not have time to get involved in asking the Garda to get the warrant on their behalf.  They want to be able to apply directly for a warrant.  Sometimes it happens with cartel behaviour that the CCPC can get very late notice that there is a meeting about to happen in a hotel room and it knows that the meeting could have very serious implications in terms of a cartel's operations.</p></speech>

The recourse is direct to the courts.  In terms of time, as Ms McNamara said, much of this activity happens at short notice and people will not give the CCPC six months' notice in time to get its affairs in order.  Is there a worry that the courts might somehow delay it and that might be an obstacle?  Is there a facility for them to bypass the courts or is it only with the imprimatur of the courts that it can happen?</p></speech>

One must be very careful about safeguarding people's rights under the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  From that perspective, we would have to ensure that there is the imprimatur of the courts.</p></speech>

It is not clear from my reading of it, which is not a deficiency on anyone's part but my own, whether there is a scenario where it could happen without the imprimatur of the courts.  Is Ms McNamara saying - I am not trying to box her into a corner; it is a straight question - that she does not think it would ever happen or is it specifically not allowed?  In the latter case, I have not seen that part of the proposed Bill and I will read it again.</p></speech>

We would have to make sure, as the Bill is drafted, that it is very clear that it would be done with a warrant.  It is also important to point out that there is always a garda on secondment to the CCPC all the time to assist the commission.  We are looking to expand its current powers while including the current safeguards.</p></speech>

Does it apply to the cloud or digital communications?  It refers specifically to surveillance and audio surveillance, which to my mind is the traditional thing of people sitting in a car taking pictures or whatever.  Communication is much more sophisticated.  They are less likely to be meeting in a hotel room and more likely to be meeting across Zoom.  Is it anticipated that those powers will cover that online area too?</p></speech>

The Deputy is absolutely right when she suggests that cartels require communication but as communication technology has improved over time, cartels have become much more sophisticated in taking advantage of technological developments.  The CCPC has the power to obtain communications from metadata which will show it that individuals have been communicating but it does not provide the content of the communications.  We are trying to overcome that with this provision.</p></speech>

It was reported recently that Ireland's rating in the corruption perception index has slipped.  We have gone backwards, which is clearly not good.  There is a perception - I will not put it more strongly than that - among the people we meet when we are able to be out and about, canvassing or knocking on doors about the extent to which white-collar crime is happening.  I have to be straight - this perception extends to the extent to which people perceive that the State is ignoring it.  People feel that someone who goes to work in a suit is less likely to be prosecuted, etc.  That is the perception that people have and it is genuinely held.  Does Ms McNamara believe the general scheme as outlined can ensure that our National Consumer Agency can rigorously tackle white-collar crime to the point where people are reassured?  There is no point in sitting here pretending that people think everything is all right and every piece of white-collar crime is coming across the desk of the relevant person and being investigated.  There is a perception that a certain amount goes on that is never tackled.  Does Ms McNamara have confidence that the powers proposed in this Bill will make a real and substantial difference in the area of white-collar crime?  I have spoken to the ODCE, which describes the people it deals with as litigious and having deep pockets.  We know who these people are.  They are not small-time operators.  As Ms McNamara has said, they are bidding for big contracts and we are talking about serious money.  I am conscious of the perception and I appreciate that rigorous action must be taken to address that.  I would be interested to hear whether it is Ms McNamara's position that the powers proposed in the Bill are sufficient?</p></speech>

One of our biggest problems around the CCPC and its predecessors is that they have not had the power to impose administrative sanctions.</p><p>As a result, if they follow a civil route, the person who is taken to court gets a slap on the wrist and that is it.  Certainly people who are breaching competition law will factor the cost of the court cases into the benefits of what they are doing.</p><p> In terms of what we believe the Bill will do, we are very confident that it will give the CCPC and ComReg the powers to slap on some significant administrative fines on undertakings that are in significant breach of competition law.  We are very confident.  When we speak about the index, in terms of competition enforcement the CCPC found itself in competition with all of the EU member states that have the administrative fine facilities that Ireland never had.  I mentioned in my opening statement that when the Commission did its review of its own regulation Ireland was singled out in its communication because it did not have a civil fines regime.  This is a sea change in terms of competition enforcement in Ireland.</p></speech>

The political system has long wanted this and it was continually blocked by legal advice.  It is great to see it lifted.  The problem with a lot of these cartels and the abuse of dominance is the burden of proof.  I know administrative fines will probably allow the Department to be less selective in what cases it pursues but will there be a lower barrier to taking on big players?  It is well known we have very limited competition in many sectors, including banking, telecommunications and insurance.  They fight tooth and nail if there is any suggestion of taking them on.  I would like an understanding of this.</p> <p>  My next question is on new technologies creating dominance of a sort we would not have typically considered.  The control of data is now a new source of dominance.  Is this adequately embraced by what we call abuse of dominance in competition law?  It seems there are many new sources of potential dominance coming in.  Has the law caught up on this?  We have seen some cases where it has been challenged.</p> <p>  The Bill will introduce specific offences on rigging.  Are there other specific offences we need to contemplate?  Is the Department working on further legislation, either on specific offences or powers, to get to grips with the changing competitive environment?</p></speech>

With regard to other offences, the CCPC and ComReg had the opportunity while the ECN+ directive was being negotiated to come to us with a wish list, in particular of the type of offences it wanted us to examine if we were going to do this by primary legislation.  The two areas it came to us with were bid rigging and gun jumping.  We are dealing with both of these in the Bill.  Gun jumping is where somebody goes ahead with a merger without waiting for the approval of the competition authority, and I already covered bid rigging in answering Deputy O'Reilly's questions.  They are the only issues the CCPC and ComReg asked us for with regard to specific offences.  This is not to say we are not always looking at developments in the area.</p> <p>  This brings me on to the question about data sharing and ownership in the digital world.  This particular Bill will not necessarily deal with abuse of dominance in these areas but it is worth noting developments are already taking place at EU level.  The Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act are looking at this area of data, online content and gatekeepers.</p><p>There will be further legislation coming down the tracks in transposing EU legislation in this area.  Competition law is constantly evolving and the Deputy is absolutely right that there can be abuse of dominance in different areas.  The legislation being considered now concerns the dominance of the key market gatekeepers, to use the term in EU legislation, in terms of market dominance.  I will not name any players in the area and members could guess who is being referred to by the European Commission.</p><p> In terms of the burden of proof, the issue we have had up to now is that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and ComReg have required the criminal burden of proof in order to be able to take criminal cases.  Whereas cartel behaviour will always be considered criminal behaviour, the criminal burden of proof is required now but in taking a civil case all that results is a slap on the wrist for the undertaking, so there will be a lower burden of proof.  It will not be of the criminal level that is now required.  There will be significant fines in comparison with the type of fines applied even in criminal cases now where there has traditionally been a lower level of fines.</p><p> There will be a lower burden of proof with higher fines.  How that interacts with the criminal system or regime is something we will focus on with drafting in order to ensure the interplay between the two is dealt with.</p></speech>

Again, I welcome the officials to the committee.  Will they speak to the matter of gun jumping or its prevalence?  There are a number of heads dealing with leniency and immunity so could those be fleshed out a bit?  It appears that if somebody co-operates and discloses information about their comrades in any alleged offence, they may be treated in a more lenient way.  There may be implications in doing that and they may be endangering parties, depending on the alleged offence.  Would protection be furthered to somebody in a position where he or she is involved with serious criminal organisations?</p> <p>  The Bill speaks about sealing business and books for the duration of an investigation.  Is there a limit to how long a business can be sealed?  We might envisage a case where a business could be closed for a considerable period, leading to a loss of income and turnover, as well as damage to reputation.  Will the witnesses speak to that?  If the process takes an inordinate period in the courts, a party may feel that a business has been shut after doing nothing wrong and may want to appeal to a court.  The business may have no way of opening until somebody decides the investigation is over.  One can see how that might be an issue.</p> <p>  I notice as well there are also unannounced inspections allowed in people's comes.  CRH has been mentioned and it has been noted that documents, books and information can be stored in people's homes.  Will the witnesses speak to that?  There is an issue with ComReg having the main powers in this as well.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that a garda would be on secondment but would other officials have some form of warrant cards or identification?  This came up previously when I dealt with a copyright Bill and people were going to premises and had to prove who they were.  Somebody else should not be able to pretend to be from the competition authority, for example.  The question of technology and surveillance comes in as well.  Data is the new oil, people tell me, so are the powers going far enough when we consider what is changing?  Is flexibility built into this in case we see further change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare McNamara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021020200002#H00100"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will start with gun jumping and give him an explanation of what is involved in that.  Under Irish competition law, mergers or acquisitions which reach certain thresholds have to be notified to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and they cannot be put into effect without obtaining clearance from the CCPC.  Failure to notify any such merger or acquisition or putting it into effect before clearance by the CCPC is referred to as gun jumping.  Currently, the offence of gun jumping is under section 89 of the 2002 Act and it can be prosecuted on a summary basis or on indictment by the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, only.  What we are trying to do here is put in a provision that the CCPC can bring a summary prosecution in respect of gun jumping.  It will ease the burden on the DPP and, in effect, is trying to deal with that.</p> <p>  In terms of the level of incidence of it, I do not have that information to hand.  I can certainly inquire of the CCPC, but as I say, the intention of the provision is to allow the CCPC to take the summary prosecutions for gun jumping offences to reduce the burden on the DPP and to increase the enforcement in that area.</p> <p>  With regard to leniency and immunity, there is a non-statutory immunity programme that the CCPC operates with the DPP in terms of cartel behaviour.  However, this Bill will be dealing with immunity from administrative sanctions and leniency in terms of such sanctions by having the fine reduced if there is co-operation with the CCPC.  The decision on immunity from criminal prosecution will always be a matter for the DPP.  This is around reduction in administrative fines in return, it is hoped, for co-operation leading to the prosecution of the cartel.</p> <p>  The directive also puts in place a system of a marker for immunity.  If a person is applying for leniency, for example, head 30 of the Bill refers to applications for immunity from administrative fines.  It sets up the system for the competent authority, for example, the CCPC, to grant applicants for immunity from administrative fines a marker in their place in the queue, effectively.  It gives them the time to gather all the evidence they need to provide to the CCPC to get the immunity or the leniency they are seeking.  It is a brand new provision in Irish law and this is one of the more novel aspects of this directive.  It is intended to support the administration of this new provision for those who assist the competent authority.  It means that if more than one undertaking is co-operating, whoever gets to the authority first marks their place in a queue and cannot be jumped in the queue by the second undertaking that comes to assist.  I hope that sets out or clarifies some of what is involved in terms of the leniency and immunity programme.</p> <p>  The question the Deputy asked about the inspection powers and the time to seal the premises shows the importance of having pre-legislative scrutiny with his committee because it is a very important question.  It is one we will have to talk to the Parliamentary Counsel about in terms of making sure that this head, when it is being drafted, puts into place a very strict timeframe, because in the same way as the level of fines are not meant to be putting undertakings out of business, the same should be true of sealing premises and gathering evidence.  We should not be in the business of impacting upon the profitability of an undertaking in the meantime.  That is certainly something we have taken note of, and we will make sure that, when we are talking to the Parliamentary Counsel, that is looked at closely.</p> <p> The Deputy spoke about data.  I am hoping that my response to Deputy Bruton's question around this area and the fact that there are new developments at EU level all the time in this area answered that question.  Already there are two new proposals around the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, which are looking at the gatekeepers of those data.  I hope that has answered that question.</p> <p>  In terms of the surveillance, I cannot add to what I said when I was answering Deputy O'Reilly on that.  This is very important in terms of cartel behaviour.</p><p>Additional covert surveillance powers are something we only see in terms of the criminal investigations of cartel behaviour, not in investigations of other anti-competitive behaviour that would result in fines.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions</p></speech>

I thank Ms McNamara for a refreshingly frank and impressive presentation.</p> <p>  I want to drill down into a couple of key sectors that I know will be of interest to people watching at home, such as the powers of ComReg and the role Eir has played in recent years.  I will start with a political point which needs to be made.  The privatisation of Eir has been an absolute disaster.  When the telecoms companies appeared before the committee a couple of years ago, they said as much.  They said that the regulatory structure is failing the markets.  This includes a lack of regulation of the incumbent and main wholesale provider, Eir.  There is an imbalance in the marketplace to the detriment of consumers.  This situation is not only bad for other competing operators but also for citizens with fixed broadband prices among the highest in Europe.</p> <p>  The European Commission's report last year, Digital Economy and Society Index, showed that Ireland has the third most expensive fixed broadband in the EU.  On fixed and mobile offers, Ireland had the second most expensive.  Eir is, of course, one of the most profitable incumbent telcos in Europe.  Last October, ComReg looked at the Eir wholesale price and it has gone out to review.  ComReg's actions seem to be taking a much more lenient approach than that advocated by the European Commission in this regard.  Last year, the European Commission told the communications regulator to reduce rates for fixed-line telecommunications as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  Clearly, the market is not working and householders are not benefiting.  What is contained in this legislation that would benefit the householder and address the issues about Eir's powers in the marketplace?</p></speech>

It has powers as a regulator of the telecommunications market, which is totally outside the remit of our Department.  That is within the remit of ComReg's parent Department.  It then has powers as a competition authority.</p> <p>  The powers that ComReg would be given under this Bill deal specifically with the implementation of competition law both in terms of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the 2002 Competition Act.</p><p>It is only specifically breaches of competition law, whether that is cartel behaviour or abuse of dominance.  ComReg will have powers to investigate any breaches it sees in those areas within the telecommunications sector.  It does not have any impact on ComReg's overall powers.  This Bill has nothing to do with its overall powers as a regulator of the telecommunications sector.  That is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p></speech>

We pay the fourth highest electricity prices in Europe, though when VAT and environmental levies are taken into account, we are the most expensive.  The shocking thing is that consumers pay just under 50% higher than the EU average.  The Commission for Energy Regulation seems to use the level of customer switching as the factor to determine competition in the market.  Will this legislation allow greater investigation of energy sector profits and transfer of information across regulators?  The energy regulator already has access to the profit margins of the companies, which it has never published.  Could this be given to the competition authority?</p></speech>

It is a regulator of the sector.  It is totally a sectoral regulator so it is not one of the four competition authorities.  The four competent authorities in Irish law for competition legislation are ComReg, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts Service.  It is not a role for the CRU.  Anybody who believes there is a lack of competition, a breach or an abuse of dominance in the energy area can make a formal complaint to the CCPC and help the CCPC by providing evidence.  The CCPC will investigate to see if there is abuse of dominance in that area.</p></speech>

Is the constitutional question still present?

This was often because when an investigation is commenced by the competition authority, it does not necessarily know if there is a cross-border effect on what it is investigating.  The constitutional question arises because of the particular role of the courts in Irish law and the fact that there is a clearly defined principle in Irish law regarding the administration of justice and who has the role in the administration of justice.  In that context, the constitutional question has impacted on the decisions we have made in terms of policy related to the role of the courts.  We want to see court confirmation of finds, regardless of whether it is a fine for a breach of EU competition law or of Irish competition law.  There will be court confirmation of the fines, or that is what is envisaged.</p></speech>

We have set out in the general scheme taken from the directive how fines are calculated and the things that are taken into consideration.  It is always important that a fine is not of a level that will put an undertaking out of business.  That was taken from a Law Reform Commission report into this area on administrative sanctions.  However, this is talking about a high level of fines and that is why it is important that the court will have a role.  We are also building the appeal process into it to protects rights of the undertakings and of the people involved in those undertakings.  They have to have the right to appeal.</p></speech>

Back in 2007, that report estimated that we were losing &euro;2.5 billion per year from economic crime.</p><p>That equates to a potential loss to the economy of &euro;35 billion over the past 14 years.  Why has the State been so slow to tackle this aspect of economic crime, given the potentially severe losses, compared with other areas we have been particularly keen to address, such as through the campaigns against so-called welfare cheats?  There seems to have been a significant gap over the past 14 years in tackling this massive sector of economic crime.</p></speech>

We are bringing in a Bill that will result in quite significant crimes for serious breaches of competition law.  If that report is correct and there has been a loss of &euro;2.5 billion a year, a great deal of money will be coming into the Exchequer once the Bill is enacted, one would hope.</p></speech>

I do not have to hand a copy of the 2014 Act.  If someone is summoned and has to answer questions and so forth, can he or she be assisted by members of the legal profession, whether solicitors, barristers or whatever?  If so, who covers the cost?  My sense is it would be possible for the person to have someone with him or her to assist from a legal point of view but I am not sure from reading the heads of the Bill, and I have not referred back to the other Acts to check.</p></speech>

It does not necessarily go into who they may or may not bring with them but if they are entitled to the same privileges as witnesses before the High Court, they probably would be entitled to legal representation, although that is a good question.

I ask members to turn off their mobile phones.  I remind them that for identification purposes and for the recording of the meeting that they should remove their face masks when making a contribution.</p> <p>  The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the recently sanctioned salary increase for the position of Secretary General at the Department of Health.  There are other issues but I suggest we first deal with that matter fully before we move on to any other matter.</p> <p>  I ask members to note that there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references they make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege. However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary proceedings.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal prosecution from proceedings as a witness physically present does.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  That generally covers the note on privilege.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021020200002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to come before them today, albeit virtually.  As the Chairman has done, I acknowledge Mr. Moloney, the acting Secretary General of my Department, who is also with us.  As members know, this is my first time appearing before the committee.  As a former member of many years, I am familiar with the valuable work undertaken by the committee on a constant basis.  It is a great privilege to appear before the Chairman and members in my capacity as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  I am also happy to have the opportunity to address the points raised in the Chairman's recent correspondence regarding the post of Secretary General in the Department of Health.  At the outset, I want to emphasise that the matter in question relates to an ongoing process for recruitment to a post that is of strategic importance for the Government.  It is important that commentary on this issue is cognisant of that fact and is not prejudicial to the outcome of that process.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I have statutory responsibility for the terms and conditions of service, including remuneration, of civil servants, as set out in the Civil Service Regulation Acts.  In meeting this responsibility, I engaged with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Secretary General to the Government regarding the terms to apply for the recruitment to the post of Secretary General in the Department of Health.</p> <p>  In that context, I took account of a number of factors.  It is no secret that the post of Secretary General in the Department of Health is a highly complex one with a challenging brief, especially in the midst of a global pandemic.  There are significant responsibilities attached to the role, including the ongoing management of the response to the Covid-19 public health emergency, implementing the Government&rsquo;s ambition to deliver on Sl&aacute;intecare and the management of the greatly increased budget of &euro;22 billion for health in 2021.</p><p>Ultimately, it will be the responsibility of the successful candidate to fulfil the Department of Health's mission to improve the health and well-being of the people of Ireland.  Reflecting these points, I consider that a salary of &euro;292,000 is commensurate with the scale of the responsibilities and the unique challenges attached to the role, not least at the current time.<br/><br/>The decision to appoint a serving Secretary General to the Department of Health on an interim basis pending the holding and conclusion of an open competition for the substantive vacant post is a matter for the Government.  In that context, in line with the decision taken by the Cabinet on 6 January, Mr. Robert Watt was assigned to the role of Secretary General in the Department of Health on an interim basis.  I wish to clarify for the committee that Mr. Watt had no input into my sanctioning of the salary of &euro;292,000 to apply for the open competition for the substantive post.  The newly sanctioned salary will apply only to the person appointed arising from the open competition currently under way.<br/><br/>Regarding the selection process, the members will be aware that the position was openly advertised on 8 January this year by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, on behalf of the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC.  In addition to the advertisement by PAS on its portal <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>, the position has been internationally advertised online on selected websites, EXEC Jobs, <i>The Guardian</i>, and the <i>Health Service Journal</i>.  It was on LinkedIn and so on, and targeted media.  PAS also issues job alerts by email and text message to those who have registered their interest in the position at this level on <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>.  TLAC circulated it to Departments in addition to other public service bodies. <br/><br/>The selection process to recommend prospective candidates for the advertised position is being undertaken by TLAC.  The Government has a policy of open recruitment.  The role of TLAC, as an independent body, is to support that and ensure that the recruitment and selection process for senior Civil Service posts is accessible to the widest pool of candidates.  TLAC operates under the code of practice issued by the Commission for Public Service Appointments in accordance with the principles of fairness, consistency, accountability, probity, best practice and professional confidentiality.  The secretariat is based in my Department to support this operation, while the competition is administered by PAS on behalf of TLAC.  TLAC will consider any applications received by PAS for the advertised position.  The same recruitment process will apply to all candidates for the position of Secretary General at the Department of Health.<br/><br/>On the conclusion of its processes, TLAC may recommend up to three names, in alphabetical order, to the Government in respect of those candidates considered to be of the standard required for the post.  As requested, correspondence and documentation on this matter have been provided to the committee.  My Department will publish the material on its website at the conclusion of today's session.<br/><br/>I am aware that the focus of attention is the salary associated with the post but I would like to touch very briefly on a couple of wider issues.  With regard to our general expenditure, overall gross expenditure for 2020 came in at &euro;85.3 billion.  The increase of almost &euro;15 billion against the original 2020 expenditure allocations reflects the additional funding provided in response to Covid-19.  This significant allocation of resources has continued into 2021, with, as outlined in Revised Estimates Volume 2021, a Government expenditure ceiling of &euro;87.8 billion for this year, inclusive of a contingency reserve of &euro;2 billion and a recovery fund of &euro;3.4 billion.  We are also undertaking a review of a national development plan, NDP to the value of &euro;116 billion.<br/><br/>My Department is centrally involved in the management of Ireland's draw-down from the Brexit adjustment reserve, and the indications are that we will get over &euro;1 billion in phase 1 of that.  Along with other Departments, we are preparing Ireland's national recovery and resilience plan to enable us to access grant funding of &euro;853 million as part of the EU-wide recovery and resilience plan.<br/><br/>On public service pay, balloting is under way on the proposed new public service pay deal, Building Momentum.  We should have the outcome of that in the next few weeks.  In addition, there is a wide programme of both public service and Civil Service reform ongoing within my Department.<br/><br/>I appreciate that the Chairman is under pressure for time so I will leave my opening remarks at that.  I look forward to questions and our engagement.</p></speech>

Where are the calculations to show why an increase of &euro;81,000 was chosen?</p></speech>

The context of the final decision I arrived at is set out in the minutes of that meeting.  A number of options were considered as part of the discussion.  The option that we arrived at as a collective at the meeting was that there would be a need for an enhanced salary to attract the very best candidates from all over the world to apply for a position of significant responsibility.</p> <p>  It is also important to point out that just over two years ago the attempted recruitment of a CEO of the HSE was unsuccessful and the position had to be re-advertised ultimately with a larger salary sanctioned.  The current salary of the CEO of the HSE is approximately &euro;363,000.  In making the final decision I looked at other salaries at very senior levels across the public service.  The final salary that has been arrived at is approximately 20% less than the current salary of the chief executive officer of the HSE.  It is fair to say that there is an element of judgment involved as to what level one believes is appropriate to attract candidates of the very highest calibre.  It remains to be seen who has applied and ultimately who will come through the process, but if I put my hand on my heart and ask myself if the money was worth it, if somebody comes into the Department of Health following this process and he or she does a good job, then it will have been.</p></speech>

I did look at the minutes of the meeting but it did not give exact calculations on how the &euro;81,000 was agreed on.  It just seems that &euro;292,000 was seen as a nice, round number.  The Minister mentioned in his opening statement that he feels the figure of &euro;292,000 is commensurate with the scale of responsibility, but he recently voted against pay for student nurses.  Is it the case that voting against pay for student nurses is commensurate with the scale of responsibility?</p> <p>  The Minister indicated that he looked at international examples.  I am very interested in how he benchmarked this and what international examples he considered.  The director general of the WHO earns &euro;199,000.  The top scale for Britain's most senior civil servant, who manages a civil service workforce of 456,000, earns approximately &euro;232,000.  It seems to me that this is significantly higher than international comparators.  Could the Minister clarify what international examples he looked at and how he benchmarked this because it seems to be outrageously high?</p></speech>

When one looks at the responsibilities of the Secretary General of the Department of Health, one must bear in mind the fact that, as Accounting Officer, he or she has responsibility for a spend of &euro;22 billion.  Even though the HSE sits under the Department of Health, as such, the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer and is legally responsible for all of that expenditure.  There are approximately 600 staff within the Department and the overall sector employs in the region of 125,000 people.  There are also 19 non-commercial State bodies under the Department.  It is a pivotal position right at the heart of government.  The Deputy knows the ambition the Government has for Sl&aacute;intecare.  We increased the budget for health in 2021 by approximately &euro;4 billion.</p><p>Some, but not all, of that is Covid related because we have real ambition to transform our health service and deliver on the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.</p></speech>

I of course fully understand that and the Government is determined to resolve that issue.  As she knows, the Government appointed Professor Tom Collins to undertake a short-term review of clinical placement allowances for student nurses and midwives.  He has reported back and made a recommendation.  There is ongoing engagement between trade union representatives and the Government on that issue.  We value the work of student nurses and all those involved in education placements throughout the health service.  There is a determination to resolve that issue.</p></speech>

There are reports.  Nurses who went on strike and are now on the front line of the pandemic got a Public Service Pay Commission.  However, when it comes to top civil servants there is an increase of &euro;81,000 and there does not seem to be any clarity.  The Minister has given us no clarity as to how that figure was calculated.  What calculations were made in respect of it?  The Minister is determined to resolve the issue of student nurses pay, but that is taking up a lot of time for people who simply do not have that kind of money.</p> <p>  The Minister has not clarified for us the position regarding the &euro;81,000 increase.  We need detail.  What evidence does the Minister have, apart from one meeting for which we received the minutes, that the increase of &euro;81,000 was needed?  Did he speak to recruitment agencies about it?  Where did the figure of &euro;81,000 come from?  Was the figure plucked from the sky?</p></speech>

In arriving at the figure I considered other senior roles across the public service.  I touched on a number of those already.  As the Deputy knows, bespoke arrangements were put in place for the Garda Commissioner and the head of the HSE.  There is a very high salary for the Governor of the Central Bank.</p> <p>  The view I arrived at, in consultation with my colleagues, was that this level of salary, albeit high, is commensurate with the level of responsibilities required for the post.  Therefore, I believe it was the right decision and it is to be hoped it will attract candidates of the very highest calibre who will make a real difference.</p></speech>

That can be seen in the memo that was generated.  There were discussions with my pay division prior to that.  I referenced the engagement that was ongoing with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Secretary General to the Government.  I also consulted the Minister for Finance to draw on his experience as a former Minister who was involved with a group of very senior people in the area of health, something to which I referred to earlier.  That is the context.</p></speech>

People's jaws dropped right across the country when the figures that we are discussing today were publicised.</p><p>The Minister mentioned the fact that we are competing internationally on this, but the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the USA earns less than &euro;200,000 a year, the British Prime Minister earns just over &euro;150,000 a year, and the director-general of the WHO earns less than &euro;200,000 a year, as I understand it.  These are also positions of high responsibility and the salaries are far less than the one we are discussing.  There seems to be two Irelands here.  There is the Ireland of the healthcare assistant who earns &euro;24,000, or the student nurse, who is struggling to get any earnings for the work they are doing, and even the family carer, who earns about &euro;11,000 per year.  Do these people not need to receive proper salaries to recruit the number of individuals that we need?  There are pinch points across the healthcare service in nursing and the caring professions because these people are not getting paid the salaries they need.  How come the Government does not have the same attitude to these key workers as regards necessary salaries?</p></speech>

As he will be aware, as part of the additional funding we are providing for the Department of Health and the health sector, there is an ambitious plan to recruit approximately 16,000 additional health professionals over the course of 2021 to make the move that we all agree is necessary, which is to implement Sl&aacute;intecare and build up the permanent capacity of our public health service.  We are determined, as a Government, to do that.  In the recent negotiations that we had for a successor agreement to the current public service stability agreement, the way we structured that in agreement and negotiation with the trade unions was that the benefits are very much weighted towards those at the lower end.  For example, even in very difficult times, which we are in, and we are under budgetary pressure, the 1% increase next year will be worth a minimum of &euro;500, even for the lowest paid public sector workers.  That is just an example of how committed we are to dealing with the issue of low pay.  I fully understand that the issue of deciding salaries for people in very senior leadership positions is always difficult, is always going to be contentious and may not sit well with people.  As a public representative, I engage with people every day who are going through very real struggles.  However, in government one has to use judgment and make decisions that ultimately will deliver better outcomes.  That is why we have made the decision to go with an enhanced salary with a view to getting a stronger pool of candidates for the post.</p></speech>

His approach to increasing the salaries of those within the health service is in the future tense, while his approach to this particular salary is in the present tense.  That is a world of difference for the lives lived by these people today.</p> <p>  Well in excess of 500,000 people have been made unemployed because of Covid, hundreds of thousands of people have had their incomes radically reduced across the country and families listening to this meeting at the moment are being pushed into poverty.  In 2020, we had a budget deficit of &euro;19 billion, while the excess national debt that we will accumulate this year will be approximately &euro;35 billion.  We have a national debt of &euro;239 billion, which works out at &euro;47,000 for every man, woman and child in the country.  People will see this type of largesse in salary for these particular roles in stark contrast to their own experience.  They will see a chasm that exists between their own experience and how Government is treating these particular positions.  Of all the documents I have seen, none points to the fact that this country is in economic dire straits at the moment.  Was that not taken into consideration when discussing this particular salary?</p></speech>

The same applies to the wage subsidy scheme.  The Government has spent vast sums of money to try, insofar as we can, to cushion the blow for people who were directly affected by the loss of a job or the loss of business income.  I am not saying that we have always got it right but we have certainly tried our best with initiatives like the local authority rates waiver and the new Covid restrictions support scheme.  We had a &euro;19 billion deficit last year not because our taxation receipts collapsed but because we spent the money that we needed to spend to support people.  That was the right thing to do and it is the Government's intention to continue to support people.  That is why we have provided a Covid recovery fund of &euro;3.4 billion.  We also have a contingency fund of &euro;2 billion.  We will need those funds over the coming months in order to be able to continue to support people.  That is the Government's strategy and we are in a position to pursue countercyclical policies at the moment.  We can borrow at historically low rates of interest and will do so in a responsible way.</p></speech>

Historical evidence suggests that under Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, much of that reduction will take the form of tax increases for low and middle income earners and cuts to public service investment.  How can the Minister make an argument for a salary increase of almost &euro;90,000 in that an environment?</p></speech>

The average interest rate on our debt is now in the region of 1.6%.  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has done a great job of taking maximum advantage of the really favourable borrowing conditions by refinancing our debt where possible and availing of the longest possible maturity profiles in the market.  That said, of course the Deputy is right to imply that this cannot be sustained forever.  The Minister for Finance and I, along with our colleagues in government, have been upfront about that.  We genuinely believe that bringing about economic recovery is the best way to close the deficit.  If we can help people to get back to work and keep businesses alive that are really struggling now, that is the best way to rebuild our tax revenues and to reduce expenditure on necessary social supports.  That is our objective and that is the way we intend to approach this over the coming years.</p></speech>

That is fine.  I thank the Minister for his comments and answers so far.  I wish to elaborate on some of the points made by Deputies Farrell and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n regarding the agreed salary.  Beyond the exact figure that has been quoted, what other benefits come with the position?  People have mentioned the WHO and the HSE.  Is there any comparative data for other EU member states, particularly those with comparable populations or health services of a similar size?  What sorts of salaries and packages are on offer for equivalent positions?  On the other side of that equation, what is expected in return?  The Minister mentioned the Government's ambitions for the Department of Health and our health service as a whole.  Tied to the salary, the package of benefits and the conditions, will there be any targets or delivery markers in terms of doing the job and fulfilling the contract beyond what is contained in the advertisement?  How will performance be rated?  Will there be six-monthly or annual reviews with the Minister for Health or will the Secretary General be solely answerable to himself?</p></speech>

Pension entitlements are, of course, a complicated area insofar as the rules have changed a lot over time.  The way in which Civil Service pensions, in particular, are treated has changed over time due to various reforms.  For a Secretary General grade such as this one, there are two categories.  The first applies to a person who was appointed before 2011 and if such a person was to be successful in this competition, one set of rules would apply to him or her.  Another set of rules would apply for a person who joined the Civil Service after 2011.  Broadly speaking, for someone who joined the Civil Service before 2011, the package includes the potential for added years and pension benefits that rely on final year salary.  After 2011, those conditions are more restricted and, indeed, if the person appointed as a result of the current competition is new to the Civil Service or public service, they will join the single pension scheme and will not be eligible for any enhancements above and beyond other members of the single pension scheme.  Those pension entitlements are the key additional benefits associated with a post of this nature.  They are dependent on length of service and the conditions of the person who is eventually successful in the competition.  Broadly speaking, the three categories that would apply are people who joined the Civil Service before 2011, those who joined post 2011 and members of the single pension scheme.</p></speech>

We talk about comparing this role with non-governmental and private sector roles.  Are expenses included in the package?  Is there a mobile phone allowance or private health insurance included in the package?  What else is included?  Are mileage or fuel cards, those ancillary elements, included?  It is a major role and there is often a lot more beyond salary and pension entitlements.  Is it possible for either Mr. Moloney or the Minister to give a bit more detail about the ancillary parts of the package that perhaps have not come out in the public domain yet?</p></speech>

It is a high-level leadership position in health across the country.  The Secretary General is, of course, required to provide advice to the Minister for Health and to three Ministers of State on an ongoing basis.  He or she will also participate in a number of different groups of officials and Cabinet committees.  He or she will be the Accounting Officer with legal responsibilities under the legislation and will lead the Department's management board.  He or she will also be a member of the overall Civil Service management board and the public sector leadership board.</p></speech>

There are other examples across the public service.  Did the enhanced salary for the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na result in the deputy and assistant commissioners being paid a lot more?  It did not.  When the CEO of the HSE got a greatly enhanced salary, did that result in national directors across the HSE getting paid an awful lot more?  It did not.  To answer the Deputy's question, I do not envisage this decision placing pressure or, at least, resulting in any change in relation to general pay policy at senior level.</p></speech>

One such group, for example, is nurses.  The Minister's proposal is that nurses would have a 1% pay increase this year.  The pay increase for the Secretary General is 40%.  Does the Minister believe that a pay increase 40 times that of the percentage pay increase for a nurse is justifiable in the current conditions?  Does he accept that a pay increase which is more than the vast majority of what nurses take home in a year is justifiable in the current circumstances given the work that those front line workers are doing in the pandemic?</p></speech>

We are in the middle of balloting on a possible new public service pay deal.  I hope it is ratified, that remains to be seen.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and other unions which represent nurses will play their part and conduct the process as they see fit.</p><p> I am of the view that this Government's public pay policy leans in favour of those at low- and middle-income levels across the public service.  I will make a few brief points to back this up.  I mentioned already, and I will not repeat it in detail, the fact that the two general rounds of 1% pay increases have a floor benefit of &euro;500 for every public sector worker.  As a result, even somebody on &euro;25,000 will not get &euro;250 but &euro;500 and that is proper order.  They will get it twice if the agreement is ratified.  There is also a sectoral bargaining component.  Inevitably, the way this will work out is that it will be of greater benefit to people on low and middle incomes.  We have agreed a process in respect of the Haddington Road hours which, of course, are very relevant for people on low and middle incomes throughout the public service.  We are putting real money behind this, with &euro;150 million in 2022.  With regard to technical grades, we have the reinstatement of twilight payments and tool allowances-----</p></speech>

I do not think this is a position the majority of ordinary people would support.  In fact, a significant number of them would share my view that it is outrageous.  I also think the T&aacute;naiste is correct that, as night follows day, there will be knock-on pay increase demands from senior civil servants.  The Minister conceded that this could be the case.  I would go further and state that it almost certainly will be the case.  The Director General of the World Health Organization is on &euro;199,000 a year while the Secretary General of the Irish Republic's Department of Health is on &euro;292,000, which is &euro;93,000 more.  The Minister can make all the points he wishes about filling the position but an ordinary person looking at that will say it is bizarre and outrageous.</p> <p>  In the context of the public sector pay deal, many workers have been on the front line of the Covid crisis and have put their health and lives on the line in some cases.  Our public sector workers are worth a lot more than 1%.  They are doing phenomenal work.  They do not need phenomenal pay increases.  They need real, genuine good decent pay increases-----</p></speech>

How did the selection process for the interim Secretary General of the Department of Health work?  Who approached Mr. Watt?  Was there an interview process?  Very quickly, will the Minister put this in context for me?</p></speech>

In recent months, we have had the final payment under the public service stability agreement of 2%, which went to all public servants.  With regard to pay pressures that will possibly follow this decision about one post, the Deputy has to judge us on the decisions we make, if and when those pressures arise.  To the Deputy's point as to how many people feel about a salary of this nature, I totally understand that.  However, many people also will judge the value of it on the outcomes achieved and how well somebody performs.</p><p>If we were to pursue the policies advocated by the Deputy-----</p></speech>

I am just making the point that if we adopted and implemented the policies of Deputy Barry in respect of public service pay, we would not have Paul Reid as head of the HSE or Drew Harris as Garda Commissioner.  That is just the reality.  They may be uncomfortable but those are the facts.</p></speech>

Members have read the minutes of the meeting from the end of October and, as pointed out, the catalyst or origin was a request by the Minister for Health to have a discussion on the position of Secretary General in his Department.  As members know, the post was vacated in June of last year, when the serving Secretary General moved to another Department.  For the period since, there was an acting Secretary General serving in the Department at a time of truly extraordinary challenge.  The minutes set the thrust of the discussion and where it led to by way of a conclusion that there would be a need to go beyond standard terms in order to attract candidates of the highest calibre.</p> <p>  Turning to the question of the appointment of Mr. Watt as interim Secretary General of the Department, pending the outcome of the open TLAC process, ultimately, the Taoiseach asked Mr. Watt to move across to the Department of Health on an interim basis.  That is what happened in the first week of January.</p></speech>

We had a full and open discussion at that meeting and different names were mentioned of existing Secretaries General who may or may not have been suitable or interested in doing it.  Mr. Watt was mentioned and I was aware through November that there was a possibility of him being asked to go across to the Department of Health on an interim basis.  That is all it was up to that point and no decision had been taken.  It was not my decision to take.  In the correspondence, members can see that, in a cautious and prudent approach, I took the view that it would be better, in view of the specific salary question-----</p></speech>

It is a highly paid job and that is a significant pay increase to receive.  In saying that, whoever gets the job has a tough road ahead of them considering that we had many problems in the health system prior to the pandemic.  I do not believe matters have improved considerably so it will be a tough job for whoever gets it.</p> <p>  In the statement the Minister submitted to the committee he talked about the national recovery and resilience plan.  I would like to touch on that, if possible.  Last year, there was talk of the European green deal budget.  I also heard a reference to the next generation European budget and now we have the national recovery and resilience plan.  Can the Minister explain the relationship of those three funds?

The salary is for whoever comes through the open Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, process.  There is nobody currently being paid the &euro;292,000.</p></speech>

Was that the deciding factor here and will it become a deciding factor in other appointments throughout the year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021020200002#L02000"><p>I believe it is one part of the overall context within which the decision was made.  I said that earlier so I do not need to repeat it.  There was certainly a recognition that when it comes to a senior leadership role in a hugely challenging and highly complex area we need to attract the very best candidates from all over the world.</p><p>This salary was designed with a view to doing that.  That process is well under way.  The deadline for applications has passed at this stage and it is going through the initial PAS, Public Appointments Service, process now.  It will then go on to TLAC from there.  Mr. David Moloney can provide more context and detail on this.</p><p> On the point about pressures that it might lead to, I had a good engagement with Deputy Barry on that question earlier.  There may well be others in the public service who will point to this to burnish their own argument for an enhanced salary.  I have not come across any arguments, nor do I envisage any being made, that include the same challenges and can make a similar case of such quality as the need for having strong and effective leadership in the Department of Health.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, whether one is in government or opposition, one has to ask these questions.

Back in October, we had the full unwinding, for example, for all of those earning up to &euro;70,000.  There is what is called the long tail of FEMPI for the higher earners.  In July of this year, there will be the unwinding of FEMPI for those between &euro;70,000 and &euro;150,000.  In 2022, there will be the unwinding of the remaining tail of FEMPI for those earning above that figure.</p> <p>  That is set out in legislation.  That is not a decision that I have made.  In approaching the issue, I sought legal advice and engaged directly with the Attorney General.  His advice to me on those issues was clear, namely, it would not have been possible to seek to extend those dates further.</p> <p>  In addition to that, the way we have designed the public service pay deal, which is being balloted, is that people at the higher end who will benefit from FEMPI restoration either this year or next year will not get the pay increases provided for under the agreement for those years in question.</p></speech>

All low and middle-income public service workers have been fully reinstated at this point.  We will have further restoration for higher earners in July of this year and then the final restoration for the highest earners in July 2022.  Those dates are effectively set out in law.  I would have had to issue orders before Christmas in respect of those issues.  It was in that context that I sought the advice of the Attorney General as to the obligations in this case and the legal issues that needed to be considered.  His advice was clear.</p></speech>

The closing date has passed.  I do not know who has applied nor do I want to know.  I have full faith in the process that it will be fair and objective.  We have some outstanding people serving on the Top Level Appointments Committee.  Many of them are private citizens who are doing a valuable job for the State.  I have no doubt they will do their business professionally and objectively.  As I said in the opening statement provided to the committee, if there are a number of candidates they deem suitably qualified for the post, they can provide up to three names to the Government.</p><p>Then it falls ultimately to the relevant line Minister to bring a recommendation to Government.

I am conscious that a lot has been said on the proposed remuneration of the Secretary General to be appointed.  It should be clear that there is a sense of disquiet and dismay among many here and in the public about the scale of the increase for the Secretary General of the Department of Health, which is disproportionate.  We want the very best in the Department and the challenges are huge but we have to evaluate what the appropriate package is.  Many people are dismayed as to the scale of the increase.</p> <p>  I will ask two questions.  First, it is apparent that the Minister was vested with the responsibility of setting the remuneration for the new Secretary General.  Does he think it appropriate that he is invested with that power?  TLAC plays a role in the recruitment of the person but is it appropriate that the Minister is invested with the setting of the package?  While it might be appropriate for him to be invested with responsibility for the whole of the public sector, should there be a special or separate arrangement for roles at the top of the public sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021020200002#N00800"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions and her contribution.  As she said, it falls on me ultimately to make decisions on salary.  For the vast majority of positions across the public service, it is done on a collective basis in relation to agreements entered into.  As the Senator is aware, balloting is under way at present for the proposed new public service pay deal.  For certain very senior public servants, however, it is open to Governments to arrive - and down the years Governments have arrived - at bespoke arrangements where they believe it is warranted in the given circumstances.  There used to be a review body on higher remuneration levels in the public service but as that body was discontinued in 2009, there is not any such body at this time.  The statutory role is with the Minister and it has to be exercised judiciously.</p><p>In making the decision in this case, I consulted a number of people at senior level across the Government and within the pay division of my Department.</p><p> I am aware of the risks.  Reference was made earlier to the memorandum in question, on which I ultimately signed off.  It points to the obvious risk that it could lead to pay demands from others at senior levels within the public service, although I am not sure that will be so great a problem as people expect.  This is such an important and serious role that if whoever comes through the process does a really good job and improves the performance in the Department of Health overall, I have no doubt it will have been worth it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.246" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021020200002#O00200"><p>As the Minister will be aware, public sector employees are being balloted at the moment on the public service pay deal.  What message does he think the proposed package sends out to student nurses and others within the health sector who are voting this week and next week on the pay increase of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is the greater, for next year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021020200002#O00300"><p>As I said earlier, the way in which the proposed deal has been designed is to the benefit of those on lower levels of income.  I will not reiterate all the points but the Senator touched on the minimum benefit, whereby each time there is an increase of 1%, it will equate to a minimum of &euro;500.  That is a significant change.  There is also the sectoral bargaining element, from which many low-paid workers will seek to benefit through the process that will be set up if this agreement is passed, and there is the restoration of overtime payment rates and so on under the Haddington Road agreement.  We are putting in place a process to address the Haddington Road agreement hours as well, which will be of benefit to many low-paid workers throughout the public service, and we are proposing to reinstate many technical allowances.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's overall point.  Those who have the right to vote on the public service pay deal will consider it in the round.  Many of the unions have recommended its adoption, although others have not.  People will look at it through their own lens and decide according to what they think is in their best interest and that of their colleagues and the public they serve.  We hope it will be passed.</p></speech>

The Government has brought this attention on itself unnecessarily and I ask it to reconsider its decision on the remuneration package.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021020200002#O00500"><p>I hope to ask questions later about the recovery and resilience strategy.  The wage for the post of Secretary General will be &euro;5,615 per week, at the same time that there will be &euro;100 per week for nurses.  That is very difficult to defend.  What is the rationale that this figure is necessary to attract the best candidates?  Is it that the best candidates will be motivated only by sums well above &euro;200,000?</p><p>Is the rationale that the Minister wants people to leave other roles and come into this role and that he needs to match their current pay?  If that is the case, why would there not be a pay scale that allowed the Minister to be flexible if he needed to be in matching a previous wage that a candidate might have had?  On the idea that people will only be incentivised to deliver their best performance by a salary of the order of &euro;290,000, I concur with those who look to the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is doing incredible work for &euro;199,000.  I challenge the idea that people need to be paid these very high figures to be motivated.  There is a psychological element.  Is it literally a motivation figure?  Is it because the Minister has looked at the pool available?  Is it an attempt to match existing wages?  If that is the case, why would have flexibility rather than a built-in guaranteed amount of &euro;292,000?</p><p> I challenge the point made around the HSE chief executive officer, CEO.  The Minister stated that the decision regarding that appointment did not have knock-on consequences but he also directly cited that amount to justify a higher wage.  The higher wage for the HSE CEO is, therefore, having consequences in that it is being used to justify a higher wage for the Secretary General.  I am concerned that we will see a race to the top and a raising of the ceiling when what we really need to do is raise the floor.  I would like the Minister to comment on those issues.  I have one follow-up question specifically related to Covid and the new role.</p></speech>

We certainly want to raise the floor.  That is very important and it is why the new public service pay deal is structured in the way that it is following the agreement we reached with the trade unions.  It remains to be seen what the outcome of that agreement will be in the coming weeks.  I certainly share that objective.  We want to make sure the salary is not a barrier to getting the very best people to apply.  I hope the Senator is right that we will have people applying who are motivated by public service, as all of us are, and want to give to their country or people from abroad who see this as an opportunity to influence public health policy in Ireland in a positive way.  That remains to be seen.  The context of efforts to fill other leadership positions is a reality.  It might not be an entirely comfortable one but it is a reality that we have to make our decisions alongside.  I have no indication that there will be knock-on demands.  There may well be.  I am not naive but certainly in the position I hold as Minister I have no intention of the particular salary for this post being used as a ground for acquiescing to knock-on claims.  I am not of that frame of mind, nor do I see a justification for it.</p></speech>

I take her point but there is a very direct working relationship in the context of what both individuals will do on a day-to-day basis.  I ask the Senator to consider that point.</p></speech>

I hope that, given the very considerable remuneration for the heads of both bodies, we will see an increase in accountability.</p><p> The Covid crisis was mentioned specifically twice in the Minister's speech as a key aspect of the rationale.  However, extreme as the Covid crisis is, it will not last forever.  If the Covid crisis was a key motivation, why are we not simply considering a bonus or an increase that would apply during the period of the global pandemic, for example, rather than permanently?  The Covid crisis is being used as a rationale, yet, at the same time, the benefits for whoever takes up the role, with its very high salary, will be enjoyed after the pandemic.  The salary could very much set the pension rate of the individual.  It is one's salary on retirement that determines one's pension.  We could be paying for this for a very long period even though the rationale is based on the current circumstances.  We have spoken about the very paltry sum student nurses are getting.  It is notable that, in France, a bonus of &euro;1,500 was given to front-line healthcare workers, and in Scotland a &pound;500 bonus was given to them, yet the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, told us just three weeks ago that there was a specific exclusion applying to any additional pay or bonus for front-line health care workers in Ireland due to Covid.  If we are citing Covid as a special circumstance that makes a difference when hiring the Secretary General, why is it not a special circumstance that makes a difference in the same Department when it comes to a bonus or recognition for front-line health staff?</p></speech>

Covid will be with us for quite a while yet, unfortunately.  The new Secretary General in the Department of Health will play a really important leadership role in respect of the vaccination programme and assisting the HSE in dealing with the fallout from Covid in day-to-day terms, but it should also be pointed out that our experience of Covid has reinforced the need for permanent improvements in our public healthcare system and in its capacity.  That is why we have provided record funding for the Department in 2021.  It is to increase our critical care capacity and acute bed capacity.  Those benefits will be with us well beyond Covid.  To be fair, while Covid features in the booklet published on the position, as it should, it is not the most significant element that-----</p></speech>

Covid was mentioned twice in the Minister's speech.

The public are finding it very hard to understand and accept, as am I, what is being proposed.  Senator Higgins raised a few of the issues I was going to touch on.  This decision is being made when the Department of Health is in crisis.  Some might say the health service is always in crisis but, because of Covid, we are in worse circumstances than usual.  Even my own business has been in crisis where decisions were made that may not have been the right ones but, because of external factors pushing us, we were forced into making them.  What analysis was conducted of the unintended consequences that Covid could have regarding the position of Secretary General?</p> <p>  Regarding the memorandum on 30 October, to what extent was asking the current acting Secretary General to stay on for an extended period evaluated, specifically in respect of getting beyond Covid-19?</p><p>If there is a change of leadership in the middle of a pandemic, that could upset things rather than settling them down.  How much was thrashed out in respect of point one, that is, of asking the acting Secretary General to stay in his current role?</p></speech>

I do not think it would be fair of me to get into the detail about any individual.  There was, as the Senator said, an acting Secretary General within the Department who worked very closely with the Minister at the time, which was one of huge pressure and challenge.  It was listed as one of the four options set out in the minutes of that meeting.  The Senator can see where the discussion took us and what it led to by way of the conclusion that was reached.  I do not want to get into detail about that individual, who is a serving civil servant, just to say that the decision that was reached followed a lengthy discussion on the issue.</p></speech>

I move on to accountability and responsibility.  The Minister has mentioned a few times that at the end of the day, the Secretary General is the Accounting Officer and has legal responsibilities.  Looking at the structure within the Department and the HSE, one sees that the chief executive of the HSE is answerable to the board and the board is answerable to the Minister.  What role does the Secretary General have in the day-to-day operation?  How does he or she influence the day-to-day operation in terms of delivery of services and control of budgets if they are not directly within his or her control?  Perhaps the Minister can explain the legal responsibility he refers to in relation to the Secretary General for budgets and achieving targets.  What does that mean?  We have all seen that there does not seem to be accountability for anything in the public sector, whether we are delivering services or budgets on time or not.  What does it mean to a layperson if the Secretary General is the Accounting Officer and has legal responsibility for that Department?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.265" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021020200002#R00500"><p>When we think of the role of a Secretary General, there are really two roles.  There is the role of the Secretary General under the Public Service Management Acts, which is about running the Department and aligning what the Department does and what the agencies under it do with the priorities that the Government sets out.  That is, as the Senator says, not a day-to-day role in the context of the Department of Health.  There are 130,000 people employed in the HSE.  That is not possible to direct in a microscopic way from the Department of Health.  On the other hand, as I am sure the Senator has seen from time to time, there are challenges in the implementation of the health policy objectives of Government.  The Secretary General, under the Public Service Management Act, has a key role in driving that in partnership with the HSE.  As the Senator noted, the HSE has its own internal structure with a CEO and a board.</p> <p>  On the money, the Accounting Officer is about ensuring there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure the probity and the value for money of expenditure.  At a fundamental level, the Accounting Officer is responsible for the safeguarding of public funds and property under his or her control for the regularity and propriety of all the transactions in each annual appropriation account that is produced.  He or she signs a statement of internal financial assurance in relation to that account and appears in front of the Committee of Public Accounts, to which he or she is answerable on a personal basis which he or she cannot delegate.</p><p>That is a long-standing responsibility for ensuring that money is properly spent.  It dates back to the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866, so it has been in place for a long time.  The dual role of Secretary General and Accounting Officer comprises the influence and strategic policy direction under the Public Service Management Act and the responsibility, which cannot be delegated, for ensuring that systems are in place for the appropriate spending of public funds under the legislation relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General under which Secretaries General are accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

What are the consequences for the Secretary General if the service is not provided or there is a failure to come within budget?  The procedure in place muddies the waters all over the place and there is no real accountability.  I am equally anxious to move on to the second part of the meeting so I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

It is very helpful to have a Secretary General before the committee.  Mr. Moloney will be aware that on 27 July last, a decision was made by Cabinet to the effect that Ministers would take a 10% reduction in their salaries.  In fairness, that was on foot of a memorandum brought before Cabinet by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The reason for that reduction was because members of the Cabinet recognised the very difficult financial circumstances faced by the country at the time with so many people in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  Have Secretaries General ever discussed making a similar contribution and accepting a similar reduction in their salaries in view of the difficult financial circumstances faced by the State?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, I have been an acting Secretary General for the past number of weeks.  I would not have been privy to those discussions.  The waiving of salary increases happens on an individual basis in terms of the legislation that applies to it.  We know that Ministers have waived increases that have fallen to be paid for quite some time now but I would not be privy to the decisions made by individual Secretaries General.</p></speech>

I do not believe there is a policy role relating to that.  That would have to be taken at an individual level as opposed to a collective level.  Clearly, there are structures within the Civil Service that set out what pay grades are appropriate to particular levels.  Obviously, those pay structures have emerged and have been put in place in respect of Secretaries General.  If we go back to the wages and salary levels of the higher Civil Service in 2008 and 2009, we know they were very much higher than they are now.  We also know that those reductions in salary scales from 2008 to 2013 have been the last reductions to come up for unwinding under the FEMPI legislation.  In fact, they are not yet fully unwound.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Moloney have any concerns about there being such a disparity between the Secretary General of the Department and the Minister who has ultimate responsibility for the Department?</p></speech>

It is not unique.  Those situations do arise sometimes.</p><p>They have arisen in this situation because Ministers have chosen to take a waiver of increases.  We know the Garda Commissioner is paid more than the Secretary General of the Department of Justice.  We discussed that the CEO of the HSE is paid more than the Secretary General of the Department of Health now and will be paid more than the holder of that position under the proposed new arrangements.  It is, therefore, not unique but it is unusual and tends to arise for particular reasons, in this case, because of the waiver to which the Ministers have agreed.</p></speech>

The Minister has answered many of the questions I was going to ask.  I will make a comment and if he wishes to respond he can do so.  There is some legitimate public concern among reasonable people that there is going to be such a significant rise in the pay of one Secretary General.  The concern is that it will lead to an increase in the payment of higher civil servants.  I ask that the Minister take this into account.  It is important that we do not allow public sector pay at the higher levels for high-paid civil servants to spiral out of control.  That is ultimately the Minister's responsibility and it is important that he ensures it does not happen.</p></speech>

A concern about potential knock-on consequences is, of course, shared by many people.  Considering the role and statutory power I have, it falls on me to withstand that.  As I said, that would certainly be my intention.  This is an exceptional position given the level of responsibility and the role it plays in Irish society generally.  I sincerely hope we now get candidates of the highest possible calibre to apply and that the person who is ultimately successful will deliver.</p></speech>

Please see booklet attached and, in particular, the section on terms and conditions."  What was the relevance of that note?</p></speech>

I believe the date on that note is 15 December.  The booklet referred to by that handwritten note does not contain the specific salary because no decision had been made at that point.  Obviously, as Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Watt would have had an operational involvement through that time in respect of ensuring this process moved forward.</p> <p>  The Chairman will see clearly, however, that when it came to the decision point, one first has the email from the Secretary General to the Government to the secretary of the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, confirming he and I had agreed the salary of &euro;292,000.  Then, the electronic submission that came up to me through the system was generated by the assistant secretary in the pay division side, which I dealt with directly.</p> <p>  I felt that was the most appropriate way to do things given that, as I said earlier, I knew there was a possibility Mr. Watt might be asked to go across to the Department of Health on an interim basis.  It had not materialised up to that point and there was no certainty that it would.  To be cautious and prudent, however, I took the view that I would deal directly with the Secretary General to the Government and the assistant secretary over pay policy in my Department when it came to the actual specific salary, which was put into the booklet on 23 December.</p></speech>

Robert Watt certainly would have known that there was a willingness to go beyond the standard terms but I would not have engaged directly in respect of the specific salary for the reasons I have outlined, namely, that it would be for the assistant secretary in terms of pay and Martin Fraser in the Department of the Taoiseach.  I did my bit but I think that was a better way to do things given the backdrop.  I am not quite sure what was intended by that reference but, as the Chairman can see, the actual decision was made on 23 December and conveyed to the Top Level Appointments Committee.  The booklet was updated and I formally approved the e-submission on 30 December.</p></speech>

One option was for a serving Secretary General to take up the role in a permanent capacity.  The minutes indicate that option was dismissed and that five conditions would have to be met.  It would have to be a single candidate.  I presume Robert Watt is a suitable candidate since he has taken up the interim position.  The second condition is that the person would be willing to take up the position, and we at least know that he has taken it up as an interim position.  The candidate would have to be available, given the agenda in the Department, and we know that he is available because he has moved.  There would have to be agreement with both the official concerned and the relevant Minister, so I presume the Minister, Deputy McGrath, agreed to it.  Was an approach made to Robert Watt to move permanently to the Department of Health, given that this issue was considered?  It would appear that he meets all the other criteria so the only other condition is whether he was available to carry out the role on the terms laid out at that point.</p></speech>

Any one of a number of serving Secretaries General could be asked to transfer across.  The view at that meeting was that there would not be great hope of that being successful.  The Department of Health would not be seen as a great prize.  The view at that meeting was that it might be difficult to get a current Secretary General to move to take that role.  If the question is whether I had any discussions about a Secretary General moving permanently, the answer is absolutely not.</p></speech>

The second option was, therefore, potentially available.  Why did the Government not execute it in full?  Why did the Taoiseach ask him to move on an interim basis when one option was to move on a full-time basis on a lower salary, so that the Government would not be in the position of having to increase the salary by 40% or &euro;81,000?</p></speech>

It is important to see who may have an interest in applying for the role, whether in Ireland or internationally.  People all over the world have tremendous experience in leading public and private sector organisations.  The Chair referred to the note from Robert Watt to me on 15 December, which acknowledged that it was my view that there should be an open Top Level Appointments Committee competition.</p></speech>

The question is why did the Minister not put the other one, namely, whether Mr. Watt was willing to move over on a permanent basis.  This would have avoided increasing the salary.  Why was that not teased out or tested?  The Government did ask him to move over on an interim basis but why not on a permanent basis?  None of us is privy to whether Mr. Watt has applied for the permanent position.  He may, however, end up being in that position in future.  The recruitment process could have been avoided, as could the increase in the salary up to &euro;292,000.  What the Government believes, because that is what it guesses, is that it will get nobody to fill that position unless the salary is bumped up so high.  However, the Government has no empirical evidence for this.  The Minister plucked a number out of the sky.  There is no record at all, none whatsoever, from him of where this &euro;292,000 figure comes from.  Will the Minister indicate what the pay is for the British equivalent of the Secretary General in the Department of Health?</p></speech>

It was important, and the right decision to make, to open this up to a competitive process.  The Deputy is right that I do not know who has or has not applied and I wish all the candidates luck.  They all deserve a fair process and I have no doubt they will get it.  We will see what the outcome is in a number of months time.</p> <p>  Was the Deputy's second question about the international context and the UK?</p></speech>

That is three times what a qualified public health nurse would get in the first year.  The Minister said it was because of recruitment issues.  Did the Minister benchmark it against anything, such as equivalents in Britain or France?  He would have found that this is probably one of the most generous positions he is awarding.  In the other examples where the Minister said there were difficulties recruiting, there was at least an option in which they went out recruiting, found out they could not fill the position and then looked at the remuneration again.  The problem with the Minister is as follows.  When it comes to people on senior salaries, we had the same situation with the "super junior" Ministers of State where the Government approved an additional position with an further &euro;17,000 on top of a Minister of State's salary.  Now, with the Secretary General of the Department of Health, not content with it being &euro;211,000, the Minister increases it to &euro;81,000 without any paperwork whatsoever to justify that.</p></speech>

I do so, I believe, in a very considered and responsible way.  Some day Deputy Doherty may well be sitting in this chair and he will have to make decisions.  As Minister, one does not always have a report on one's desk telling one to make the decision - one must use judement.  Sometimes it is not easy but there is a real-life context within which this particular decision was made.  I will not repeat all the points I made earlier on because I know colleagues want to raise other issues but there have been real-life challenges in filling senior leadership roles in health in Ireland.  I am not talking about the UK or anywhere else in the world, I am talking about Ireland, in the past two years or so.</p><p>That is a reality.  That is why the State has had to pay considerably higher salary, as the Deputy knows, to fill that particular role with someone of the calibre that, thankfully, we have at a time of such great challenge.  I am well aware of the challenges and well aware of public concern.  Sometimes you have to make a decision that you believe is the right one.  Time will tell in regard to the quality of who we get, ultimately, and what impact they will have.</p><p> I know that, as others have, the Deputy has juxtaposed it with the issue of student nurses and other issues.  He knows the Government is determined to resolve that issue.  That is why we got the independent report to make the recommendation.  We are engaging with the unions and, as the Deputy knows, unfortunately, because of the pandemic, there has been a temporary suspension in respect of the student placement of nurses.  However, I believe we will resolve that issue and we will certainly endeavour to do so.</p></speech>

I could give the Minister example after example.  He mentioned that he received the independent report and he is engaging with the unions, and there is a process.  There is always a process and it takes a period of time, and we will see what comes out of it.  The problem is that, when it came to senior civil servants, just like the &ldquo;super junior&rdquo; Ministers, there was no process, or no process that we can see.</p></speech>

The Minister gave an outline to the committee in regard to what happened at Cabinet and said that the Taoiseach verbally gave a report.  Again it shows the<i>laissez-faire attitude</i>in that there is not even a memorandum for a 40% increase in public sector pay for a senior civil servant.  The Minister made the point that the issue was brought to Cabinet and it was noted.  The point was made that Robert Watt would move to the Department of Health on an interim basis.  Can the Minister clarify whether the salary increase of &euro;81,000, a 40% increase, was actually brought to the attention of Cabinet?  If so, can he explain why the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, disputes that and suggests that while the issue was brought, the salary was not, and, indeed, why it is reported that the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, raised this again at Cabinet, asking why the salary issue was not brought up?</p></speech>

Having said that, what the Taoiseach did do was to set out in detail at Cabinet the context within which it was proposed to go with an enhanced salary, an enhanced package, for the position that was being advertised a couple of days later as part of the PAS and TLAC process.  He set out that context and he informed Cabinet that there would be an enhanced salary as a result of that.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Moloney to organise that we write to the committee immediately on the national recovery and resilience plan.  The Government is required to submit a plan to the European Commission by the end of April.  I would value the committee's input.  We will ensure that that process is put in train immediately so that the committee's voice can be heard.  On an offline basis, members of the committee can contact me or my office at any time.  We will provide whatever information or assistance we can.  My officials are at members' disposal.  I will arrange for a letter to issue to the committee, which can let us know its views on the national recovery and resilience plan which is so important to us.  A total of &euro;853 million in grants is coming our way this year and next year, with an emphasis on climate action measures and digitalisation.  In respect of the Brexit adjustment reserve there is just over &euro;1 billion which will be very important for the fisheries sector and other enterprise sectors.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Before closing, I will comment generally on what has been discussed.  Reform is also part of the committee's agenda.  I am of the view that this whole system needs to be reformed.  The correspondence from start to finish reflects a cosiness that I certainly do not like.  There should be a strong dynamic between Government and the Civil Service and the public service which gives the best for the public we serve.  I do not like the manner in which this was matter dealt with overall.  The public is concerned about this.  We were right to have this session with the Minister to air our views and make it clear that there is public concern about how this came about.  We will revisit it at another stage.</p></speech>

In return, I have sought to be as open as possible which is why we wanted to ensure that the documentation was compiled.

They will be providing us with an update on Covid-19 in nursing homes: from Nursing Homes Ireland, Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive; Professor Dermot Power, gerontology expert; and Ms Deirdre Shanagher, strategic clinical nurse expert with regulatory compliance; from the Department of Health, Dr. Kathleen MacLellan, assistant secretary, social care division; Mr. Niall Redmond, principal officer, services for older people unit; and finally, from the HSE, Ms Yvonne O'Neill, national director, community operations; Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kennelly, national clinical and advisory group leader, older persons; and Ms Sandra Tuohy, assistant national director, services for older people.</p> <p>  Before we hear the opening statements, I need to point out to the witnesses that there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege applies to evidence given from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if witnesses are directed by me to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  I call Mr. Daly to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

Accompanying me, as the Chairman outlined, are Ms Deirdre Shanagher, clinical nurse expert with regulatory compliance, and Professor Dermot Power, Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI, gerontology expert.</p> <p>  We are here to represent over 400 private and voluntary nursing homes across the country which are integral for health and social care in Irish society.  The past 11 months have represented a most arduous and upsetting time for all of us in the nursing homes sector.</p> <p>  The recent January 2021 data published by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, is a stark reminder of the indiscriminate nature of this deadly virus, with more cases of Covid-19 reported in January 2021 than the total number in the whole of 2020.</p> <p>  Nursing homes are home to people with the highest levels of frailty and with multiple underlying conditions.  Worry and anxiety have been rife for the past year as staff and residents have lived with a virus that threatens their very lives.</p><p>Greater engagement and collaboration between the nursing home sector and our public health services has undoubtedly enhanced the supports available to nursing home residents and staff in the face of a global pandemic.  This collaborative approach with key stakeholders, who are also attending this meeting, the HSE and Department of Health has included the provision of personal protective equipment, PPE, serial testing of staff and timely turnaround of results, provision of regular specialist Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, advice and guidance, the temporary assistance payment scheme, TAPS, and staffing when available.</p><p>The collaborative approach that was implemented following the onset of Covid-19, albeit delayed, remains in place, thankfully.  However, the entire health service is under immense strain, with more than 6,000 staff absent due to the virus and in excess of 1,800 being unable to work within our nursing homes.  Staffing is the predominant emergency that presents today across our health service.  Within homes with outbreaks, available staff are going to extraordinary lengths at huge personal sacrifice to ensure continuity of care.</p><p> It should be noted that the majority of nursing homes, thankfully, are not experiencing an outbreak this time.  Those that have outbreaks are severely constrained by the unprecedented circumstances, but thanks to the tremendous commitment by their teams, they are working through significant staffing challenges.  The situation remains precarious.</p><p> The warnings from public health experts have been consistent and repeated.  Heightened prevalence of Covid-19 in our communities presents an inevitable consequence for our health services and our nursing homes.  In early December, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, warned about the epidemiological situation.  Just two weeks ago, it highlighted that the new strains escalate transmissibility and, regrettably, bring with them higher mortality rates.</p><p> It is a great tragedy that Covid-19 has manifested again within our acute hospitals, nursing homes and all residential care settings, with tragic consequences for so many.  Covid-19 is not particular to any class or type of setting.  The new strains are highly transmissible across our health settings and within broader society.</p><p> A new beginning is slowly emerging.  The roll-out of vaccination is bringing huge relief and hope within nursing homes.  The biggest reaction among residents, staff and families is, thankfully, euphoria and it is important to acknowledge the contribution of the vaccination teams and all stakeholders in the roll-out.  It has been a success throughout the country, with very positive feedback and very high levels of uptake being reported among residents and staff.  However, we feel it is legitimate to ask if a critical window of opportunity was missed.  With nursing home residents the most susceptible to the virus, just 10% of the initial 77,000 vaccinations administered by mid-January were within nursing homes.  The committee will be aware that the national immunisation advisory committee agreed nursing home residents and staff would be priority 1.  The first vaccines arrived in Ireland on 26 December, yet the first was only administered in a private or voluntary nursing home on 7 January.  Every day is vital for our nursing home residents and staff.</p><p> A system also needs to be outlined with urgency for those residents and staff who missed the first dose of the vaccine due to having Covid and for new admissions to nursing homes from acute settings and the community.  We remain engaged with a view to securing commitment from the HSE and public health to bring into effect immediately a policy to address this important issue.</p><p> Vaccination is bringing us towards a new dawn for the relatives and friends of nursing home residents.  However, there is a way to go to protect our most vulnerable.  The public health advice entails ongoing temporary but extended visitor restrictions, bringing tremendous pain and sorrow.  Nursing homes have strived to ensure meaningful engagement has been supported through the homes and will continue to be guided by the public health advice.  Based on our engagement with public health, the strong indication is enhanced infection prevention and control, IPC, measures will be required for some time.  We cannot let our collective guard down as a society based on vaccination.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s agenda encompasses supports for nursing home residents.  I have spoken previously in the Oireachtas and to individual Members about the fair deal scheme, the requirement to publish the long-awaited pricing review which was due for publication in 2017, and reform of the funding model.  HIQA needs to work with homes to better understand the severe challenges of the past year and those that present currently, and to work with providers and staff in a supportive and empathetic manner.</p><p> It is the opinion of Nursing Homes Ireland that an enduring legacy must emanate from the tragedy of Covid-19.  Clearly, the enhanced collaboration and the teams of broader healthcare and social care professionals have come together in communities to support the delivery of highly specialised care to those in our nursing homes.  Residential care of our ageing population cannot be allowed drift from the consciousness of the legislators responsible for health policy and resourcing.  A number of significant issues remain in cul-de-sacs and we look forward to engagement in the months ahead on the broad reform agenda.  The necessity to more tightly integrate nursing home care into our health services, a core recommendation presented by the Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel, must become an immediate priority.  Our organisation is engaged with the reference group under the Department of Health to ensure this happens.</p><p> I thank the staff across the entire health and social care service, particularly those in our nursing homes, for their heroism in providing care to our most vulnerable during this pandemic.  Great pride is assumed by people within our nursing homes in providing person-centred, compassionate care.  It is important, and I know this has been highlighted by committee members, collectively and individually, by the expert panel and by the HIQA review, to pay tribute to staff, managers and owners for their dedication.  We also take this opportunity to extend our sympathies to the families and loved ones of all residents and staff who have lost their lives because of this awful pandemic.  For residents, my wish, I am sure it is shared by committee members, is that they soon will get back to a familiar norm of open visits, hugs and hope.</p></speech>

I am joined by Niall Redmond, who is principal officer in services for older people.</p> <p>  The year 2020 brought with it the most serious global pandemic in a century.  Since its emergence, there have been more than 100 million Covid-19 cases worldwide, with almost 200,000 of these in Ireland where, very sadly, more than 3,000 people have lost their lives.  One third of these lives have been lost in the past month.  While there is much to be hopeful about, challenges associated with the pandemic will continue for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>  Nursing homes have been particularly affected by Covid-19 in Ireland and internationally, where residents and families, in balancing protective and supportive measures, have lived without the normal daily social and person to person interactions.  It is with great sadness that 1,543 people have lost their lives to Covid-19 in nursing homes; 369 of these in the past month.  It is important to recognise the continued and determined professional care provided by our healthcare workers in nursing homes 24 hours a day.  The Government prioritisation of vaccination for residents and staff in nursing homes brings a strong sign of hope.  Nursing homes are where more than 30,000 of our citizens call home.  Residents of nursing homes are vulnerable to Covid-19 because of their age, underlying medical conditions, the extent of their requirement for direct care involving close physical contact and the nature of living in congregated settings.</p> <p>  The ECDC risk assessment in November reiterated the overarching message that residents of long-term residential care services are one of the most vulnerable populations and continued focus should be placed on preventing Covid-19 from being introduced into such facilities and on the control of outbreaks when they do occur.  Consistent with the learning arising from the pandemic to date, the ECDC highlights that the probability of Covid-19 introduction into these setting depends on the level of Covid-19 circulation in the community.  Consistent with the recent and current levels of community infection, unfortunately nursing home impacts can be seen, with a fivefold increase in open outbreaks from 34 in mid-December to 193 by the end of January.  However, it is also important to appreciate that approximately 40% of our nursing homes remained Covid-19 outbreak free and many nursing homes that did experience an outbreak managed very well.  The central focus of NPHET's response has been to control the spread of the virus in so far as possible to protect those who are most vulnerable from infection, as well as protecting against causes, situations, circumstances, and behaviours that may lead to the spread of Covid-19.</p> <p>  Sustained communication and interagency co-operation remain central to the response to Covid-19.  Extensive, ongoing and problem-solving collaboration between stakeholders, the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, HIQA and the Department continues.  The State&rsquo;s responsibility to respond to the public health emergency created the need for the HSE to establish a structured nursing home support system in line with NPHET recommendations.</p><p>This has been a critical intervention in supporting the resilience of the sector in meeting the unprecedented challenges associated with Covid-19.  Guidance, personal protective equipment, staffing, serial testing, infection prevention and control training, accommodation and financial support have been provided to the nursing home sector, both public and private.  In addition, multidisciplinary clinical supports are in place at community healthcare organisation level through 23 Covid-19 response teams.  HIQA has designed and implemented a regulatory assessment framework of the preparedness of designated centres for older people for a Covid-19 outbreak and an infection prevention and control assurance framework<i></i>for nursing homes, which includes a self-assessment tool and support programme.<br/><br/>Following a NPHET recommendation in May 2020, a Covid-19 expert panel on nursing homes was established by the Minister for Health.  This panel was tasked with providing immediate real-time learnings and submitted its report to the Minister for Health, making a substantial package of 86 recommendations across 15 thematic areas.  The report was published on 19 August.  The Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people are committed to progressing the recommendations and have established an implementation framework with a priority focus on those key short-term public health and protective measures.  This framework includes an inter-agency implementation oversight team and a stakeholder reference group, which have met 11 times and seven times respectively.  A second progress report is being finalised and early progress has been made on the recommendations, as I will set out.<br/><br/>An additional funding allocation for the provision of integrated infection prevention and control has been made to the HSE.  There has been advanced planning for testing the safe staffing framework.  There is an ongoing commitment by the HSE and HIQA to continue the public health support measures.  Additional inspectorate staff for HIQA have been sanctioned to support increased frequency of inspections.  A review of the current nursing home-related legislation, with a particular focus on enhanced regulator powers and oversight, has been commenced and work across HIQA and the Department is ongoing.  There is ongoing serial Covid-19 testing in nursing homes.  A framework document on the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies has been published.  There has been provision of extensive education, including a dedicated web page with all nursing home education resources in one place.<br/><br/>It is important that a paper reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s actions in light of the key national options in mitigating and managing Covid-19 in long-term care provided by the November ECDC risk assessment has been developed and discussed by NPHET.  The ECDC outlines the need to take a systems level approach to supporting the prevention, introduction and transmission of Covid-19, noting that no single intervention or response, but instead a co-ordinated package of interventions, is required to successfully tackle the virus.  This paper has been published.<br/><br/>In summary, across all options identified by the ECDC, Ireland has in place a comprehensive set of public health measures, actions and responses that align with each of the ECDC options.  These are either direct actions or supports undertaken by State agencies and public health authorities or are measures aimed at supporting and facilitating individual nursing homes.  It is likely that the effect of these actions, building on the evolving knowledge of the disease, has had over time a positive effect on the levels and impact of Covid-19 in long-term residential care.  As presented by the Irish epidemiological modelling group, the number of cases in long-term care was smaller in the second wave compared with the first.  However, the number of cases linked to long-term care following unprecedented levels of infection in the community is now very high, similar to the numbers seen in April and May 2020.  Nonetheless, when compared with the total burden of disease in the community and total cases per week, the level of infection is significantly less than in April and May 2020.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the Government's plan for living with Covid-19 places an important focus on supports for the nursing home sector, both in the short term and for the longer-term development of the future model of care.  These supports include the continuation of the various supports I have outlined in the opening statement.  The focus of the programme for Government has been on the development of the future model of care.  It is very important today, as we reflect on what has happened during the pandemic, that we focus our efforts on supporting new and renewed models for older person care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.354" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Yvonne O'Neill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020200002#D00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to come before it this morning.  Members have already been introduced to my colleagues, Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kennelly, the clinical lead for older persons, and Ms Sandra Tuohy, who is our head of operations for older persons.  I start by acknowledging the professionalism, dedication and commitment throughout the pandemic of all healthcare workers and volunteers, particularly those working with older persons in nursing and care homes, whether public, voluntary or private.  I extend my sincere sympathies to our healthcare workers who have lost colleagues and to all families who have lost loved ones to the virus, particularly today those who are residents of nursing homes where the impact of Covid-19 has been felt so severely.</p><p> When we attended in mid-June, a detailed paper was submitted to the committee which captured the roles and responsibilities and the substantive level of collaborative engagement across the system between the HSE, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, the Department of Health, Nursing Homes Ireland and other providers, all with the singular mandate of safeguarding the health and well-being of older persons living in long-term residential care.  At that time in June the virus was relatively under control, with the then risk of a second wave as the country further opened the economy and society.  </p><p> Public health reported data in mid-June indicated active outbreaks in less than 6% of nursing homes, characterised by largely smaller levels of detection in residents and staff.  The response now required to the outbreak levels experienced in the current wave since December covering nearly 30% of nursing homes has relied on continued and enhanced collaboration across these stakeholders to support all facilities now impacted by the increased rates and virulence of Covid-19 community transmissions.</p><p> We understand that the committee members want a specific focus today on a number of themes and so the remainder of this statement will follow in that order.</p><p> Evidence in Ireland and globally has shown that older people, particularly those who are medically compromised or frail, are at severe risk for poorer outcomes from Covid-19 and that congregated settings such as nursing homes have been particularly impacted.  Throughout the pandemic nursing home residents, their friends and families have been severely restricted in their social interactions and personal contact.  Both in our professional roles and our private lives we appreciate the impact of those restrictions on the well-being of our loved ones.</p><p> Approximately 32,000 of our older population live in one of the 572 nursing homes currently registered by HIQA, with 81% of beds operated by private providers.  It should be noted that a considerable number of those have remained Covid free and for many which did experience outbreaks these were managed very well.  </p><p> From our public health data we know that 81% of all notified deaths in health service settings in Ireland from Covid-19 occurred in nursing homes and, sadly, we have lost the lives of more than 1,500 nursing home residents as a result of Covid-19.</p><p> The pandemic continues to pose extreme challenges to the delivery of health care services nationally with the rise in community infections across the Christmas period compounding challenges with regard to maintaining a safe, effective service delivery across the nursing home sector where there are approximately 2,000 staff on Covid leave across the largest outbreaks in more than 100 facilities.  At 1 February 2021, there were 193 reported open outbreaks.</p><p> The HSE has directed maximal efforts towards the management of these outbreaks.  In line with recommendations from NPHET, the HSE has rapidly stood up and continues to provide a range of supports including clinical advice, infection prevention and control guidance, access to staff training and education, prioritisation of staff for testing, supply of personal protective equipment, PPE, temporary staff accommodation and redeployment of HSE staff in exceptional cases to ensure continued safe care.  In the last reported week ending 21 January 3,000 bed nights were provided in that staff accommodation, 60% of which related to a private nursing home staff.</p><p> Between the first and second waves a considerable number of webinars have been offered by the HSE and attended by hundreds of providers and their staff, in addition to a dedicated website for all related guidance.  That is in parallel with continued operation of fortnightly serial testing of all nursing home staff, increased to weekly for the two weeks at the height of the current wave of Covid.  The current seventh cycle of serial testing is indicating a detection rate of 2.3% of all staff tested.</p><p> During the first wave of the pandemic the HSE established a number of Covid-19 response teams with multidisciplinary specialist expertise who continue to work with all nursing homes - public and private - and play a critical role with the public health outbreak control teams in responding to, managing and containing outbreaks.  There are currently 23 Covid response teams actively supporting nursing homes and these include infection prevention and control expertise, older persons service managers, consultant geriatricians and nursing staff.  The Covid response teams can, if necessary, be flexibly enhanced with additional skill sets depending on the nature and setting of the outbreak in question, such as palliative care, and can also assist facilities with deployment of additional staff where necessary.  Currently, there are nearly 200 HSE staff redeployed to older persons residential services and more than 60 of those related to private facilities.</p><p> The HSE has continued to supply PPE to all nursing homes in accordance with clinical guidance for both precautionary and Covid positive levels and also regardless of whether they are public, voluntarily or privately run.  Measures are in place to increase PPE distribution for high demand items.  The situation is monitored on an ongoing basis and guidance updated as required.</p><p>The very infectious nature of Covid-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings.  In order to safeguard residents and staff, the HSE has, through the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, issued guidelines on visits.  These guidelines are reviewed to reflect current public health advice and NPHET recommendations.  As contact with family and friends is essential to residents&rsquo; well-being, these guidelines have at all times sought to balance competing challenges in order to serve the needs of residents, as well as incorporating expanded definitions of critical and compassionate circumstances based on experiences to date.</p><p> In addition to the previously outlined supports, the ongoing vaccination programme continues to provide a source of hope and positive development within older persons services during this difficult time.  Today, 575 nursing homes across the country will have participated in the first dose programme of the vaccination with the plan for both delivery of the remaining dose 1 residents and staff who could not be vaccinated due to clinical presentation and the dose 2 programme to follow within the indicated timelines, dependent on vaccine supply.</p><p> While this continues to be a difficult time for all, it is vital that the work completed to date by our colleagues, clinical and non-clinical, is acknowledged.  The HSE will continue to divert all of its efforts to managing the current crisis and maintaining safe, patient-focused service delivery.</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge the work of everyone in the healthcare sector, in the hospitals, congregated settings and nursing homes.</p> <p>  Ms O'Neill stated 81% of notified deaths in health service settings occurred in nursing homes.  That could be misinterpreted that 81% of the 3,000 Covid-related deaths occurred in nursing homes.  The number of those who died in nursing homes is approximately 1,540.  My understanding also is that a number of people died in facilities covered by the Mental Health Commission.  Is there an actual breakdown of the number who died in home settings, hospitals, nursing homes and congregated settings, respectively?  It is important the figures are clarified.</p></speech>

That is across nursing homes and hospitals as opposed to 47% of all Covid-related deaths.  We can provide the breakdown across all settings afterwards if that is helpful to the committee.</p></speech>

The last time the numbers worked out at 80:20.  Up to 80% of nursing homes are in the private sector and 20% in the public sector.  Has there been any variation from those numbers?</p><p>Are there any new challenges in the nursing homes that were not there in the first outbreak of Covid?  Ms O'Neill referred to about 30% of nursing homes having had Covid outbreaks.  Why does she think that occurred and what contributed to that?</p></speech>

I will have to check afterwards in relation to how the deaths are recorded per facility and see if I can provide a breakdown between public and private.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's second question, I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kennelly, but all statements reference the virulence of the current strain and the dependency between the rate of community transmission and the rate of transmission in our nursing sector.  Unfortunately, that has led to the rate of increase.  There have been huge developments in terms of infection prevention control, IPC, efforts and adherence to the guidance by providers.  The other thing that has probably changed, which is positive, relates to the regular serial testing of staffing.  That leads to early detection and we have been able to work with providers on managing outbreaks through early detection in identification of staff.</p></speech>

Ms O'Neill has covered most of the points I would have made.  Serial testing has made a significant impact on our ability to pick up asymptomatic infection, in particular on this round.  The primary driver of the increased rates we saw was the very high rates of community transmission and the fact that our staff who work and live in community settings are unfortunately able to bring the virus with them into care settings and that causes difficulty.</p> <p>  The issues which have been highlighted through the nursing home expert panel report in terms of the risks that are posed by congregated settings for frail, older and vulnerable groups have not gone away.  We will need to look fundamentally at the model of care in terms of provision for vulnerable groups and how they can be best cared for into the future.</p></speech>

An issue that occurred in March and April was where, say, five people shared accommodation but they might be working in different healthcare settings.  I presume it has been a challenge to try to deal with that issue.</p></speech>

That accommodation has been made available to all staff where they believe their home settings cannot give them the level of infection prevention control that they want.  Other members of staff who have not taken up accommodation offers have, as Mr. Daly referenced, made sacrifices in their personal lives to minimise the potential for them to bring infection into the home.  There have been multiple efforts, including accommodation provision and personal efforts by all our staff.</p></speech>

On that issue and the challenges now faced by private nursing homes, there are now increased costs in dealing with Covid.  There is also the issue that when a patient is assessed under the fair deal scheme, he or she may be able to move around and is not in any way restricted.  As such people remain in a nursing home for a longer period and as they get older, they need a higher level of care.</p><p>What are Mr. Daly's views on the challenges the failure to publish the review is posing for the private nursing home sector?</p></speech>

That it has not been published is an impediment to a mature debate and discussion on the future and sustainability of residential care services for our older population.  We expected the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to publish it in November 2019.  He confirmed at our conference that the fair deal was not fair for private providers and that he would publish the review without delay.  There has now been a further delay and that is having an impact.</p> <p>  It is important to acknowledge that the Department has put in place a temporary assistance payment scheme, although it is due to run out in June.  It is a contribution towards the increased costs associated with Covid.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about dependency, at the moment there is a one-size-fits-all pricing model.  The issue was raised recently in the Oireachtas by the Committee of Public Accounts, which some members of this committee are also members of.  It highlighted in its analysis of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that there are significant challenges.  We will work with the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department to ensure that the report is published as a priority.</p></speech>

Of the many people who have left the nursing home sector, will there be difficulty in getting them back, even when Covid is well under control?</p></speech>

People who work in nursing homes are exceptional and we are hopeful the majority of them will return to the sector, although clearly that is a challenge.  On the issue the Deputy raised about the sustainability of the sector, there is a significant discrepancy in the funding model, and until that is addressed, it will continue to impact on recruitment and retention.  That needs to be dealt with as part of the review of the nursing homes support scheme.</p></speech>

As outlined by Mr. Daly, it was provided to the then Minister in late 2019.  The report is complex and was given preliminary consideration by the Minister at that time.  The report is now with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who are considering its content and the appropriate next steps.  It is expected to be published soon.</p> <p>  We will have to give consideration to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  As was noted, the temporary payment assistance scheme has provided to the private nursing home sector additional Covid-related support to the value of &euro;62.5 million to date.  We will also need to give consideration to the Covid-19 expert panel recommendations in considering the pricing mechanisms within the nursing homes.  Importantly, funding this year was provided for the recruitment of interRAI assessors, so we can move to put forward a standard assessment tool for the assessment of all older people, irrespective of whether they are going into nursing homes or whether they will be supported within their own home.</p></speech>

We obviously have had very high levels of community transition but the number of outbreaks in nursing homes at the moment, amounting to over 190, is very high.</p> <p>  I wish to ask Ms O'Neill about crisis management.  I have engaged with many groups that are raising concerns, from the Irish Association of Social Workers to Sage Advocacy and Care Champions.  I want to discuss some of these concerns.  In response to my first question, I do not want context or even the policy.  Is there an outbreak management plan in place?

The outbreak control teams from public health and our own 23 Covid response teams operate according to a plan in responding to each outbreak when it happens, in determining what an outbreak is and in determining the level.

We need consider that relationship very carefully.</p> <p>  On outbreak management and crisis management, I have been contacted by staff in many nursing homes who have expressed alarm over staffing levels in some of the homes.  On the outbreak management and crisis management plan, what is the threshold or staff&ndash;resident ratio that would have to exist for circumstances to be considered to be at crisis point?</p></speech>

It is done in consultation with the provider, the public health team and the Covid response team.  There is no one threshold because each outbreak has its own characteristics.  The learning from the expert panel and the recommendations include the review of the staffing and skills mix for all providers.  That will be a really important part of the learning from this.  It is also a question of continued supports.  I will ask my colleague-----</p></speech>

Most reasonable people would say there has to be a basic, minimum staff-resident ratio in any setting to ensure the optimum and highest levels of care.  If the threshold falls below what I, Ms O'Neill and most reasonable would consider to be a minimum, then we have a difficulty.</p><p>I want to put a number of questions and some of the experiences of families to Ms O'Neill, which come directly from all the groups I highlighted earlier.  Families are struggling to get in contact and get through to nursing homes on the telephone.  Has Ms O'Neill been made aware of the types of challenges family members have even to get basic information regarding their loved one in a nursing home?</p></speech>

The loving and watchful eyes of loved ones and family members are not there.  This is important when we talk about residents in care.  That is not to say people do not get care when they are in nursing homes.  Of course they do.  We also know there have been instances of neglect and abuse.  When one does not have that level of interaction between the loved ones and family members and the nursing home, it is a problem.  It has been expressed to me that it is difficult even to get through on the telephone for basic information.  The second issue is not being able to comfort a loved one who is passing away.  I have heard from many families of residents who say they are only granted access when the person is no longer aware of their presence.  I am sure Ms O'Neill can appreciate how traumatic that is.  This is the experience of many family members.</p></speech>

He will appreciate that we do not have a presence - legislatively, we cannot have a presence - in every nursing home because we are not the provider.  We work closely with all providers to provide supports.  When a nursing home has had an outbreak and there has been a level of concern about staffing levels, we have worked closely with it to identify agency staff.

There has been extensive collaboration with nursing home providers and the teams in the nursing homes.  Clearly, we are aware of the issue, particularly when people are faced with outbreak situations with constrained staffing and very sick residents.  As a geriatrician, I have been in a number of nursing homes when they have been experiencing these particular circumstances.  I have looked after people who were dying in such circumstances.  The situations described by the Deputy deeply affect the staff members who are looking after the patients and residents, as they do their family members.  I am personally familiar with the efforts everybody is making at this time to try to support residents in their place of care.</p></speech>

I want to emphasise the role of the regulator in working with the providers on what their baseline safe staffing levels look like and how those are coming to light in the context of the pandemic.  There is much work to be done to make sure there is sufficient baseline staffing in care homes for vulnerable people.  We must look at the fact that 40%-----</p></speech>

We have ten minutes to ask questions and we really need more distinct answers from the witnesses.  We are raising important issues.  I want to put a question to Ms O'Neill.  I appreciate the responses I have been given.  I must ask these questions on behalf of all the families and groups I have interacted with over the last number of weeks and months.  Has the HSE engaged, or when was the last time it engaged, with the Irish Association of Social Workers, IASW, as one organisation?  When was the last time it engaged or met with Care Champions, Sage Advocacy or any of those groups, personally?  I ask the same of Dr. MacLellan.  When was the last time any of the witnesses has met with those groups?</p></speech>

In all cases, as part of a set of preparedness actions that have been laid out by HIQA, that unfortunately is not represented here today, they are advised to put in contingency plans around how families will be able to make contact during an outbreak and during a pandemic.  So there is a plan in place but it is very important that people understand the context within which people are trying to deliver services when a very severe outbreak hits.  It will be very important in the context of the discussions we are having here that we understand the realities of the staffing issues and care needs.  A structured engagement with families is necessary in all of these residential care units and they do their best to provide that.  We cannot speak for private providers who are doing this and it might be that many of these questions might be more appropriately addressed to the people who are representing them here.</p></speech>

I suggest that the committee looks for a report on some of the outstanding issues that cannot be answered by the witnesses present.</p><p>As this is obviously a fraught situation for everyone, I want to thank people for their work at the front line.  I thank the nursing home staff and management who I imagine in the vast majority of cases are doing their absolute best.  As it is clearly exceptionally challenging, I really want to express my thanks.  I believe there are four nursing homes in my constituency.  All are privately run.  This may change after this meeting but I have not had overt criticisms or challenges to the manner in which they have been run.</p><p> I have several questions.  We were given a percentage of residents who died Covid-related deaths in nursing homes.  How many can the HSE say died with Covid, as opposed to from Covid?  An elderly relative of mine died in a nursing home.  She had a number of conditions but Covid in the last 48 hours was on the death certificate.  Has the HSE any statistics on that?</p></speech>

In respect of the numbers of deaths, we separate those that are Covid-related deaths.  The Deputy's points are very important for us to understand because every death is a sad loss for families and is experienced deeply by other residents and staff in nursing homes.  I will hand over to Dr. Kennelly but those data are recorded separately.  In the month of January, 369 of the 1,000 deaths were Covid-related.  Dr. Kennelly might describe the way in which they are reported.</p></speech>

Essentially, Covid-related deaths are very specifically those deaths that occur in residents who have been detected as being Covid positive, either through serial testing or because they have been symptomatic.  As the Deputy will be aware, all deaths in nursing homes are reported through the coronial system so there is a system of engagement between GPs, coroners and public health experts about what would be recorded as the cause of death within those settings and how that then gets recorded in our national system.</p></speech>

Have there been any new residents admitted to nursing homes over the period?  Obviously there must be families with elderly relatives who require nursing home care and attention.  How is that managed?  Are there some who are resistant to that option now because of the experience of the high rate of outbreaks and so on?</p></speech>

Obviously there are guidelines around admission including a requirement for isolation for 14 days on admission.  Thus the move to a nursing home is currently difficult for anyone.  My colleague, Ms Sandra Tuohy, might give the Deputy a quick note on that point.  That would be helpful, especially in terms of how that activity has changed over the last number of months.</p></speech>

However, that probably has more to do with the fact that we have increased the number of home support hours and the overall wraparound services we can deliver to people to maintain them in their own homes.  Obviously the reform agenda of the HSE and the Department is to support more people to remain at home for longer so we are seeing the impact of that beginning to happen.  We are trying to support people with home support at night in their own homes to reduce the overall number of people who must be admitted to nursing homes to receive the appropriate care.  We still have access to private nursing homes and to public facilities.  We are trying to do rehabilitation within them at the moment but as Dr. Kennelly has outlined, significant number of nursing homes are closed to admissions because of ongoing outbreaks.  Nevertheless, we remain able to bring in some patients whose needs really could not be met in the community.  We are getting access to some facilities but not all.</p></speech>

She said there is a reduction.  Can she quantify it?</p></speech>

At the end of 2020, we had 22,755 people supported in the nursing home support scheme.  This is a &euro;1 billion scheme so those people are supported out of that budget.</p></speech>

Am I correct in saying there are some 2,000 staff on Covid-related leave in 100 facilities?</p></speech>

We have 193 outbreaks currently.  We we have staff leaving on and returning from Covid-related leave so it is a very volatile number.  Across our most significant outbreaks, we currently have approximately 2,000 people on Covid-related leave.</p></speech>

A number of bereavement supports and programmes have been put in place by the Irish Hospice Foundation and others to help with some of the trauma related directly to the deaths and outbreaks as they have been happening.  There will be a significant need, as highlighted in the expert panel report, for bereavement supports for many of the staff, residents and their families who have been impacted directly by outbreaks.  Second, there has been the mental health impact and a physical health impact of a significantly prolonged period of isolation.  If residents are isolated for a two-week period during an outbreak, they can become quite deconditioned.  Many of them lose weight.  We have quantified that with regard to the impact it has on mood, appetite and a significant number of physical and mental health parameters.  We recognise that residents in these facilities are going to need a significant level of rehabilitation and support.  Their families are going to need support and staff will clearly need a lot of support.  We have provided a lot of education and training on post-Covid rehabilitation with staff across the sectors, but clearly they need time and resources to be able to provide that.</p></speech>

My first questions are on the roll-out of the vaccine programme in nursing homes.  The original target date for having all residents and staff in nursing homes receive the first dose of the vaccine was more than a week ago.  For various reasons, this has not happened and the Minister has told us that there are four nursing homes where no vaccine has been provided.  In another 117 nursing homes, there are significant numbers who did not receive the vaccine, again for various reasons.  What is the total number of people in those two groups, as between residents and staff?</p></speech>

There is engagement directly on identification of those religious communities where there are vulnerable older people and their carers.

It is hard to believe we are back in this situation given the experience of last April and May.  Yet again, NPHET is expressing serious concern about the very high numbers similar to last April and May and it has referenced a deteriorating epidemiological profile in long-term residential care facilities.  Have we not learned lessons from that first wave, which was so tragic?  There were three lessons identified at that point from that awful experience.  The first was that there was no clinical oversight of private sector nursing homes and that the State was operating an arm's length approach to older people's care.  There was a major gap in services and no clinical oversight of private nursing homes.</p><p>The second lesson that we talk about is the fact it is not an ideal situation for older people to find themselves in congregated settings.  It is not ideal from a health perspective, certainly in a pandemic, and also not ideal socially.  The third area was the chronic under-funding of homecare.  Those three lessons were identified by the expert panel and they have been known for a long time by many of the advocacy groups working with older people, particularly Sage.  It was also recognised at a political level.  Those of us in opposition have recognised these for a long time and it was recognised at Government level last summer that these were lessons that had to be learned, and that we had to find a new model of care for supporting and caring for older people.</p><p> I am asking about those three areas that had been well flagged and identified last summer: the lack of clinical oversight; the fact many older people are in congregated settings and we needed a new model of care and a statutory right to homecare; and the under-funding of social care for older people.  What has been done about those three major areas that had been identified last summer?</p></speech>

That has meant a significant reduction in waiting lists for people for homecare.  The Deputy will know that our model of care is maintaining people at home and, thus, there is also additional investment in rehabilitation supports to maintain people at home.  Deputy Lahart earlier referred to the question around the reducing number of older people in our nursing homes.</p> <p>  In terms of that model for congregated settings, we have responded to the learnings from the last time.

Some &euro;127 million has gone in to configure 1,250 beds for intermediate care to provide for a re-ablement model in the community.  The ESRI is just completing a demand and supply model for us in regard to part of the basis for the statutory homecare scheme.  Significant funding has gone in for the establishment of a national homecare office, which will underpin the statutory homecare scheme, and that is scheduled as part of the national service plan, NSP, for 2021 in addition to the roll-out of the InterRAI single assessment tool, for which funding has gone in for 128 assessors.  There has been significant progress in terms of increasing the capacity and progressing the key elements of the statutory homecare scheme.</p> <p>  We have taken significant lessons and learning from the evolving disease and what has happened internationally.

Work has started to scope what that clinical governance model might look like, and the HSE is also working to scope how it might start engaging with the general practitioners.  As the Deputy will understand, the key engagement with the general practitioners over the last period of time has been in regard to the vaccination roll-out, but it is a priority and it is part of the work of the implementation oversight team at the minute.</p></speech>

Two issues were raised there, including one on clinical oversight.  Clearly, there has been better collaboration in recent months but that needs to continue to improve.  We highlighted in our opening statement the need for greater integration.</p> <p>  The issue of the care needs of an ageing population is relevant.  We need to be careful here that we do not get into talking about home care versus residential care versus acute care.  What we need is a continuum of care for our ageing population with all those elements playing a key role.  Those who are in our nursing homes, as we know, are the most frail and vulnerable and have been assessed by a multidisciplinary team as requiring residential care.</p></speech>

I am trying to get a sense of what the interface with the information technology system is, especially in nursing homes as it relates to the private and public versions.  I am asking for an overview.  I am specifically interested in the fact that we have many staff on leave.  We might have new service users.  What is the access and interface between nursing homes and the vaccine IT system over the coming months?  Will it pick up people who might have been missed in the first round?  How is the HSE referring people to that?  Could someone give me an overview of how that is happening?</p></speech>

However, what I do know is that it is available to all, irrespective of the location of where the vaccination is being rolled out.  How this happened in practice was that the team was on-site at a public, private or voluntary provider of services for older persons, those with disability or in hospitals.  The details of those vaccinated were recorded at the time of vaccination and then put on the system.  That will allow us to identify the question Deputy Hourigan is asking, which is those to whom we have to return.</p></speech>

First, the list of those for vaccination, including residents and staff, is supplied in advance.  That is loaded onto the system in advance of the vaccination team presenting.  Second, there is a portal within the system that is made available for people to register.  That will also allow people who have not been identified to register.  The useful thing about it is that any worker, from an agency or otherwise, who is present is vaccinated.</p></speech>

It is a terrible situation in which the staff in nursing homes, residents and their relatives find themselves.  I worked in a nursing home for a number of years and I cannot imagine the hurt and pain relatives are going through at the moment when they cannot see their loved ones in their time of need.  It is pretty bleak to say the least.  Our solidarity and support goes to all the workers and residents who are in that situation.</p> <p>  The public were shocked last year to learn that more than 50% of the people who died from Covid were in a nursing home setting.  In January that figure has gone down to approximately 35%.  We do not seem to have learned any lessons even with respect to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  It made a number of good recommendations, particularly related to staffing levels, retention of staff, agency staff and how people were discharged from acute hospitals into a nursing home setting.  Hopefully all those recommendations can be adhered to.  When the dust settles on this members of the public will want a public inquiry into what happened in nursing homes.  There is the disparate nature of nursing homes with 80% being private and 20% being public.  Also, there does not seem to be a coherent plan for the care of our loved ones.  When all of this is revealed, we will have to look at ourselves in the mirror.  Would the HSE personnel support a public inquiry into what has happened during the past year, particularly with respect to nursing homes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.507" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Yvonne O'Neill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020200002#S00100"><p>There is nothing in what the Deputy has said regarding the impact of the pandemic with which the HSE or any member of staff of the HSE would disagree.  It is important for us to emphasise, as Dr. MacLellan noted earlier, that although there was an increase in the rate of detected infection in nursing homes, that rate was much lower than the community rate.  I want to make sure that people understand this point.  Certainly, in terms of our residents, their families and our staff, it is important to acknowledge that they managed to keep the rate of increase of infection in our long-term residential facilities at a much lower level than was the case in respect of community transmission.  That is in direct relationship to the work and efforts and the infection prevention control measures taken by all of our staff and their adherence to those measures.</p> <p>  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the detection rate of 2.3% for the seventh cycle of serial testing is a very small proportion of how high the community transmission rate got at the same time.  We need to acknowledge that in order to make sure there is a proportionate view of the level of outbreak in nursing homes.  Certainly, the HSE would be very happy to contribute to any analysis that may take place in any forum in regard to the management and prevention of outbreaks in any of our long-term residential facilities.</p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. Kennelly, wants to comment.</p></speech>

He stated that 40% of deaths in older people very much reflected where they lived, particularly if they lived in a congregated care setting.  We really need to look at the pandemic in terms of what it means for us in regard to how we address ageing within our society and the health and social care provision around it.  That is part of the fundamental policy provision in terms of Sl&aacute;intecare and trying to ensure that people can live within their own homes for as long as possible.  The measures that are being taken through the enhanced community care initiatives and others are fundamentally underpinning the way the discussion moves forward.</p> <p>  I come back to Mr. Daly's point earlier around these issues being seen across a continuum.  When one asks older people where they want to live, the huge majority of them want to continue living in their own homes.  We need a model of long-term care that speaks to smaller, residential, household-type models in which the evidence internationally is increasingly accruing around less exposure in terms of pandemic and risk.  The Deputy is addressing a number of really important learning points within his questions and they will need to be taken on by the system.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Daly support a public inquiry into what has happened in nursing homes?  I am not sure whether he will be able to answer my second question.  Have new residents coming into nursing homes been given the first dose of the vaccine?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.512" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tadhg Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020200002#S00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  In common with all colleagues, whatever is decided by Government or by the Legislature in terms of the look-back at the pandemic, as it were, it needs, first, to be done in the round.  Nursing Homes Ireland will participate as appropriate.</p> <p>  In terms of vaccinations, at this point in time, new residents have not been vaccinated.  That is why it is important that we are engaged with the HSE on a policy, procedure and protocol to ensure that there is a robust system of making sure that all residents who discharge from acute hospitals are vaccinated, ideally before they come to the nursing home or, if not, within a very short period of their arrival into the residential care setting.</p></speech>

It has been a difficult 11 or 12 months for staff in nursing homes and I pay tribute to them.  It has also been a difficult year for residents and their families, especially for residents who were used to regular visits from families or those who might have large families.</p> <p>  Mr. Daly mentioned that staffing is the predominant emergency.  He also mentioned the significant progress in reducing processing times for the atypical working visa for non-EEA nurses.  What are the turnaround times and how have they improved?  Which countries in particular are providing most of the valuable nurses and care staff?  What more can be done in this regard?  Has the job situation resulted in an increased interest by people in this country to work in care homes?</p></speech>

In some cases the waiting time has reduced to seven days, which is very positive.</p> <p>  The main sources of candidates right across the health service, not just in nursing homes, are in India and the Philippines.  We are working closely with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland on the clinical adaptation programme for staff coming from overseas because of the impact they have right across the entire health and social care service.  That is very positive.</p></speech>

Even in recent days, I heard colleagues outlining the challenges when an outbreak occurs and a large number of staff are out sick due to Covid.  Nursing is the single biggest issue.  That is why we as an organisation engaged last year in a workforce plan.  We will engage with the Department of Health on that.  We must have a workforce plan for the entire health and social care service.  People spoke earlier about increased home care, for example.  Even if we have all the additional home care hours, we need the staff to be able to do that, both in terms of nurses and carers.  The situation is still very challenging but that is something we collectively need to address.</p></speech>

We hear that many people are now, regrettably, unemployed, having lost their jobs in other sectors but the vast majority of them may not be suited to working in nursing home care.  That is why we need to focus on career planning.  Reward is an important part of it as well.  That goes back to the point I made earlier on the review of the fair deal scheme.  Recruitment and retention are a challenge for all of us right across the health and social care services.</p></speech>

Physiotherapy, chiropody and personal care services involve a lot of intimate and close contact with residents.</p> <p>  Within HSE services there has been a huge emphasis on the provision of multidisciplinary services which, in some cases, have been diverted to residents in those settings, in particular after an outbreak.  There is an issue around the continued provision of services.  In the drafts on visiting guidance issued from September and October onwards we made a very clear distinction between essential service providers, including those who provide all the services the Senator listed, and a number of other important service providers, such as those who provide supports like hairdressing that support the well-being of people in nursing homes.  We have tried to cover that, but access is contingent on what is happening within a nursing home at any one time and the type of care that needs to be delivered for the residents.  It is very much dependent on the service provider.</p></speech>

Significant efforts have been made in terms of education and training provision.  We understand an awful lot more about the indirect impacts the Senator is speaking to as the months have gone by.  There has been a huge emphasis on learning from what the indirect impacts will be.</p> <p>  There will be a long tail to the pandemic in terms of the needs of residents, families and others in a residential care setting.  We will need to do a lot more work and research to understand what the long-term impacts will be.  They should inform the safe staffing levels we are talking about and the multidisciplinary needs of the model in terms of the multidisciplinary supports that people need and our entire social care system.</p> <p>  We must remember the direct and indirect consequences are similar for very vulnerable people who are living in the community outside of the nursing home and are isolated in their homes and experiencing equally deleterious effects.  For those who are interested, there is a report on the impact of cocooning available on the HSE website.  It outlines a lot of the impacts we have spoken about today and details the feedback from voluntary agencies, the nursing home expert panel report and others in a very detailed way to demonstrate our learning and the kind of positive impact that community and voluntary support groups have had in mitigating some of that impact.  It is available for members if they want to read it.</p></speech>

I am thinking about them as they try to move forward.</p> <p>  The Covid-19 expert panel's report for the Minister for Health was released a couple of months ago.  It stated only 10% of nursing homes invited actually submitted a written response.  Members of the public had only one week within which to make a written submission.  There were only 60 submissions from members of the public.  Given the very strong public feeling about what has happened in nursing homes, that seems to be an extraordinarily small number.  Can anyone offer any commentary on that? </p> <p>  Reference has been made to the need for a public inquiry.  Do the witnesses think there has been a proper and deep reflection thus far on the situation in nursing homes with the Minister?  Have members of the public had an opportunity to engage in that process?  Have there been adequate opportunities for that thus far?</p></speech>

The expert panel worked at speed.  It was very conscious of the need to get as much learning as quickly as possible and to bring that back to all of us around the table so that any improvements that could be made, would be made.  It engaged quite significantly and directly with nursing homes.  Virtual site visits were conducted with a number of nursing homes so that the panel could hear directly what was happening within those homes.  I might ask Mr. Redmond to come in to provide some more detail on that consultation piece.</p></speech>

I am just wondering whether engagement with 60 members of the public constitutes an accurate reflection of how members of the public have felt.  I remember at the time that not a single person I knew had heard about the opportunity to engage with the consultation, including people who had relatives in nursing homes who had passed away.  Do the witnesses think that there was adequate opportunity for members of the public to engage?</p></speech>

It engaged quite extensively with the various stakeholders and representative bodies, such as the patient advocacy service.  It met with a number of those bodies as well as with nursing home staff and representatives of residents.  It reflects the approach the panel needed to take in respect of using a good and robust methodology to deliver a report and the learning from that report as quickly as possible.  It is important to say that throughout the implementation structures that have been established, there is a stakeholder reference group.  Members include nursing representatives and advocacy representatives from the national patient advocacy service and Sage Advocacy.  Therefore, there is an ongoing opportunity to feed in the views from the resident and family perspectives.  That is an important part of that process as we move through the implementation and ensure that the voice of residents is represented in those structures.</p></speech>

An article was published, which I am sure everyone has seen.  It has also been referenced in respect of the fact that because of staff shortages, relatives are not going to be able to visit residents at the end of life stage.  I know many references have been made to the funding model and all of those things.  What actions have been taken to recruit and keep staff?  Would the witnesses acknowledge that pay and conditions are probably the main barrier to keeping staff and attracting them into the sector?  I know we have discussed the funding model.  What actions have been taken since the beginning of the Covid pandemic in order to get people into the sector?  Critically, people need to be with their relatives at the end of their lives.  The article, which states that staff shortages are going to result in people not being able to be with their relatives, is alarming.</p></speech>

We have a significant recruitment campaign that is ongoing.  Part of that campaign will help support some of the staffing levels that may be required during very high Covid surge times within nursing homes.  I am sure Nursing Homes Ireland may want to speak on this issue.  It has also been actively seeking to recruit staff for its nursing homes.</p> <p>  On the end of life issue, there has been significant support from the community palliative care teams and the Covid response teams to support end of life care as well as is possible, within these very challenging circumstances.  When Covid rates are very high within nursing homes, it is difficult for them to facilitate as much visiting as they would like to.  We have always supported nursing home providers and those nurses in charge to facilitate as much visiting as possible at the end of life stage.  Indeed, the guidance includes a very specific risk assessment to support them in this.  One of the recommendations from the expert panel is that we work with the Irish Hospice Foundation, which we are doing in respect of any improvements that can be made around end of life care.  In addition, we have funded HIQA to look to develop an end of life survey, as part of the patient experience survey, so that we can gain learning from that to bring back into our practice.</p></speech>

I also wish to send my condolences to all of those families who have lost loved ones.  It has been a very difficult year for so many people.  A lot of the questions I wished to ask have already been answered but I have one or two questions on the increase in the number of outbreaks in nursing homes during this third wave.  This has really alarmed the relatives of nursing home residents.  They fear that there will be delays in vaccination because it is not possible to vaccinate nursing home residents when the level of the illness is so high.  This is a terrifying prospect for elderly residents and their families.  I seek clarification on whether residents who do not display symptoms and test negative for Covid-19 can be moved off-site to be vaccinated.</p> <p>  Most of us will be aware of the nursing home in County Galway that has issued an appeal for qualified nurses to help it to fight a serious outbreak of Covid-19.  It is heartbreaking to hear that the outbreak has taken the lives of 12 residents and that 35 out of 49 residents have tested positive for the disease.  Perhaps Dr. Kennelly could outline to us the situation with regard to providing qualified nurses for facilities like the nursing home in Galway when they are engaged in an enormous battle with Covid-19.  It all seems to boil down to staffing levels and what we can do about them.  One of the main issues arising from today's presentations is the lack of staff and that is something we must focus on going forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.545" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kennelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020200002#W00300"><p>I will deal with the first question and then hand over to my colleague, Ms O'Neill, who will address the second question.  The vaccination of residents in nursing homes where outbreaks are occurring has been taking place.  Mr. Daly will be familiar with that as it is happening in both private and public settings.  Obviously people cannot be vaccinated if they are Covid positive.  They must wait for four weeks from the time of a positive diagnosis but are eligible for the vaccine after they have completed that four-week waiting period.  Residents who are either negative or who do not have symptoms at the time of a vaccine roll-out have, for the most part, been vaccinated.  That has been continuing over that time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.546" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Yvonne O'Neill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020200002#W00400"><p>I will not speak about any particular outbreak if that is okay.  The HSE works very closely with all care providers, including any facility that is experiencing a high level of outbreak like the one the Senator described.  The Covid response teams work with providers in the identification of agency staff.  Where that is not possible, they have supported facilities experiencing outbreaks with redeployed HSE staff.  We operate on the basis of shift to shift and day to day.  We are literally in that level of close contact with providers when they are experiencing challenging outbreaks.  By and large what we are able to do, particularly while staff are on Covid leave, is to stabilise shift and rostering levels to get the facilities through the worst days.  There is very strong guidance on this and providers are, largely, very responsive to it in terms of cohorting residents to reduce the wider impact when significant numbers of residents test positive.  Mr. Daly may wish to speak on this too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.547" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tadhg Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020200002#W00500"><p>As I said in my opening statement, staffing is a challenge that is shared across all of the settings.  Over the weekend we heard acute hospitals appealing for staff.  This problem is not unique to nursing homes, unfortunately, given the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  It is the single biggest challenge.  That the existing staff are working above and beyond the call of duty, working additional shifts and additional hours, is keeping us all going at this point.  It is important to acknowledge that.</p> <p>  The other point that the Senator made with regard to vaccinations is critical.  We need a very extensive protocol to ensure nobody is denied vaccination, particularly those in the most vulnerable categories.</p><p>We need to be very careful about moving residents off-site.  We are looking at the most frail and vulnerable people here so we would expect that vaccination would happen on-site and every effort needs to be made, in the first instance, to go down that avenue.</p></speech>

I think a representative of the HSE said that those engagements were happening monthly.  Has the Irish Association of Social Workers been asked to engage?  Has it engaged?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.550" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sandra Tuohy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020200002#X00300"><p>I will submit a list of all the voluntary agencies that have been invited to attend those monthly meetings with the HSE.  The monthly engagement is an opportunity for us to be updated on outbreaks and matters related to Covid-19.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for those agencies to offer advice to the HSE on direction of travel and how we might do things differently.  The meetings once a month are very much collaborative.  Those meetings were occurring every two weeks at the beginning of the crisis but it became more and more difficult to get people to attend.  I will get a list of the relevant agencies and send it to the committee.</p></speech>

I will ask first about the 193 outbreaks that were identified in nursing homes, as of yesterday.  Has the HSE done any tracing in terms of those outbreaks?  What percentage of them is a result of community-based transmission and what percentage is a result of infection in acute hospitals?  Has any research been done on that yet?</p></speech>

Our public health outbreak control teams do that level of tracing but I do not have the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, data in front of me.  Those data are made available to explain the underlying cause of an outbreak.  I cannot tell the Senator about the data around the current 193 outbreaks but community transmission would probably account for 90% of it.  A very small number would relate to outbreaks in acute hospitals and associated discharges.</p></speech>

How much has been paid out through that scheme to the private nursing homes to date?</p></speech>

Up to Friday of last week, &euro;66.9 million had been paid out to providers.  In excess of &euro;100 million has also been spent on personal protective equipment, PPE, staff redeployment, staff accommodation, serial testing, cleaning and the like, in addition to the TAPS.  That money has been given to providers to try to maintain the welfare of residents in those facilities.</p></speech>

When the first wave of the pandemic hit us, PPE and so on were the big issues for the 400 members of Mr. Daly's organisation.  Was that &euro;170 million enough to ensure that Nursing Homes Ireland could cover its Covid requirements in terms of the range of services it provides, PPE and so on?</p></speech>

The TAPS is, clearly, a welcome development, to be fair.  We are seeing that those facilities with big outbreaks are exceeding the thresholds.  The scheme is a contribution towards the significant additional costs associated with Covid.  It is very welcome but we are working with the Department on an ongoing basis to continually tweak and amend the scheme, as appropriate.</p></speech>

Everything that could be done has been done.  As I stated in May in my opening remarks to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, money is not a barrier.  The temporary assistance scheme is a support mechanism to offset some of the costs.  We were initially disappointed with regard to the issue around isolation beds.  That was subsequently dealt with in November.  In December, funding was made available in respect of the issue of visiting.  I do not wish to be negative about it but we would liked to have seen those elements happen much more quickly.  The total budget provided was &euro;92 million.  Only &euro;62 million has been drawn down to date.</p></speech>

Mr. Daly wanted his organisation to be represented on NPHET.  What is its relationship with NPHET like at the moment?  Does it have a relationship with NPHET?  Mr. Daly made a very strong case in the media that private nursing homes should be represented on NPHET.</p></speech>

That is still the case.  History will speak for itself in that regard.  Our relationship with the system has been greatly enhanced.  We do not have a direct relationship with NPHET but we are working closely with Dr. MacLellan, who is a member of NPHET, and we work with other members as individuals.  However, we do not directly engage with NPHET.</p></speech>

What action on detection takes place in the event of an outbreak in the workplace, the community, public or private nursing homes, hospitals or other areas?  What has been learned in the context of this surge in comparison with previous outbreaks?  Has something been learned that needs to be incorporated more into services?  Has the appropriate action been taken?  Is it possible to take the appropriate action in every case?  When the bells ring and there is an outbreak in a particular place, is there a systemic reaction and is it universal?</p> <p>  Is the provision of vaccines to patients and staff, etc., in nursing homes and hospitals being reviewed on an ongoing basis?  Can it be improved?  If there is any information that cannot be provided in the time available, I would be happy to take a written reply on the matter.</p></speech>

I will deal with his questions in reverse order.  The roll-out of the vaccination programme to nursing homes was accelerated.  In the month since we received the vaccines, we have basically administered one dose in all of the 578 nursing homes bar four.  As was stated, those who could not receive the first dose for clinical reasons will receive it when the programme for the second dose is rolled out.  The only dependency is the supply of the vaccine.</p><p>The nursing home sector remains the priority in the roll-out of vaccination.</p><p> We talked a little about the Covid response teams in our reply to Deputy Cullinane earlier, so I will ask Dr. Kennelly to respond to the specific question on what actions happen as soon as an outbreak is detected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.567" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kennelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021020200002#Z00200"><p>There is a very close relationship between all the public health teams on the ground and their colleagues in nursing homes and across many of the workplaces the Deputy outlined.  Those public health colleagues will link directly with the care provider in the nursing home.  They will establish where the positive cases are and what is the safest way of cohorting, which means grouping together residents who are positive into one area, and having as many staff work with them as closely as possible so there is less mixing of staff with residents who are not positive.  There is usually very significant testing of all the residents in an affected area along with all the staff in those areas.  Much of it depends on the size of the nursing home and the size of the outbreak, but it is very closely monitored with public health colleagues.  They in turn link with us clinically, such as with my colleagues, geriatricians and others, to get palliative care advice.  A number of reflex clinical actions arise.</p> <p>  Then there is the operational part Ms O'Neill spoke about in terms of the types of supports that are needed, be it for PPE, infection prevention and control, surveillance and assistance with that.  They are well outlined and are available to all the care settings when it happens.</p></speech>

The lessons we have learned about asymptomatic presentation have informed a number of the additional interventions.  In particular, the serial testing has offered another way of early identification and mitigation of outbreaks.  I see Dr. MacLellan has her hand up, so she might wish to say more on that.</p></speech>

I also wish to associate the committee with the messages of condolence.  I offer thanks to you and all your staff, as you are working with the most vulnerable in society.  We will return to the issue with HIQA, which is developing new oversight proposals for nursing homes.  The suggestion of the vaccination of new residents is something we will follow up.  We will also examine the implementation update for the expert panel report.  Mr. Daly will be following up on the fair deal proposals with the Minister.</p> <p>  Again, thank you for your contributions.  There is a great deal of information that we need to assess.

We will later suspend for ten minutes to reconvene in private session to discuss correspondence.  This morning, we are joined remotely by Dr. Theresa Reidy, head of the department of government and politics at UCC, and Dr. Jane Suiter, associate professor in the school of communications at DCU.  Professor David Farrell, head of the school of politics and international relations at UCD also contributed to the presentation but is unable to attend due to the rescheduling of this meeting.  Members have been supplied with the opening statement.  I will ask our witnesses to make their opening statement and members will then be invited to address their questions.</p> <p>  Members attending from their Oireachtas offices or within the confines of Leinster House are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their participation in this meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty, as Chair, to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Members are reminded that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the website after this meeting.  I welcome Dr. Reidy and Dr. Suiter to the meeting.  They attended a meeting of the joint committee a number of years ago in connection with similar subject matter.  I thank them for being here today and for their assistance with this pre-legislative scrutiny.  We have a new committee with only two members from the previous one.  Each member will have about five minutes to ask a question.  Could the witnesses could answer within those five minutes?  If members could identify themselves before they speak and confirm that they are within the confines of Leinster House, it would be very helpful for us.  I invite either Dr. Reidy or Dr. Suiter to make their opening statement.</p></speech>

The three of us thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute to pre-legislative scrutiny of the electoral reform Bill 2020.  Overall, we very much welcome this Bill and the pre-legislative scrutiny.  We think it will allow for extensive engagement with the structure and functions set out for the electoral commission.</p><p>As we all know, Ireland is an old democracy and has a proud tradition of free and fair elections.  However, our democratic processes are long due for updating in the digital age and for a more diverse and fragmented electorate.  It is great that the establishment of the electoral commission has cross-party support and has widespread backing from civil society groups.  There is enormous potential with this Bill to create an innovative and robust institution that will really shepherd Irish democracy through the next decades.  Ireland could be held out as a beacon in establishing an electoral commission fit for the 21st century.</p><p> The general scheme is a very detailed document of more than 300 pages.  In our approach we very much take an overview, or a helicopter approach, and focus on aspects of the composition of the commission and the roles that are ascribed to it.  It has taken us nearly two decades to get to this point, which is why we believe that perhaps the most concerning aspect of the general scheme is the overall lack of ambition envisaged for the commission.</p><p> In the format outlined, the electoral commission will consolidate the roles of many of the existing agencies in this space and the franchise section of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage into a single management body.  That is to be welcomed.  However, the scheme heavily prescribes the structures and functions of the commission leaving very little room for expansion of current election management activities to allow for its evolution in the decades to come or for its capacity to adapt to electoral integrity challenges of the future. </p><p> Overall the document is really strong on detail about how the commission will be set up and what functions it will take over from existing bodies but there is very little information on how it might grow, apart from six lines, on page 60, that refer to functions that might be transferred at a later stage, which are an oversight of electoral events and political funding.  In essence, this is a static design for a dynamic environment.  The initial design must have more ambition to allow the commission to grow.  For the three of us, this is the big missing piece of the document.</p><p> The proposed composition of the commission has largely been modelled on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission but, internationally, electoral commissions follow different models.  The large size of the board, the requirement that the leadership be drawn from the judicial community and the inclusion of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, the Clerk of the Seanad and the Ombudsman, are all consistent with Irish administrative practice but this approach is unusual internationally.  The electoral commission of New Zealand has a board of three members which includes the full-time chief executive.  Australia&rsquo;s electoral commission has just three board members.  The electoral council of the Netherlands has seven members.  While electoral commissions always have strong internal legal sections, few require that the chairperson is a judge.  For example, the chairs of the UK, Dutch and New Zealand commissions are not judges.</p><p> Looking at the financial arrangements, the costs of running the electoral commission will be included in annual voted expenditure and it will have its own Accounting Officer but this may well lead to negotiations and discussion with the line Department on the annual budget.  In contrast, the IFAC and the Houses of the Oireachtas&rsquo;s costs come from non-voted expenditure and that would seem to us to be more appropriate given the need for complete independence and autonomy.</p><p> As noted, the list of functions on page 57 consolidate the roles of existing bodies but notably do not broaden the scope of electoral management in Ireland.  Crucially, the commission is not given a specific function of maintaining the integrity of electoral processes.</p><p> I will highlight a few areas from within those chapters.  Political advertising is conceived very narrowly and there is an impractical separation of the regulation of online and broadcast media, which is not in line with recommendations from the BAI.  There is no substantive engagement with the possibility of disinformation and interference in elections.  The 1997 definition of political purposes, which has proved very limiting for civil society organisations, is maintained.</p><p>Promoting political participation should also be a stand-alone function of the commission.  This should cover the promotion of voting, provision of political information and some role in encouraging and supporting candidacy.</p><p> The research function is very tightly defined and unambitious.  It involves layers of approval that may prove unrealistic in the event of unplanned electoral events such as snap general elections.  In sharp contrast, the section on voting registers contains extensive information on how current provisions and practices are to be updated.  However, it still allows very little ability for the commission to influence the approach to registration.  Specifically, the provisions for postal voting are still very limited in section 14 and are only mentioned under voter registration.  Will the new electoral commission be able to contribute to and expand on the provisions outlined?</p><p> We welcome this really concrete step towards establishing an electoral commission.  Our comments are intended to enhance the final design and operation of the institution we hope the committee will be able to contribute to under the process of pre-legislative scrutiny.  We have been discussing electoral reform in Ireland for many years.  Recently, we participated in a network with wide-ranging expertise on many issues.  I know the committee has invited in quite a few others.  However, it may also be interested in engaging with some of our colleagues, including Ms Fiona Buckley, University College Cork, UCC, on equality, diversion and inclusion; Ms Liz Carolan, Digital Action, on political campaigning and advertising; and Mr. Liam Herrick, Irish Council for Civil Liberties, on participation and advocacy on electoral matters.</p><p> Ms Reidy and I are open to answer any questions the committee might have.</p></speech>

One of the problems we have with committee meetings is that we are very restricted in time, so what we may do is seek a written submission from those recommended.  We will move on to questions.</p></speech>

This is a little bit like the bus we have all been waiting for and now that it has arrived we want it to be the best response to what we have been waiting on for a long time.  At a previous meeting with the Department, I acknowledged the importance of this legislation, the delivery of it and the work that took placed in the Department under the previous Government.  There are two areas of concern I would like the witnesses to speak to.  I am persuaded by both the governance and ambition arguments made.</p> <p>  Two issues of concern for me are the management of the local register and political advertising.  It would appear that in this legislation we are permitting political advertising from organisations which are largely multinational and do not have a strong track record of preventing interference in elections.  On the other hand, we have independent radio stations and Irish television channels prevented from gaining that advertising revenue.  I am not making the argument we should have that advertising but is there a case to be made for preventing online advertising during elections?</p> <p>  The second question is on the management of the register.  It would appear we are leaving the responsibility and the resource at local authority level but some sort of oversight or management function with the commission.  What potentials for error do the witnesses see in the management of that process?</p></speech>

I will then respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.581" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Theresa Reidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020200002#D00300"><p>I will speak about the electoral register and then I will let Dr. Suiter come in.  It is not unusual to have a relatively modest sized electoral management board that works in tandem with a network of local authorities managing electoral registers.  That is a pretty common model internationally - in fact, our nearest neighbour, the UK, operates along those lines.  One of the difficulties with the register at present is that we know it is significantly over estimated in some areas but then quite under estimated in other areas.  In urban communities, in particular, we think there are far fewer people on the register than there should be.  Part of the reason for this is that there are no overarching guidelines, structures or requirements that local authorities have to adhere to.  One of the strengths of this Bill is that it changes that.  It puts in place a set of guidelines, reporting requirements and policies and procedures that local authorities will have to adhere to.  That is a step in the right direction.</p> <p>  We also need to look at the evolution of how voter registration is potentially going to develop in the future.  One would expect that the balance of registration will move towards online registration.  We will probably see much more of that, particularly if there is a referendum on external voting rights for emigrants.  This is going to change how we deal with voter registration.  It will require significant policy development which will have to be managed at a national level and then filtered down.  </p> <p>  We must remember that we need to keep electoral expertise on the ground in terms of the organisation of polling.  That is one of the strengths of our system.  In the audits of electoral procedures in Ireland, we know that works very well.  The processes of organising polling and counting is done very efficiently and effectively.  To some extent, it makes a degree of sense to have franchise expertise at local level.  We will need to maintain some of that to consolidate this in the area of voter registration as well.  This comes back to Dr. Suiter's point as to what role the electoral commission will play in oversight.  As the Bill is currently written, annual reports will go to the Minister and only after a period of time will they go to the electoral commission, once that part of the Act is commenced.</p> <p>  There are also questions about when the electoral commission will begin to get oversight and the ability to inform policy.  Under head 80, reference is made to how the electoral commission can undertake research on electoral registers and the processes but it is not clear at what point that will begin.  It is also not clear whether it will have the ability to inform and shape the procedures that are currently written into the Bill, particularly in relation to postal voting.  Should the referendum be passed, the registration requirements are going to change significantly.  The idea of having local authorities still involved is a good one because there are strengths in that but the issues of oversight and ensuring that that purpose can grow and develop and be evaluated and analysed needs to be teased out a bit more.</p></speech>

The Deputy's point on the difference between what we allow on international platforms and what we allow in national media is very marked.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, has made a submission stating this is not best practice in its view.  We know the big platforms - the Facebooks, the Twitters and the Googles - operate according to their own rules.  They all have idiosyncratic definitions.  Twitter may announce a ban on something and Facebook may not while YouTube may do something else entirely.  There is a big question as to whether we allow the regulation of that to be decided by big US platforms rather than by ourselves.  In addition, their responses are usually driven by US politics and not by Irish politics.</p><p>There are many questions there and others around the fact that we are narrowly keeping it to electoral periods when we all know there is much political activity between elections so that seems problematic.  There is the issue around transparency.  It is good that we are looking for transparency but we are only going to have the archive available afterwards rather than in real time.  Obviously, journalists, researchers and political parties would like to see that kind of archive in real time.  While the moves on political advertising are welcome there are quite a few holes or lacunas and there are ways it could be substantially improved.</p></speech>

I will try to be as brief as possible.  I am interested in online advertisements and Dr. Suiter's experience in this regard.  Could she give us an idea of any comparable legal changes that are taking place in other countries around the area of disinformation?  Are any of them put on a legal basis or are they just guides and policies for companies to follow?  One of my big concerns is not paid online advertisements and transparency around that but disinformation and nefarious actors coming into that area.  Are there any examples of best practice from other countries?</p> <p>  I am also interested in the point on the evolution of the electoral commission and on it not being able to evolve into a 21st century commission.  Does Dr. Suiter consider there is sufficient flexibility in the Bill to allow the electoral commission to develop guides around, for example, who can take part in party leader debates so that it is not simply up to RT&Eacute; to set the policy?  Is there a role for something like an independent electoral commission in that?  I am interested in the archive being made available afterwards.  Does she think that is worthy of an amendment to the Bill so that tech companies make online articles available in real time?</p> <p>  Head 80 states that the electoral commission can inform policy and Dr. Reidy said that there is no detail provided on when that will begin.  What type of issues does she envisage it looking at?  Is it simply around electoral reform?  Is it simply around the register or does it cover a wider area beyond that?</p></speech>

Some of the best guidance is coming out of the EU.  It is important to note the EU's Digital Services Act is likely to make provisions in this regard.  It could happen that because of the way the Bill is currently drafted it would need to be redrafted in order to take that into account.  We very much need to look at this.  I can send the committee links to the various European documents, if the Chair wishes.  However, it will be important to ensure the Bill is in line with European legislation which is most likely coming down the track this year.  It would be a pity to do something that would then have to be changed in light of changes in Europe.  That is probably the main area where most of the European legislation is coming from.  Notably, that calls for it to be a year-round affair with perhaps additional measures during an election period, rather than only having measures during an election period.  It is also very strong on the transparency issue.</p><p> This brings me to the third question posed.  The platforms make these databases available almost in real time.  They are updated at least once a day, if not two or three times a day.  It would seem odd to us that the Bill would state they be made available afterwards given that they are made available by the platforms in real time.  It would seem to make sense to use that capability and make them available in real time as well through the electoral commission.  There does not seem to be a particularly good reason to hold those back until afterwards.  </p><p> I will let Dr. Reidy address the issue of flexibility.  Regarding the broadcasting regulations, some of those are governed by court judgments on topics such as balance, while some are BAI regulations.  Operational and editorial decisions, such as who is allowed to be in a debate, are internal editorial matters for RT&Eacute;, and I am not sure that area would be within the purview of an electoral commission.  It is an editorial decision.  Perhaps there could be negotiation on best practice guidelines but I am not sure that aspect should be in legislation as it would seem to be micromanagement of the media process.</p></speech>

A couple of countries have set up stand-alone small commissions to deal with this question separately.  I think Canada was the first country to do that.  Its Leaders' Debates Commission provides guidance on how many debates there should be and if there should be shared platforms across different broadcasters.  A Bill in the UK was designed to do the same thing but I am not sure if that has passed into law.  It was definitely on the agenda in late 2019 and 2020.  It is not an issue that is so much dealt with by electoral commissions <i>per se</i>, although other countries have come up with mechanisms for dealing with this.<br/><br/>Regarding the question on the evolution of-----</p></speech>

They consolidate existing electoral administration functions, but there do not seem to be any open functions which would allow the commission to develop its role and expand into new areas.</p> <p>  I will address some of those points in more detail.  At present, there is no function providing that the electoral commission has a role in auditing each electoral event and assessing how it operated in the various parts of the electoral cycle.  That means we do not have a consistent evaluation after every event.  If we take the provision of voter information, because the referendum Acts are consolidated into this legislation, a specific set of requirements mandates the electoral commission to be involved in providing information at referendums.  It is not specified anywhere, however, that the electoral commission will be responsible for doing this at elections.  We have the odd situation where if a referendum is scheduled at the same time as an election, the referendum commission provides excellent information concerning when the referendum will be, what the issue is and how long the polls will be open, but there is no mention of the election running at the same time.  Reading this Bill, there does not seem to be any provision to allow the electoral commission to step into that role and provide this more general information.</p><p>It is the same with, for example, the promotion of candidacy, encouraging people to run for election and providing supports for them.  There are not functions set out in the current general scheme, as we read it, that would allow the electoral commission to evolve in that way.  This is the first step, though, so it is possible that these things can be built into the Bill.</p><p> In response to Senator Moynihan's question about the role the electoral commission would have in providing policy advice, and with respect to the voter registration processes, it will be interesting to know if the commission will be able to provide advice as we move towards more online registration.  These things interact.  If we were to trial much wider use of postal voting, for example, that would have very important implications for the electoral registers, where people are registered and the point at which the electoral commission would be able to advise on those things.  What is written there now is that when the electoral commission comes into play, many of these decisions on postal voting will already have been made, which really limits the ability of the commission to shape what are very important decisions.</p><p> The other very important thing about registration is that if we were to trial early voting, which is common in a lot of countries, it would also have implications for voter registration.  In general, though, there are some very welcome developments and advancements in voter registration.  There are some really important changes in the general scheme that will be very good if they come into play.  It is just that there are other challenges ahead, and it is not entirely clear how the electoral commission would be able to shape and evolve that policy.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Suiter, Dr. Reidy and Professor David Farrell not only for their presentation but also for their ongoing work in this area.  To pick up on Deputy McAuliffe's bus analogy, it is not only because we have waited so long for the bus but also because, like in so many parts of rural Ireland, we know the next bus will not come for quite some time that we want to make sure that this one is as good as possible.  We all want this Bill but we all want the best Bill we can get.  My questions are with a view to the fact that this committee will produce a report and that the report will have recommendations.  As we all know, the more focused our recommendations are the greater the chance that the Government and the Department will listen to some of them.  I am really keen to get the witnesses' specific high-level asks, that is, the things they would like to see added to the Bill in a number of key areas.</p> <p>  First, Dr. Reidy mentioned the audit, but are there any other key functions the witnesses would like to see in the Bill at this stage?  Do they have any concern about the independence of the structure as it is set up in terms of being reliant on voted expenditure and other aspects of the Department and the Minister almost being a kind of line manager to the board in some respects?</p> <p>  Second, regarding voter participation, which is a very distinct piece of work, what is the good practice?  What should we be looking to insert in the Bill to ensure that this commission has a really strong role in increasing participation, particularly among sections of the population such as young people, lower income communities, migrants, etc.  Dr. Suiter mentioned election and referendum research at the start, but I would like the witnesses to bring their experience of previous election research to bear.  What do we need to see in this Bill to ensure that the kind of good work that previous governments funded the witnesses and others to do becomes mainstream for all elections and referendums?</p> <p>  Finally, we were told by the officials at the previous meeting that the set-up budget will be at the upper end of &euro;2.7 million within an annual operational budget at the upper end of &euro;1.7 million.  Obviously, it is hard to compare this with other jurisdictions because their populations may be bigger and so on, but is that adequate?  What is the norm for comparably sized western European liberal democracies?  I would also be interested, if the witnesses get a chance, to hear them further expand on some of the online stuff, but that has been well covered so far so perhaps they could concentrate on those other questions first.</p></speech>

The Deputy highlighted those that we homed in on.  It is important that there be a type of election audit or evaluation at each election, not just of the election day process itself but of the whole electoral cycle, including the operation and organisation of the event.  This would involve rolling research.</p> <p>  That connects to the Deputy's question on what would be good in terms of referendum or election research.  It is important that we learn about how voters engage with politics and what information is useful for them.  We need to do this over a couple of periods.  We must engage with voters at the start of the process, prior to election or referendum day, and after the day with a view to enhancing the processes and practices thereafter.  This would not have to be done at every electoral event, but we should ensure that it was done reasonably regularly and that the commission had the independence to do so.</p> <p>  Regarding what is good in terms of voter participation, it is crucial that there be a function specifically related to voter participation at all electoral events, not just at referendums.  This would connect with the voter registration processes and involve ongoing voter information and education on, in general, the political system, the electoral events in question and the roles of the people being elected.  We have good practices in this area.  The Referendum Commission has been doing this work quite well in recent times, but it should be done at all election events.  Participation should be understood broadly.  We would want to encourage people to become involved in politics and see candidacy supports and a role for candidacy.  Our colleagues who work in the fields of equality, diversity and inclusion are keen to see this dimension being understood in terms of participation in voting and standing for election.  This relates to a recurring theme.</p> <p>  We should leave the Bill sufficiently open so that the electoral commission could evolve this work itself by trialling different techniques.  This would particularly be the case around what works to mobilise voters.  The commission would be able to try different techniques, evaluate them and roll them out if they have been successful or trial something else if they have not.  For example, many techniques have been tried in France around contacting voters, including by text, to let them know where their respective polling stations are and what times those are open.  Some of that has worked well whereas some has not.  We want the electoral commission to have the autonomy to trial techniques, evaluate them and move on.</p> <p>  A great deal of good referendum research has been done.  It is obvious to us that every referendum should be evaluated, not just the ones where the Government did not get the results it believed it would.  It would be good if an evaluation was an automatic decision of the electoral commission.  Referendums have started working well, as shown by some of the Referendum Commission's research.  There is a strong core, but an evaluation needs to happen at every referendum.</p> <p>  I do not know the operating budgets of electoral commissions off the top of my head, but we have examined this issue previously and spoken to committee members.  Internationally, the Canadian electoral commission is considered the exemplar, but it is a very large commission, covers diverse territories and is probably not the best model for Ireland to consider.  Rather, we should probably consider the Electoral Commission of New Zealand.  It has a relatively small staff and works with local authorities.  When discussing budgets, we must remember that the model envisaged in this Bill, albeit a good one, would involve a great deal of this work being done by local authorities.</p><p>Budgets are involved in that too, so the total cost of electoral administration would be considerably greater than just what is included in the budget for the electoral commission.</p></speech>

My concern comes from a focus on digital identity, the manipulation of digital presence and what happens to that in the context of democracy as a much wider subject.  I am quite influenced by the writings of people such as Dr. Shoshana Zuboff on the age of surveillance capitalism and looking at what is happening on social media and with those social media giants.  Today we have newspaper reports of a misinformation campaign claiming that hospitals are lying about their capacity and that they are empty.  There is a pattern of online content that is repeated through several countries and we are just the latest country to exhibit this.  It is a deliberate disruption campaign that is being orchestrated by somebody or some parties.  My concern is that we are reliant on the Facebook definition of community rules to examine that content or do something about it and there is not, <i>per se</i>, anyone with the powers for a mandatory order to remove content.  That is not currently in legislation.  One can act on defamation but there is otherwise no limit on content.</p><p>I welcome the Bill and note the witnesses' comments on it.  My concern is that it is a narrow definition of advertising, limited to the campaign period.  I do not believe that that reflects the reality of our lived experience day to day, especially in the context of today's campaign and similar campaigns.  I am mindful of the Digital Services Act coming.  I would rather get it right or examine the possibility of getting it right, whether we do it in this legislation or in the transposing legislation when the Digital Services Act comes into being.</p><p>I look at the online safety and media regulation Bill, the creation of a media commission with broader parameters and jurisdiction, the Data Protection Commission, with which I am especially familiar, and at the electoral commission.  Given their boundaries, jurisdictions and focuses, do the witnesses think that this power should be legislated for separately?  Can it be done effectively within the commission?  Is it too much to ask of the electoral commission?  What are the witnesses' thoughts on how that can be tackled?  My overriding concern is that we will publish legislation that implements rules regarding political advertising that are already out of date by a number of years with regard to reflecting the day-to-day experience.</p></speech>

It has been led by the Department of the Taoiseach, which has been quite involved in it.  As the Senator knows, parts of this are being addressed by the Future of Media Commission.  I could not say for sure where I think it best sits, but looking at election and political misinformation, what we have transposed here is text that we came up with in the previous century.  As a result, this does not in any way tackle the problem of disinformation in elections and so on, yet we know some things that will do that.</p><p>I am not sure that it is the place for the commission.  Obviously, this is something that is evolving.  There was a call last week but, unfortunately, there were technical problems so it was difficult to understand exactly what is happening with that.  The European Commissioner on data had a piece in the <i>Irish Independent</i>just yesterday on issues relating to data protection of which we must be cognisant and to which the Senator may have been referring.  This is probably one of the good places to put some of that detail in and start trying to think about how we might legislate for it.  If we rely on US corporations or even European legislation, it is not clear how far we will go in terms of content yet we know that the content itself matters - not just the transparency, which is where Europe is going.  One of the researchers who works with me, Eileen Culloty, has been on the websites of a number of the far-right groups that are manufacturing some of this disinformation, on places like Parler and Gab, and has found a very clear pattern which shows that some of the discourse that is starting in QAnon groups in the US is arriving in Ireland.  We are beginning to see more of that appearing in Facebook groups and people start to believe it so it is something that would be of concern for all Members of the Oireachtas.  This is where it might be good to start thinking about how we might tackle that.</p></speech>

This is a really interesting discussion.  Of course, we all know the importance of elections, which are fundamental to our democracy.  Therefore, it is important that they are properly managed and evaluated.  This goes without saying.  I have been involved in the OSCE so I am familiar with the monitoring of elections and indeed was in the US during the mid-term elections.  It was interesting to observe the discourse there.  We had a workshop as part of that process a few days before polling.  It was interesting to engage with different groups and discuss the major concerns about misinformation or disinformation.  It is an extraordinary set-up that can in no way be compared with the Irish system.</p> <p>  I know Dr. Reidy has talked about it so I am particularly interested in hearing from Dr. Suiter about the auditing of electoral events, the cycle and how we can evaluate all of that because that is where the learning will be - how we can audit and learn from that system.  Could the witnesses tease out international best practice regarding the auditing of electoral events, the cycle, evaluation and the learning from that in other countries such as Canada, which was mentioned by them, or New Zealand, with which we might be more familiar?  I think that is critical but it has not been addressed in the heads of this Bill.</p></speech>

When we talk about the electoral cycle, we are often talking about a 12-stage electoral cycle - everything from voter registration to party registration to voter information to the campaign period itself to polling day.  There is often an appeals process or the potential for an appeals process afterwards.  We are talking about what is sometimes called an election ecosystem when we talk about auditing it.  One would really want to ensure that one had capacity to evaluate each of these stages - perhaps not all in the one go, although there are processes for undertaking what is called a full electoral audit.</p><p>There are different systems in place.  If the Senator is particularly interested in this, we have a UK-based colleague, Professor Toby James, who works quite a lot on this area.  He has developed a number of systems, on which he has written a number of books, and these have been adapted and taken on board by electoral commissions around the world.  He would certainly be a good person to contact to get more detail on how it is done.</p><p> The election work we do much of the time relates to understanding how people voted, why they voted and what information they found useful, with the intention of feeding that back into the system.  Our work tends to be more post-election evaluation.</p><p> Work done specifically on Ireland that is worth mentioning includes work done by the Electoral Integrity Project, which is based out of Harvard University and Sydney University.  It does an expert evaluation of the electoral process after elections.  Ireland was included in that in 2011 and 2016.  The evaluation includes everything, for example, party finance regulation and evaluation of the electoral registers.  That project is interesting because it involves experts evaluating how they think the election worked, rather than having an audit team going into the commission and evaluating the documents.  It is an expert evaluation.</p><p> There are a number of different ways in which this can be done.  One probably wants to have the flexibility to allow different models.  Some of this work can also be done external to the electoral commissions.  There are international research projects, for example, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, involved in this kind of work.  In the case of Ireland, there is potential to engage more effectively with some of these international projects and also to ensure that capacity is built into the electoral commission so that it can do some of this work as well.  Some of this international work is being done but Ireland is not often included in these studies because we have a decentralised model and we do not have budgets.  For example, our elections were covered by the Electoral Integrity Project in 2011 and 2016 but not in 2020.</p></speech>

Now that we are in this hybrid media system, it is important that we think about some real-time monitoring.  That would be particularly the case for the information environment.  Senator Boyhan was concerned about disinformation.  Certainly, if one brings out a report on disinformation three months after it has happened, the learnings are fairly limited.  The commission needs to have the ability to get people to do this kind of monitoring of the information environment in real time rather than following an event.</p></speech>

Rule 28 says something along the lines of "where practicable".  Does Dr. Suiter or Dr. Reidy have any concerns about the way that is written?  Does this refer to it being practicable for the person register online or remotely or practicable for the local authority to enable it?  We all know that many local authorities are better resourced to deal with that than others and I wonder whether that would create a division among local authorities with some people being able to digitally register.</p></speech>

In an ideal world, to ensure there were not geographic vagaries of that nature, part of the oversight function of the electoral commission would be to allow a centralised digital or online registration function.  It would also seem sensible that one would not have to then build different systems in every local electoral area.  There is a possibility a centralised system could even be used for the preregistration of the younger people we were talking about.</p><p>That is a personal view.  I do not know if Dr. Reidy agrees.</p></speech>

One is that it would reduce the costs of running the registration process.  It would eliminate all the form inputting that must be done afterwards, and it would eliminate a lot of error because incomplete forms are not submitted.  It is very advantageous for accessing younger cohorts who are much more familiar with this technology.  It would require verification and validation processes so there is confidence in the system. That is where the conversation with the Data Protection Commissioner would come in.</p> <p>  We are all moving in this direction and a number of countries are at a much more advanced stage on digital registration.  We could learn a lot from them.  Many states in the USA have been doing this since around 2007 and 2008.  Several EU states are at an advanced stage.  France is one where there is still some self-registration and we could learn a lot from it.  We need to keep in mind that there will be people who will not use digital registration.  That goes back to the original question of whether it is a good idea to have-----</p></speech>

We completed a couple of reports for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, which were then used by the European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services, ERGA, on political advertising in the local and European elections here.  There are still problems with that but it is something on which the Commission is working with the platforms.  The ads are archived and it is possible to look at the material.  It is the archive that this legislation seems to refer to.  That is what would be made available whereas they are available in real time and so the technology to deal with that would be preferable.</p></speech>

When the posters go up, it is something that sparks a lot of conversation.  There does not seem to be much conversation when the posters come down.  Would that be too prescriptive?  We spoke about the editorial rights of a television station to agree who should be on, but do the witnesses have any view on whether there should be any limitation on posters to even the playing field across an election campaign?</p></speech>

They are something children see when they are walking around and there is some evidence this will spark conversations about politics and about issues within families.  In some jurisdictions where posters are much more limited the overall engagement can be more limited.  Certainly from a political engagement and political education point of view, limiting posters is not necessarily the ideal way to go.</p><p> I know people have some environmental concerns around them in terms of what they are made of, or Tidy Towns committee sometimes have concerns because they think they look messy.  There are also concerns about people spending various amounts.  If we think about it in terms of new candidates and new parties, it is one way for them to get their faces out.  If we limit posters, it gives an advantage to incumbents whom people already know rather than to challengers.</p><p> The electoral commission could certainly be involved in a debate on the amount of spending that could be allowed on a poster campaign by candidates, especially when it comes to SIPO being incorporated.  If some of these functions were allowed to be expanded, that is something the commission could do.  I do not think we would want to put into legislation that the commission necessarily must act to limit posters.  It could be that there is some way to limit them and the amount a major party or an individual candidate can spend.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions related specifically to the Bill and what changes should or should not be made and what recommendations the witnesses have.  Potential disinformation from online campaigning is a challenging area because one person's disinformation is another person's strongly held opinion.  It is more about trying to limit external influence and have transparency about people trying to influence voting in referendums.  Is the Bill flexible enough to deal with the potential changes that will continue to happen with regard to online influencing and campaigning?  Do changes need to be made?  With regard to the EU Digital Services Act, what do the witnesses think is the best way for us to ensure there is alignment with it?</p> <p>  My next two questions are on potentially extending postal voting.  What changes in the Bill would the witnesses recommend?  With regard to early voting and allowing for it, what changes might be made to the Bill to facilitate this?</p></speech>

I will address the questions on disinformation and perhaps Dr. Reidy can speak about postal voting and flexibility.  In a way, they both speak to the same thing, which is our overarching concern that this is a pretty prescribed piece of proposed legislation that does not allow much flexibility, yet we know that in the ten or 20 years that committee members have been involved in politics there have been huge changes in campaigning, the information environment and everything else.  Therefore, it would seem necessary that some sort of flexibility for functions would be built into the legislation.</p> <p>  Specifically relating to disinformation, there simply is not the flexibility for the commission to deal appropriately with that and this would need to be considered.  Some electoral commissions deal with fact-checking.</p><p>Our Referendum Commission has done some work in this area but again it is limited and more could be done in that regard.  We do not want to get into contested political areas but there are some claims that are manifestly false and not factually based.  That is important and not just in referendums.  The text from the Referendum Commission has been copied but it has not then been addressed to election periods.  It does not apply outside election periods.  There is a tightly defined political area but we all know there are issues with influencers and bots, for example, and there are many ways in which this can happen.  The flexibility just is not there for this commission to deal with that kind of matter.</p></speech>

In the aftermath of the 2007 election, it was possible to do some research on the reasons people did not participate.  The evidence indicated a ratio of 2:1 for voters who did not participate but would have done so if facilitated; they could not make it to polling stations, they did not know where those polling stations were, they did not know if they were registered or they were away for unspecified reasons.  Facilitation mattered for two-thirds of the people who did not participate.  That is why postal and early voting matters.  We believe there is a reasonable number of people who would participate if it was made a little easier for them to engage with the electoral process.</p> <p>  As it currently stands with the Bill, postal voting is confirmed for diplomats, polling workers and people with specific illnesses but there does not seem to be potential for broadening the criteria or the scope of those criteria.  As we have said, under head 80, the electoral commission is allowed to advise and provide policy recommendations on this but it seems this is a relatively straightforward area in which the electoral commission should already be making progress in broadening the scope for postal voting and making it much easier for people who are travelling or away from their home for whatever reason to be able to access a postal vote.  That is not currently in the legislation.  Generally, over many of the evaluations of the electoral process, there has been support for that.</p> <p>  Early voting is somewhat different and we do not currently have facilities for early voting other than, for example, what happens on the islands or with the special voter list.  That is not covered.  This is one of the places where we would want the electoral commission to do some research before proceeding to making recommendations about early voting.  It has implications on the production of registers and management of polling stations.  This is an area where we would definitely want the electoral commission to do much detailed work.  We would probably want the electoral commission to trial this in an area.  This is something we have come back to a couple of times as there must be scope for testing, evaluation and decisions thereafter.  As currently constructed, that type of flexibility does not appear to be present.</p></speech>

I am here in LH 2000 as well.</p><p> I have a couple of questions for the witnesses.  While the Bill is very welcome, I get their point that it is too limited and not ambitious enough.  I wonder if it is trying to be all things to all men.  I am thinking in particular about the points we have raised with the witnesses on the veracity of communication and the messaging.  Should this Bill not be dealing with those issues?  They are issues that do not relate just to elections or referendums but ones we are contending with on a daily basis in the political discourse and the political environment.</p><p> The witnesses spoke about the Digital Services Act and other legislation and policies that are being pursued.  Would it be better if the electoral commission did not deal with any of those issues?  Those are issues we recognise have to be dealt with in real life on a constant basis and the electoral reform work of this Bill should focus exclusively on the activity that takes place on polling days, be they referendums or local, European or general elections.  That is a strategic question in respect of the Bill.</p><p> The other issue I wish to raise is more operational in nature.  It has to do with the register of electors.  I listened closely to what the witnesses said about what is currently proposed but there is one aspect I do not get, and I come from a local authority background and have a great deal of respect for those working in franchise.  I have also had my challenges with the register of electors so I have a real interest in this issue.  I believe we have an opportunity to improve it but I am not convinced by the idea that on the one hand we are proposing to have a centralised rolling register of electors and on the other hand we will continue to maintain the maintenance and management of it in each of the local authorities.  What is the witnesses' opinion on that?  I appreciate that there will be an initial transition that would have to be managed but I refer to setting as the objective having one centralised register on a national basis, which would obviously have to be digital, online and verifiable.</p><p> The other two points raised were about having reports on elections and referendums and not just when the Government does not get the result it wants.  Do the witnesses believe it should be a statutory requirement to prepare such a report within six or 12 months?  In what sort of timeframe should a report be required?  Should it be prepared by the electoral commission and what would be the parameters of that report?</p><p> In terms of penalties, what are the witnesses&rsquo; views on compulsory voting and requiring compulsory participation?  Do they believe that is a good or bad thing?  Would it work?  If it was to be made compulsory what type of penalties would be imposed?  I believe the current penalty is a class A fine or something like that.  What are their views on that?  I thank both witnesses and Mr. Farrell also.</p></speech>

The main reason we continue to have local authorities involved is because there are layers of complexity involved in voter registration.  Envisaged in the Bill is some ongoing type of door-to-door canvass in terms of adding people to the electoral register.  There are provisions in respect of postal voting and special polling stations.  There are very welcome developments with regard to the provisions for including people who have temporary residence or are of no fixed abode on the register.  All of that, which is very welcome, requires some kind of structured organisation and offices across the country.  That is one of the reasons continuing to have agencies on the ground is very welcome.</p> <p>  Many countries have automatic registration but if we dig into how that actually works, it means one presents to City Hall, usually within three months of moving to an area, and registers with one's local authority.</p><p>That automatically updates the electoral register and one's voting enfranchisement entitlements follow one.  It involves a process of engagement with local government.  Accordingly, the model we have is not that different.  Some of the improvements and reforms built in will make us a little more dependent on knowledge on the ground and having the capacity to process postal voting, special voting, as well as improving registration opportunities on the ground.</p><p> The crucial point is that appropriate oversight and procedures are put in place which have to be adhered to.  One wants to eliminate the geographic variation that one has at the present time where some local authorities are more effective at delivering this than others.  That is where the real emphasis needs to be regarding the reporting requirements to the Minister and the electoral commission, along with the capacity of both of those to require improvements and expansions of activities on the ground.  The idea of having local authorities involved is not unusual and is quite typical around the world.  It retains this connection and keeps the voting services close to the people.</p><p> There is a school programme envisaged and pre-registration for 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds.  Again, it would make some degree of sense that this would be organised by franchise staff on the ground working reasonably closely to the schools.  Otherwise, we will be looking at a much larger electoral commission.  If the commission staff were to be involved in the voter registration processes, there would have to be suboffices and outreach abilities when we already have that structure in place.</p><p> One thing we do in Ireland is we strip roles away from local authorities before we actually look at how they could be improved and work better.  There is a real tendency towards centralisation.  We need to keep that in mind when we are addressing these matters.</p><p> On whether research should be put on a statutory function, ascribing a research role to the commission is crucial.  We want different types of research.  As Dr. Suiter said, on some occasions, one wants campaign research and reports afterwards.  There needs to be some degree of autonomy regarding the design and deployment of that research.  The commission has a research function which is a positive point.  Giving it a little more flexibility would require the approval of the Minister and the Oireachtas.  Freeing that up a little bit might be the direction to go rather than putting in more prescriptive statutory obligations.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Reidy and Dr. Suiter for their thoughts on this legislation.</p> <p>  I welcome the Bill and the setting up of the electoral commission for several reasons.  In the constituency I represent, Cork North Central, we have fierce variations in the number of people who vote.  In some parts of the constituency, only 30% of people vote while in other areas, it is more than 71% vote.  That comes down to the demographics of the areas.  Those in more settled and affluent areas have a tendency to vote.  In areas where there is disadvantage, deprivation, marginalised communities or much rental accommodation, fewer people vote.  This Bill is vital to making it more possible for more people to vote.  We need to make it easier for postal voting and opening polling stations earlier, for example.  Voter registration, as it stands, is a shambles in certain areas.</p><p>People who have unfortunately been deceased for ten or 20 years are still on the register.  People say to me that when they turn 18 they are cut off from children's allowance but not automatically registered to vote.  The question of data sharing comes in then.  The data commissioner will give us some insight into this.  We know, from either a tax or a health point of view, when people turn 18.  We need to make it possible for them to be automatically registered.  This should also apply when people move.  Many people are fed up with politics and do not want to engage.  That is why we want to make it as easy as possible for them to register and be able to vote.  Where is the best practice that the witnesses have seen for postal voting?  Is this Bill doing enough to engage with people to ensure they vote?</p><p> Then there is the whole issue of education.  We do a sample ballot paper in advance of elections because we find that many people still do not know how to vote.  On young people particularly, I welcome the preregistration but early school leavers will miss out on that.  What can we do to engage with those people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.648" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jane Suiter" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020200002#R00200"><p>As Dr. Reidy has said, preregistration is important.  We have to go in and deal with the different schools, or talk to the Data Protection Commissioner, so that we know when people turn 18 through their PPS numbers or whatever else and they automatically get put on it.  That needs to be worked out.  It is the same thing when people are deceased.  The State knows when people are deceased but it is a question of whether that data sharing is permissible and if it is something we want to do.  If it is, then when somebody's State pension is no longer being paid, maybe they should be taken off the electoral register.  To do this means some element of centralisation and, as Dr. Reidy has said, we do not want to strip functions from local government.  Some of these things with regard to moving addresses and so on cannot be done unless there is an overall system that different local authorities feed into.  Under such a system, it could be seen and understood that somebody has moved from Cork North-Central to Cork North-West, for example.  There has to be some element of this.  For that to happen, there has to be some element of data sharing.  It would be useful to engage with the Data Protection Commissioner on such questions.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about more vulnerable people not voting and lower turnout in disadvantaged communities and communities with higher numbers of young people.  This is where it is important to have a strong engagement and education function in the commission, including proper campaigns involving text messages to let people know that it is election day and where their polling place is.  We need campaigns on social media, where people will see them.  Those functions of the commission are important for precisely those reasons.</p></speech>

It is pretty good at running advertising campaigns and alerting people to the date and the content of referendums.  It is a question of using that existing expertise, broadening it out and ensuring the commission has a role to play there.  If we had regular advertisements before elections which showed the content of the ballot paper and how to vote down the ballot paper, that would help significantly.</p><p>These are all modest changes, but cumulatively they could be very important for our most vulnerable voters.</p><p> As for good practice in regard to postal voting, the UK recently undertook an expansion of postal voting, and while there have been problems with it, there is much we can learn from what it has been doing because it has been moving significantly into this space.  That is where the electoral commission would begin its investigations.  Postal voting is a crucial issue because if the proposal to enfranchise emigrant voters is passed in a referendum, those voters will have to vote by post.  There is significant potential, therefore, for this to have to be examined in great detail.</p><p> To pick up on Deputy Gould's point about preregistration in schools and the issue of school-leavers, this reinforces why local authorities are needed on the ground.  They need to continue with door-to-door canvassing.  It is mentioned in the Bill that local authorities might organise events to boost registration and they will have some autonomy in that area.  Those are important reasons and they reaffirm why we want some people to be on the ground.  The centralised rolling register will facilitate and improve data-sharing but the Bill is cautious in that it makes clear that the commission will have to engage with the Data Protection Commissioner and the Attorney General regarding how these matters will be managed and operated.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.656" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020200002#S00700"><p>I thank our two guests, Dr. Reidy and Dr. Suiter, for their insightful contributions.  They made a good point about non-voted expenditure versus voted expenditure and the committee will have to reflect on it in compiling our report on this legislation.  They were quite critical of the heavily prescribed nature of the structure and function of the commission and gave examples of other countries, including New Zealand, whose board has three members, and the Netherlands, where there are seven members.  Do our guests accept that within the structure proposed in the legislation, four people will be appointed through the Public Appointments Service and that, therefore, those independent laypeople will effectively have a majority on the commission?  If that is not acceptable, what do they propose in regard to the make-up of the commission?</p> <p>  Turning to the issue of the register, much of this will be teased out with the Data Protection Commissioner when she appears before the committee.</p><p>However, when I was asking questions of the Department on this last week, I asked about how the two systems, involving both the existing register and the use of PPS numbers to confirm that people are located at the locations specified, would be married.  It was stated that three attempts would be made to confirm whether somebody is at a particular location.  I am a little concerned about that answer because it could lead to an inaccurate register for a hell of a long time.  Does Dr. Reidy agree that if three attempts must be made to confirm whether somebody is at a location, they should be made within a prescribed timeframe, be it over a three-month period or a six-month period?  I am acutely conscious that if we are to do this exercise and improve our register, which both delegates have accepted has not been up to scratch in that it has been oversubscribed in many cases and undersubscribed in others, we really need to tackle the issue of people being registered at multiple locations and people who are not registered at all.  If we really are to tackle it, we will have to remove people after making a reasonable effort to check whether they are at a location.  Should this be within a prescribed timeframe?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.658" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Theresa Reidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020200002#T00200"><p>I will address the composition first.  We are not overly prescriptive in terms of whom we suggest should sit on the commission.  Our point is that a quite large board is envisaged.  As we all know, the larger the board, the greater the potential for long, protracted discussions and things not getting done.  When we looked around the world, we saw that there are many models for electoral commissions.  It is not as if there is one dominant model but many of the countries identified as having effective electoral administration tend to have smaller boards.</p> <p>  On the question on composition, it is legitimate to ask why the Clerk of the Seanad would be sitting on the electoral commission given that most aspects of Seanad elections are not related to national elections involving the entire electorate.  The same applies to the Ombudsman.  We tend to have a default number of people we put on all these boards.  We want to ask why we are putting these people on the boards because it does not happen in other countries.</p> <p>  On leadership, we have in Ireland a tendency to appoint members from the judicial community as chairpersons of boards but it is worth asking why they have to be judges.  What specific skill sets do judges have that would mean they should necessarily or always chair commissions?  Judges do not always chair commissions around the world.  Often, it is senior civil servants.  It is actually people from political backgrounds who are appointed to the positions.  We are asking questions rather than prescribing an alternative model.  Although we always appoint the Ombudsman, the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and the Clerk of the Seanad, we are evaluating whether it is necessarily the way we want to continue to do our business.</p> <p>  Specifically on the other question, I am very sorry but I do not have an answer.  This is exactly the kind of question that the electoral commission should determine in respect of the transition arrangements because these types of questions are quite technical.  The commission would need to draw on its own electoral expertise but also on what is international best practice for managing transition arrangements such that when voter registration processes are changed and new structures and systems are created, it can identify what can be learned from what has been done in other jurisdictions.  I do not know whether I can specify a number of months or years.  It would be random.</p></speech>

It changed its registration processes in the past decade.</p><p>It moved from family registration to individual registration and experienced many teething problems regarding that.  I know the Scottish section of the Electoral Commission in the UK, with which I have done work, was involved in that.  They are definitely a group of people one would want to engage with around the practicalities and modalities of what worked well.  Tying into some of the other bigger questions we had today, that is why one would have an electoral commission which would set the guidelines for all local authorities and be mandated for everyone.  One would therefore reduce the disparities and variation that have crept into electoral administration practice.</p></speech>

In my view, a person's personal public service number, PPSN, essentially dies with him or her.  Does Dr. Reidy agree that in the event of a person's death, it should be the case that he or she is automatically removed from the register through this modernisation process?  One of the things that upsets many families is not getting the polling card that comes in for an election, even though that does upset some people; it is often when somebody is called for jury duty.  That is obviously linked to the electoral register.  I am sure Dr. Reidy would agree the appropriate way to deal with this is by having a person's PPSN essentially removed automatically.</p></speech>

There are discussions in the later sections around the electoral register about data sharing with specific other Departments.  Death is obviously one area.  As I said, it is tentative because this would need significant checking with the Garda as to its legalities and operation.</p></speech>

I confirm I am in a very cold Leinster House today.  I will perhaps follow on from some of what Senator Cummins mentioned.  I totally agree with what he said about the cleaning up of our register of electors.  It is critical it is done in a sensitive as well as an efficient way.  With my background coming from private sector employment, it frustrates me no end that we do not have a streamlined database we can manage for all our services.</p> <p>  That really came into its own this year during the stay-and-spend initiative, which we had to do through the Revenue Commissioners because it had to be a tax-back process.  We did not have any easily identifiable, user-friendly database we could use to target all of our citizens who were aged over 18.  That, to me, is incredibly frustrating.  If, therefore, we can in any way use this Bill to help clean up our act in that regard, it would be a definite positive.  I quite like what Senator Cummins said about the linkage with a person's PPSN.  If that is going to be a person's footprint from a Government and State perspective in Ireland then it makes sense.</p> <p>  I agree also with an awful lot of what the witnesses said in their presentations, for which I thank them.  They have been insightful.  I agree, in particular, with the need to future-proof this Bill.  In response to some of our contributors today, Dr. Reidy has given some interesting ideas on how we can potentially do that.  I understand well the concerns around the political advertising element of things.  Our next pre-legislative scrutiny session will probably focus quite heavily on the advertising element.  I understand we are bringing representatives from some of the social media platforms before the committee.  It will certainly be interesting to hear what they have to say on this.  I do not want this to be case of self-regulation, however.  I do not believe that is the right way to deal with it.  I have, therefore, certainly taken on board what Dr. Reidy said in that regard.  She raised a valid point on the referendum advertisements.  I would love for us to make sure the electoral commission has the authority, ability and expertise to be able to run information campaigns.  It never ceases to amaze me how few people understand our single transferable vote system.  We could certainly do with some information campaigns around that as well.  I believe it was in 2019 that I stood in the by-election.  It is awful that I cannot remember.  We had a historically low turnout.</p><p>Information in advertisements encouraging people to vote and reminding them that election day is coming would have been helpful.  Advertisements are really helpful for referenda.</p><p> Regarding representation on the commission, I appreciate Dr. Reidy's comment that we need to rethink why we are putting people there rather than just doing it because that is what we have always done in Ireland.  One of the positives of living in Ireland but perhaps a constraint is the Constitution.  New Zealand, for example, which has been cited a few time, does not have a constitution.  Ireland, therefore, probably has a different perspective and that is why it is quite important that our commission should have members of the judicial system, judges, and clerks of both Houses of Parliament because they have useful experience and expertise in dealing with the Constitution.</p><p> If we were to give the electoral commission the power to run information campaigns, could it run an information campaign that encourages people to check whether their details are correct on the register of electors and if they are registered under one address?  I am thinking of young people, in particularly, who may hop from rental accommodation to rental accommodation and who may also be registered at their parent's address and might not be aware of that.  A campaign could encourage people to check the register before letters reminding them were sent and before we consider removing people from databases.  This would put the onus on them to check the register and ensure they are on the register  correctly and at the right address as there is so much duplication.  Do the witnesses think a campaign would be effective? </p></speech>

One would want to be careful about taking people off the electoral register.  I refer back to the previous point made about three times, which I had not heard about, and that was mentioned at the previous meeting with the Department.  Again, this is an issue that must be checked with the Data Protection Commissioner.  Almost everybody has some dealing with the State and, therefore, the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social Welfare or somebody has an address for people that is linked to their personal public service number, PPSN.  If it is deemed acceptable for a PPSN to be used, then the default position could be to use whatever address is registered for a PPSN then it would be the address for voting and if one wanted to change that, then one would do so.  So one could check one's address on the register to see if it is the current address-----</p></speech>

Obviously information campaigns could be run on how to vote and what a single transferable vote looks for.  We even get some misinformation about it in some of our newspapers sometimes in terms of how the counting actually works so that would be really interesting.</p> <p>  Of course, self-regulation is up.  Even Europe is now moving to co-regulation with the platforms.  Very much, when one talking to the platforms it is co-regulation.  Interesting, in terms of who is in charge, and this comes back to a previous question that we did not have time for, Australia has some of the most developed regulation with the media.  The Australian Electoral Commission, AEC, deals with a lot of the disinformation.  They got very involved after the Christchurch shootings in New Zealand and so on.  Regarding the composition of an electoral commission, obviously there are issues related to the Constitution and without doubt legal expertise is needed.  Whether the relationship with the Constitution is the primary function of the electoral commission and, therefore, it must be a judge rather than it might be a judge, I think is something that is maybe worthwhile questioning.</p></speech>

One is the regulation of platforms generally, and I am a strong advocate that they be treated as publishers not as platforms.  The second is the regulation of online advertisements in elections.  Dr. Suiter and Dr. Reidy have both referenced the BAI recommendations.  Will they give us a little information about those?  We can read the detail of those afterwards but what is the BAI is recommending on that that would be helpful?</p> <p>  Second, will they give us a little more information on the election and referendum research as distinct from the audits?

Its annual budget in a non-election year is equivalent to &euro;14 million and in an election year, it is equivalent to &euro;44 million.  We could be comparing apples with oranges because they could cover many of the costs our local authorities cover in an election year.  However &euro;14 million in a non-election year is quite a lot of money when compared with what we are allocating.  I am just giving that by way of information because Dr. Reidy raised it.</p> <p>  Finally, there was a question about compulsory voting.  If it was answered and I was not listening then the witnesses should ignore it but if not I would appreciate it if they responded because it is a good question.  I think it was asked by Senator Fitzpatrick.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.686" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jane Suiter" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020200002#W01400"><p>I will just answer on the BAI.  Dr. Reidy has done some work on compulsory voting so I will leave that to her.  The BAI has said the controls should be media neutral, unless one has transparency mechanisms for a particular medium.  If one is going to allow online political advertising then one must allow it on linear media such as radio and television.  To do otherwise is problematic.  It used to be that linear broadcasting services were the only place where someone could advertise but now if they are the only place singled out for prohibition, despite it being allowed online, then it is problematic not just for the broadcasters but also in terms of what is allowed.  It must also be remembered that online they can actually have a higher impact in some ways because of their ability to micro-target.  Those were the BAI's points.</p> <p>  On the funding, it is really interesting that it is &euro;14 million.  What I would wonder about is why it is &euro;1.7 million or whatever it was.  One might ask what is that to pay to have done.  Even having the budget so fixed in advance speaks again to this kind of control and lack of flexibility for the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.687" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Theresa Reidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020200002#W01500"><p>On the election and referendum research, we have been in before talking about how there should be research conducted at every election and referendum.  At a bare minimum it should be done at every general election, because throughout Europe and many of the advanced industrial democracies, it is quite standard that research is conducted on why people vote, why people did not, their experiences of the campaign, what information they acquired and when they decided to vote.  This information is in essential in informing policy development on the conduct and management of elections.</p><p>It is also vital for sharing with all political parties and candidates so that they can understand it.  We are aware that a lot of political parties are doing this research by themselves at the moment.  One of the additional advantages of involving the electoral commission is that this is non-partisan research done by an independent commission and done up to international academic standards, which must meet the standards of the international studies to which all of this research contributes.  It is also shared with everybody, including all the political parties and civil society organisations.  It can inform the strategies of the individual parties and candidates and it can inform policy.  There are a lot of advantages to conducting impartial, independent research and ensuring that it can be shared widely.</p><p> If I may, I will make an academic point.  With referendums, for example, and because of Ireland leading the way in deliberative democracy, a lot of things have happened in Ireland that have been of interest to the global research and policy communities.  We have not necessarily had the data after these events to be able to share those experiences.  This has been a real limitation with regard to the marriage referendum and the abortion referendum.  We did some small research but it was of a very limited nature because we do not have an automatic research function, which is in most other advanced industrial democracies.  It is very important to make the point that it would be to the advantage and benefit of everybody in the political system and it would reduce costs and barriers for political parties.</p></speech>

We have dealt quite extensively with all the implications of the different tools within a campaign.  Many of them become less significant when we have a ban on corporate donations because the potential for advertising to go the way of the United States of America is perhaps less important, although still significant.</p> <p>  The Minister has indicated, in writing, to all the general secretaries of different parties his desire to see greater transparency around the two jurisdictions on the island and the possibility of donations on one side that are not permitted on the other side.  Are there any international examples of where political parties operate in different jurisdictions that have different rules as a result?  Are there any models that would allow us or future parties to operate on both sides of the Border and at the same time provide transparency?  We saw the case where &euro;4 million was allowed to be donated on one side of the island but there is a &euro;100 limit for a corporate donation on the other side of the island.  I do not ask the witnesses to get into the political long grass in this but to keep it in the bigger picture.</p></speech>

If I was to direct the Deputy anywhere, it would be to look at the European party families that operate in the European Parliament.  They have funding mechanisms that operate across jurisdictions.  This might be a starting place, but for political parties that operate at multiple levels.  I am sorry to not have a more useful answer for the Deputy.</p></speech>

That was on compulsory voting, which was also raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  Very briefly, compulsory voting is in place in a small number of European countries and it is most notably used in Australia.  It means there are very high levels of turnout and compliance is important.  In general, the view is that participation should be voluntary.  In my view, I believe we should be looking at ways of facilitating voters before we go down the road of making it compulsory.</p> <p>  There is a philosophical reason behind compulsory voting, which is that the views of all citizens should be reflected in the political system before us.  In a lot of European countries we have tended to emphasise candidacy in relation to that point.  We have, for example, looked at gender quotas and steps to address bringing people from minority backgrounds into politics.</p><p>Our emphasis has been on the supply side, whereas countries that have compulsory voting get at that in a different way in that they ensure all voters vote.  In that way, one might get a political system that reflects the diversity of societies.  If one looks at Australia, that is not necessarily what has happened in its politics.  It may be more diverse than it is in Ireland but it is not fully diverse.  There is a philosophical argument behind this that can be teased out.  We have tended to emphasise candidacy, while other countries have opted for compulsory voting.  There is definitely something to be said for us looking at facilitation and helping voters before we go down the road of compulsion.  If we were to go down the road of compulsory voting, we would have to be absolutely certain we could facilitate all voters.  </p><p> Was the second question in regard to political advertising?</p></speech>

Before asking it, I want to thank Dr. Suiter and Dr. Reidy for their engagement with us today.  We will not have an opportunity to engage with them directly outside of this meeting so I might forward some supplementary questions to them.  If they could facilitate me, I would appreciate it.</p> <p>  I would welcome a comment from the witnesses on former political party members being members of the commission.  It is suggested and provided for in the heads of the Bill that members of the commission cannot be sitting Oireachtas Members but when Members retire their political affiliations do not cease and their associations certainly do not.  I would like a comment from the witnesses on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.698" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jane Suiter" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020200002#Y00500"><p>In lots of places, former political members are involved.  The expectation is that they would not be acting in a particularly partisan manner and they would just be one among many.  The type of experience and expertise that they have would be very useful to a commission.  I would not like to rule out the involvement of former civil servants, public servants or politicians.</p></speech>

It is quite common around the world to have people from political parties on commissions.  There are extensive provisions in the Bill around the removal of a person should there be dissatisfaction in regard to how he or she is behaving.  I will leave the question from Senator Fitzpatrick to Dr. Suiter, who, I think, mentioned the issue earlier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.700" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jane Suiter" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021020200002#Y00700"><p>In regard to electoral commissions, as in the case of Australia and Canada, they are generally the bodies that oversee political and issue-based misinformation and advertising.  Advertising and information provision prior to elections and referendums is a crucial part of the process.  If this role was to be removed from the commission and put into some other general regulation, it would become problematic.  One would also be wondering when that would be done and about the specific electoral impacts.  We are concerned about issues such as Covid misinformation, but when it comes to misinformation that is related to voting, referendums and elections, it is very serious.  To take that away from the electoral commission would hobble it and would not allow it to fulfil all of its functions.  Again, I point to Australia.  Earlier, Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the second part of the committee's discussions about platform regulations.</p><p>I am sure the committee will have looked at some of the measures the Australians have taken to try to protect their information environment.  Again, it is their electoral commission that leads on this.  It is not necessary and I would not die on this cross on this, but, overall, the electoral commission is probably the most appropriate place for this legislation to be.</p></speech>

Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identified person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely, outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members that they are allowed to participate in this meeting only if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  In this regard I also ask all members, prior to making their contributions to the meeting, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  For the information of anyone watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chairman, and the staff essential to the running to the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances of Covid and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everyone to bear with us should any technical issues arise. </p> <p>  I call Mr. Walsh, TII, to make his opening statement and he has five minutes.</p></speech>

I understand the committee wishes to discuss the NDP, having regard to Review to Renew, the public consultation.  Before I report to the committee on progress in the delivery of the elements of the NDP that TII is responsible for, I will briefly describe the duties assigned to TII through legislation.  The National Roads Authority, NRA, operating as TII since 2015, was established under the Roads Act 1993.  It is the general duty of the authority to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads.  In 2015, the NRA was merged with the Rail Procurement Agency, RPA, and the Roads Act 2015 added the function of securing the provision of, or providing, such light railway and metro railway infrastructure as may be determined by the NTA.  I make the distinction between these two responsibilities of TII to explain why I will provide information to the committee today on national roads projects but that for the MetroLink and Luas light rail projects for which TII is the sponsoring agency I will defer to the NTA as the approving authority.</p><p> The national road network is 5,400 km in length, which is approximately 6% of the public road network, but it carries 50% of all traffic and 90% of all goods transported.  TII works in partnership with the 31 local authorities, which are roads authorities, to fulfil its duties and the arrangements include 11 national roads offices funded by TII and staffed by the local authorities.  In 2018, the NDP mandated the progression of 43 major projects that would address deficiencies in the national road network across 29 local authorities.  Since then, three have been completed and a further two have been delivered through a series of minor projects.  For the remaining 38 projects I have provided the committee with a booklet that describes each project and gives an update on the progress achieved to date.</p><p> The delivery of national road projects is progressing well for the 12 projects that had planning approval in place at the commencement of the plan.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of staff in the Department of Transport, TII, local authorities, national roads offices and civil engineering designers and contractors in achieving this progress.  During the past year, contractors have produced and adhered to standard operating procedures that have created and maintained safe working environments.  Their achievements in this regard allowed for road construction to recommence on 18 May after a seven-week shutdown.  Productivity has been impaired but very significant progress has been achieved, and continues, on these critical transport infrastructure projects.</p><p> On the matter of challenges to progress, progression of projects through the planning approval process has become slower in recent years.  The time spent in the planning process and the judicial review process has extended the delivery timeline for some projects by several years.  The restrictions required to combat the spread of Covid-19 have further interrupted the planning and judicial processes.</p><p> I refer to TII&rsquo;s engagement with the Review to Renew consultation.  In response to a request from the Department of Transport, TII made a comprehensive submission in December 2020.  The submission included all national road projects in the current NDP.  In addition, TII requested that consideration be given to ten projects of regional importance, six bus priority projects which would be developed on the national primary radial roads in the greater Dublin area and four programmes of works to be focused on the national secondary road network.  TII has also proposed the development of a national cycleway network to safely connect urban areas.</p><p> Finally, TII has recommended four actions by Government to assist in the delivery of a new NDP.  They are a commitment to a steady programme of projects, multi-annual funding commitments for steady state investment and projects, measures to achieve shorter timelines for planning and regulatory approvals including faster delivery of judgements in judicial reviews and an allocation of reasonable levels of resourcing to public sector bodies with responsibilities for implementation and statutory and regulatory approval.</p><p>I am happy to take questions from members and if I do not have information immediately to hand relating to a question, I will revert back to the committee in writing.  I thank the members for their attention. </p></speech>

I understand that the committee wishes to focus on the NDP review having regard to Review to Renew, the public consultation element of the plan.  To assist me in dealing with the committee's subsequent questions, I am joined by Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO with the authority.</p> <p>The NTA remit is primarily concerned with the planning, development and funding of sustainable transport modes, that is, public transport, cycling and walking.  At a national level, the NTA has responsibility for securing the provision of bus and rail services.  This includes the provision of subsidised services through directly awarded contracts with Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, and publicly tendered contracts for bus services across the State with a number of operators.  The authority is also responsible for light rail services, which we procure jointly with TII.</p> <p>  The NTA regulates and licenses public bus passenger services, which operate without subsidy from the State.  We also manage the rural transport programme, Local Link, on behalf of the Department of Transport.  The authority also regulates the provision of small public service vehicle services.</p> <p>  The authority manages the capital investment programme for public transport, cycling and walking in the greater Dublin area and funds the transport operators and local authorities for approved projects.  It also manages a similar capital investment programme for the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford on behalf of the Department of Transport and we manage the national accessibility programme.</p> <p>  Within the greater Dublin area, the NTA has a greater depth of functions.  The authority's role covers not only public transport capital investment and provision of services but also securing greater integration between land use and transport planning.  The authority's statutory Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035 sets out the key transport projects that are required to be delivered to provide for the growth in travel demand by sustainable modes.  This strategy is required by statute to be renewed every six years and the first review of the strategy has been commenced by the authority.  This strategy must align with all current Government policy on sustainability and climate action.</p> <p>  The NTA has worked in partnership with a number of local authorities in Ireland's cities to prepare transport-related strategies or implement transport-related projects.  The Galway transport strategy was developed by Galway City Council and Galway County Council in partnership with the authority.  The transport strategy for the Cork metropolitan area was completed by the NTA in partnership with the relevant Cork local authorities.  The transport strategies for the metropolitan areas of Limerick and Shannon, and separately Waterford, are under development and are due to be completed later this year.  It is our view that investment in transport projects in the metropolitan areas should be guided by Government policy and the recommendations in the relevant transport strategy.</p> <p>  The National Development Plan 2018&ndash;2027 includes significant developments such as the BusConnects programme, the MetroLink and a DART expansion programme, as well as other important public transport, walking and cycling projects that will assist in meeting the demand for sustainable transport and our obligations to reduce carbon emissions.  These projects continue to be relevant to meet the Government&rsquo;s long-term overarching strategy to make Ireland a better country for us all.</p> <p>  Project Ireland 2040 is underpinned by a shared set of goals or national strategic outcomes, NSOs, for every community across the country.  The work of the NTA supports all NSOs but, in particular, compact growth, enhanced regional accessibility, strengthened rural economies and communities, sustainable mobility and transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient society.</p> <p>  The national climate policy position establishes the national objective of achieving a transition to a competitive, low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  The provision of a significant investment plan for sustainable transport is a key objective in meeting that goal.  Public transport capital infrastructure is very largely used for the provision of State subvented public transport services and, therefore, there is a strong link between expanded infrastructure investment and an increased need for more current funding for the provision of additional services using that infrastructure.  It will be a particular priority, in line with the Department of Transport's strategic investment framework for land transport, SIFLT, analysis, to reverse escalating congestion problems to secure a significant improvement in transport service to the public.</p><p> The authority has commenced a number of sustainable transport projects to be delivered as part of the current NDP across the five cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford to provide additional sustainable travel options to complement increased capacity and faster high-quality public transport in the cities.  These will include traffic management, bus priority and other smarter travel projects, along with new urban cycling and walking routes to allow transport infrastructure to function more effectively and relieve congestion.</p><p> The authority recognises that additional funding beyond that set out in the current NDP is required to meet the objectives of the transport strategies, those that are developed and those in development.  However, those strategies have a longer timeframe than that envisaged by the NDP review.  The authority looks forward to supporting the Department of Transport in assessing any additional sustainable transport projects to be included in the NDP review.</p><p> I am happy to answer any queries that arise.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Graham and Mr. Walsh for their opening statements.  I have a great deal to say to both of them, but it is probably important that I commence with my questions to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, regarding the review of the national development plan.</p> <p>  I represent the constituency of Cork East, which is a large geographical area in Cork county.  From the point of view of the current national development plan, we were very badly let down in terms of the level of investment in Cork county as a whole and in the focus it received when this document was being drawn up.  I say this in the context that the national development plan excludes the upgrade of the N25 road between Cork city and Waterford city.  I am currently dealing with serious congestion issues at Castlemartyr village in east Cork and at Killeagh, where in excess of 20,000 vehicles per day are travelling down the main streets, in particular in Castlemartyr village, and multiple metres of tailbacks running out of that village.  This needs to be addressed.  This should have been done long ago and it is now a major political priority for me.  It is a significant project that needs to happen under the review of the NDP.  It should be included as a white box scheme when the new national development plan is being finalised.</p> <p>  From the perspective of the transport of goods and services, the Rosslare connection is becoming increasingly important for goods and services heading to the Continent via Rosslare to Europe.  We must prioritise the upgrade of the corridor along the south of the country.  In terms of economic development, Waterford county and some parts of east Cork, in particular Youghal, are economically disadvantaged areas.  Prioritising this particular region of Ireland should be more important than some of the projects TII has prioritised up to now.  There has been significant investment in the constituencies of Wexford while projects such as the upgrade of the N25 at Castlemartyr and Killeagh and the north ring road in Cork were shelved.  This is not good enough.  We must work to address these issues as soon as possible.  These are critically important projects.  I would like increased focus on Cork county.  It is deserving of that focus.</p> <p>  Another issue worth highlighting is the enormous efforts of Cork County Council, one of the largest local authorities in the country, in regard to the upgrade of the road on and off Cobh island - Great Island - where the connecting road infrastructure is below average.  Although there is a rail connection and an excellent bus service, private and public, it cannot be denied that road access to Cobh is significantly underdeveloped and over capacity.   It is being restrained by very old road infrastructure, particularly the bridge at Belvelly.  Unfortunately, the local authority is not in a position to pay for the upgrade of that road which is expected to come in at approximately &euro;100 million.  The council is seeking the reclassification of this road as a national road.  The top priorities in Cork for the local authority from a roads point of view is the addressing of these issues, which are matters for TII.  They cannot be done by the local authority because of the cost.</p><p>Even if one looks at the schemes that are available in terms of giving funding to local authorities to deal with an issue such as a new bridge at Belvelly and upgrading the Cobh access road, the schemes that are usually available come in at around &euro;60 million to &euro;100 million for the entire country, but that individual scheme will require about &euro;100 million overall.  It shows there is a lot of scope for improvement in terms of the interaction between Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and local authorities where there is a requirement for new national roads or roads classification, which is quite important.</p><p> I thank Ms Graham for her attendance.  She is probably highly aware of who I am at this point from my work on raising the issues in regard to Expressway inadequacies and the National Transport Authority&rsquo;s role in regard to subsidised bus routes and how the pricing structures are completely out of balance, which I highlighted in particular with reference to Youghal town some time ago through Deputy MacSharry.  I have to say I am not satisfied with the current subsidised bus routes under the control of the NTA in Cork.  I am thinking of areas like the Jack Lynch tunnel and the south ring road in Cork, densely populated areas around Mahon, Cork University Hospital and the universities, for example, and the employment hubs at Ringaskiddy, and how they are connected up to major residential towns throughout County Cork.  It has to be said that very little is being done to address the particular opportunity to cut down on traffic congestion on the South Ring Road by allowing metropolitan areas like Carrigtwohill, Glounthaune, Midleton and Fermoy, and perhaps Mitchelstown as well, to use public transport services to access parts of the Cork South-Central constituency at places like Mahon Point and other employment hubs, retail hubs and residential hubs, as well as education.  That is a very important issue in Cork that has not been addressed and it is causing havoc on the South Ring Road.</p><p> The consequence, of course, is that TII is spending an extraordinarily large amount of money on upgrading the Dunkettle interchange and the Jack Lynch tunnel.  We need to see an integrated transport service, which is important.  Otherwise, we will only end up in a similar situation in another two decades when the Dunkettle interchange is finally completed, which will be a good thing for the county, but it could be over capacity at some point in the future.  I am strongly of the view that we have to prioritise this.</p><p> With regard to other projects that need consideration from the NTA, one is expanding the green zone fare area around Cork County.  Cork is the second largest city in the Republic.</p></speech>

This is one important question and I will finish on this.  I ask Ms Graham whether the NTA has any intention of expanding the green zone area.

Has the NTA plans to expand the green zone fare area in Cork and could Ms Graham confirm that?</p></speech>

As part of that, we can consider the appropriate fares associated with that.</p> <p>  At this stage, it is not possible to reduce any of our fares in any location around the country because of the impact of Covid on our fare revenue.  As a result, the Government has had to put significant additional funding into our subsidised services in order to keep them going.  At this time, it is not appropriate to reduce fares in any location but we can consider them as part of the BusConnects network review, which will be starting very shortly.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Connor in his narrative painted a picture that there is nothing happening in the south west, but the contrary is the reality.  The purpose of our meeting today is to ensure that the investment in the regions continues.  Never before have we seen the need for investment in the regions outside Dublin.  Both Deputy O'Connor and I share an ambition, speaking as Corkonians, to recognise the importance of Cork as a counterbalance to Dublin.  This is my first question to both witnesses.  In the context of the counterbalancing, we have heard witnesses refer to the cities beyond Dublin.  Can we take it that, as part of the review, the counterbalance will be a strong overarching theme to promote equality and opportunity?</p><p>My concern is that the reshaping or review of the national development plan could become a reconfiguration.  This may mean a reduction in the level of investment in the regions.  I want to ask our witnesses about that in terms of the overarching philosophy and policy around investment in the regions.</p><p>I have a specific request in the context of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I believe that he should be invited to the committee in the context of this review.  I welcome the extension to 19 February.  I believe it should be longer, to be honest.  I do not know that the commitment is necessarily in place in the minds of people.</p><p>Engineers Ireland has made a substantive submission.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, is talking about the reshaping of the review in the context of climate change and where we are today <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the pandemic, with commutability having changed and the whole issue around working from home.  In the context of working from home, wherein lie the views of TII and the National Transport Authority with regard to more people working from home <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the transport network and the proposed reconfiguration of our road network?</p><p>The Minister, Deputy McGrath, said:</p> <blockquote> 	Ireland cannot continue with 'development as usual' without giving due consideration to climate-associated risks. We need to ensure that we have the capacity to adapt and we must take an integrated approach, including climate change adaption at every stage in our development plan. </blockquote> <p>That is why I believe it is important that we have the Minister in.</p><p>My final comment resonates around Engineers Ireland, the professional body that put in a review.  It referred to avoiding the mistakes of the past and systematically prioritising target projects with the greatest impact for society.  Will our witnesses say what they see as being the targeted projects from the south-west perspective that would have a greater targeted impact for us in the region?</p><p>My thanks to Ms Graham and her team for organising the briefing for us on the Cork metropolitan strategy.  I believe it has a significant journey to take yet but it has got off to a good start.  There is now a level of engagement that was not in place previously.  I commend Ms Graham on her role in driving that.  I hope that we can see the synergy between Cork City Council and Cork County Council working to benefit all of us.  If we are to create a counterbalance, then we need a strong Cork city.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.724" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021020200002#H00100"><p>From the NTA's perspective, we would always be trying to ensure there is a counterbalance to Dublin.  When the previous national development plan was being created, we had two key strategies in place, namely, the Dublin strategy and the Galway strategy.  From those, a number of projects had already been identified.  We were not in a position to put forward at that stage any projects for Cork except BusConnects because we knew that would be coming down the track.  However, we now have a strategy in place and we know the types of projects required in Cork and in Galway city.  We also know the approximate expenditure required for those.  We will also know more in terms of Limerick and Waterford.  We are in a better position to put forward the public transport infrastructure projects for the regional cities as well as for Dublin.  These will act as a counterbalance.  We have no issue with focusing only on the Dublin region.  To meet the national development plan and Project Ireland 2040 goals, there is a requirement to counterbalance that with investment in the regional cities as well and not only in the cities but in the towns and villages, but that would be primarily around bus infrastructure and some rail infrastructure.  That is very important to us.</p> <p>  On people working from home, we will certainly set out the public transport networks to be robust regardless of the number of people who are working from home.  Particularly with the bus service network, it can be dialled up or down depending on the level of demand.  The network itself, in the context of connections and the places it serves, should remain robust.  We certainly have that in place in Dublin.  By means of the work to assess the BusConnects for Cork, we hope to establish what will be the appropriate network for the city for the next 20 years effectively.  When the network is established, it is then just a case of increasing on reducing services on the basis of travel demand.</p></speech>

The Chairman asked us to confirm that earlier.</p> <p>  In terms of regional development and the projects that might support that from a TII perspective, the national road projects contained in the current NDP all support regional development.  There is a list of 12 in the inter-urban roads category.  With the possible exception of the M7 in Kildare, they all address connectivity to the regions.  There is significant emphasis on enhanced regional accessibility in all our projects.  The second list of eight projects relates to accessibility to the northwest.  The emphasis within the current NDP is very much one that produces enhanced regional accessibility and identifies the areas that did not get the benefit of connectivity in the previous plan.  We would see a continued need to support the development of urban areas outside Dublin by enhancing the connectivity between them and Dublin - the largest market in the country.  I hope that answers the question.  We do not choose any one of them above another.  In terms of the assessment of projects, they are assessed against the performance under the national strategic outcomes and enhanced regional accessibility is a very strong one for us.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about our views on people working from home.  It is probably too early to have a clear view on it but the need for movement of freight and movement for business purposes exists.  The provision of a safe and efficient national road network to meet that need is one that is a priority for us.  Commuting has always placed a demand on the network.</p><p>Whether that demand spreads out in time over a day, changes in terms of days of the week or sees a reduction in some of the more intense periods, it is very early and difficult to say.  The overall number of trips is likely to be the same.  That is my view at the moment.  In terms of research, there is nothing definitive as yet.  I do not know whether I have answered all of the questions.</p></speech>

We have received documentation from TII.  Reference was made to a number of priorities that have been submitted to the NDP review.  I do not know whether those priorities are contained in the document TII sent to us.  If not, it would be useful to see those priorities, if possible.</p> <p>  In Mr. Walsh's opinion, what has changed in terms of the assessment and prioritisation of projects in the context of the NDP review?  I get a sense that there is a commitment in the programme for Government to shift the focus away from roads infrastructure, for example, towards public transport.  Is this something that has been emphasised to TII?  What does Mr. Walsh see as new about this review?</p></speech>

The Department has asked that we indicate that it will make all the submissions available when it has them and that they should not be handed out piecemeal from each of the agencies.  I do not mean to avoid the Deputy's question.  The document will be in the public domain.</p></speech>

There are two specific changes, as I see it, in respect of the projects in the review.  One relates to climate action.  There is a requirement to achieve significant performance in terms of carbon reduction.  The performance of projects in that regard will be influential in terms of their selection for delivery.  That is my opinion.  Obviously, they will go to the Department of Transport and also to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  In terms of the national road network, the other change for us relates to vulnerable road users.  We have just concluded the last road safety strategy.  Whereas fatalities on the network are down and the performance has been quite good overall, fatalities among vulnerable road users are up through the period of the previous strategy.  This comes at a time when we are heading into a period when active travel is very much being encouraged.  People around my age and probably younger are getting on electric bikes and going out on the network.  We are going to have to address that in a very proactive way in our projects.  It may not change the specific nominated projects but the manner in which we develop the designs will have to address vulnerable road users in a way that we had not really addressed them previously.</p></speech>

A number of projects are highlighted as being at different stages of development.  I represent Meath East and the N2 Rath roundabout to Kilmoon Cross scheme is a project that I have been highlighting since my time as a councillor.  The case for a Slane bypass is compelling.  The M50 to Clonee upgrade is another project that makes the case for itself.  I lend my voice to supporting all of those projects.  One does not have to see any AA Roadwatch update to know about those individual bottlenecks and issues.</p><p>I again thank Mr. Walsh for the presentation.</p><p> Could I ask Ms Graham the same question in terms of the shift in priority or emphasis following the review of the development plan?  I am interested in particular about how it relates to the assessment of projects and what the priorities are.  I thank the NTA for its presentation to Meath County Council yesterday, which I attended.  As Ms Graham is aware, I have a particular interest in the Navan rail project.  We recently saw the report on the western rail corridor.  Communities in those areas are really disappointed that another review does not match their aspirations for investment in rail for public transport and freight transport.  Will there be a step change with this review on public transport, including rail transport?</p></speech>

Carbon reduction is certainly going to be a key aspect in terms of assessment.  The assessment will not be done by the NTA or TII, it will be done by the Department of Transport and the Government.</p></speech>

But that is more of a later stage in the development of a project.  In terms of what we will be putting forward, from our point of view we want to see projects that are going to give the greatest return for the State in terms of cost versus benefits.  That would include carbon emissions benefits as well.  It is not just focusing on Dublin but also on the regional cities and rural towns as well.</p> <p>  Our responsibility in terms of rail infrastructure is only around the greater Dublin area.  We have no responsibility for any improvements to rail infrastructure beyond that area.  As the Deputy is aware, we are looking at the Navan rail line as part of the review of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  That work has commenced with AECOM.  In terms of putting forward a delivery, what we would like to do is achieve all the transport strategies and all the projects outlined in them for the various areas, but in terms of prioritisation it is really about getting the best return.  I refer to what gives the best coverage in terms of public transport networks for the least amount of money in the shortest possible time, or within the time period of the NTP.  That is as much as we can say at this stage in terms of the projects.</p></speech>

I have a few questions that I would like to put to Ms Graham of the National Transport Authority and then I would like to ask some additional questions of Mr. Walsh of Transport Infrastructure Ireland.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Graham for her engagement with us today.  Quite a serious issue developed in County Clare overnight.  We heard that a well used and well supported bus route in east Clare is being pulled.  The route 345 Scariff to Limerick service is being overhauled and enhanced, but along with that enhancement the NTA has directed that an add-on service provided up to 3 January on Saturdays to Tulla, Bodyke, O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s Mills and Broadford, the four largest villages in east Clare, will not continue.  In the Government's July jobs stimulus, the plan was to enhance rural transport, and there has been investment</p><p>There was good news today for west Clare, where the NTA and Local Link will enhance Bus &Eacute;ireann routes in terms of frequency.  </p><p> I ask Ms Graham, as the person at the helm of the NTA, to re-examine the service that people in Tulla, Bodyke, O'Callaghan's Mills and Broadford have enjoyed.  I ask her to intervene in this.  I have spent the morning on the telephone to management of Bus &Eacute;ireann in the region.  They are very clear that they would run the service if it was authorised by the NTA.  Could Ms Graham address that matter if she has knowledge of it?</p></speech>

I would appreciate that.  It is something that needs to be addressed very quickly.  A lot of misinformation is circulating.  People want to know that the service will continue.  Perhaps a logical way of applying the service in east Clare would be through Local Link.  That is what is happening very successfully in west Clare.</p> <p>  My next number of questions are for Mr. Walsh of TII.  I refer to the Limerick northern distributor road.  It was not referred to in the presentation pack he circulated to Deputies yesterday.  It is a critical project north of Limerick city to south-east Clare.  Phase 1 runs from Coonagh to Knockalisheen and Meelick.  It is not a very long road and would provide for enhanced pedestrian links and cycling ways.  The project has stalled.  My understanding is that it is currently on the desk of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and needs to move off that in terms of having a contractor carry out works on the ground.  Some &euro;58 million is the overall project cost and a lot of money has been spent to this point in terms of surveys and reports.  Even the spur of the road has started at the Coonagh roundabout near Tesco.  A lot has been done.  For the project to go back to review stage at this point would only serve to perpetuate the uncertainty that landowners and homeowners in the area have encountered from many years. </p> <p>  Before Mr. Walsh responds, I should add that despite the problems phase 1 has faced heretofore it is anticipated in the region.  Phase 2 is more disputed in that its route line dissects the village of Parteen in half, something I have huge reservations about.  Another proportion of the road goes through floodplains in Cloonlara.  As an overall project, it is good.  The route line of phase 2 is not so good.  Phase 1, which should have been completed last September, has stalled.  Can Mr. Walsh tell us whether there are any other barriers or impediments preventing the project from proceeding?  I ask him to update us on the status of the Killaloe bypass.</p></speech>

As such, it does not come under our responsibility in TII.  I am afraid I cannot illuminate the situation.  I will have to come back to the Deputy on the Killaloe bypass.  I am happy to provide an update to him.  I do not have the information to hand.</p></speech>

It is an international airport.  It, like all other airports, is currently in the doldrums, but it is a vital piece of infrastructure.  In the event of an accident at Shannon Airport, there is only one lane of traffic in and out of it.  The extension would provide dual carriageway capacity to the door of the airport.  Does Mr. Walsh have any update on that today?  Could he furnish me with one after this meeting?</p></speech>

I refer to a parochial issue, namely, Bunratty on the N18 dual carriageway.  The Bunratty local development committee has been awarded Government funding to develop some fabulous trails.  It is, as the committee probably well knows, a magnet for tourism.  The trails have to be started and completed by a certain deadline because the community is adjacent to the dual carriageway.  There is a need for sanction and approval from TII.  The development committee has been passed from pillar to post over the past number of weeks.</p><p>I ask Mr Walsh, this evening or tomorrow, to intervene in this case to allow this fabulous amenity to be completed and not to have really good positive public money washed aside because deadlines cannot be met.  </p></speech>

From our perspective, the entire concern is safety.  That will be the element of the project that will be examined, and it will be done so quickly.  We will give a quick response to it.  As I have said, it is a high-speed road at that location and our primary concern is the safety of all road users.  We will not hang around.  We received the submission in December.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh outlined various projects in his presentation.  On page 30, he speaks about the N20.  He will probably be aware that it is a project that is very close to my heart.  I have campaigned for it for many years.  I would like to see "M20/N20" rather than just "N20".  There has been a period of public consultation on it.  I have been critical that the public consultation to date has not covered the proper modelling.  No modelling has been done around safety, costs or travel times.  Eight routes were proposed, some of which were upgrades to the existing routes and others that were new routes, including, certainly, from Charleville to Limerick, a maze of routes, many of which make no sense.</p> <p>  My understanding is that the consultation was a non-statutory public consultation.  I believe a further consultation is required after the modelling has been done on the routes in respect of safety, travel times and cost, because it created a huge degree of confusion among people living along the routes, both in terms of road and rail.  Three rail routes were proposed.  Irish Rail has already completed a proposal and is putting in a submission on the upgrading of Limerick Junction to Limerick with a second rail line.  Both of the other two proposed routes are in private ownership, one of which crosses virgin territory from Bruree to Killonan, and the other goes along an old line.  I ask for a commitment from the TII that there will be another period of public consultation on the M20.  I ask Mr. Walsh to go through that.  A huge degree of confusion has been created because the modelling was not done prior to the routes being put out for consultation.</p></speech>

On the issue of the public consultation and the process, it is a prescribed process.  It requires that all options are considered.  That is what the project team is meticulously doing.  There is not any assessment put out into the public domain, seeking input from the public, at the time of going through the initial route options.  When we talk about non-statutory consultation, as part of the normal process of projects, we conduct two non-statutory consultations.</p><p>One is around the route options and then a further one comes later, after the preferred route is selected.  There will be further non-statutory consultation.  There will also be a statutory consultation process when the project is submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In terms of the analysis of the benefits, costs and so on-----</p></speech>

All I am asking is that TII would consult with the design office of Limerick City and County Council.  Routes were put forward but the next public consultation will be on a selected route, a road that is possibly complemented by rail.  That appears to me to be an incomplete process.  Why were routes put out for consultation and considered under certain criteria but not under the key criteria of cost, safety and travel times?  That created an enormous degree of confusion.  There were two routes from Cork to a point just outside Buttevant and around eight routes from Buttevant to Limerick, which created a huge degree of confusion and anxiety.  Many of those routes will not get through the modelling process and if that is the case, why put them out for consultation at all?  Ultimately the council reports to TII.  I ask that TII would discuss this with the council and encourage it to engage in a further public consultation process when modelling is done on safety, costs and travel times.  Will TII commit to doing that?</p></speech>

My next question is for Ms. Graham of the NTA.  There are new routes in operation now and I welcome new routes like the 323 and the 345, particularly the former serving Birdhill, which I sought.  In more recent times, the X12 Limerick to Dublin Expressway route, which served Nenagh, Roscrea, Portlaoise, the University of Limerick and many locations outside Limerick city, including Castletroy, was discontinued on 29 January.  The NTA's letter to this committee and to me as a Deputy for the Limerick City constituency states that there are sufficient services along the route.  However, only one provider on the route, JJ Kavanagh &amp;amp; Sons, which is providing a good service, is serving Roscrea, Nenagh and Portlaoise.  The other providers are not serving those places but are providing a direct service between Dublin and Limerick.  Why did the NTA not ask Bus &Eacute;ireann to defer decisions on its Expressway routes until after the Covid-19 pandemic?  Certainly decisions regarding Cork and Galway have been deferred.  Those routes are continuing to operate, albeit at a reduced level because of Covid-19.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.757" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021020200002#N00500"><p>First, I wish to make clear that the decision of Bus &Eacute;ireann was a commercial one as it related to its Expressway service, which is operated on a commercial basis.  Bus &Eacute;ireann made a decision in September to alter or withdraw certain services and that decision has now been implemented across a number of services, including the X12.  The role of the NTA is to assess the services that remain and to determine whether there is a public service obligation to put in additional services associated with the towns that have experienced a reduced service or no service at all.  In the assessment we carried out, we determined that along the X12 route, which served Nenagh, Roscrea and Portlaoise, there are sufficient services remaining in those towns such that there is no public service obligation for us to put in additional services.  Regarding the other routes, namely, the X20 and the X8, we determined that a public service obligation remained for certain locations.</p><p>In those cases, we asked Bus &Eacute;ireann to retain a smaller number of services on those routes to fulfil the public service obligation until such time as there is either another operator operating on a commercial basis or we are in a position to tender out for a number of services to provide the alternative, which possibly will be the case for the X8.  For the X12, our assessment is that the remaining services fulfil the public service obligation.  It will not match the service level that was in place before Expressway pulled out but it certainly means that the towns remain served by connections.</p></speech>

It went out to public consultation in Limerick a number of months ago.  I held a public Zoom meeting that many people attended and a number of issues came back.  It was felt that the strategy is not ambitious enough in a number of areas.  It was deemed that the area does not have the population for a light rail system.  I made a detailed submission asking two things of the National Transport Authority, NTA.  One of those was that it would consider looking at the existing rail network around Limerick city, which presents enormous possibilities within the city, going out into Moyross and perhaps incorporating a spur from Cratloe to Shannon Airport.  I ask that our guests take on board all the points that have been made.  I also ask the NTA to go out for a further period of public consultation in Limerick and Shannon.</p> <p>  The exciting aspect of the strategy is that it is linking Limerick and Shannon in a structured way through public transportation for the first time.  That is very welcome but we want to get it right.  Will our guests comment on the rail system and give a commitment to go out for a further public consultation on a revised draft plan in order that we can get buy-in from people?  Everyone wants to get to the same end point but people had strong observations to make on the LSMATS.  Ms Graham might just given a commitment on further public consultation.</p></speech>

An awful lot of the earlier questions dealt with some of the issues I was going to ask about, including the reasons and extra factors that are taken into account for review of the national development plan, NDP.  Mr. Walsh and Ms Graham both mentioned planning, which can be a huge issue.  It is about trying to find the perfect cross between giving people a sufficient opportunity to point out if there are difficulties that will relate to their lives, possible logistical difficulties that are not necessarily seen by planners, and considerations around being able to implement the necessary infrastructure.</p> <p>  Rather than asking general questions, I will also be parochial.  I am a Deputy for Louth and will throw the N52 Ardee bypass into the conversation.  That project was on the books and almost shovel ready for ten years but an awful lot of change has happened in that time.</p><p>The community living on the Bog Road raised the fact that they would have been completely cut off from their hinterland.  The circumstances ten years beforehand were very different.  That matter was reviewed and dealt with.  I ask for an update on it.</p><p> In a general sense, what do the witnesses propose would be a fair process for dealing with planning problems?  That is probably a question for the representatives of TII first of all.</p></speech>

I will illustrate my answer to the question on what a fairer process would be with an example of an issue that has been a frustration.  I am not pointing fingers at anybody.  The N28 Cork to Ringaskiddy scheme was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 15 May 2017.  It passed each test and was approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in July 2018.  It has been through various  judicial review challenges and we still do not have an outcome.  We may not have one by May 2021.  There has been no finding of any substance.  Nobody can point to anything that Cork County Council did wrong on the project.  I can only assume that the length of time the process is taking arises from the capacity of the courts to deal with the issues.  It may well be that there is a resourcing issue there that should be addressed, although that is probably not for me to say.  I am not suggesting that people's rights should be in any way curtailed.  If any substantive issue had been raised, any resultant delay would be fair enough, but no such issue has been raised.</p></speech>

I am not seeking to have an argument, but let us be fair.  The residents of the area were trampled on.  If there had been proper engagement, the problems could have been avoided.  The majority of people in the area were not against the road but they were against the way in which they were treated, to be fair.</p></speech>

I suppose it highlights that there is a need for all aspects of the entire process to be sorted out, in the sense that, whether they are right or wrong, people often feel aggrieved that they do not have speedy enough access and that it can at times be slow and cumbersome.  I accept the point made by Mr. Walsh in respect of the resourcing of courts.  That is a wider issue than that which relates to this particular point.</p> <p>  There also needs to be a means for changes to be made.  The Ardee bypass is a necessary piece of work but it was almost sold to people at one point as being a take it or leave it situation.  They were told that if changes to the project were sought, it would not happen and the money would not be released, etc.  There needs to be means and an ability to get relatively small aspects of a project changed quickly and to ensure that a project is not held up.  However, people should not be logistically screwed over for want of a better process.</p></speech>

The design dated from 1999 and there had been significant changes in terms of the pattern of development and so on in the intervening time.  When the project was considered for construction, the issues raised by local representatives were found to be valid, so it had to go back to consultation.  The Deputy is correct.</p><p>I understand it is frustrating for people that it cannot be fixed quickly.  However, the consultation concluded.  Covid-19 did not help with the consultation and it took longer than people were anticipating, but it has concluded.  It will be going back to another planning process, however, and we expect that to commence immediately.  The scheme will be better for it, and the issues raised were valid.</p></speech>

One thing that might assist the country in the future is to get to a point where there is much more balance in terms of projects going through the planning process, rather than having them arrive in bunches which causes resource issues for all the different agencies involved.  I am thinking about the planning processes for MetroLink, DART+ and BusConnects, which are all coming into the planning process at the same time.  That is just unfortunate and the way it has happened, whereas if they were scheduled and we had a great deal more pre-planning in terms of our capital investment, we could time them so that between our roads projects and all our major infrastructure projects they are more balanced as they are coming through the planning process.  That is not always achievable because consultation can bring up issues that might delay projects, but something that may be considered in the future is to try to have a pipeline of projects across our infrastructure that comes to both the planning process and the legal process, if that is necessary, in a much more streamlined fashion.  That is the only view I can offer.</p> <p>  The other point is to try to do as much pre-consultation as possible.  It will not necessarily result in no judicial review process, but if many of the issues can be raised in the public domain as early as possible in the process, it should lead, one would hope, to a much more streamlined process coming into the planning process.  However, there is no guarantee of that.</p></speech>

I accept all the review scenarios.</p> <p>  With regard to remote working and having robust public transport services, there are many services that will require a greater level of frequency and we probably have to examine ticketing that allows for partial commuters, which will be the reality of remote working in the future.  I also ask that any determinations the witnesses are looking at as regards reviewing would contain a cross-Border aspect, ensuring an all-Ireland type of response.</p></speech>

Ms Graham covered the X12 Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway route.  In Tipperary, we are obviously greatly concerned about the X8 from Cork to Dublin because Bus &Eacute;ireann, despite a great deal of pressure from many public representatives, has said it is not a commercial route.</p><p>The Cork to Dublin route is crucial to the service in Cashel.  It is a major disadvantage for a heritage town, which has the Rock of Cashel and which is frequented by visitors, to have the bus stop on that route taken away.  How can an adequate service be provided on that route in the absence of Bus &Eacute;ireann? </p><p> My second question is for Mr. Walsh regarding the N24 road from Cahir to Limerick Junction.  Will he please take me through the work that has been carried out, what progress will be made in the short term and the timescale involved?  I am especially concerned about the section from Cahir to Tipperary town, which is in bad condition.  The road has heavy traffic, is extremely dangerous and is not fit for purpose.  In addition, we have the major issue of Tipperary town itself, which has been congested for years with HGVs.  It is a major bone of contention, and it has become very difficult to find a solution.  Many people, however, would say that the only way to address the issues affecting the town is a bypass.  I ask Mr. Walsh to comment on that scheme.</p><p> I would also like him to comment on the situation in Thurles.  It is a busy town, which again experiences traffic congestion, time delays and resultant problems with carbon emissions.  The design had been completed for works there and it had advanced to the stage where the preferred routes had been identified.  If Mr. Walsh does not have information on that aspect now, he might communicate with me in that regard.  I would like an update on whether that project is still under consideration and the prospects of moving it forward.</p></speech>

In the case of the towns mentioned, namely, Cashel, Cahir, Mitchelstown and Fermoy, we have assessed that there is a public service obligation, PSO, to provide services once the Expressway service has pulled out.  We addressed that issue by approaching Bus &Eacute;ireann to operate four services daily under the emergency direct award contract we have in place with it and other commercial operators to support their commercial services.  We are proposing to fund four services daily in each direction under the emergency direct award.  We will obviously continue to assess those services to see what the demand will be when we come out of these current restrictions.  Our immediate plan, therefore, is for four services daily, and they have been operating since Saturday.</p></speech>

The project is in development and it is one of the list of projects covered in the NDP that is to be brought through planning development under the plan.  There was no commitment to construction regarding that project in the current NDP, and the progression of that project will be a matter for consideration by the Departments of Transport and Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the revised NDP.

I will turn first to TII.  I have had some communication from TII.  It is one of the great pities that such people cannot be here themselves to make their cases personally, but Councillor Duffy in Mayo has made a very strong case for the N26, which is a major route between Swineford and Ballina.  The witnesses will be aware that literally thousands of people in rural Ireland have to commute many kilometres to work each day.  I am personally aware of a number of people who commute from Castlebar to Belmullet daily - two round trips - which is quite a distance, as the witnesses will appreciate.  In the response TII gave me following my communication with the Minister, I find it deeply depressing that there does not appear to be any funding available in the foreseeable future apart from the &euro;50,000 Councillor Duffy is prepared to put into the system out of the roads budget that he has allocated to him.  I have driven the road myself.  It is lethal.  It is very hard not to see Councillor Duffy's point when one sees the money we spend on roads in Dublin and on building new roads.  The Dundrum bypass, which is just down the road from me, is one that comes to mind.  The money spent on it would probably refurbish several roads in Ireland.  I understand that TII has had dozens, if not thousands, of submissions on the N26.  Is there any hope of getting something done on the 25 km stretch between Swineford and Ballina?  The road is used by anybody travelling around Ballina, Easky, Erris or anywhere along that route.  Farmers, teachers, nurses - you name it, they all use it.  That is the first question.  I will leave that over to the witnesses representing TII to answer.</p></speech>

I know something about this one.  The N26, the N58 and the connections between Castlebar and Ballina comprise a project that was looked at in some detail some years ago.  The main emphasis and the main connectivity that was required was between Castlebar and Ballina.  The N58 is the route that is selected to provide that connectivity up to Foxford and then up the N26 from Foxford.  The N26 from Foxford down to Swineford, however, is carrying quite low volumes.  One aspect of it that was problematic from a safety point of view was Cloongullane Bridge over the River Moy.  That is being funded and is under construction.  The rest of the route is to be targeted for online upgrades.  It is one of very few routes mentioned in the current NDP as being one to be so targeted.  That is the manner in which we would see that being developed.  It is capable of taking it and the traffic volumes are quite low.  That is the plan for that piece of the national road network.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

I understand that TII has limited resources that it must work with, but Mr. Walsh might drop me a note on the matter and engage with Councillor Duffy and see how we might best spend whatever funding he has to make any improvements that can be made to that road.</p></speech>

New commuter technology that is coming on line probably meets carbon emission targets and so on.  The route from Craughwell, Athenry, Oranmore and on into Galway city and from there to Salthill, Knocknacarra and Barna covers the majority of where the workforce in Galway is located.  Anyone who has been in Galway recently will know that the early morning and evening rush hour commutes are crazy.  People in Galway are seeking a feasibility study to examine new transport technologies.  Where is the NTA in terms of supporting that?</p></speech>

It was found that there would not be sufficient demand within Galway city along the alignment that the Senator mentioned.  We believe that an enhanced bus system is the approach for Galway, although this means that a significant level of priority must be placed on the approach roads and the routes through Galway city in order to support an effective and more efficient bus system.  That is our approach to Galway, in association with Galway city and county councils.  In that regard, Galway City Council is beginning to bring forward projects and has started consultation on many of them.  Associated with that is a significant cycling network and a walking network throughout the city.  These are three aspects of the matter, as is ensuring that regional bus services can access Galway city, including by supporting park-and-ride services at, for example, rail stations.  That is what is set out in the Galway strategy and is what we would like to fund.  If funding is made available, we would like to progress these projects as quickly as possible for Galway city.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. Walsh and TII.  He provided us with an extensive list of large projects and significant expenditures under the national development plan, NDP.  It concerns me that they relate to an area with significant carbon emissions and a fossil fuel dependency.  I will ask a couple of direct questions on that point.  What is the total cost of TII's road projects under the current NDP?  Does Mr. Walsh have an approximate figure for that?</p></speech>

I should say that many of the 23 projects in design are at early stages.  What have been identified are the segments of the network that require intervention.  It does not mean that an eventual project will be the full length of the relevant segment.  In many cases, it is too early to determine the associated cost.</p></speech>

It has been done for a couple of projects.  We have a carbon tool in development, which is being used on Galway city's ring road and on the M20 but it has not been rolled out to every project.  It is our ambition to bring that into common usage when developing the projects.</p></speech>

It is a good thing to do.  I appreciate that it has not been perfected and there is much to work out.  Climate action needs to be at the front and centre of every transport decision that we make.  We need to recognise that even if we are in the process of design or various stages of a plan, we need to consider the possibility of locking ourselves into future carbon emissions because we have locked ourselves into a project.</p> <p>  The witnesses from the NTA state that it has no responsibility for rail outside the greater Dublin area.  That is unfortunate because I can see great prospects for places such as Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford in improving and providing an urban rail system.  Looking at the expenditure on roads, and I do not want to have a go at TII, if we matched even a percentage of that expenditure to electrify urban lines, we could transport many people.  It would be much better than building roads through these cities.  Who should have the responsibility?  Do the witnesses think the NTA should take on responsibility for urban rail for the five cities?</p></speech>

In that, one would set the infrastructure requirements for urban rail in our regional cities.  At the moment, we are doing it on a non-statutory basis.  Having that in place gives us a little more power in determining what should be in place for urban rail within the regional cities.  We would still look and assess our rail system whether we have the <i>vires</i>or not and put forward the appropriate rail infrastructure, whether it is electrified or not, as part of the development of those strategies.  That is our position at present.</p></speech>

That included developing metropolitan area strategic plans.  Those plans defined the areas.  I recall that Tramore was outside the Waterford metropolitan area and we have been following that definition for our work.</p></speech>

I will get parochial for a moment and talk about the N11 in Wicklow.  I know that there is a proposal for express buses on that road.  I suggest that the express bus can work well if it operates from departure point to destination point rather than pulling in at a number of stops along the way.  It is important that one states that there is an Arklow bus, a Wicklow bus or whatever it is.  One needs to be able to match time of journeys in a car, it needs to be comfortable and it needs to be high frequency.  I know that being stuck in traffic is not pleasant.  If one is going to provide a service, it needs to match the car option to work.</p> <p>  This question is for both TII and the NTA.  When the N11 upgrade was being proposed, I understand that TII could not consider the rail network improvement and how that might improve the functionality of the N11, because improvements to the rail service were not included in the NTA strategy.</p><p>Going forward, do we need greater interaction and co-operation between both agencies so that we can consider every transport option as we try to get connectivity between our cities and through our cities as well?</p></speech>

On services, at peak time in particular we try to run a mixture of express-type services that suit commuter-type travel from point to point.  Off peak, we operate multi-point stopping services which serve local trips.  As in the case of Dublin and in other parts of our cities, there are express services serving peak commuter travel times with multi-stop services for off-peak travel.  It is important to have a mixture of both services.  What the Deputy suggests would be under consideration.  If consideration was being given to priority services, it would be important to make the most of that priority by providing point-to-point services.  I will hand over to Mr. Creegan to respond to the other question.</p></speech>

There is close co-ordination between TII and the NTA on that corridor and the schemes that ultimately come forward will have the support of both organisations in the final decision phase.</p></speech>

This needs to be done in tandem with development of a really good service along the eastern spine in Wicklow, serving all of those population centres.

Have the TII and NTA made their submissions under the review of the national development plan?  In regard to the terms of reference under which they are required to make submissions under the national development plan, has there been a change in those terms of reference?  Are other issues being looked in terms of those submissions around road versus rail, carbon footprint and active travel?  If so, how have they changed and how will that impact on existing projects?

Whether that is the end of the process, I do not know.  If we are invited to make further submissions or to provide more information, we will be happy to do so.  It terms of the manner in which the submissions were to be made, they were required to be provided in a structured spreadsheet format with the performance of each project proposed commented on in terms of its delivery of national strategic outcomes.

In the previous development plan, projects were submitted on the basis of what part of the networks were deficient.  We had done our own assessment of how they performed under various headings, from the capacity of the road to the volume of traffic that was trying to use it, so there were volume to capacity ratios for each section of the network, and then the manner in which it would provide connectivity and so on.  These were our own means of assessment drawn from the public spending code.  This time around, the Department has set out a more comprehensive series of criteria.</p></speech>

Has TII taken over any roads from local authorities on the basis of a reclassification in recent months?</p></speech>

I cannot think of a road that we have taken over, other than the fact that any time we build a road it becomes a national road.  Often, by default, the road that is being bypassed ceases to be a national road.  We have had a couple of cases recently where they have remained national roads.  Other than that, I cannot think of a circumstance where we have changed the classification of a road to a national road in recent times.</p></speech>

My thanks to them for their time before the committee.</p> <p>  My final point is for Mr. Walsh.  I will be in contact with him about the N73 national road in north-east County Cork.  It is an exceptionally dangerous road.  The N72 runs parallel to it.  Significant issues have to be addressed.  I was disappointed, despite the fact that there was a &euro;6 million increase to the budget of Cork County Council for the purpose of maintaining our national road network, that no progress was achieved.  I want to see that being solved and safety improvements being implemented.  It is a dangerous route.</p></speech>

I suggest that in our private meeting we discuss the remarks made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  First of all, the plan is being extended to 2027-30.  Second, the Minister said in October that the existing budgets may not cover the ultimate costs of mega infrastructure projects like MetroLink, BusConnects and the N20 Cork to Limerick motorway.  It is important that we have a further meeting.  Can we commit to holding a further meeting with Ms Graham and Mr. Walsh?  We should consider bringing in the Minister, Deputy McGrath, in advance of 19 February.</p></speech>

My questions are for Mr. Walsh and Ms Graham.  I will use the stretch of road from the N2 Rath roundabout to Kilmoon Cross as an example to try to understand this process.  This project is identified as a real need.  Earlier, I mentioned the volume of traffic and the backlogs.  The project is at an early stage of the process.  There is an argument for proceeding with it, identifying a solution and delivering the road infrastructure.  There is also an argument being articulated that a solution can be found within the existing configuration, perhaps by expanding the road a little or improving the public transport network.</p><p>Perhaps with more people working from home there would be fewer cars on the road.  How are decisions on those considerations being made?  For example, is TII talking to the NTA about what types of solutions are provided or are those decisions being made at a departmental level?  That is the crux of a number of the issues that were raised.  How are these options being assessed and who is assessing them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.873" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021020200002#Y00200"><p>I am happy to take those questions.  We work very closely with the NTA.  We are jointly engaged in several endeavours, including the operation and expansion of the Luas, the MetroLink project and the light rail project for Cork.  However, for any project currently in the planning process, all options must be examined and that must start with the lowest possible intervention.  The process must consider the online aspect, alternatives and public transport.  That work is done by the design team.  The sponsoring agency is the roads authority.  The local authority, in the first instance, will put out a contract for the project in most cases.  Sometimes it is done in-house but in most cases the project will go out to contract for design engineers to take on the development of the design.  Then they will have to make their way through a seven-phase process set out in our project management guidelines and follow an appraisal process set out in the public spending code and reflected in our project appraisal guidelines.  It is a comprehensive suite of guidelines and procedures that require all options to be looked at.  I hope that gives the Deputy some reassurance.  We are certainly not jumping to any conclusions on any of these projects.</p></speech>

As in the case of the M20, rail options are being taken out and brought forward for public consultation.  One would not have seen that with road projects some years ago.  The public transport aspect is being emphasised more - that is true.</p></speech>

We have spoken in the past about the need to have an orbital bus service in Ennis.  It is the largest town in Munster without city status and Ireland&rsquo;s 12th largest town.  It is quite compact, with a population of 25,000 in a relatively small area.  Ennis would benefit greatly from having an orbital bus route bringing people from its suburban corners right into the town centre.  The town centre's medieval streets do not lend themselves to buses travelling up and down them but there are many good places just a stone&rsquo;s throw away from the main street that could be used for bus connectivity.  Is there any update on where that project is at?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.877" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021020200002#Y00900"><p>I am not sure about the detail but I can certainly forward the Deputy a note on the project.  Providing such services has always been an ambition of the NTA and Ennis is on the list of towns we have assessed as requiring a town bus service.  However, we are not in a position, given the funding constraints arising from Covid, to bring forward any new bus services this year.  Even those that are ahead of Ennis will not be progressing this year.  Unfortunately, that will delay delivery of other services.  Providing a service in Ennis town is part of our ambition to provide much improved bus services in County Clare.  The service will be designed as part of the improvements to Clare bus services but, unfortunately, I cannot give the Deputy a timeline at this stage for when it will be possible to deliver it.</p></speech>

I ask that any statutory phases the authority needs to go through would continue.  Maybe the bus service is not ready to roll out in the coming months but I ask that the NTA keep pushing on with those important stages in advance of that.  I ask, in particular, that Clarecastle be looked at because it and Ennis are almost one and the same town.  There is now only a roundabout separating them.  They have different identities but in terms of how they have developed, they are joined at the hip.  The bus service needs to incorporate Clarecastle as well.</p></speech>

Irish Rail has an order of intercity railcar units ready for delivery some time next year.  If the company were to increase this order, would that allow it to roll out increased capacity on, for example, the Cork, Galway and Wicklow services or to operate them at greater frequency?</p></speech>

Against that, we have to balance that we are undertaking the DART+ programme, which is extending electrification and replacing diesel fleet with electrified fleet.  We will see the diesel fleet cascading onto other lines.  We have to be careful that we do not undermine this fleet deployment strategy by over-purchasing diesel fleet and finding later on that we have more than we need and we are unable to put in the electrified services that we want to in certain places.</p></speech>

In the context of cross-Border projects such as the Narrow Water bridge or the A5, has TII or any other body been involved in preliminary discussions?  The Taoiseach has said that those sorts of projects will be overseen by the shared island unit and that this will bestow on them a further element of importance.</p></speech>

We meet about twice a year and it keeps us updated as to where things are with the A5 project.  Our main direct connection with this project is that we have a small project in Donegal that would connect to the A5 when there is a project to which to connect.  It has planning approval but we cannot progress it and Donegal County Council cannot progress it until such time as it has somewhere to go.  We have not been involved in the Narrow Water bridge project but I know it has come up in discussions because representatives of the Department of Transport attend those meetings.  It was not a project we were progressing and I am not kept up to date on what the current thinking is on it.  I am sorry I cannot give any more information in that regard.</p></speech>

There are, as the Deputy will know, cross-Border services, both bus and rail, but it is defined by regulation what can be achieved in terms of such services.  They have to be aligned with the appropriate regulatory approach.  This is something that is usually considered through the licensing system, which is more on the commercial side rather than the subsidised side.</p></speech>

It is similar to what I said earlier about accepting what the witnesses are saying about robust services.  There is a requirement for a greater level of frequency, particularly when we are talking about cross-Border rail travel.  Sometimes it is insufficient.  Another factor is that we may be dealing with people who are now going to be partial commuters because they will be remote working for some of the week.

Agreed. </p> <p>  Before we begin, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  I ask that all members, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.  Anyone outside of the Leinster House complex may remain at the meeting to observe.  Should they have any questions, they may be directed through the clerk and we will have the questions asked on the members' behalf.  </p> <p>  For the benefit of anyone watching the meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chair, and the necessary staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask that everyone would bear with us should any technical issues arise, which they often do.</p> <p>  At the outset, arising from the reports coming from Belfast and Larne ports yesterday and this morning, on behalf of the committee I utterly condemn the intimidation of staff at those ports and wish the workers and their families well.  We hope that they are safe and keeping well.  We wish the members of the Assembly and the Executive well in dealing with this matter.  Of course, they have our full support in tackling these issues which are extremely difficult for all concerned. </p> <p>  I welcome members to today's meeting. The only item correspondence for today's meeting is the Department of Foreign Affairs impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland, which we will note.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>   I welcome Mr. Colin McGrath and the members of the committee for the Executive Office of the Northern Ireland Assembly to today's meeting.  As we are all aware, Brexit has huge implications for the entire islands, both North and South, and I would like to take this opportunity today to explore some of those implications. </p> <p>  I remind Mr. McGrath and other witnesses attending that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with subject matter of the proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call on Mr. McGrath to make his opening statement to the committee, and I thank him once again for being available to us this morning and for this engagement.  We are very much looking forward to having this conversation with him and the other members.</p></speech>

The Wi-Fi connection in this building is not the best so my apologies if it should break at any point, please let me know and I will repeat anything that needs to be said.</p><p>I thank the Chair and the committee for the opportunity to meet today.   We are delighted to meet with the committee, albeit virtually, and look forward to engaging on matters of common interest.   The UK withdrawal from the EU has brought about significant issues that require us to put our combined energies together to overcome.  The Committee for the Executive Office is responsible for the scrutiny of the work of the department and, as the Executive Office leads on Brexit, this issue has occupied a significant amount of our time.   The all-encompassing nature of Brexit means it is a concern not just of our committee but of all the statutory committees, to some extent or other.   As a committee, we take a strategic overview and have sight of the work of other statutory committees engaged on these issues for their own scrutiny purpose.   In addition to periodic briefing from the First Minister and deputy First Minister, we receive monthly updates specifically on Brexit issues from the junior ministers within the department of the Executive Office.  We are also in talks with Westminster, Welsh and Scottish legislators on EU matters.  We are pleased to engage with the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union to share our relative perspectives.</p><p> We have heard from wide-ranging sectors as to the challenges Brexit has brought, primarily in terms of interruptions to trade and the loss of EU funding.  We will also be vigilant, alongside the dedicated mechanism of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the equality commission and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, that there will be no diminution of equality and human rights standards following Brexit.</p><p> It will come as no surprise to the committee that there are differing views on Brexit within our committee but we are united in the conviction that the transition from UK membership of the EU is undertaken as smoothly and with as little disruption as possible, be that on a North-South or an east-west basis.  Consequently, the committee remains steadfast in its scrutiny of the department to ensure that everything is done to minimise any adverse impact in our relative jurisdictions.</p><p> I look forward to the conversation today and hope the committee finds it useful for report at the end of March.  I remind members of our committee that they are here as members of the Committee for the Executive Office as well.</p><p> Matters have taken a significant turn from the past weekend.  Confusion has reigned as to the purpose of last week's decision and then the counter-decision.  This has not helped the smooth transition and the threats hanging over staff undertaking checks at Larne Harbour are sinister and unwarranted.  We need cool heads, calming language and fortitude to resolve the presenting issues.  It is my hope that this is what all governments on all sides will be doing and we as a committee would be looking for evidence that that is taking place here</p></speech>

At the outset, I forgot to mention that we have received apologies from Senators Gallagher and Black.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. McGrath.  That was very helpful.  I agree with him that we want to maintain all the rights that citizens in Northern Ireland have always had.  That is an important aspect of our work.  I am glad he pointed out that there are different views on his committee.  It is important we respect and listen to all views.  Brexit means different things to different people.</p> <p>  We are joined by Mr. McGrath's committee member, Ms Emma Sheerin.  I invite her to contribute.  I think we might have lost Ms Sheerin.  I will open up to questions and answers from our own members.  I am sure many of our committee members will have issues they would like to raise.  We are happy to take questions on this end as well.  It is not all one-way traffic.  I call Senator Byrne.</p></speech>

My first question relates to higher education and research.  I could not figure out why the UK chose not to continue in the Erasmus+ programme.  Mr. McGrath will be aware that the Irish Government is giving the opportunity to Northern students to take part in Erasmus+, but it is also important that we examine ways, in a post-Brexit scenario, to increase all-island research, which has been growing in recent years.  How does he envisage we can foster greater co-operation between higher education institutions on this island and between these islands, and the participation of Northern students in Erasmus+, even if there are only a few on the new Turing scheme that the UK Government is going to start?</p><p>My second question is more general.  How can we as Members of the Oireachtas support the assembly, and <i>vice versa</i>?  How can we most effectively co-operate in navigating the difficulties we all face?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.902" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colin McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021020200002#D00200"><p>They are incredibly important questions that impact students throughout the islands.  To start in a slightly process-y way, the issue of higher education within the Northern Ireland Executive is dealt with by the Department for the Economy.  The specific scrutiny, therefore, of issues pertaining to higher education will have taken place through that committee, although we get oversight of the issues.  The Erasmus+ programme provided opportunities for young students to participate in a wide range of programmes and it was always of benefit to their education.  Like the Senator, I am a bit shocked that when the opportunity was offered, it was not taken up.  It would have provided continuity in the provision of those opportunities for young people.  There are other facets of Erasmus+ that we need to explore.  There are many connections between young people, not least in youth services.  In my prior life as a youth worker, I availed of Erasmus+ programmes to bring groups of young people together.  We need to explore whether those opportunities are still available.</p> <p>  A situation like this will highlight the importance of the North-South institutions.  An infrastructure is in place through the Good Friday Agreement, which referenced the relationships there would be within the North, and then east-west and North-South.  Back in the day, when the agreement was being drafted, obviously we were all part of the European Union and many of the institutions could work together seamlessly, but there is a role for them at this stage to take the lead and provide that continuity that Brexit has taken away.  There are opportunities through the North-South Ministerial Council, whereby Ministers, North and South, can come together to iron out those difficulties and try to put difficult decisions at a ministerial level while putting ease of access to services for students at ground level.  The Senator referred to the UK scheme, the Turing programme.  It was highlighted to me that there could be a difficulty in that some of that will start to become intra-UK.</p><p>When that was part of a wider European network, there was always an opportunity for somebody in Bristol to look at Barcelona or somebody from Belfast to look at Berlin.  Those opportunities were available.  However, if we start to see too much of a focus on a single UK-based programme, we may end up seeing people staying within the UK as part of the schemes.  For example, we were part of the European Solidarity Corps, which gives people, particularly young people and often students taking a year out, an opportunity to travel to other parts of Europe and volunteer with third sector organisations.  Again, that option is not available now as a result of Brexit.  London has said it will develop its own system but that will be intra-UK to such an extent that it will not be recognisable, nor will it meet the aims with regard to travel, language and culture that were part of many of the European programmes.  All of those various elements will not be part of the scheme if it is internal to the UK.  There are significant challenges for students.  I think the institutions in the North should be tasked with dealing with those.  What can the Oireachtas do to support that?  It can push and ensure that the Irish Government works with Northern Government to make sure that these institutions are operational, which might require a fair bit of pressure at times.</p></speech>

What I have in mind is this.  Obviously, one can condemn it but we do not want public support growing.  It seems to me that there is some room for tweaking practice between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as regards, say, stocking supermarkets.  I hope that the difficulties of paperwork and so on will be reduced to the absolute minimum to ensure that the shelves in supermarkets look more or less the same now as they used to before January.  I say that because little things like that could seep into a widening of support for a boycott of the customs inspections.  There must be room for pragmatic co-operation to ensure that teething problems are overcome and normal trade between Great Britain and Ireland is maximised, especially as it affects most people in their daily lives.</p></speech>

Ms Sheerin can join me in answering questions, much to my relief.</p><p>As I said in my opening remarks, the threats to staff at Larne are absolutely deplorable and are to be roundly condemned by politicians of all shades.  The leadership that can be shown by politicians is critical.  As ever, and has been experienced right through the years here in the North, all politicians must be very careful about their communication.  A communication or miscommunication from a politician could be considered as a heads-up for people to engage in certain behaviours within the community.  We need a cool and calm approach to this.</p><p> In the context of the issues at Larne, Warrenpoint, Belfast and other ports, there are going be significant teething problems.  The UK has exited a major institution that was a part of almost every element of its trade.  The majority of the people in the North did not support Brexit.  It was not our choice to leave the European Union.  We want to remain part of the European Union but we are also pragmatic that at this exact moment in time, that is not the case.  Of course we do not want to see trade stop between east and west.  We understand that many businesses rely heavily upon the trade that moves from east to west, and therefore we must try to make that process as simple as possible.  We also need to have a reality.  It is interesting that many of those who are arguing about what is happening along the border in place in the Irish Sea are the people who were the proponents and supporters of Brexit.  It is not the protocol that is causing these problems, it is Brexit.  As we exit the European Union, there will be substantial problems somewhere and the easiest place for these to happen is in the Irish Sea.  That is where they are happening.  Yes, the first year will be difficult.  I do not believe that in six month's time we will face many of the difficulties we are facing at the moment.  There does need to be a thorough assessment.  People need to determine what paperwork is necessary, if it is absolutely necessary, if it needs to be there and how the processes can be streamlined to be more effective and supportive of businesses.</p><p> I would say to those who have issued threats to the people working at the checks in Larne that if the staff are not there, then they will not be able to determine how the process can be made easier and more seamless.  Those issuing threats have been counterproductive.  The requirements will still be there, the border is still down the Irish Sea for trade, but nobody will be able to go in and fix it because they have been threatened and have had to be taken out.  I ask those who have issued the threats to actually take a step back and think if what they have done is counterproductive.  I will pass over now to my colleagues to add to that.</p></speech>

I apologise for my technical difficulties.  As a rural MLA, nothing proves my point about broadband more than being dropped off about five minutes into a call.  I apologise for missing a short bit of the meeting as a result.  Following on from the question that was asked about the overnight threats at Larne and the issues arising, It is incumbent on political unionism to show leadership and to stop hyping things up at the minute.  It is, however, also important for all of us to take the worries and concerns of people seriously, be they from the Protestant unionist and loyalist communities, and to listen to what they are saying and to engage with them.  There is no threat to their identity and there is no threat to their place, wherever they call home.  Nobody is threatening that.  As the Chairman of our own committee has rightly pointed out, this is a result of Brexit.</p><p>People are pointing to the protocol when there would not have been a protocol had it not been for Brexit.  There were always going to be issues with leaving the EU, especially in the way that we did.  Rather than going over old ground, I think we are better to recognise that we are where we are and to try to see how we can minimise the difficulty and the impact on the local communities that we represent.</p><p> The issues that have arisen at the checkpoints in Larne and Belfast are one part of that.  We need to engage with unionism, we need to engage with the people on the ground, recognise the concerns they have and try to work through that.  We are now in a position of constitutional change and, as we move down this track and as we move into a place where we are talking about a unity referendum and we are having these conversations, we need everyone to know that they are not going to be threatened, and that they are safe to live their lives and be in the home they have called home.</p><p> I welcome this engagement.  It would be brilliant if this is a long-standing commitment and if we had these meetings more frequently.  It is a great opportunity for us to engage with each other.  As a representative for Mid Ulster, I represent south Derry, which is a rural area with a great deal of manufacturing, agriculture and other things that are being impacted upon by Brexit.  Constituents are coming to me with issues all the time.  It is important that we have this opportunity to have conversations with each other to see if there are opportunities within the island.</p><p> In recent weeks, people have raised issues with me that I was not aware of in the past.  For example, if someone buys eggs in the North, none of the chicks that laid those eggs were born anywhere on the island of Ireland.  They all come through England but originate in mainland Europe.  That is something that was never an issue before.  However, we have to think about the fact that egg producers in Ireland import those chicks from other countries.  It is about trying to see if there is a more efficient way of doing this, both in terms of cost and the environment, and there probably is.  We need to use this time to look for the solutions locally, so we are doing these things in a more sustainable way in the long term.  This is a great engagement and it gives us a great opportunity to look at those solutions for the long term.  Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

We would all be in agreement that more of these types of meetings would benefit everybody.  I am looking forward to greater engagement, North and South, across all committees and bodies.  I call Martina Anderson, MLA for the constituency of Foyle.  I hope she is back online.</p></speech>

I thank everybody.  I am delighted to be here.  Unlike Ms Sheerin, who is in rural constituency, I am in the heart of what some people think is the mother of democracy in the North, namely, Parliament Buildings, and we still have technical problems.  We actually have more technical problems in this building then people have in Mid Ulster, which is saying something.  It is fantastic to get an opportunity to engage with everybody today.  I apologise for missing the beginning of the meeting.  I am now on my own device.  I have given up on the Parliament Buildings one because I could not hear anything that was being said.</p> <p>  Listening to Ms Sheerin, I picked up on the question about what happened last night.  Anyone with a titter of wit in terms of understanding the implications of Brexit knew that, unfortunately, there were going to be consequences and there was going to be a border somewhere.  We all live very close to the Border and the people of the North of Ireland realised what a hardening of the Border in Ireland would do to our political process, to the all-Ireland economy and to the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts.  We have had a border in the Irish Sea for many years.  We knew the hardening of that would be a consequence because there was going to be a border somewhere.</p> <p>  Throughout the process, we heard political unionists telling us that they would prefer a harder Brexit so long as there was Brexit.  We tried to explain that it was going to be an unmitigated disaster.</p><p>As well as leaving the EU, there are, as the Chairman and Senators will all be aware, 759 treaties with 168 other countries, and Britain needs to renegotiate all that just to stand still.  At this stage we need calm heads.  Listening to the news reports quoting the PSNI this morning, there does not seem to be a loyalist threat.  There seems to have been graffiti.  Lots of graffiti has gone up on the walls in recent times.  The PSNI has not given any confirmation that these threats, insofar as it would categorise them as threats, are coming from loyalists.  There are lots of dynamics at play here.  We had a LucidTalk poll just in the past few days that would speak to unionism as to where its people are at and where people are looking to, whether it be the Alliance Party, Traditional Unionist Voice, TUV, or others.  There may be other reasons people are reacting as they are.  They have been calling for Article 16 to be revoked and to be triggered, as we know from the past few weeks, and unfortunately, the statement from the Commission was a disaster insofar as it was not thought through.  Could the Chairman impart some information to us as to whether it was red-flagged with her end?  I mean the totality of the Parliament in Leinster House because the South has a Commissioner, Mairead McGuinness, who would be in receipt of at least a note, as Commissioners are, informing them as to what the Commission's position would be.  Was the Irish Government in any way informed about this beforehand?  While some members may have been, was the Government informed about it before it was referred to?  We need that kind of information flow.  While Sinn F&eacute;in has one MEP there now, obviously people are not on the ground in the European Parliament any more than Deputies and Senators are on the ground in the building.  We see in the North that democratic deficit by not having an MEP in the European Parliament.<br/><br/>The British Government and the EU made declarations in December when they signed off on what is in effect an association agreement.  It is not a free trade agreement.  It is not the deep and meaningful comprehensive agreement that was promised.  It is only an association agreement and anyone who understands what that means in Europe will understand that it is very light-touch.  We also know they made a declaration that forbids the British Government from asking for an extension to the grace periods.  We have three-month, six-month and one-year grace periods, that is, three months for retail trade, six months for frozen food and so on and one year for medicines.  We need to ensure we use this grace period wisely if we do not want to end up on a cliff edge.  Even though, personally and politically, we would have a lot of sympathy for the argument that these periods need to be extended, we tried to get the transition extended and we could not.  There is a lot of sympathy for the extension of those grace periods and for trying to get derogations but given that both have said in the declaration that the British Government then needs to implement the EU <i>acquis</i>, what we would benefit from would be an understanding from the South's end as to what has happened at its ports in order that we can have a learning experience and perhaps be able to share that when, for instance, hauliers, traders and others engaging with us point to what is happening in Dublin.  As much as the Chairman is pointing to what has happened here, I think Border Communities Against Brexit, BCAB, has been directing people towards Warrenpoint and Dublin because they are saying that perhaps Larne or Belfast needs to close, whether temporarily or otherwise, until this is sorted out.</p><p>We know that people are looking to the South as a supply chain and that businesses are pragmatic when it comes to doing business, and rightly so.</p><p> I will say to the chair of our own committee that we would benefit from some understanding on the Seanad committee's end as to what is happening at Dublin Port, which we could relay to people here.  We must ensure that we do not waste the grace period and that we try to put preparations in place in order that what happened in Britain at the end of the transition period is not visited upon businesses, including traders, in the North.  The sharing of information is important.  I agree with Ms Sheerin that this is a great opportunity to engage with the Seanad committee.  I hope that this is one of many such meetings going forward.</p></speech>

As I told her committee's chair at the outset, this is a two-way street.  Some members may wish to contribute again.  I will wait until others have made their first contributions before I ask questions on my own behalf.  I suggest that, after my committee's members have made their contributions or asked their questions, I will turn to Mr. McGrath, but if he would like to direct other members of his committee to answer, there would be no difficulty with that.  I will leave that to him.</p> <p>  On my side, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile is next, followed by Senator Wall.</p></speech>

I do not have many questions at this stage but I will make a couple of observations and proposals.</p> <p>  I agree with what Mr. McGrath stated, and what my colleagues in the Assembly said, about the importance of tempering our language, given the events of the weekend.  That is key.  Approaching it in a sincere spirit, my Seanad colleague, Senator McDowell, and I raised this matter in the Chamber yesterday because there are fundamental questions that need to be asked and there are important answers that we need to get.  Ms Anderson has raised some of those questions to see whether we could shine a light on matters on our end.  I will pursue them as much as I can in Leinster House.</p> <p>  Regarding the news last night and this morning about threats to workers at the Port of Larne, we must ensure that a clear message goes from both our committees that we send our solidarity and support to them.  The PSNI needs to pursue the threats vigorously.  I agree that, at the heart of this, the protocol and the withdrawal agreement have to be protected.  As imperfect as they are, they take priority in this context.</p> <p>  It has been touched on by a number of colleagues that we should probably task officials from both committees to arrange follow-up meetings on these matters, given that there is a great deal of detail and the sharing of a considerable amount of information is required.  My colleague, Mr. Jim Gibney, who works with me in the Seanad, says that he prefers to light a candle than curse the dark.  We need to light a candle regarding some of these issues in order that we can share information.</p> <p>  With the Covid restrictions, this is probably an ideal time for our committees to engage and work together more regularly in the same way as we are today.  To Mr. McGrath, I suggest that we take on the issue of continued access for citizens in the North - by "citizens", I mean all citizens - to schemes like Erasmus+ and the European health insurance card.  A proactive approach needs to be taken by the Government in Dublin to ensure that, through committees like Mr. McGrath's, the institutions in the North, the all-Ireland institutions and its own secretariat, people in the Six Counties get information on what all of that means.  It was rightly welcomed and much lauded that some of these entitlements would be protected.</p><p>I am extremely disappointed that other entitlements, like access to voting rights and seats in the European Parliament for citizens in the North, were to denied to us when the Irish Government had the opportunity to keep them, but sin sc&eacute;al eile.</p><p> From our end, we need to ensure that the Irish Government is engaged in a proper communications strategy and engagement process.  I understand and appreciate the Covid dynamics, but it is really required.  There is no point telling young people in Ms Sheerin's or Ms Anderson's constituency that they will have continued access to the Erasmus scheme and not tell them how they can avail of it.  Similarly, once we get through all this, people will have access to the European health insurance card, EHIC, but they do not know how that system will work.  We have been told loosely that people need to keep receipts and all of this kind of stuff.  It is important to ensure that we encourage the Department in the South to carry out that piece of work.</p><p> People lead busy lives, not least in the current climate, and we often say that we need to follow up, engage and meet more regularly.  If we do nothing else, this should be a formal ask coming out of this meeting today and that a particular period of time should not be allowed to pass.  As Ms Anderson rightly said, this window of the grace period is a very live issue.  It is a moveable feast almost every week.  It would do absolutely no harm for us, as members and committees, but more importantly for the public, to engage more regularly and light a few more candles going forward.</p></speech>

It is important that we all say that and voice our support for the workers in the Port of Larne.  I also support Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's calls for continued meetings.  It is an excellent idea.  As has been mentioned by the Senator and other speakers, it is most important that that is continued over the coming weeks.  I am glad there are problems with broadband in rural Derry as there are in rural Kildare.  Unfortunately, it seems to be an all-isand issue.  Perhaps it is something that we can discuss further as we continue to meet.</p> <p>  The question I wish to raise is probably more specific for Ms Sherrin, Ms Anderson and Mr. McGrath.  It has also been touched upon by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  It concerns the cross-border healthcare directive.  It is important to many groups down south, including the Defence Forces, who have great relationships with hospitals in Belfast etc.  Has there been any chat about that?  I am hearing that our own Government is in talks with Northern Ireland in respect of continuing on that directive.  I would be interested in hearing Mr. McGrath's interpretation of that issue.  I thank the witnesses and hope they continue their good work.</p></speech>

People feel like something has been taken from them which allowed them to access life-saving treatment.  In the many and various conditions which people might have, there is not the critical mass of people within the North, and sometimes within the South, to be able to provide the right level of clinics and support.  If we can bring our communities together, we do get that critical mass of people who can detail and use the services.  I am thinking, for example, of the children's heart surgery that many people in the North used in the South.  It makes common sense for families to be able to travel and for support to be provided, so that people can use and access those services across the island, rather than having get on aeroplanes and fly to other parts of the UK through what can be a traumatic and frightening time for people.</p><p>I would like efforts to be made to bring those services back online.  I am sure Ms Anderson and Ms Sheerin will attest to the fact that it was an issue on which many people contacted us, wishing to know whether they would be able to access those health services.  Those who contacted us knew of other people who were able to get help and assistance a bit more quickly.  That is something on which our committees could shine a light, be it candlelight, full torchlight or whatever.  It is something that our committees can do and on which we should continue to come together.</p><p> It is good to see Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile again.  He probably lives only just down the road from me but we normally only encounter each other at events such as this.  However, these events have not been taking place recently.  Covid does-----</p></speech>

If it helps people and delivers services for people on the island, then I will absolutely do so.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile is correct that Covid has provided an opportunity.  Even taking this meeting as an example, rather than involving significant organisation and time commitment with people having to travel for several hours to spend an hour or 90 minutes at an in-person meeting, it can now be held online, as has become second nature as a result of Covid.  It does provide that opportunity.</p> <p>  I wish to provide a small health warning and challenge to the committee.  I am conscious that no unionist representatives are taking part in this meeting.  I appreciate that two such representatives frequently attend meetings of the committee.  I know that one of them is not too well.  I am not sure where the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for the Executive Office is.  I will take their absence as a challenge, rather than anything else, to see if we can get them to engage.  If we are able to highlight a work plan in terms of what our committees, coming together, could do, that would be of benefit to everybody.</p> <p>  We need to highlight the importance of unfettered access east and west as well as the fact that we do not wish to remove or reduce anybody's culture or identity through any part of this process.  Rather, we just want to get the practicalities sorted out so that life after Brexit is equal to life before Brexit and citizens do not notice any impact of it on their daily lives.  I will certainly take that on the challenge of trying to engage our unionist friends and colleagues to be part of these conversations going forward.</p></speech>

I think that it goes back to the conversation we had about the threats that were made last night.  We need political unionism to come to the table, show leadership. talk, engage and get involved in dialogue.</p> <p>  I refer to the health consideration raised by Senator Wall.  I am Chairperson of the assembly's Ad Hoc Committee on a Bill of Rights.  We do not have a bill of rights in the North.  It is one of the things that was supposed to come out of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 but it never did because of a lack of political agreement across the board, as well as the British Government wanting good relations to trump having a bill of rights.  One of the things constantly discussed by my committee in terms of rights, particularly socioeconomic rights, is the right to healthcare and how best that can be achieved.  We constantly see that people have certain rights under legislation but cannot access them because of practicalities.</p> <p>  In the context of cross-Border initiatives, the unit at Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry, Ms Anderson's constituency, is an example of practical thinking and trying to find a solution to work for people.  My mum is from Donegal.  It does not make sense for anybody from her family in Donegal to travel to Dublin for treatment when they could travel 30 minutes up the road to Derry.  Initiatives such as that are an example of using a sensible approach to deliver rights.  Obviously, there are rights concerns arising from Brexit.  For example, people do not know the situation for dogs for the blind community when it comes to crossing the Border, and there are issues with medication.</p><p>All of these things have to be worked out.  They have real implications for people's everyday lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.927" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Anderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021020200002#M00200"><p>I wish to pick up on the point relating to the cross-border health directive.  I have been dealing with a constituent.  Indeed, I dealt with several of them prior to the transition period ending.  Constituents in the North were obviously able to avail of the cross-border health directive.  For example, a number were able to go to Navan and other hospitals in the South.</p> <p>  EU law, policies and funding have touched on almost every aspect of life in the North.  Brexit has also touched on many aspects of life as a consequence of us being dragged out against the majority, who voted to remain.  That is one of the things we have lost.  While we have an area of co-operation in the Good Friday Agreement for health, we will have 151 areas of EU laws intersecting with the assembly's competency and with the Houses of the Oireachtas on an all-Ireland basis.</p> <p>  There has been some scrutiny of the kind of engagement going on at the moment around Covid-19 in terms of the areas of co-operation around health.  We have heard about the memorandum of understanding.  We know we had challenges, if not difficulties, around the implementation of that area of co-operation.  We know on an all-Ireland basis, unfortunately, we have had two different operations with the rolling out of Covid-19.</p> <p>  The loss of that EU health directive is very much impacting on resident citizens in the North who can no longer avail of it.  That was one of the ways they were able to look at paying some contribution towards their care, because they were able to get 50% paid for by this directive.  Now, that is not the case.  While discussions are taking place I do not believe that the kind of priority given to an all-Ireland approach to this issue has been materialising on the floor given the questions the three of us in this room have been asking the Minister of Health in the North and the Minister for Health in the South and the collaboration that is required and how we need an all-Ireland approach.</p> <p>  We have heard from Gabriel Scally - as well as many other professionals - who looked at New Zealand and other places in the world to show us the only way that we are going to tackle the virus.  We cannot confront and tackle what we cannot see and we have to go about doing this on an all-Ireland collaborative basis.</p> <p>  Based on what is happening in the North, there has been considerable focus and attention given to trade, and perhaps rightly so.  That was happening even during the transition period and during the conversation about the impact of Brexit.</p> <p>  Article 2 was picked up on.  We had An Taoiseach, as he was at the time, Deputy Varadkar telling the people of the North that no Irish Government would ever again leave us behind.  One of the first things that I believe the southern establishment could have done, because it was within its gift, related to the three electoral seats given to the South when the MEPs from the North and Britain were kicked out of the EU.  It could have allocated them to the North.  This was the first signal to us that the democratic deficit was not only not going to be honoured but that we were being left behind.  Article 2 in the withdrawal agreement and in the protocol relates to our rights.  We are Irish.  As a former MEP, I had not one but two Irish passports, which I cherished.  I had a diplomatic Irish passport.  It says on our passport that it is the right and entitlement of everyone born on the island of Ireland to be part of the Irish nation.  I know we have people here who are British and I respect the fact that they are British and that they want their rights upheld.</p><p>In fact, I was the only MEP when I was there to take the unionists over to meet the Commission to ensure that there would be an equivalence of rights across the North and that we would not have a situation whereby because we were Irish passport holders, it would not give us some additional rights compared with other people.</p><p> We want rights across the board.  We have had before us at a hearing the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commissioner.  She is very focused on the equivalence of rights across the island.  We have an all-island charter of rights coming out of the Good Friday Agreement.  Just as we do not have a bill of rights, the all-island charter of human rights has not materialised either.  There is work for us to do to make sure that we protect everyone here regardless of our religious denomination or the colour of our skin.  We need to truly engage with each other.  Even though there will be bumps on the road ahead as we walk towards a future that, I think, will result in constitutional change, we need to do so mindfully and respectfully of the differences that we all say were so carefully fostered unfortunately by an alien government.  We need to be mindful of our language.  Sometimes we have had to be tough and sometimes we have had to call it for what it is and what is happening around us.</p><p> Some things have been lost to us in the North and one of those things that has  been lost across the island is the cross-border health directive for the North.  In the South, people have opportunities to go elsewhere in the EU.  In the North, people do not have any opportunities at all now because of Brexit.  That is one of the many losses we have had in North.</p></speech>

I was having difficulty connecting at the start.  I appreciate their patience and help.  I thank the Chairman for calling me even though I have been missing for some of the meeting.  Like Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, I want to make a few comments rather than ask direct questions.</p><p>I join colleagues in welcoming our guests or, rather, our colleagues from the Northern Assembly.  They are very welcome.  It is important to have this exchange and I hope it will be one of many.  I join colleagues in saying we are delighted to engage with Mr. McGrath, Ms Anderson and Ms Sheerin to work together on the issues.  Like Senator Wall, I condemn the threats to the workers.  We must all be unequivocal about that.  There is no ambiguity in that regard and neither should there be.</p><p>To move on, it is important we maintain the areas of co-operation and as much of the pre-Brexit normality basically as can and, in fact, more.  Health co-operation is one such area.  I come from a Border constituency and that is one of the reasons I appreciate the opportunity to contribute today.  Coming from a Border constituency, I am very aware of what the cross-Border health initiatives have meant.  These are very important.  There were opportunities for people from the South to access a number of treatments in the North and <i>vice versa</i>.</p><p>The point Ms Sheerin made about Donegal, Derry and Altnagelvin hospital is eminently sensible.  Practical health co-operation, joined-up thinking on health and joint services are matters that transcend politics, on which we can build good relations and that is a tangible thing.  A number of people who have gone to Northern Ireland - to Belfast - on foot of the cross-Border schemes.  I have been involved in helping some of them with the process of making their applications and completing forms, as, I am sure, other colleagues have.  Quite a number of people in Cavan have made such applications.  I am sure they benefited from having their treatment in Belfast and meeting people there.  It all adds to a good picture of relations.</p><p>I fully agree with the points made about the health services.  I also agree with the point about the Erasmus programme and the need to maintain normality in that regard.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, our challenge, as two committees working together and in our own individual capacities, is to try to maintain the best level of co-operation and interaction that we can and to maintain the highest level of pre-Brexit normality, if you like, and build on it.  The point was well made earlier - I think it was by Ms Anderson - that blaming the protocol is wrong.  The issue is not the protocol; the issue is with the difficulties that are now arising.  The difficulty is actually the Brexit vote <i>per se</i>and the decision to go ahead with Brexit.  Our Northern Ireland colleagues are in the invidious position of suffering the effects of Brexit without wanting Brexit in the first instance.<br/><br/>This is a wonderfully welcome exchange.  As a Border representative, I want to be associated with it.  We really have to build on joint services and the health service is an obvious one.  Supporting Erasmus for students from Northern Ireland and keeping an information flow there is also important.  It is a very worthy discussion and one has no more function than to support and echo it.  I hope we can build on it.  I have no doubt that the Chairman will seek to do so.</p></speech>

All the members who indicated that they wished to speak in the first round have done so.  I have a couple of questions for the witnesses, after which any members who want to come in on a second round might put their hands up and I will let them in.</p><p>I thank Mr. McGrath, Ms Anderson and Ms Sheerin for their candid exchanges with us.  They are really painting a picture of the challenges for Northern Ireland and for the island as a whole.  This issue impacts all of us and it is in all of our interests to deal with it.  As Ms Sheerin said, we are where we are but we must try to make it work, because we have to make it work.  My first question relates to the consent mechanism in the Northern Ireland protocol.  I raised concerns around that at the time it was agreed.  We know that in four years from the end of the transition period, the people of Northern Ireland, and the witnesses and other public representatives, will be asked to vote to maintain the Northern Ireland protocol, maintain what is now the <i>status quo</i>and continue with the Brexit that we now have.  That includes what is, in effect, a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</p><p>I am concerned by the tensions that we are seeing bubbling away at the ports of Belfast and Larne.  I agree with Senator McDowell that we need to put a stop to that as quickly as we can, bringing all sides on board.  My concern is that if the likes of that were to continue and if Brexit were not to be working as best it can for Northern Ireland and for the whole island, that the witnesses will have difficulties in four years' time when the vote comes up.  I made the point when the consent mechanism was agreed that it is not a <i>fait accompli</i>.  If it were, it would not need to be written into the protocol in the first place.  We can never underestimate or take for granted what the outcome of that vote might be.  While we can be fairly certain at the moment, on balance, that it will be a vote in the positive to maintain what we have, we must work proactively together across the island to make sure that happens.</p><p>We need to plan, North and South and as an island, in advance of that vote.  We need to be proactive about it and we need to acknowledge that we cannot take it for granted.  We need to find mechanisms to deal with the issues we are seeing for Northern Ireland, including in regard to supply chains and the threats to workers at the ports.  All of that needs to be dealt with.  It is incumbent upon the Government here in the Republic, the European Union and the British Government to work together to fix this.  I do not have full solutions yet but we need to ensure that the difficulties that are there are addressed for the people of Northern Ireland and for the island as a whole.  My first question, then, is around the consent mechanism in the Northern Ireland protocol and what the witnesses' thoughts are on it at this early stage.  We have a number of years to go on it yet.</p><p>On the invoking of Article 16, Ms Anderson asked questions around what the Government knew and what Commissioner McGuinness knew.  No member of this committee is in a position to answer those very valid questions.</p><p>I have no doubt Commissioner McGuinness was instrumental in resolving the matter quickly.  I know the kind of work ethic she has and that she has Ireland's interests at heart.  There is no doubt the attempt to invoke Article 16 was a poor decision, which has had implications.  It is no surprise that the other side is arguing that Article 16 should be invoked because of the supply chain issue.  One could see that coming.  The European Union is responsible for that because it has allowed that discourse to happen.  Article 16 should never have been invoked.  That was not the way to do it.  That is not what it was intended for.</p><p> From what I have read, I think there was panic over the vaccine programme and that it was an oversight, but it was a really unfortunate one that we now have to deal with on this island.  I think we would all agree that should never have happened.  I am really pleased the Taoiseach intervened, as did the entire Government, to stop that and to row back from it.  As with anything, there are consequences and we have to deal with those.  I hope we never see that happen again.</p><p> I do not know the thoughts of the witnesses.  Do they think Northern Ireland now has the best of both worlds?  For the most part, it has full access to the market in Great Britain and being part of the UK, but it also has access to the European Union market as well.  Do they see potential for Northern Ireland in terms of foreign direct investment, growing industry and entrepreneurship and that it might be a fantastic haven for business because of the access to both markets that nowhere else has?  There are positives and opportunities here for the North which are deserved and long overdue.  That is just my opinion.</p><p> Mr. McGrath, as Chair, acknowledged at the outset that there are different views on the committee, and that they may not be expressed at today's meeting.  I acknowledge that the DUP members of the committee would probably have a different view from the one I am expressing today.  We respect those views.  We are not in any way attempting to gloss over them.  We fully accept and respect that there are different views on both sides of the issue.  They are my three points.  I will hand back to Mr. McGrath and to the members of the committee, Ms Anderson and Ms Sheerin.</p></speech>

It could take three or four hours to answer all of the points raised because the questions were so comprehensive.</p> <p>  There is always a difficulty in Northern Ireland that any issue we take instantly becomes green or orange and is one side of the community or the other.  The motivation for some of the contributions is in the interests of people's culture and identity rather than the practicalities.  Reference has been made on a number of occasions to a cool, calm, collected approach.  The bottom line is that for the sale of a potato or pencil, it does not matter whether it is a unionist or nationalist buying it, it is about making sure that the potato or pencil can get from one place to another and not create additional costs for the business selling it.  It is about keeping matters streamlined.  Something like Brexit creates so many problems, but the solutions are always there.  They need to be hard worked for, but they must be found and then delivered.  When people have the solutions and they realise it is not having a massive detrimental impact on their business and trade practice they will settle and be happier.  At that stage, they can start to look towards the opportunities mentioned by the Chair.  Recognising that we are in a new dispensation may provide certain opportunities and we can go and embrace them.  If some politicians constantly intertwine identity and culture with those issues, we will move into very dangerous territory.  When people's culture or identity is threatened, they react in a particular way.</p><p>The bottom line is that we do not need to intertwine these issues whenever we are dealing with issues of trade.</p><p> There is a democratic deficit.  Ms Anderson referred to it earlier.  There was a potential for us to have some representation but that is not available.  Where there can be a difficulty in that respect is with the changes that might take place in 12 months, two years or five years.  Those changes may take place at EU level in Brussels or in conversations at a UK level in London.  While the Dublin Government clearly has a voice at the table in Brussels, the way the landscape has been set up through various committee means we are not guaranteed that voice here through the negotiations and discussions that will take place from London.  Our businesses and communities will be impacted by these decisions.  We need to be able to bottom out how we make sure that our voice is heard.</p><p> I refer to the formation of any policies going forward, not just when a policy is implemented, and we are told what is going to happen and see the problems that happen.  The potential under the consent mechanism in the protocol was mentioned.  There is a fear that even assembly elections could be fought on whether the protocol should stay.  In some quarters it may be to their benefit to make sure it never works because they can then use that opportunity to try to gain some sort of democratic benefit.  We have to be very careful to keep the situation separate.  It is a trade issue.  Let us deal with it as a trade issue and make it work.  If somebody has a cultural issue, let us address it as a cultural issue and try to persuade people on that front.  When absolutely everything is tangled up we get ourselves tied up in knots and confused.</p><p> In terms of the best of both worlds going forward, there are some potential pitfalls because while the UK may be able to discuss trade deals with other countries on a technicality, we in the North should be allowed to benefit from that because of the connection to the UK.  The protocol means that some of those products and trade impacts will not benefit the North.  There will be the potential for some confab there.  For example, if there is some form of trade deal with Argentina over meat or Brazil over coffee, those goods might be able to come into the UK, but the question under the protocol is whether they will be able to move into the North.  There is a chance that we may not benefit from trade deals in the future and that may leave us with a deficit.</p><p> The very valid point was made that if these decisions are to be taken in two, four or six years' time, now is the time to do the planning.  We saw what happened in the negotiations when a decision was eventually taken on Christmas Eve which gave businesses seven days to prepare for what was coming.  That is no use to businesses.  They need binoculars to be able to look a year or two ahead in order to get their systems in place.  Therefore, it is incumbent on everyone, when they look at problems and issues in the future, that we start to plan for those changes today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.936" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Anderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021020200002#Q00200"><p>I will respond directly to the matter of consent in the protocol.  The protocol was an ugly compromise.  There was nothing perfect about it.  Therefore, we all had views on the consent built into it.  As Mr. McGrath said, it will be played up as we head towards the next election as, unfortunately, a green and orange issue.  Nothing could be further from the truth when it comes to what has happened in the North as a consequence of this.</p> <p>  It has been played as a green and orange issue in what was said about the Commission making a mistake.  We all acknowledge that it was a strategic blunder that should never have been made at the highest level in the Commission.</p><p>Let us not confuse that and think it has now caused others to call for Article 16 to be invoked because it was already being called for.  Those who were calling for it and then became outraged and offended that the Commission had made such a blunder, utilised that blunder to do the very thing that they had already jumped on the bandwagon in calling for it previously.  It certainly did not help.</p><p> What Brexit has done for us, in the North, is certainly not the best of both worlds.  We have lost hard-won rights.  There is no guarantee for workers' rights, consumer rights, commercial rights - things that we have all taken for granted and hard-won rights that needed to be built upon.  We all know, as people living in the North, what the British establishment is like when it denies one rights.  This establishment wants to ensure that global corporations, oligarchs and elites are serviced and that workers' rights will be thrown under the bus as a consequence, whether they are paternity and maternity rights, and all the rights that we require and that are the floor upon which these rights are built under EU law.  We are in for quite a rocky road and will, perhaps, have those rights stripped from us.  That is why we are keen that a conversation and focus are given to Article 3.</p><p> What Brexit has done in exposing the folly of partition has also ignited a reasonable, calm and logical conversation that has taken place across society about what the form and shape of a new Irish State would look like.  We, in the North, are dependent on SMEs for our employment and labour market.  Our labour market is mainly made up of SMEs.  Approximately 80% of our SMEs trade on an all-Ireland basis.  Many of the people who live here are aware of some of what is happening at the moment and I do not diminish any threats that have been made.  It is appalling if that is the case.  </p><p> The Northern Ireland protocol was being targeted and focused on to camouflage a strategic blunder by political unionism who walked their people into the unholy mess in which they find themselves.  These threats need to be removed.  If people are making threats on social media, that needs to be pursued.  If people are taking the registration numbers of cars, they need to be arrested.  Unionists, like us all, need to call on those people to stop making the threats.  I refer to what is happening at the ports and what is happening with the protocol.  We are telling people to be calm, encouraging them to keep calm heads and all that.  However, we also need people to be strategic, analyse the situation and not to be dragged into a fool's paradise with what is happening here.  With Brexit, right up until December, we were told that people could live with 44,000 jobs being lost here.  That is what political unionism was saying : "Go to the chippy" and "the harder the Brexit, the better, as long as we are out of the EU".  This is a consequence of all of that.  We need to ensure that all-Ireland supply chains are opened up where possible, and the work that can be done to make sure that businesses and workers can be protected, is done.  We must ensure that we do have the kind of co-operation that is taking place.  I do not agree that it is the best of both worlds, because our world and our rights have been stripped away.  That will be the case and that is the trajectory we will be on unless we build on the conversations taking place about a better, new, united Ireland, however long it is going to take.</p><p>Let us plan and prepare for it.  Let us not be ostriches and put our heads in the sand because the people are way ahead of us.  The people are already talking about it and already doing it.  There is job of work to be done and this committee needs to be engaging with unionism on what kind of a new Ireland is possible.  Will it be an Ireland that will facilitate Orange parades?  Of course it will.  Will it be an Ireland that is going to acknowledge people's British identity?  Of course it will.  It will never be an Ireland in the manner of the North, where we are sitting in a Parliament but the only thing Irish or Republican in that Parliament is unfortunately a photograph of the late Martin McGuinness hanging on the wall.</p></speech>

Ms Anderson has covered a lot of the questions that were posed, particularly around the four-year period and the consent mechanism under the protocol.  We can see already that Ms Arlene Foster and political unionism have referred to that, as have various commentators, as a sort of mini-Border poll or unity referendum.  To my mind we are in a period of constitutional change; Brexit forced that.  It forced a situation where the people of the North are no longer in the arrangement they previously enjoyed, when they were dragged out of the EU.  While we are in this period of flux, obviously the dominance of political unionism within the Assembly is gone.  That majority has now been removed.  There are very significant and valid calls for the British Government to start planning for and putting in place the processes to hold a unity referendum, as per the 1998 Good Friday agreement.  That agreement provides that the British Secretary of State can call such a referendum whenever it is felt there is an appetite for it.  Successive polls are now showing that there is such an appetite and we are in that space of constitutional change.  I would reiterate that the most important thing at this time is dialogue.  We need cool heads.  We need to have conversations to work out how we are going to operate this.  I am sure I do not have to tell committee members because they already understand that the British Government has a very bad record in Ireland.  People talk about the best of both worlds but while we are still under the control of the Westminster Parliament, we are not in the best of both worlds.  People had to adapt and make arrangements.  Businesses grew and operated in the system they were in because that was the place we were in but going forward it makes much more sense for businesses to be operating on a North-South basis than it ever did on an east-west basis.  That is my contribution to the discussion on that issue.</p></speech>

A number of Senators are offering, including Senators Gallagher and Martin.  I will go to them, revert to Mr. McGrath and then call Senators who wish to contribute to a second round of questioning.  Senator Gallagher appears to be having technical difficulties so we will go to Senator Martin next.</p></speech>

That is clear from the unified assessment of it by a collection of different voices, North and South.  Notwithstanding that, I am deeply concerned that this will be used in the forthcoming Assembly elections and we must address that.  I would like to hear from our friends across the Border about how best to calm the jets.  I expect we will have an inquiry in due course about how that decision was reached but there would be more consultation before reaching a decision in a local gardening or bowling club than that engaged in by the European Commission.</p><p>It seems that the Irish Commissioner was out of the loop.  A member state, the Republic of Ireland, was not consulted.  That will mend in due course and we will learn from the mistakes, but how do we take the steam out of it?  How do we reach out?  My fear is that it will be like years ago where an issue would become a hot potato in an upcoming Assembly election.  I have a vested interest.  I love moderate voices such as those of the Green Party in Northern Ireland and of the Alliance Party.  With no disrespect to the bigger parties, I feel that a voice of moderation in the middle is the future and I feel those voices will be squeezed if an election is dominated - I will not use the word "hijacked" - by the protocol issue.</p><p> I respectfully agree to disagree with what Ms Anderson said about "the best of both worlds".  I know from where my colleagues in Northern Ireland are coming when they say that they want a shared island but accepting the Brexit we have, although our guests might not be jumping up and down about it, it is as good as was feasible or could be expected as the best of both worlds.  Perhaps the solution is if the people of Northern Ireland could benefit financially and culturally from the best of both worlds through something like the Erasmus scheme.  Is that how we can take the steam and sting out of these matters?  Like other speakers, I am concerned that this issue could get out of control in the medium term unless we reset things.  </p><p> It is fortunate that, largely speaking, our guests are talking to a converted audience.  We have representatives of the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in from Northern Ireland in this meeting.  How do we get through this and get us back on track?  The solution I referred to a moment ago is one suggestion I have for the people of Northern Ireland.  No one wanted Brexit and I know it is not the best of both worlds that our guests wanted, but we are where we are and in that difficult circumstance with their backs against the wall, I feel it was perhaps the best that could be achieved although no one wanted it to happen.  I would love to hear a constructive and concrete strategy in due course to take the tension out of the air in both the short and medium term.  The last thing we want is for this to be the number one issue in an Assembly election that should be about health and a more normalised society.  Perhaps we should be aiming towards a border poll at the right moment when the tension is out of the air and people can make that democratic decision.  How do the experienced politicians at this meeting think we can take the temperature out of things?</p></speech>

Can you hear me?</p></speech>

I would first like to issue a warm welcome to our colleagues from the North; it is great to hear their voices.  It is somewhat unfortunate that the development of last night seems to have dominated the discussion this morning, and rightly so.  We would hope, when temperatures cool, that the issue can be resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned.</p> <p>  Like Senator Joe O'Reilly, I too come from a Border constituency.  I was born in Donegal and now live in Monaghan.  We have a unique understanding of what life was like for those of us who have lived on the Border all our lives.  I am somewhat disappointed that we do not have any unionist voices on the call this morning.  That is the first challenge that this committee faces.  We need to encourage all voices to join in.  I see this particular process as a threat to no one.  We are public representatives who represent the people of all the island on issues such as health, education, transport or whatever.  One of our Northern friends, I think it was Ms Sheerin, made reference to the relationship that is ongoing between Letterkenny University Hospital and Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry.  That has been going on for a while to the benefit of citizens on both sides of the Border and is working very well.</p><p>I would like to see such schemes rolled out in more detail across various parts of the North because that is the kind of co-operation that is needed, whether it be in the areas of education, transport, environment or whatever.  We all live on a small island and have the same difficulties.  This committee can progress any of those issues.  It would be doing a good day's work if it were to do so.  </p><p> On the issue of the lack of unionist voices, I know the Chairman outlined that this is our first meeting with our colleagues from the Northern Ireland Assembly and it may be conflicting with other meetings.  I would like a big effort to be made to encourage all voices to participate in meetings of this committee.  As I stated, the committee is not a threat to anybody.  </p><p> I think Senator Wall was the first attendee to refer to the cross-border healthcare directive.  It is another example of cross-Border co-operation that has benefitted the citizens of the country, that there would be people from the South travelling to the North or people from the North travelling to the South.  Although there is a transitional arrangement in place from now until the end of the year, which I welcome, I see it as a window of opportunity for us to expand on that and put a more long-term process in position.  I am confident that we will manage to do so.  We, as a committee, could shortlist two or three issues that we can see progressed.  A cross-Border healthcare agreement would be No. 1 on such a list because it is the kind of seamless co-operation that people need.  People in need of healthcare are able to access it and they do not care where they have to go to do so.  I have spoken to people from as far away as County Kerry who went to Belfast to get an eye procedure.  It was the first time the individual from County Kerry to whom I spoke had ever been in the North.  I am sure there have been similar situations in Northern Ireland whereby people who may not have previously been to the South went there to receive treatment for a health issue.  That is very positive and the more of that we do, the better.</p><p> I will not keep the witnesses too long.  We have covered a significant amount this morning.  It has been a very good and worthwhile exercise.  It is one I would like us to carry out every quarter or perhaps three times per year, depending on what members deem suitable.  I would like every effort to be made to ensure that all voices would be represented on the next occasion.  I know we have spent a lot of time this morning looking back and discussing how we got to where we are this morning.  None of us can change the past, but we can help to shape the future.  I think the efforts of this committee should be directed 100% in that area.</p></speech>

Members have come in for their first round.  I will revert to Mr. McGrath and the other members of the Committee for the Executive Office to see whether they wish to respond to Senators Martin or Gallagher or whether they have any questions for the committee.  They have already heard from all Senators on this side and those Senators will be coming back in for a second round.  I will revert to Mr. McGrath and his colleagues.</p></speech>

So many issues have been raised within those questions that it would take a long time to respond on them all.  Senator Martin asked how we can take the heat out of this situation.  We do so by dealing with facts.  Unfortunately, as a result of knee-jerk reactions on social media, people can be very quick to take a slant on an issue and that can very quickly grow to become a narrative. There is a line right back to the remarks of Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile in respect of getting clear facts out to people about what they can and cannot do.  If people understand that, they are very quickly able to make their own determination on an issue but if a void is left, that is filled with social media armchair commentators, confusion and misinformation.  If we take it right down to the actual problems, it is not about nationalists and unionists or British and Irish.</p><p>It is about how one gets a lorry from Stranorlar to Larne as seamlessly as possible.  If we focus on that as the issue, rather than window dressing it with everything else, there might be an opportunity to move forward.  It is incumbent on all the governments on these islands to be able to get the correct information to people as clearly and concisely as possible.</p><p> On the issue of Brexit, for me it was happening when the vote was declared on that day in June.  There were various ways and means to try to prevent it, but a democratic decision was taken by primarily English people that they wanted to leave the EU.  We wasted far too much time from then to now, but that was a victim of circumstance.  We all know how politics can be massively impacted by circumstance.  The protocol was the least worst option available.  Other options were available, but they were just dismissed, primarily by the DUP.  Time and again they were not supported, and we would not be where we are today if some of those other options were explored several years ago.  For people to say that the protocol, which was all that was left on the table, needs to be dismissed to bring us back to a scenario where there is nothing on the table, does not bring us forward.  It just moves us backwards.  If we have learned anything in this process, it is that we all need to work together and move forward, rather than take big steps backwards.</p><p> If we can stick to the facts, if people can accept that we are where we are and if they can stop intertwining identity and culture into trade matters, we should be able to take the heat out of it.  That will require political leadership rather than political opportunism.  I worry because I do not think that unionism is in a good place at present.  All that it has for a certain amount of survival is opportunism, and perhaps it is going to lurch towards that.  It is incumbent on the rest of us not to allow unionism to have that heat brought into the conversation.  We should do everything we can not to rise to any of the bait it throws out.</p><p> Ms Anderson or Ms Sheerin might wish to continue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.952" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emma Sheerin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021020200002#V00200"><p>To follow what Mr. McGrath said, I said at the meeting that I feel almost as if we are being admonished for the lack of unionist representation.  This, in itself, is the point that I have been making all along.  Political unionism needs to come to the table and engage.  The Assembly started at 10.30 this morning, but there was half an hour before that.  There are unionist representatives on this committee who have not engaged.  Perhaps they have other engagements and that is the reason they are not here.  I do not know.  However, it almost proves the point we are making here that we need conversation to flow both ways.  Regarding the events last night at Larne, we are now finding out there was no formal threat and that the DUP Minister withdrew staff without an actual threat.  One can make one's own assumptions on the rationale behind that.  The point is we need to engage.  We need a calm response from the unionist leadership and we must have conversations with people on the ground who feel that their identity is being threatened or that there is something to fear from what is now the formal border down the Irish Sea.  The Irish Sea exists.  It is a geographical reality.</p> <p>  Mr. McGrath spoke about intertwining trade matters with identity matters.  I am an Irish republican, so I want to see things happening on the island of Ireland.  I want to see Irish unification.  There is no shock in that regard.  However, I have constituents who have no political affiliation whatever and could not care less, but because of the situation we are in and the fact that we are part of the UK they made their business fit to that and they traded with Britain.  Now that we have been taken out of the EU and those things are made difficult, they are looking for alternatives and another arrangement.  Incidentally, it works out to be more efficient and sensible.</p><p>Logically, it makes sense that someone who was previously buying cattle in Scotland would now buy them in Monaghan.  This is about exposing those kinds of things, trying to find solutions to the problems which have arisen and protecting the protocol as a means of protecting our businesses.  We cannot force unionism to engage with us, but we can open the door and ask it to do so.  We are doing that, and I do not know what else we can do in that regard.  From my party's perspective, we have been clear about that aspect.  We are not threatening anyone, and we do not want threats or violence or to have this situation hyped up.  We want to have dialogue and conversation, and that is the sensible way forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-02a.954" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Anderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021020200002#W00200"><p>My appeal for the members of the committee is to do what they would do in any situation, namely, to assess the facts and not to get caught up in hysteria or to believe that because an action is taken, that action was based on an actual threat.  If it is based on a threat, then that is appalling and disgraceful and needs to be condemned.  My appeal and that of Sinn F&eacute;in is for that assessment to be done.  I live in Derry, and we have long heard about the radiotherapy unit in Altnagelvin Hospital.  I am aware of how long and hard people in Donegal and the north west have fought to have access to the hospital.  I am closer to Donegal than I am to Strabane, geographically and literally, and to everything in that regard.</p> <p>  My heart is at where my heart is at.  I am minutes away from having one foot in Donegal and the other foot in Derry.  I assure the committee that this is not just my opinion which I am expressing regarding trying to convince the people of the North in this respect.  We have been dragged out of the EU against our express wishes.  Things will happen which will have EU law attached to them, and we will have no say about the form and initiation of such undertakings because of the democratic deficit.  In addition, we had only just been taken out of the EU when the British Government announced two weeks ago that it was doing a review of workers' rights.  I refer to those rights being under threat, such as the 48-hour week being re-examined.  In that context, we are being told that our employment rights need to go, and we must now also have car insurance green cards to travel from Derry into Donegal.  Those are some of the things which have been lost as a consequence of Brexit.  </p> <p>  We have also been told that it is okay for the British Government, through the Internal Market Bill, to change the protocol and to strip powers from Ministers in the North and give those powers to British Ministers.  Those Ministers could then override decisions taken by Ministers in the North regarding the budget.  We in the North would have no democratic scrutiny of that process and would not be party to decisions that might be reached by British Ministers.  I refer to actions such as an outreach initiative to a particular firm in the North, for example, which may not be part of the budgetary programme or programme of work here in the Assembly.</p> <p>  With all due respect, when I listen to suggestions that we have the best of both worlds I refer to all those things we have been stripped of that I have just outlined.  The people I represent are being stripped of all those things.  Sometimes we do not know what we have until it is gone.  Day after day, we hear more examples in this regard.  A constituent was in contact with me last week because she wanted to get access to cross-Border healthcare.  She did not realise that she could not make that application anymore because of Brexit and that option was now lost to her.  The realisation caused shock waves for her.  I refer to Brexit not just being about trade, the customs union and the Single Market.  People did not really understand the full implications.  Workers are talking to us as well and asking how their rights will be upheld in this context.</p> <p>  Our appeal to the members of the committee concerns the need for serious EU reform.  I believe we can bring about that reform if we engage with the EU and that it can be a better EU, depending on the representation which is sent to those institutions.  After losing all those things I have spoken about, we are now being told that the time is not right for us to get our pathway back into the EU.  The Good Friday Agreement has offered us a democratic pathway back into the EU, and that might be via the reunification of Ireland.  Many people, regardless of whether they come from a nationalist or republican constituency, feel European as well.</p><p>They feel Irish, they feel British and they also feel European.  There is a challenge to the South in perhaps moving itself, as we all have to do, out of its comfort zone that this is not the right time.  That is not the way life works.  As the saying goes, "Man plans and God laughs."  Life does not allow us to go in when we think it will be the best possible time.  The conversation is already happening.  I have been in halls where DUP representatives have told the audience there was no conversation about Irish unity taking place in their constituency only for someone from the Orange Order to stand up and say, "That is not quite true, Jeffrey."  They want to know whether they will be able to have orange parades.  These are the kinds of questions that will arise among ourselves.  I would like members in the South to understand the extent of the impact of being dragged out of the EU and what it means.  While the focus is on ports and trade and cattle and sheep, cattle and sheep have more rights and protections than human beings in the North at the moment.  That is a role of this committee, which should be concerned about protecting the rights of the people of the North regardless of what community they come from.</p></speech>

We have to bring the committee to a close by 12 noon.  Due to public health guidelines, we cannot be more than two hours in the committee room.  I therefore ask Senators Byrne and &Oacute; Donnghaile to be as brief as they can.</p></speech>

Year on year, trade with continental Europe is now up by 446% even though trade with Britain has halved.  There are now 16 direct sailings to mainland Europe, and increasing numbers of hauliers are coming from the North, straight down the M1, which is motorway nearly the entire way down if one is coming from Belfast.  In Gorey, where I live, we now have a Covid testing centre for all the hauliers just outside the town, so the possibility of using Rosslare as well as Dublin needs to be considered.</p> <p>  Regarding identity, the point has been made that there is no one on this call from a unionist tradition or who would subscribe to neither the unionist or nationalist tradition.  It may be useful that on a future call, and talking about the constitutional relationships on this island, we look at engaging with some of our colleagues who are looking at this issue, for instance, in the Scottish Parliament - obviously, fish is an issue and it is a big issue in Scotland - but also in Westminster and the Welsh Senedd.  Setting this discussion in that broader context may be useful.</p> <p>  Finally, I will take issue with a little of what Ms Anderson said because it is important that issues surrounding identity and culture and trade are kept separate.  I would say I am Irish.  I aspire towards a united Ireland but I am also a committed European and have consistently been so.</p><p>I do not want an argument on European identity and membership of the EU being divided into green and orange and the notion that if people are green, they therefore support the EU and if they are orange, they are pro Brexit.  I do not want the European project to be dragged into that sense of tribalism.  There has not been enough recognition of the importance of the EU in underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and co-operation on these islands.  That has to be recognised.  It is important in any of the language we use that it be inclusive and we are not seen as dragging the question of a European identity into arguments around green and orange.</p></speech>

It does a great disservice when we reduce people to those one-dimensional labels, and I am not doing so from the perspective of my party or my politics.  The main point we must remember is that the majority vote to remain was not green or orange, it was multicoloured.  We had the great advantage in the previous Seanad and on this committee of the membership of then Senator Ian Marshall, a proud unionist from a unionist tradition who was also clear in being anti-Brexit.  This Oireachtas could have returned him to the Seanad and our committee but it did not do so.  As such, perhaps colleagues in the Government parties might question how to involve unionist parties in this institution.  The great strength of the Seanad is that it can be nationally representative of all of our different colours and traditions.</p> <p>  As committee members here will know, the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement experiences the same problems.  We do a great deal of work in trying to encourage our unionist colleagues to attend meetings, although it seems only one party ever gets criticised for its abstentionist policies.  I agree with the sentiment that we need to do more to hear unionist voices.  There might be legitimate reasons for some of our colleagues not to be present today.  That is fair enough, but it emphasises the need for more meetings to try to give them the space and encouragement to come along.</p> <p>  The constructive strategy that Senator Martin argues for is 23 years old.  It is in the Good Friday Agreement and we need to look towards it.  While I am delighted and greatly encouraged to hear our Chair and the assembly committee's chair advocating for preparations in advance of potential upcoming votes on the protocol, I hope that applies across the board.  I will ask that it be applied in respect of other potential votes, namely, those contained in the Good Friday Agreement that allow a pathway out of this damaging Brexit, which has been inflicted on us all.</p> <p>  There is a notion that people can be told how an election should be fought and a presumption of the grounds on which they vote.  That comes from a place of supreme privilege, if not arrogance.  I go into republican heartlands all of the time.  They vote on issues of health, housing, welfare and so on.  Brexit has upended all of those issues.  It impacts every aspect of our lives.  Of course it will be a factor in how people consider their future options.  My opening point was that we needed to be calm, level headed and measured in this period and that remains my steadfast position.  We must also be careful because people are not one-dimensional.  I know people from within the nationalist and republican traditions who are indifferent to all of this.  I know people from unionist and loyalist traditions who are asking fundamental questions and re-evaluating fundamental beliefs they have held for all of their lives.  This is our current dynamic and we cannot tell people how an election should be approached or how they should vote or presume to know that they vote on one issue and one issue alone.  That has not been my experience of voting or of engaging in elections for a long time.</p><p> I am glad about today's discussion.  It has been helpful and I think that we can do more.  I hope to see colleagues from different parties attend the next meeting so it is crucial that we get that date in the diary as soon as possible.</p></speech>

That may lead us to the point of bringing recommendations about future opportunities to meet to our respective committees.  Would it be fair to say that there is consensus among the special select committee and representatives from my committee to continue this engagement?  Maybe we could ask for our clerks to meet, advise us and plan for that.  We could take away our thoughts, notes, issues and concerns and pick them up in our future engagement.</p></speech>

What we have garnered from this morning's discussion is that far more unites us than divides us.  There is a desire across all parties and none for continued and further engagement.  There are many issues to delve into and it is difficult to deal comprehensively with all of those in a two-hour timeframe.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. McGrath, Ms Anderson and Ms Sheerin on behalf of our committee for being available this morning.  It is much appreciated.  I thank both clerks for all of their hard work behind the scenes to make this happen.  I suggest to Mr. McGrath that it might be easier for us to go to his committee next time.  If his committee would like to extend an invitation to us, it might make it easier for us to engage with all colleagues on his committee.  I will leave that with him because obviously he will want to run that by his own members to get agreement.  I have no doubt that that would be agreed on our side.  We would love to reciprocate what Mr. McGrath has facilitated this morning.  We will leave it to the clerks to engage on that and await Mr. McGrath's response.</p></speech>
