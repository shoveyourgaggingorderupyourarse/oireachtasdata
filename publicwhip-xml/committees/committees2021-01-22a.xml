Apologies have been received from Deputy Sean Sherlock.  I welcome everyone to our online meeting.  Due to the current situation with Covid-19 only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and he is also attending remotely.</p> <p>  Today we engage with officials from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to examine the 2019 appropriation accounts for Vote 29 - Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  To assist us, we are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications: Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in, assistant secretary for communications and Ms Lisa Keyes, principal officer.  From the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform I welcome Mr. Brendan Ellison, communications, climate action and environment Vote section.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications: Mr. Philip Nugent, assistant secretary for waste and natural resources, Mr. Robert Deegan, principal officer, Mr. Frank Maughan, principal officer and Mr. Fergal Mulligan, national broadband plan programme manager.  I welcome them all to the meeting and thank them for the briefing material they have prepared for the committee and for appearing before us.  We changed the date at short notice and today is a different date from when we intended to have the meeting.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  I ask that people use the button on their laptop or desktop to raise their hand when they wish to contribute.  People can remove their masks when speaking so we can hear them more clearly.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent or switched off.</p> <p>  I also want to explain some limitation with regard to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses with regard to references made by the witnesses to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the precincts of the Houses of the Oireachtas is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, a number of today's witnesses are giving evidence remotely from places outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present on campus.  Such witnesses have already been advised and they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> To assist the broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members, where possible, direct their questions to a specific witness because it will be a bit more difficult today.  If a witness has not been referred to, I ask that the witness would state his or her name before responding.</p><p> I now invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012200002#B00200"><p>Good afternoon.  The appropriation account for Vote 29 - Communications, Climate Action and Environment had total gross expenditure of &euro;587 million in 2019.  This was distributed across six expenditure programmes of varying value.</p> <p>  The largest expenditure programme was in relation to broadcasting, accounting for &euro;260 million, or 44% of the total spent in 2019.  That programme was substantially funded by television licence fee receipts, which totalled just under &euro;223 million in 2019.  Most of the expenditure under the programme was in the form of grants of almost &euro;197 million to RT&Eacute; and &euro;36 million to TG4.  Almost &euro;15 million was paid into the broadcasting fund, which is distributed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  A little over &euro;11 million was paid to An Post in respect of its costs of collecting television licence fees on behalf of the Department.  Responsibility for this programme transferred to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in 2020.</p> <p>  The Department spent &euro;185 million on the energy programme in 2019, of which &euro;151 million was expended on energy efficiency programmes promoted by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Expenditure on this programme has been increasing rapidly.  The spend in 2019 represented an increase of 18% when compared to the outturn for 2018.</p> <p>  The Department spent more than &euro;61 million on the environment and waste management programme in 2019.  More than half of this went to support the operations of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  Members may wish to note that, separately from the Vote, the Department also controls the Environment Fund.  This is funded from levies on the landfill of waste and on plastic bag usage, which are kept separate from the Vote and accounted for in a separate account.  In 2019, the Department spent in excess of &euro;37 million from the Environment Fund on environmental projects and initiatives.</p> <p>  Expenditure on the communications programme in 2019 was significantly less than the amount provided in the Estimate and through deferred capital spending carried over from 2018.  The total available was almost &euro;97 million, in anticipation of significant expenditure on the national broadband plan, NBP.  The outturn expenditure of &euro;25 million included just &euro;6 million in respect of the plan.</p> <p>  The Department spent just over &euro;34 million under the inland fisheries programme, mainly in grant support for Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI.  Finally, almost &euro;21 million was spent on a range of services covered by the natural resources programme.  More than half of that expenditure related to the specialist functions and services of the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI.</p> <p>  Appropriations in aid of the Vote amounted to &euro;236 million, including television licence fee receipts referred to earlier.  The surplus remaining at the year end was approximately &euro;86 million.  The Department got the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over &euro;27 million in unspent capital funding to 2020.  The balance of &euro;59 million was due for surrender to the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  Separately, the Department received &euro;123 million in relation to the operations of the EU emissions trading system, as disclosed in note 4.3.  This was not available to the Vote or otherwise to the Department for spending, and was also transferred to the Central Fund.</p><p> For the second year in succession, my audit report draws attention to a disclosure by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control that material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules occurred in respect of contracts that operated in the year.  These non-compliant procurements related to a wide range of contracts that were either extended beyond their original contract terms or were awarded without following the appropriate competitive tendering processes. </p><p> Members may wish to note that the Department was responsible for oversight of a broad range of public sector bodies, including regulators and a number of major commercial State bodies that do not receive ongoing grant funding.  The bodies are listed in an appendix to the appropriation account.  Responsibility for oversight of broadcasting-related bodies has transferred away from the Department in line with the redistribution of functions referred to earlier.</p><p> To conclude, I draw the committee's attention to the need for a correction in note 5.1.  This note presents figures for the number of full-time equivalent staff employed in the Department and in the agencies funded from the Vote.  In preparing for this meeting, we identified that the comparative agency staff number for 2018 was incorrect because it also included staff numbers for some of the Department's non-Vote funded agencies.  The anomaly in the figures was picked up by the audit and should have been corrected but due to an oversight, it was not followed through.  For the record, the correct comparative 2018 figure for full-time equivalent agency staff is 843.  The correct comparative total staff figure for 2018 is 1,238.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012200002#C00300"><p>I am here today to discuss the 2019 audited Appropriation Account for Vote 29, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  As the committee will be aware, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, our new guise, was established following the reconfiguration of a number of Departments by the Government last June and a transfer of functions order was made in September 2020 formally assigning the broadcasting and media functions to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  This transfer will impact on the 2020 Appropriation Account but has no impact on the 2019 Appropriation Account, which is under examination today.</p> <p>   As requested by the committee, I have provided some advance briefing for the meeting and so I propose to keep my opening statement short.</p> <p>  Total gross expenditure under the Vote in 2019 amounted to &euro;587 million, some 14% or &euro;93 million below the budgetary allocation of &euro;680 million, including capital carryover.  The underspend is primarily due to the contract for the national broadband plan not being signed until late 2019 and projects under the climate action fund not proceeding to delivery during 2019.</p> <p>  My Department has a key policy development and co-ordination role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon, climate resilient economy.  The climate action plan, designed to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030, was published in June 2019 with implementation of a wide range of actions across 13 Departments and 40 agencies.  The first progress report, published in October 2019, showed an 85% completion rate for measures due by the end of quarter 3 of that year.  </p> <p>  Using less energy and using it more efficiently is one of the most cost effective ways to take action on climate change.  The Department invested a total of some &euro;185 million under its energy programme in 2019, an increase of almost &euro;10 million over what was originally allocated to this programme.  Of this, capital expenditure of &euro;104 million supported energy efficiency measures in more than 24,700 homes and 475 public, private and commercial buildings, while also supporting around 4,500 jobs throughout the country.   </p> <p>  Measures aimed at decarbonising electricity generation and promoting the electrification of heat and transport were progressed.  Work on the development of a new renewable electricity support scheme continued throughout 2019 and the second phase of the support scheme for renewable heat opened in June that year.  Some 4,700 electric vehicles were grant aided in 2019 and by the end of 2019 over 15,500 electric vehicles were under taxation in Ireland.  This upward trend has continued in 2020, notwithstanding the overall reduction in new car sales last year.  Spend on the electric vehicle, EV, home charger scheme, introduced in 2018, increased in 2019 reflecting the increase in sales of EVs.</p><p> In 2019, the Department committed &euro;10 million from the climate action fund to the ESB ecars project to promote the charging network across Ireland and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB.  In total, seven projects, with approval of up to &euro;77 million in support, moved into the validation stage in 2019 and projects approved under this first call for applications are expected to leverage total investments of &euro;300 million.  The climate action fund was established on a statutory basis with effect from 1 August last year and preparations are under way to launch a second call for applications for support from the fund allowing both public and private bodies to apply to contribute to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s climate and energy targets in a cost-effective manner.</p><p> Some &euro;25 million of the Department&rsquo;s allocation was spent on communications, multimedia developments and the information society in 2019.  Within this total, expenditure to support digital entrepreneurship and to promote digital inclusion among small businesses and citizens amounted to &euro;3.4million.</p><p> The contract for the national broadband plan was signed in November that year and will ensure that a future-proofed high speed broadband network will be deployed to support people living and working in rural Ireland.  Covering 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s land mass, the intervention area includes more than 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools.  The current deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first two years.  At this stage, survey and design work is under way across every county and 243 broadband connection points have been provided with high speed connectivity.</p><p> In other sectoral areas covered by my Department, funding to support public service broadcasting amounted to &euro;247 million in 2019.  Investment of over &euro;55 million was targeted at the sustainable management of our natural resources and inland fisheries and a further &euro;62 million on the protection of our natural environment and the transition to a resource-efficient circular economy.  Along with my colleagues, I look forward to assisting committee members with any questions they may have.</p></speech>

We move now to the committee members.  The lead speaker today is Deputy Catherine Murphy, who has 15 minutes.  Deputy Neasa Hourigan has ten minutes and each member after that will have five minutes.  I ask members to co-operate as this is the first meeting we are doing remotely in respect of the witnesses.  I will indicate to Deputy Murphy after 12 minutes.</p></speech>

I welcome our witnesses.  Obviously this is not an ideal format but it is better than not being able to conduct the meeting at all.  I will try to go through the questions quickly and I would appreciate succinct responses from the witnesses to allow me get through as much as possible.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses clarify the number of whole-time equivalent staff in the Department and whether there are vacancies?  What is the reason for the difference?  It was before the Department broke up or the broadcasting section transferred to the new Department.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012200002#D00500"><p>The question is to Mr. Griffin.</p></speech>

We have about 410 staff in the Department.  When that translates into full-time equivalents I think it is around 380.  The number that transferred out was quite small.  I think it was about a dozen staff in the broadcasting sector of the Department.  It is a smallish, policy-focused section.  One of the challenges that not just the Deputy but I face when looking at numbers in the Department is the level of churn we are experiencing.  We had a discussion with our human resources, HR, people in the Department on Monday and we had 66 people move into the Department during the course of 2020, bearing in mind that we are talking about an overall number of 400, and 52 people move out.  That is a combination of retirements, mobility, job sharing and so on so the picture in terms of numbers in any Department at any point in time is very fluid.</p></speech>

I want to move on to the national broadband plan and the number of connection points.</p><p>It was supposed to be 300 within the first 12 months.  It looks like it is less than that.  Mr. Griffin might tell us exactly what it is at this point.  Penalties were included in the contract.  Have penalties been applied for the underachievement of the numbers set out in the first 12 months?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012200002#E00200"><p>Some 298 broadband connection points were envisaged in year 1 of the contract.  Year 1 extends from January 2020 to January 2021.  Forty-seven of them withdrew.  That is entirely a matter for the original project promotee, if I can use that term.  Twenty-two were added.  The net figure was then 273.  Of the 273, 247 have been connected, with the balance to be connected by the end of January.  We think we are in good shape in meeting the target of 273.  Among the 273 connections, 73 are for schools.  The issue of penalties does not arise because the original target of 298 has been stepped back on the basis of a number of entities that put them forward as broadband connection points having withdrawn from the process.</p></speech>

In short, there are no targets that have not been met.</p></speech>

That included subsidies and VAT.  There was subsequently a Revenue decision which knocked &euro;270 million off the VAT bill, so the overall cost has moved to &euro;2.7 billion.  Based on our engagement with NBI, with which we have extensive governance arrangements in place, there are no indications yet of cost increases for the project.</p></speech>

I got names of some firms in a reply to a parliamentary question.  The same firms recur in 2018 and 2019, including Analysys Mason, Deloitte, KPMG, and Mason, Hayes &amp;amp; Curran.  Why is the Department picking up those costs?  Why are they not part of the national broadband plan?  Will those costs recur?</p></speech>

It included companies such as KPMG, Analysys Mason and Mason, Hayes &amp;amp; Curran which supported us over the five or six year period of the procurement process, right up to the signing of the final tender.  We retendered in the course of late 2019 and in 2020.  We believe there will be an ongoing need for commercial and technical advice.  The Deputy mentioned Analysys Mason.  It operates in that bailiwick when providing services to us.  Three of the companies that were with us, KPMG, Mason, Hayes &amp;amp; Curran, and PwC, did not make it through the new tender process.  They have been replaced by William Fry and Ernst &amp;amp; Young, with Analysys Mason still on board.</p><p>We will continue to use some of that technical expertise over the next few years.  We have a big and strong team in the Department.  We have about 30 staff working on the national broadband plan, NBP.  As we build up our governance capacity in the Department, we hope that the reliance on external contractors will decline over the next couple of years.</p></speech>

On Analysys Mason, I remember when the report was produced in 2018, there was considerable criticism at the time about the lack of transparency in pricing and on competitive practices in respect of the metropolitan area network services, MANS, contract.  I remember it coming from BT and probably others.  Following the publication of that report, almost 12 months later an announcement of an immediate reduction in the costs was made.  Obviously, the object of the NBP is to pass houses and offer people a connection.  While it is not that each house or premises is going to be connected, for it to be sufficiently attractive, it has to be cost-effective for the end user.  Is that the work that Analysys Mason is doing?  Has that work been updated?  What are the findings in respect of the actual end user costs?</p></speech>

I will deal with one of them and then I will ask my colleague, Fergal Mulligan to come in.  One part of it is the question that the Deputy posed to me at a previous committee meeting on the pricing of products on the Enet services, the MAN services, which are part of the overall NBP infrastructure at this stage.  A number of issues were raised in the Analysys Mason report including inter-company transfer pricing and whether Enet was complying with the terms of the contract that we have in place for the concession agreement on the MANS.  The former Minister asked ComReg to review that.  ComReg commissioned PwC to carry out that review.  The report has been submitted to us.  My understanding is that in overall terms, the report is positive regarding Enet's compliance with the concession agreement.  Subject to final clearance internally according to our own procedures, our intention is to publish the report, probably as early as next week.  It may drift into the following week.</p> <p>  The second point raised by the Deputy is the equivalency of pricing for people living in rural Ireland to people living in urban Ireland, if I am picking her up correctly, and how that is managed in terms of connection costs.  I ask Fergal Mulligan, who is the programme director for the national broadband plan, to comment on that issue.</p></speech>

As of next week, the likes of Eir, Sky, Vodafone and many small companies - up to 17 or 18 - will be selling services to consumers.  I expect that many of them will offer a service with no connection cost and the rental every month will be no different to what the Deputy or others in Dublin pay for Virgin Media, Eir etc, namely, &euro;40, &euro;50 or &euro;60 per month.  Those will be the charges to end users.</p></speech>

It went on from 2015 to 2019.  We ended up with only one bidder.</p><p>We do not need to go back over the points on which we had engagement previously.

We would have covered published correspondence with colleagues of mine in other Government Departments, and we would have published a redacted version of the contract, albeit the version that was published was very extensive.  To the best of my knowledge, and I would ask Mr. Mulligan to comment briefly on this, I believe that a review was finalised but I do not know whether it was published.

We have had RT&Eacute; in highlighting that it is strapped for cash.  It is a concern that there appears to be substantial money laid out for some of its employees, while I recognise that most of them are self-employed.  Obviously, not all RT&Eacute; employees are on those kinds of salaries, and this was highlighted during the week, but there is an issue.  RT&Eacute; commissioned the Eversheds Sutherland report.  Is Mr. Griffin satisfied with the implementation of recommendations at the end of that report?  One recommendation was to develop guidelines for managers on when to engage a contractor or an employee, and to determine the appropriate classification.  People were being employed as contractors over a protracted time where really they should have been employees.  Is that being followed through?</p></speech>

As I understand it, the director general of RT&Eacute; wrote to the committee at the end of 2019 to give an update on where things were at <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Eversheds Sutherland report.  There was an examination of all 433 contractors, or freelancers, in the organisation.  There were question marks over 157 of those contractors.  Since then the work in dealing with the 157 has been ongoing.  There have been ongoing engagements with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection, and RT&Eacute; has updated the relevant RT&Eacute; policies and implemented training and awareness on these issues for all managers within the organisation.  I do not have more up-to-date information because the functions have been moved from our Department, effectively, since the middle of last year.  As I understand it, however, that work is substantially done but probably with bits and pieces to be finally swept up.  If the Deputy wishes, I will get an update note from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and include it in my Department's response to the committee.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for being here.  As I only have ten minutes I will try to fly through a couple of areas.  I will start with cybersecurity.  I am not sure to whom I will direct these questions.

Note 210 of the accounts refers to an amount of &euro;1.6 million.  This covers part of the funding made available for cybersecurity.  This covers IT infrastructure, training and so on.  There is another chunk of money for pay, which amounts to approximately &euro;1.8 million per annum.  The two amounts total &euro;3.4 million per annum.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Griffin.  The National Cyber Security Centre shares an intellectual space with a number of other organisations, and some of the work is parallel, tangential or even complementary.  It is not very clear from the numbers sometimes what exactly is involved in the operations of the organisation.  Could Mr. Griffin outline the communications framework between the National Cyber Security Centre, the Office of the Data Protection Commission, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I have been reading the cybersecurity strategy published in 2019 quite carefully and I still cannot get a hold on what is happening between all the groups that are responsible for complementary issues.</p></speech>

There is very extensive engagement across the agencies.  It is a factor that while some of the numbers that are working in these areas are quite small, they are very connected.  No. 2 in the strategy concerns threat intelligence and analysis.  The link-up with the new national security analysis centre located in the Department of An Taoiseach has been key.  There is very strong co-operation there, both in terms of governance and at a structural level through that forum and then on a day-to-day basis in terms of protecting critical national infrastructure and dealing with incidents concerning threat sharing groups.  When one gets to the threat sharing group level, a broad range of stakeholders is involved and that includes An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  I will speak about the development of the current strategy.  The Deputy referred to the OGCIO, and there is also the Departments of Justice, Foreign Affairs, Defence and the Taoiseach.  They were all in the room for the development of the strategy and they sit on the steering group that monitors the delivery.</p></speech>

There is nothing red.  It is predominantly green.  Very good progress was made in 2019.

Ireland is a hub now for private cybersecurity firms and part of the Department's role is policy.  Considering the current climate and recent cybersecurity events such as the SolarWinds Orion breach, and the Comptroller and Auditor General's previous remarks on the inadequate funding for cybersecurity, does Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in consider that the National Cyber Security Centre is properly funded to deal with the threat facing it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.55" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012200002#H01000"><p>I will respond to that before Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in comes in.  If one asks anybody who has a cybersecurity centre in any state, he or she would be remiss and probably foolish to say any of the facilities are well-resourced because the situation is so dynamic.  We have 26 excellent staff in the National Cyber Security Centre.  We are near finalisation in the recruitment process for a director and chief technology officer.  We have a separate policy piece in the Department.  The work Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in is doing now is taking account of the 2019 strategy and looking at what additional resources are required to support that.  A capacity review is under way and we expect it to be completed by the end of quarter 2.  It will examine whether we have enough resources and, if not, how many extra resources we need, and what type of people we need in terms of numbers and levels.  In truth, the effective functioning of any cybersecurity centre is less about capital investment and more about investment in human capital, which is where our focus is.</p></speech>

We have 67 operators of essential services designated in water, health, energy and transport.  We are constantly in contact with them - the NCSC is.  We constantly issue advisories in the event that an incident is discovered, including the one the Deputy mentioned about solar winds.  Advisories issued to all the entities that engage with the NCSC.  This is a very dynamic area and policy is updated on an ongoing basis.  Finally on that, the network and information systems directive, which provides the legal basis for how we operate, has also been updated at EU level.</p></speech>

I find it difficult to unpack some of those numbers.  I ask for a ballpark percentage or a breakdown of the &euro;141 million.  How much of that represents grants to the 18,500 households outlined in the grant scheme or the deep retrofit?  How much was delivered to the 3,500 households in danger of energy poverty?

The better energy homes, which is the private grants, was &euro;24 million, with 18,500 homes upgraded.  Better energy warmer homes, which is the critical one in terms of energy policy, was almost &euro;40 million with 3,100 homes upgraded.  Warmth and well-being, which is the pilot Dublin-based project, had &euro;8.4 million spent and 340 homes were upgraded.  I could go on, but I am conscious of time.  We will get a detailed table which shows spend and output - I have it in front of me - from 2017 to 2021.  Obviously, we only focus on spend for 2021, but we will show the targets, as it were, for what we hope to achieve in 2021.</p></speech>

However, &euro;10 million represents two thirds of the spending from the climate action fund.  Mr. Griffin outlined that in 2019 only 0.3% of cars on Irish roads were electric.  Even with the increase to 15,000, that is still less than 1%.  Does the Department have any particular performance indicators or guidelines that help it decide how to spend its funds as it relates to the impact it will have on Irish people?</p></speech>

We have scoped the design of the network accordingly.  We are satisfied that up to 2024, the network as is and as designed, including the ESB e-charger scheme - we see private sector companies coming in on that as well, is adequate.  There will need to be substantial scaling up of that.  A strategy to be finalised in the coming months will deal with that area in terms of how we get to the 936,000 or how we get to a bigger figure, if that is what is required on foot of the review of the climate action plan to be completed in the middle of this year.  I have lots of figures on EVs showing where we stand.  I am happy to provide that to the committee as part of a written response.</p></speech>

This is really important in terms of how the programme for 2021 to 2023 will be framed, which is what the Deputy is interested in.  The key concern of the Deputy, along with every householder in the intervention area, is when the connections will happen.  There will be an announcement later today that National Broadband Ireland, NBI, has made the first connections in the Deputy's own county around Carrigaline.  NBI is working across 26 counties and has surveyed more than 160,000 premises, with 120,000 premises progressing through or having completed detailed design.  Construction is under way in 19,000 premises and will be under way across every county on approximately 130,000 premises by the end of the year.  That is construction and we expect, by the end of the year, to have approximately 70,000 premises completed.</p> <p>  I may ask Mr. Mulligan to comment on this and he describes it very well.  The first year of this contract was about building the runway, and once it is built - it is fairly well built - we will see a flow of premises through the final construction phases starting to ramp up very considerably during the course of 2021, 2022 and 2023.  Mr. Mulligan is very close to what is happening on the ground.  I know the Deputy has asked many parliamentary questions on this matter over the past while.</p></speech>

In particular counties there will be locations around Cork, Ballinasloe, Cavan and Limerick that will see several thousand premises getting a fibre to the home connection in the next couple of months.  The good news is those premises will get a service of at least 500 Mbps; it is not an "up to" service.  Businesses will get 1 Gbps and more.  That will happen at prices equivalent to those available in urban areas.</p> <p>  There is a target of 70,000 connections and the initial targets in the contract were higher.  There is a slight delay of a few months and there have been significant challenges, as alluded to by Mr. Griffin, in all construction contracts across the country due to Covid-19.  Even in recent weeks this has been a real challenge, given the number of staff across the country either in isolation or who have Covid-19.  That has presented many challenges, but notwithstanding those, there will be more than 70,000 premises connected across many counties.</p></speech>

An area in my constituency had more than 100 houses built but there is no landline or mobile phone access.  It is only after a hard battle that we got some houses connected.  Has there been any communication with local authorities?  Construction of houses is not allowed unless there is access to roads, sewers and water, but access to the Internet is now a key ingredient when we speak about building homes.</p><p>Has there been any communication with local authorities on that issue?

Obviously, planning is in the ambit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage at this stage.  I think that the point posited by Deputy Colm Burke is reasonable.  I suppose, from the point of view of those 100 houses, because they will appear in the amber area they are in line for connection irrespective of the other difficulties they have experienced.  They are encompassed within our plan in terms of provision of that high-speed connectivity.</p></speech>

Until a few days ago, we had not received the 2019 and 2020 annual reports, let alone the list of salaries for top earners for 2017 to 2019, inclusive.  Recently, the director general of RT&Eacute; stated in an interview that in 2008, RT&Eacute; had given a public commitment to publish the details of its ten highest earners and has done so since then.  Given the substantial annual investment the State makes in RT&Eacute;, can the Secretary General advise when the 2020 annual report will be published?  Is he in a position to give an undertaking that RT&Eacute; will start to publish its list of top salaries on an annual basis and the annual report within a timeframe that most people would consider reasonable?</p></speech>

I do not know the reason the report was only published in the past few weeks.  I know there can be delays in the submission of reports to Departments.  There can be delays in the analysis and assessment of such reports within the Departments themselves before they are brought to the Government and before the Government approves them for publication, submission to and laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

In the context of the large amount of public money involved here, is the ability of shows to attract sponsorship a factor in the decision-making?  I can give an example about which I am curious.  There was a presenter with a weekend show and RT&Eacute; was seeking a sponsor for that show for more than a year.  I think the amount involved in the sponsorship deal was &euro;195,000 but the presenter's salary was in the region of &euro;220,000.  If one compares that salary to the loss of sponsorship, one can probably assume the figures were more or less the same.  Obviously we have not seen value for money recognition but can we expect to see value for money in the 2020 figures<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the salaries of the top stars?</p></speech>

We have an oversight agreement that looks at the performance of RT&Eacute; in the round.  If the Department started to stray into the decision-making process on those particular issues, we could find ourselves straying into other areas and issues that are rightly within the purview of a commercial semi-State body.  RT&Eacute; is a commercial semi-State organisation and it has to make calls.

The total spend was just under &euro;10 million.</p><p>Those are the 2019 figures.

Looking at the situation in 2019, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, the total non-compliant spend was just short of &euro;9.9 million.  The bulk of that was, at least in terms of value, across 13 contracts, 12 NBP contracts.  I touched on this with Deputy Murphy.  These were services we had procured to assist us in the NBP procurement process.  They amounted to &euro;5.5 million of the &euro;9 million in non-compliant spend.  Effectively, we were in the final stages of an award.  It would have been simply untenable to change horses at that stage.  Doing that would have represented bad value for money and would have set back the project.  The other big contract was for &euro;2.3 million.  This was an extension of the contract for the National Digital Research Centre, pending the completion of a procurement process.  That process is now completed and we have a new provider, a new concessionaire, in place.  Some 79% of the contract values related to both the NBP and the NDRC.  Looking at the 36 contracts that were non-compliant in 2019, four of them, to the value of &euro;420,000, remain non-compliant.  We are going to get them resolved during the course of 2021.</p></speech>

There were contracts that related to the national broadband plan.  I think we may have started our first extension of the NDRC at that stage.  Some of the contracts called out in 2019 were also the contracts that were the start of the difficulty, for want of a better term, and commenced in 2018.  We have done a lot since then, and that is the key piece from a governance perspective.  We have a procurement unit, we have updated our guidelines, we have a procurement toolbox for staff, we have 190 staff who went on training and we have a help desk in place.  We see that reflected in a far healthier position in 2020, looking at the Circular 40/02 cases.  We had 11 non-compliant contracts compared with the 36, but their value is substantially lower.  It is &euro;1.6 million.  At the risk of my coming back this time next year and being quizzed on the same issue, I am quite confident about the work that has been done in 2019 in terms of elevating this as an issue within the Department.  It is obviously deeply uncomfortable for me to come before the Committee of Public Accounts to explain this.

I will cover two areas.  The first is An Post and the postal office network.  Obviously An Post has been going through a revitalisation, resurgence and transformation over the past number of years but, of course, that involves closing down some post offices.  In my own area, this is because no one was willing to take over the business in Monkstown and Foxrock.  There is a significant network of connected Government-funded offices.  What has the Department in mind for securing those?  Has it had a conversation around additional Government services that could be delivered to people through that network given its dispersion and the fact people are spending more and more time in their local areas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.111" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021012200002#O00500"><p>Over the past number of months, anybody, particularly in rural Ireland, would recognise the huge value An Post has provided in terms of its functions.  A strategic plan was put in place in 2019 as part of an injection in terms of delivering the plan.  A long-term loan was provided by the State.  State aid was approved and secured for that.  The figure is &euro;30 million - &euro;15 million to support the universal service obligation and &euro;15 million to support the network.  The network has done very well over the past couple of years.  I do not want this to be construed in the wrong way but An Post has looked at the services it can provide through the network.  We have the recent report from Grant Thornton, which An Post is considering.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has met with An Post and the IPU about that.  There is active engagement on it.  When one looks at the ubiquity of the Internet, digital and all the rest, one can see there is a significant enough cohort of people who are not comfortable with engaging with the Internet.  This is a piece the Government needs to look at on a whole-of-government basis.  A report was prepared under the last Government that we are looking at updating with a view to bringing it to Government to see what additional service might be capable of being channelled through the post office network.  I expect that to happen over the next couple of weeks.</p></speech>

Is there anything Mr. Griffin can talk to us about?  Obviously, it is a significant network and there is a public-private element to it.  When one thinks about the sort of things people come to Deputies about or even queries about driver licences or motor tax, one can see that it is a physical network operated on behalf of the State and there is nothing else like it.  Is there anything Mr. Griffin has in mind?</p></speech>

There are issues around procurement and the existing mechanisms whereby those services are discharged at Government level and how it might cut across that.  I do not want to go into it in too much detail.</p></speech>

We want to make sure the network remains strong, ensure that additional services are channelled through the network and look at how the Government on a whole-of-government basis can play its part in that regard.</p></speech>

We know some of the terms and conditions with which people in that economy work.  An Post has a full-time workforce and electric vans.

The steps the chief executive and the board have taken to electrify the vehicle fleet within the Dublin region are a credit to the organisation.  I know there is a desire on their part to do more in that area.  One thing under consideration is to use the network of post offices as electric vehicle charging points.</p></speech>

My area is D&uacute;n Laoghaire and we have a significant issue with ground wastewater pollution and its impacts there.  We see it especially when there is heavy rainfall.  I have been following up with Irish Water.  What is the role of the EPA in following up with these ongoing long-term investment issues?  Can the officials give us some information about the remit of the EPA?</p></speech>

For example, EPA would look at Ireland's compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive, the drinking water directive and the water quality and water framework directives.  The EPA produces reports, such as the state of the environment report published during the course of 2020.  There is ongoing engagement between the EPA and Irish Water.  This is important in framing the nature of the investments that need to be made.</p> <p>  One thing the EPA has done in recent years is maintain a remedial action list.  One issue that springs to mind relates to the difficulties that were experienced in Roscommon until some years ago.  Irish Water invested significantly and it seems to have addressed that issue well.  That was based on the work the EPA did in the remedial action list.  All of that feeds into the investment decision-making and the establishment of the overall investment programme by Irish Water.</p></speech>

I have questions that are possibly for Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in and Mr. Griffin.  I wish to say at the outset that in any engagement I have had with the Department I have always found the officials helpful.  I hope that continues.</p> <p>  My question is on cybersecurity.  I am concerned that we do not have a budget fit to meet the demands of the national cybersecurity strategy.  My question is pertinent to today.  How vulnerable is our health system in the event of a cyber attack?  Has there been a cyber attack recently?  What is the most recent attack?  Can the officials comment on the recent cyber attacks in Australia and New Zealand?</p> <p>  I compliment and concur with the remarks of Mr. Griffin on An Post as a network.  As a rural Deputy, I know those in An Post have been invaluable in terms of communications and the knowledge they have of our rural and most vulnerable residents.</p> <p>  I have engaged a good deal with An Post, especially in respect of the budgetary requirements.  Given where we find ourselves now, post-Brexit, An Post is one of the most effective deliverers of parcels in the whole private commercial network.  This is simply because An Post is aligned with Revenue.  It is well worth investing in it.  An Post seems to be more up to date with things than many of our other services.  I know Mr. Griffin cannot outline that but I thank him for that and I look forward to seeing what it is.</p> <p>  I wish to discuss the last EPA report issued.  I am concerned about our failure to meet carbon emission targets.  I know that previously Department officials have said what the cost was from 2013 to 2020.</p><p>At the moment the Department has estimated, from the report, that it would be &euro;6 million to &euro;13 million.  Could the officials give a little update on that?  Is that the final figure and is there a further cost for this year?</p></speech>

I will make a couple of points on cyber and then on carbon emissions I will hand over to Mr. Frank Maughan who is the Department's principal officer in that particular area and has a good feel for it.</p> <p>  On the funding and capacity of the cybersecurity centre, we will complete that review in 2021.  From a Government perspective, once we know what the need and the ask is - and at the risk of being proven wrong by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform later in the year as part of the Estimates process - I am quite comfortable that there is an appreciation within Government of the criticality of resourcing this, whether through money or staff, because this is something that the State cannot afford to get wrong.  We need to be fully fighting fit on this particular issue.  On the health sector,  we mentioned operators of essential services earlier and the health sector and the major hospitals are constituents, they are one of the 67 designated.  They do get a level of support from our Department and obviously they have their own capacity through the HSE and perhaps within the individual hospitals themselves.</p> <p>  As for what we have been doing during the pandemic, we have been issuing advisories to the HSE and the individual platforms-----</p></speech>

The EPA publishes an annual report of emissions inventories as well as a separate annual report of emissions projections and those projections look out over the period to 2040.  The most recent report from the agency about projections was published in July 2020.  It estimated that for our 2020 targets, we would end up between-----</p></speech>

The estimate of the additional costs of funding the purchase of credits to make up that shortfall remains, as the Deputy mentioned, between &euro;6 to 13 million.  That has not actually changed as an estimate.  It will be another year before we have a final estimate because the 2020 numbers will not be available from the EPA until later this year and it is only at that point will we be able to actually get a final fix on our estimated costs.</p></speech>

It is a huge issue in my own constituency of Mayo where over 36,360 premises are in the intervention areas.  That equates to over 44% of all premises within the county.  From the initial detail that was discussed I want to get a sense of where the deployment is within County Mayo.  Two areas which have completed their surveys are Castlebar, with over 2,139 premises, and Ballina which has over 2,500.  National Broadband Ireland's website talks about the anticipated date for connection.  For Castlebar townlands it will be between August and October 2021.  Is it correct to say we are still on schedule for this and can the officials provide me with an update on where we are currently at versus the original schedule?</p></speech>

National Broadband Ireland, NBI, was hoping to have more done by the end of the year at a national level but things have fallen back by a few months, although that will not impact Castlebar and Ballina to any great extent.  The target for this year is 70,000 overall and NBI will be looking to do a hell of a lot more than that in 2022.</p></speech>

It means that those particular premises in Ballina and Castlebar can get a connection that can make an order to Sky, Vodafone or Eir.  There will be approximately 20 service providers.  Westnet Broadband, for example, would be another service provider that will sell fibre in the west.  People can make a choice.  Anyone can go onto the relevant websites and get that 500 Mbps upfront connection for &euro;100, perhaps without a charge from the retail provider, and will then be charged at &euro;40 or &euro;50 a month.  Within that package, those 4,000 or 5,000 people in Ballina and Castlebar will get high-speed broadband, possibly television, a landline and other things.</p> <p>  Many other townlands across Mayo will see vans and trucks of contractors over the course of this and next year.  That is what we mean when we talk about "home survey" and "under construction".  While 70,000 will be connectable by the end of the year, more than 130,000 will be surveyed and designed over the course of the next 12 months and we will see that coming on stream in 2021.  The NBI website is being updated every month as all that gets updated.</p></speech>

There is a considerable thirst for information, so having that website updated and accurate is an important step.</p> <p>  Is consideration being given to creating and rolling out an aggregated national retrofit scheme, area by area, that would encompass large numbers of houses?  I know such a thing has been piloted in the midlands, but is that something we can expect as part of a roll-out?</p></speech>

A national retrofit scheme was provided for in 2020 and the whole <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>for that is to try to build scale and volume to establish a one-stop shop where people can get everything that needs to be done through that one conduit.  That is to make the process far simpler for people who want to do that and engage in it.  I am conscious of time, but I will give the Deputy a written note on that when we come back to the committee secretariat as a follow-up to this meeting.</p></speech>

Let me make sure that does not happen.  I note in the report that there is an additional spend of &euro;1.53 million and the cumulative total for the project appears to be &euro;32 million.  I have seen previously reported figures that the total cost of the project was &euro;38 million.  Before I ask my subsequent questions, the witnesses might clarify the total cost of that project.</p></speech>

In simple terms, the total cost will be &euro;38 million.</p><p>Up until the end of 2019, we spent &euro;27.91 million.  That means expenditure of &euro;1.8 million in 2019, including VAT.  Much of this expenditure would have been in the set-up phase &ndash; the design, encoding a database, the launch and dissemination.  Where an increase can be seen, it concerns the ongoing maintenance and dissemination costs, and a small increase in staff costs in the Department.</p></speech>

Given that we spent such a substantial amount, I am sure Mr. Griffin was disappointed with the survey showing 60% of people never, or seldom, used the system.  What needs to be done now to encourage people to use it?  There is a very clever radio advertisement regarding the ambulance service on which I often remark, but I wonder whether real engagement needs to happen with different agencies.  For example, we discussed the electoral reform Bill and the new electoral register this morning, yet there appears to be no basis for starting to work with the postcodes.  That is the type of proactive engagement we need to make sure the State recoups its expenditure on the Eircode postcodes system.</p></speech>

I have a couple of points on that.  I have seen that figure before.  Like a lot of things, the particular question that was posed would not have been the question that I would have asked, and that is why a percentage of 60% was elicited.  We have Am&aacute;rach Research appointed under the contract.  The research it did in 2019 shows that 99% of the Irish public are aware of Eircode postcodes and that 96% use them.</p> <p>  Considering what has happened, particularly in the course of 2020, including the immediate and massive shift of both workers and businesses to operating online, we have seen a huge uptake in the usage of postcodes.  There was a 60% increase in November 2020 relative to November 2019.  The total number of look-ups increased from 6 million in 2016 to almost 20 million in 2019.  We are seeing that increase on a constant basis, month-on-month.  We are seeing a very significant increase in the number of private sector entities using the system in terms of logistics and so on.  Banking and insurance companies are included.  In the public sector, the system is used for online passport applications.  It is used for the census and for Student Universal Support Ireland grants.  It is used for property marketing and mobility.  We are constantly engaging with our colleagues across government to increase the use of postcodes.  They are being stitched into what is known as the national data infrastructure.  There are three key pieces of information: the PPSN, the Eircode postcode and a unique business identifier that is in development-----</p></speech>

I want to ask questions with respect to the Department's relationship with EirGrid.  I note the Minister is a shareholder in EirGrid.

Regarding the sorts of governance arrangements that are in place for EirGrid, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform jointly agree a letter of expectation.</p><p>The most recent one dates from December 2019 to June 2021.  It sets out the sorts of things the State wants the company to do, both in terms of financial performance and metrics and in terms of supporting overall Government policy, particularly around the delivery of infrastructure that is necessary to meet our 70% renewable electricity target by 2020.  That is the broad framework within which the governance relation between ourselves and EirGrid operates.</p></speech>

The point I was making was that there is a vested interest in the Department and the wider Government apparatus that EirGrid is financially successful and prudent because when it is successful it returns a dividend to the State.

It would appear that advertising spend would be strange.  Over the five years leading up to, I think, 2019, EirGrid spent &euro;8.6 million on what is described as selling and advertising.  That is &euro;8.1 million more than was approved by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  Considering that the State is drawing down dividends of &euro;4 million, that is proportionately a big spend on advertising.  Does the Department have a view on the rationale for that or on the fact that it apparently was not approved?  Does Mr. Griffin think that is a prudent use of the resources of the company?</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the CRU, which regulates EirGrid from the point of view of approving the levels of funding it can spend on the network.  The most recent regulatory review, PR5, was approved by the CRU in December.  It sets out the allowable investment by EirGrid and by ESB Networks over the next number of years.  I am not <i>au fait </i>with that issue but I will come back to the Deputy with a note on it.  I will get an explanation from EirGrid as to why that seems to be out of kilter with what-----</p></speech>

We have all seen it.  One cannot go on social media without seeing promotion by EirGrid.  It is the same when one watches a football match.  Current affairs programmes on a number of local radio stations are sponsored by EirGrid.  Does Mr. Griffin understand why that would be needed?</p></speech>

On the advertising bit, I need to get it clear in my head.  EirGrid does a great deal of community outreach which one would imagine involves the need for extensive investment in local advertising in the areas where they are doing work or expecting to do work.  It has done a good deal of outreach on some big projects it is doing to keep the communities adequately briefed on what is happening and likely to happen in the area.</p><p>Whether that is encompassed within the &euro;8.1 million, I do not know.  If it is, I would see that as being hugely important in terms of that community engagement piece, particularly on projects some of which, as both of us know, can be quite difficult and controversial in local communities.

My constituency is affected by one of its primary planned projects and its engagement has been very poor.  Its advertising campaign has done the opposite of what the Department set out as the objective because it has antagonised people even more.  I will return to that point.</p></speech>

In respect of An Post, I compliment the company.  I was my party's spokesperson on communications a few years ago and the company was in deep bother at that time.  It has had to carry out a transition very quickly and get itself into shape, so I compliment everybody involved.  There is good employment for my area of Portlaoise and the wider County Laois at the mail centre and I hope that will be maintained.  Some parcel facilities have been moved out of the centre but for now it is holding up well, and the Covid pandemic has actually brought a new layer of business to it.  I wish the company and everybody associated with it well.</p> <p>  On the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na plants and the Department's role in the issue, the Lough Ree and Shannonbridge plants have stopped generating power.  These plants are on the national grid and are strategically located.  They are a plug-in point.  There is deep concern that they either will not be used for anything or will be under-utilised.  What is the Department doing in terms of new ideas?  The plants are ideal plug-in points for solar power, which can be generated on the local bogs because there is a huge land mass.  Both Lough Ree and the West Offaly Power Station in Shannonbridge are surrounded by a huge land mass of bogs.  There is a great opportunity as a plug-in point for biomass, and there is plenty of biomass because, by international standards, there is a very large agricultural sector in the midlands, which is good.</p> <p>  They could also act as a plug-in point for wind power.  While the location of wind turbines is a contentious issue, the one place where they can be put is where there are large tracts of bog, which can be utilised.  Some of the largest bogs in Ireland surround these two power stations.  I have been trying to highlight this for years.  What is the Department doing to flag that up and explore how the power stations can be utilised to ensure they can be used for power generation and as connectivity sites because of their strategic location in the context of the renewable energy phase we are moving into?</p></speech>

From our perspective in the Department, we are acutely conscious of the very fundamental changes that are occurring in the midlands and the very fundamental changes that are occurring for people who have worked in Bord na M&oacute;na, the ESB and related industries for decades.  We secured the &euro;108 million for the bog rehabilitation scheme pre-Christmas, which was a very positive outcome.  Tranches of funding have been approved in principle for a range of projects to be funded under the just transition fund and at EU level, a further tranche of just transition funding is likely to be made available to the State over the 2021-27 period, which again is a really positive thing.</p><p>On the specific points, I know from speaking to Bord na M&oacute;na that it is keen to make sure the infrastructure that is available within the midlands region, that is, the connections to the grid, are harnessed, whether that is through the connections of additional renewable energy or otherwise.  At one point, given the grid connection, I believe consideration was given to whether a data centre that could be connected to the grid was appropriate.</p><p> On the broader point on ESB plants, one of the things Mr. Kieran Mulvey set out in his report, which he provided to the then Minister back in May or June 2020, was the need for a group to look at how that existing infrastructure could be used.  That group is currently sitting and is chaired by the ESB.  Other local stakeholders are involved and the Department sits on it.  I do not know if there is anything specific Mr. Maughan can say around that.  I understand the work of that group is to conclude probably within the first quarter of this year.</p></speech>

They have been power generation centres for more than half a century and are ideally located.  It is important that the State captures and makes use of that and they are used as part of the whole new infrastructure needed in the midlands for renewable energy.  Perhaps Mr. Griffin will come back to me with a short note on that.</p></speech>

There were to be 300 such connection points.  As I understand from reports, the first group of 50 has been connected.  That is all that has been connected.  There are 51 connection points at the moment.  The Department, in reply to a media query, stated the shortfall was due to a disengagement locally when sites that were to be provided were backed out.  However, the Department's reply indicates that only 47 were withdrawn.  There seems to be a discrepancy in terms of what happened and why that number has reduced dramatically.</p><p>My other question is about penalties.  I engaged with Ministers and officials, including some of those present, on this matter for three and a half years.  We were assured that strict penalties and timelines would apply to the delivery of the contract.  Deputy Richard Bruton, when he was Minister, stated NBI was bound by contract and by the regulator.  He stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The contract we have put in place has checks and balances built in because National Broadband Ireland is privately owned.  That is why we have very strong governance arrangements in place, with key performance indicators, stringent penalties and a clawback of 40% of the value of the asset if it has value at the end of the process.  </blockquote> <p>The Department's website states there will be significant penalties &quot;to address underperformance&quot; to protect the State's investment.  There seems to be a discrepancy with regard to performance, in that we have learned that no penalty clause has been invoked to date.  Why is that?</p></speech>

A total of &euro;50 million was spent in 2020 - I am open to correction but that is what it was as far as I can ascertain - buying carbon credits from other countries.  How much do we expect to spend this year and over the decade up to 2030 on carbon credits?</p></speech>

We will not know until August 2021 whether that needs to be spent because we will have the final 2020 energy figures from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, at that stage.  That is on the renewable energy side.</p> <p>  On the carbon credits, that is, the spend to meet our emissions reductions targets, as Mr. Frank Maughan mentioned earlier, we had a target, by 2021, of a reduction of 20% in our emissions relative to 2025.  For a whole range of reasons, that will be somewhere in the region of 2% to 4%.  We have made significant investment, most of it in the period to 2012, in emissions reductions allowances, which we have banked.  We estimate but cannot be certain that the additional quantum required to meet our 2020 targets is &euro;6 million to &euro;13 million but, again, we have to do a bit of work to finalise that.</p> <p>  As we move into 2030, the focus over the next decade is to put in place a plan that will allow us deliver our 2030 targets and to make sure that that plan is delivered.  The delivery of that plan will be set out in legislation, which has just completed its passage through pre-legislative scrutiny in the Oireachtas and will be introduced in the D&aacute;il or Seanad in February.</p></speech>

Some of the companies were originally bidders and are not now.  We heard recently that some of those assets are being leveraged.  Is it the private national broadband company, the public purse or the individual householder that benefits?  Who benefits from driving down those costs?</p></speech>

The reduction in cost, should it arise, accrues to the State.  The subsidy is paid on the basis of expenditure incurred.</p><p>If there is a reduced tender price or if there is a redesign, say, for example, to use the ESB network to roll out some of this, the ESB will get a payment for the subsidy because it is a commercial company.  However, that would be fed back in through a dividend.  The State gets a 40% dividend from the ESB every year.  Accordingly, some of that will be factored into the dividend payment back to the State.</p></speech>

As the Secretary General rightly said, EirGrid is involved in the development of some substantial infrastructure.  I note from a previous freedom of information request, secured by the newspaper <i>The Northern Standard</i>, that the relationship seems to be a strange one, in that EirGrid was even consulted and contributed to ministerial responses to parliamentary questions among other issues.  A former Secretary General is now the chair of the board of EirGrid.  It seems to be a fairly seamless relationship with regard to some of the major infrastructural developments.</p><p>One has situations, to which the Secretary General referred, where there can often be community differences, to put it mildly, between EirGrid's stated position and the wishes of the communities affected.  I am referring specifically to the North-South interconnector.  Has the Department ever analysed the information it receives from EirGrid?  For example, has the Department ever analysed, visited or engaged with the ALEGrO interconnector development between Belgium and France?  This is undergrounded and is a model sought by many communities.  Does the Department, as appears to be the case, take its direction entirely from EirGrid?</p></speech>

The Deputy commented about a former Secretary General being chair of EirGrid.  The said man came through a process utterly independent of the Department, undertaken by the Public Appointments Service, strictly in accordance with the state aid guidelines and the name presented to the Minister.</p> <p>  Any factual information we take, we always critique it ourselves.  It is absolutely appropriate to speak to all our State agencies, whether it is EirGrid, the ESB, An Post or whoever else, to source information from time to time for particular processes.</p> <p>  On the ALEGrO interconnector, to the best of my recollection, when the 2018 international expert study review was being undertaken, it looked at a range of high-voltage direct-current, HVDC, underground cable projects and how they operated.  I stand to be corrected but I believe the ALEGrO one was considered.  I will double-check that for the Deputy.</p></speech>

The environment fund is used for measures such as the anti-dumping initiative, which has been hugely effective in counties throughout the State in recent years since we introduced it.  The fund supports measures such as the protecting uplands and rural environments project in the Wicklow mountains, which has been hugely successful and is a model we would like to see replicated more widely.  It also provides support to environmental NGOs in the form of funding.  There is a long list, which I will get and email to the Deputy, on where the moneys were disbursed in 2019.</p></speech>

There is good work being done but a huge problem has arisen in regard to CCTV cameras.  Unfortunately, many rural county councils have had to erect cameras at places where there is likely to be dumping taking place, including at bring banks, to stop people from dumping residual waste and to try to manage bring banks better.  Typically, it is a mobile set of cameras that moves from location to location.  I know the Data Protection Commission has a job to do and I do not want to speak badly of it but it has put the brakes on this measure.  This is driving people crazy, not just council officials but also the public.  While I do not wish to delay on the point today, will the Department come back to me on this issue, which is very important?  Everyone understands the right to privacy and all of that.  However, I can assure the Department that communities and people in rural and urban areas where there is illegal dumping taking place, some of it on a commercial basis, have no objection to a couple of small cameras being put up on a temporary basis and moved around from location to location.  We have to find a way to deal with this.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for the question.  There was a recent ruling by the Data Protection Commissioner, which sets a serious question mark over the use of some technology in some circumstances in terms of waste enforcement.  It does not rule it out completely but what we have committed to in the new waste management (amendment) Bill, which follows on from the waste action plan in September, is to data-proof all waste enforcement activity so any question mark over the continued use of CCTV and body cameras is completely clarified.  We expect to have that legislation in place this year.</p></speech>

Yesterday, I said to the Minister that in his home county of Donegal the industry has estimated that there could be a hit of up to 400 job loses.  In an industry that was already struggling to survive, the amount of fish we have lost is completely unsustainable.  The message from people in the industry is that they are not looking for financial compensation.  They are looking for a fair allocation of the fish in our exclusive economic zone and in other waters under the jurisdiction of the Common Fisheries Policy and, indeed, in waters belonging to the UK, which we are now a trading partner with.</p><p> This is a serious crisis.  I was taken aback by some of the Minister&rsquo;s comments yesterday.  I appreciate he has a huge portfolio, which includes agriculture, food and the marine and that he relies on advice from officials in the Department but it is time those official were confronted on the advice they are giving him.  I refer to one thing the Minister said yesterday.  He said fishing was the last issue to be resolved in the negotiations and that that was a sign of how hard people were working on the issue.  However, that is entirely contrary to the view of the industry.  In particular, I refer to the comments of Se&aacute;n O'Donoghue of the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation.  He said that they always understood that this would not be allowed to happen and that fisheries would not be left as the last item on the agenda to be resolved because that would leave it vulnerable to being sacrificed again.  That was his commentary which he was very clear about because he was part of the partnership of other EU member state fishing organisations, called the European Fisheries Alliance.  He was very clear that there was to be a united approach, that it was to be linked to the trade negotiations and that it would not be the last item on the agenda.  What has happened is that because it was the last item on the agenda there was a rush to get the deal over the line and our fishermen were sacrificed and they took a disproportionate hit.  This is a profound injustice.  We need the Government to understand that this is a profound injustice.  We need the Government to make this clear.</p><p> I put my first question to the Minister.  Will he now renegotiate a fair share of the fish in Irish waters for the Irish fishing industry?  Will he make it clear to his European partners that this is an injustice?  I am really disappointed that the Government voted against an amendment to the motion on the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement in recent days which merely called for it to renegotiate the Common Fisheries Policy to get a fair deal and a fair share of the fish in Irish waters for Irish fishers.  That was all we were asking for.  It was a very conservative ask and it was voted down.</p><p> Will the Minister take the opportunity to make it clear that he understands the seriousness of this crisis for the fishing industry and that he will go back and do everything he can to renegotiate a fair deal?  That is my first question.</p></speech>

That was a tremendous concern of the fishing sector and the Government from the outset.  That is why we worked so closely together throughout the process to ensure there was one united national voice.  The Government and I worked with our counterparts in other European maritime states and the industry representatives worked with their counterparts.  This was to ensure that the European approach was strong and resolute and that fishing was a key priority in the negotiations during the initial mandate and throughout the process.  Key to this all along was ensuring that fisheries were discussed in terms of the wider trade agreement.  That was essential in order to give us the strongest possible platform and to get a good outcome for the sector.</p> <p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn will know we catch one third of our fish in UK waters.  To have lost that in a no-deal scenario would have had a massive impact on our fishing sector and it would have had a significant impact in relation to displacement of other vessels in our waters.</p><p>The British negotiating stance was that they wanted to take back 100% the fish caught by EU fleets in their waters.  The ultimate outcome was that 25% would be reallocated over the course of five years.  The key thing all along was to ensure that this would be tied to other aspects of the trade agreement.  That was something we pushed for and ensured was the case at all stages.</p><p> In the final analysis, the three outstanding issues in the last couple of weeks, as we all know, were the issues of governance, a level playing field and fish.  In terms of time, it was essential to ensure fish would stay tied in the future to other aspects of the trade agreement.  There are conditions in there too to continue to ensure, for example, in relation to energy markets, that it stays tied.  We would certainly have liked even more leverage but our key objective in everything we did was using that leverage throughout and ensuring that there would be leverage going forward too.</p><p> The deal will see a 15% impact on our overall national quota between now and 2026.  That is certainly higher than other EU member states will be taking.  Germany is similar in terms of the proportion of its fleet but for other nations, it is less, significantly so for some of them.  I am certainly not happy with that situation.  It is not an outcome I wanted or we fought for.  We knew we were the nation that was most endangered from a fisheries point of view because more than any EU member state we share more of our species with the UK.  The species that are important to us are the species that are most important to the UK as well and they were coming after them.  We were always very much concerned by that.</p><p> The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, the Taoiseach and I, in all our respective engagements, had very clearly pushed the principle of burden sharing and fair burden sharing in the outcome of the agreement.  The outcome is not a fair reflection of burden sharing.  It impacts more on our fisheries sector and that is something I have taken up, very strongly, with the Commission.  On Tuesday morning I met with the task force chair, Michael Barnier, and the fisheries Commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevicius, and made it very clear that we were not at all happy about the additional burden we are taking.  I will be taking every opportunity to try to address that and across Government, that will be a key priority.</p><p> We are at one with the fishing sector in the objective of supporting it and emphasising the fact that this outcome does not reflect the principle of burden sharing.  I fully understand and am with it in that we want this raw material of fish for our sector which feeds into our processing sector, into jobs and into the wider economy.  That is our first objective.  We all know how challenging that battle always is at European level because every other country is fighting its corner as well but I certainly will be taking up that battle in every way I can, working alongside the fisheries sector.</p></speech>

It is of huge importance and I will get straight into what I need to say.  As far as I am concerned, after listening to fishermen, their unions and leaders, we are facing a massive crisis in fishing.  I am in a rural constituency, surrounded by water and fishing, that has seen cuts for the last number of years and neglect by successive governments.  I was in the D&aacute;il yesterday but the Minister did not get around to answering some of the questions, which I accept given that our time limits were very tight.  The preliminary analysis now confirms that the transfer of quota shares from Ireland is a staggering 27% higher than the Government initially announced.  The official report indicates a total loss to Ireland's fishermen in the mackerel sector of &euro;43 million by 2026.  This is most valuable to the Irish fleet, which has been hardest hit with a 26% cut in its quota share, worth &euro;28.6 million.</p><p>Around 60% of this cut will emerge in 2021 so the impact will be felt immediately.  What can the Minister offer fishermen?  I have been talking to people in the pelagic sector and they have told me they are facing wipe-out, massive drops in their income and job losses.  The only thing they hear from the Government is about a decommissioning and tie-up scheme.  Surely, there is something better for the Irish fishermen who see and want to see a future in the water other than a tie-up and a decommissioning scheme.  The Minister said he was talking to Michel Barnier during the week and raised with him the situation Irish fishermen were facing with an additional burden.  We did not get anywhere in the negotiations.  It looks to me Michel Barnier was negotiating.  I was always saying in the D&aacute;il that he was offering 18% and asking where the 18% of fish was coming from.  I always knew it was coming from Ireland at a cost to Irish fishermen.  No one seemed to want to take up the issue.  Mr. Barnier's president, Mr. Macron, was definitely at the wheel and was steering the ship.  He was not going to allow any deal until French fishermen were looked after.  Unfortunately, it seems they and other European countries were looked after at a cost to Irish fishermen.</p><p> Where do these fishermen go from here?  What is there future?  They are losing their income and their jobs.  There are going to be massive losses in coastal counties like the Minister's county of Donegal and in my constituency of Cork South-West.  What is the future?  I do not want to hear about decommissioning because if that is the future for Irish fishermen, it is a very bleak one.  I asked the Minister about the number of EU, non-Irish, UK and other coastal state vessels that have authorisation to fish in the biologically sensitive area in the Celtic Sea, off our west coast, in the Irish Sea and off our Donegal coast?  I asked the Minister another question yesterday, which he did not have the chance to answer as the time was very tight.  How does one monitor the amount of fish these vessels catch every day in Irish waters?  The Minister might be able to answer those questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021012200002#D00300"><p>I was.  </p> <p>  On the Deputy's point on the total value of the impact of the quota transfer on Ireland, the initial analysis after the agreement was based on EU average prices.  That was the assessment the EU had carried out based on EU average prices.  The quota share and the total tonnage has been the same from the outset.  That has been very clear.  A tonne is a tonne.  The various impacts on different species have not changed.  We carried out our own assessment using Irish prices on the Irish market, extrapolating that in relation to other species as well.  No matter which country does it, or what value one would use per tonne, different species would impact the assessment on it.  The initial impact was based on EU average prices.  That would have been the European Commission assessment.  Every country applying its national prices to it would have a different figure.  The tonnes remain the same but in our assessment, the best and clearest way for us to do it is to see how it impacts our national prices.  If one were to do it based on the EU average prices, the figure discussed immediately after the agreement, &euro;32 million, would have had a 13.4% impact on the overall value from an Irish point of view.  When we apply our own prices to it, we would calculate that at &euro;43 million, which would be 15%.  Each member state would have different calculations depending on what value it puts on different fish or different species.  We used our own.</p> <p>  I refer to my objective throughout the negotiations.  As a representative of Donegal, the county most affected by fisheries, I was very much aware of the absolute importance of fisheries, no more than Deputy Collins who represents a county and a constituency which is similarly affected like many of our coastal counties.  Our objective, working with the fishing industry, throughout the negotiating process was not to have any give in terms of fish.  That was the line we held to and pushed at all times.</p><p>As everyone is aware, a no-deal Brexit would have been quite catastrophic from a fisheries perspective.  The outcome to the deal is going to have an impact.  While the impact will not be on the scale of a no-deal Brexit, it will nonetheless have a significant impact on our fleet compared to some of the other fleets one might look at.  My objective and mission at EU level is to fight for fishing every way we can and, while working with our sector on how we can support it, to address what is undoubtedly an impact.  There is an impact for all member states with regard to the Common Fisheries Policy.  I am moving to set up a task force to ensure the sector and the communities most impacted by the Brexit outcome are central to how we actually support them to grow and to ensure the maximum value for our fisheries sector in the time ahead.  This is a fundamental impact.  We have all known over the past three to four years how fundamental Brexit could be and how damaging it could be.  Thankfully that damage was limited but it could not be entirely avoided.  Now we must work to address that to ensure the sector is invested in and prioritised in the time ahead to make the absolute most of the sector and the very valuable resources we have.</p></speech>

I got the document just before the meeting started and have looked through it while the discussion was ongoing.  We have had a number of debates on the floor of the D&aacute;il on fishing, yesterday included.  This is a very serious situation for the fishing industry.  It is debatable how it can survive the actual cuts that are talked about here.  It definitely will not survive in its current state.  The industry would have to decline significantly to be viable with these cuts.</p> <p>  I am aware that the opening statement is being taken as read.  The Minister's opening statement states in the first paragraph that this "means that Ireland's key Brexit objectives have been achieved".  Do we take it that fishing was not one of the key objectives?  If that is the case, fair enough, but the Government should say that rather than leading the fishing organisations and the fishermen astray in relation to it.  Our key Brexit objectives may have been achieved but fishing has been left to one side and left on its own.</p> <p>  The Minister outlined yesterday in the D&aacute;il, and in his opening statement today, a meeting he had with Michel Barnier and the EU fisheries Commissioner in recent days at which the Minister outlined Ireland's disappointment at the outcome of the negotiations.  In the D&aacute;il debate yesterday and in today's statement, the Minister has not outlined what their response was.  I believe that how the EU has responded to Ireland's concerns would be the most interesting part of it.  The reality is that the Minister will have to go back into the Common Fisheries Policy negotiations to try to get, for the first time ever, a fair deal for Ireland.  It is clear, from the way the rest of the countries dealt with the Brexit negotiations, that Ireland is being left behind with regard to fairness and equity within the EU, and always has been.  The Minister must undo that in the upcoming negotiations.  I wish him well and good luck with that because it is vitally important for our communities right along the coast.</p> <p>  In his opening statement the Minister also referred to the task force he intends to establish to look at the future of the fishing industry.  I ask that he would consider having representatives of crews, not the vessel owners but the actual crews, and representatives of workers in the fish factories to participate in the task force.  Their voices are, to a large extent, lost in this discussion and they are the people who will be immediately impacted in respect of the changes taking place.</p></speech>

Every part of our economy, peace on our Island and fishing, in particular, were exposed as a result of Brexit.  These were all included as key objectives.  It was really important that we got a deal, not least from a fisheries point of view in that one third of our fish are caught in UK waters, significant displacement would have resulted from a no-deal and our 1,900 boats would not have been able to access UK waters.  The Deputy knows, from a Killybegs point of view, how important that is and the impact it would have had.  We always knew that there was a challenge in respect of fully protecting fish.  It had been put up in lights as the key objective of the British Government in the negotiations.  It was one of the key reasons given to British people during the Brexit campaign that they should vote for Brexit and take back control of the fish in their waters.  As we know, throughout the negotiations the British were looking to take back 100% of the fish caught in their waters.  The ultimate outcome was that 25% of the fish caught by the EU fleet in their waters would be reallocated and that, in return, mutual reciprocal access for the EU fleet to fish in UK waters would continue.</p> <p>  Many of the stock desired by British fishermen and Scottish fishermen are also desired by us.  There are many valuable species, but mackerel and prawn are two of the most important and invaluable species for our fleet.  They were the two that the British Government were really going after in the negotiations.  We fought tooth and nail to ensure that the line was kept and that we would protect our fishing industry.  Unfortunately, in order to achieve a deal, a reallocation of 25% was involved, and we bear the weight of that more disproportionately than other member states.  </p> <p>  Looking across the rest of the economy, there is a recognition, as there was at the outset, that apart from Britain, the country most likely to be damaged and suffer from Brexit, was Ireland.  This is the case very much in respect of our fishing sector, but also right across our economy.  The Brexit adjustment reserve was allocated last week to countries most impacted by Brexit.  The fishing industry is an element of that, but only a certain element of it.  Ireland got 25% of that total EU fund.  That is a reflection of the fact that our country's economy is most impacted by Brexit and that includes our fishing industry.  At the European level, my objective is to fight for our fishermen and fisherwomen.  That is ultimately what they want.  I will also work alongside them in addressing what undoubtedly is the result of Brexit and the impact on our own fleet and those of others.  In respect of our own fleet, I will invest, work with and involve them and seek direction on how to best I, as Minister, and the Government, can support them in the time ahead.</p></speech>

I am sure none of us is expecting other member states to be coming forward and offering us their fish.  That is a battle and a challenge we will face.  I will take every opportunity going forward to try to get a result for our fishermen.  As Deputy Pringle knows, having watched fishery negotiations over the years, that is always challenging.  The Government has been clear about the importance of burden-sharing coming out of the fisheries agreement.  We wanted that to be reflected in the agreement itself, and if there was a give regarding fish, it should be spread across member states.  If the outcome of the negotiations does not address that burden, then we will be in a situation at European level where will be engaging with other member states about the challenge of applying burden-sharing afterwards.  That is where matters stand.  I have made it clear - and Germany is similar - that we are the member state that has sustained the biggest impact as a result of the reallocation.  The EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council will meet on Monday and I will take this matter up again at that meeting.  We will take it up at every opportunity in order to try to find constructive ways in which it can be addressed.</p> <p>  I have had discussions with the industry and will be engaging in detail about the task force and its composition.  I am open to contributions that members of the committee wish to make for consideration.</p></speech>

We have been well-warned about the consequences of Brexit.  Listening to some contributions, they make it sound simple.  The negotiations in recent years by the Minister and his predecessors, Deputies Coveney and Creed, have not been simple.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned a task force and getting the maximum value out of our fishing industry and coastal communities.  I would like him to flesh out what he expects and wants and who will sit on such a task force, and making sure that processors and everybody involved in the fishing industry will be represented on that task force.</p> <p>  A question raised in my coastal community in Wexford is about scallop fishermen who were fishing off the southern coast of the UK.  Up until now, they have been allowed to dock and land their scallops in the UK and transport them back to Ireland.  Now they can land their boats in the UK but they have to go to UK-based processors.  If they do not do so, they cannot land.  That would mean they have to go to Belgium or such to get the scallops transported to Ireland.  They are asking if there can be a derogation for that, otherwise they will have to steam back to Wexford and to other coastal communities here.  What is proposed does not make sense.  They are seeking a derogation.  They also understand that there are other issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021012200002#G00400"><p>Regarding the task force, it is not just about the value of fish and its impact.  It is also a matter of what it means for the processing sector, employment and the spin-off sectors, whether engineering, boat-building, maintenance or the local economy which depends on fishing in coastal areas.  It is important that the task force reflects that.  I will consider any input from committee members about that.</p><p>I intend to set up the task force promptly.  There is a three-month window to the end of March during which there will be parity in respect of the quotas that can be caught during that time, which is important.  That was agreed in December but there is an urgency around this regarding how we support the sector in the time ahead.  I want to ensure that the task force plays a key role in informing the way we go forward.</p><p> The Government stands ready to support the sector.  We understand the impact of what has happened and the challenge to be faced.  We are also very much aware of the fact that the sector still has a very strong future but that Brexit has had a real impact on it.  We need to consider how we work to support those in the sector to address that in terms of the outcome of the negotiations and engaging at European level on quota discussions but also, domestically, in the context of how we can best support the industry and the coastal communities that depend on it in the time ahead.</p><p> With regard to scallop fishermen, there are real challenges now with regard to landing catches, particularly in Britain.  We have seen the tremendous challenges the Scottish fishermen have had, and fishermen across Britain, in exporting their fish and the red tape involved.  It is ironic that the British Government is having to come forward with a financial package to support them.  That is a very long way from the scenario and horizons that were explained to them during the Brexit negotiations.  There are significant challenges now with regard to additional red tape and how vessels land.  I will further examine the particular issue the Deputy raised and revert to him on it.</p></speech>

This is about keeping the processing plants open in our coastal communities also.  Rather than landing into the UK and having to go to UK processors, we want to do our best to keep processors on our own island in business.</p></speech>

This is a very important meeting because we need information on this major issue.  Brexit was always going to have a major impact on the fishing industry.  A no-deal scenario would have crippled the industry at every level.  This is a bad deal but a no-deal scenario would have crucified us.</p> <p>  Can the Minister elaborate on the timeline he is proposing in the context of getting the task force up and running?  Will that require legislation or will it be done by means of a ministerial order?  What will be the actual process relating to the establishment of this task force?  How will its members be chosen and how it will be funded?</p> <p>  On the significant funding package from Europe, how much does the Minister believe will be made available to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is the most affected of all Departments?  Where does he see that kind of money being spent?  It is a substantial amount of long-term money.  What is the Minister's vision for that money in terms of this sector?</p></speech>

In the coming days I will be moving to consult with all stakeholders in the sector on the format of and terms of reference relating to the task force.  The key objective is to have a full assessment of the impact on those who know best in terms of what the outcome of Brexit means for the sector and to ensure that this informs the way we move forward in terms of both supporting them in the time ahead and the national response.  The Government stands ready in terms of the necessity to invest in our fishing sector in the time ahead.  The Brexit adjustment reserve is available to provide support in respect of the impact of Brexit across our wider economy, including the fishing sector.  I have no doubt, however, that there will be significant additional national funds, particularly for fishing in terms of the impact on that sector.  That will be very much informed by the views of those who are affected and who know best how that can be utilised to support the sector in the future.</p><p>On the Brexit adjustment reserve in general and the agrifood and marine sector, there will be engagement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance on how it is distributed across the economy.  There is a really clear commitment and understanding at Government level on standing ready to support the fisheries sector in the time ahead.  That will be very much in addition to what is available in the Brexit adjustment reserve.</p></speech>

I have not been at a meeting since he became Minister so I wish him well.  He is doing very well.</p> <p>  On the task force, I hope that we would have representatives of the fisheries, not civil servants or people who would be dictating to the fishermen.  It must be the people who are involved in the business, such as the processors and the fishermen themselves, who have a big say in it.  What will the task force look at?  What will it do?  Who will distribute the funding from Europe to the fishermen?  Will it come directly from Europe to the fishermen or will it come through the Department?</p></speech>

I agree with him completely on the task force.  It is about making sure that those who are impacted or affected and, indeed, who know best about how the sector works and how it can be supported, are particularly supported to address the impact of Brexit and to move on and have a sustainable, successful future.  That is what it is about.  We must ensure they inform the future direction of the sector and how we go forward with investment in the time ahead.</p> <p>  On the Brexit adjustment reserve, the funding will be allocated at national level for member countries to decide how they are used nationally.  There will be significant discussions and engagement within the Government on the overall use of that.  Particularly for fisheries, there is a very clear commitment on national funding which will be required to support the sector, which is one of those most impacted.</p></speech>

While I agree with what he has said in that what is there is better than no deal, it is far from desirable from the perspective of the fishing industry.</p> <p>  Some of my points have already been raised.  It seems there is a disproportionate reduction in our quota from the European side.  Has due regard been given to what were known as The Hague preferences, where preferential treatment was given to UK and Irish quotas and total allowable catches?  There does not seem to have been any regard to The Hague preferences here when the loss of quota was being divvied up.</p><p>The Irish sector seems to have lost a disproportionate amount of quota.  Has that rebalanced the book from the European side?  Is our argument here with our colleagues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021012200002#K00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  As I said previously, the most straightforward way to ensure there was equitable burden sharing was in regard to the deal itself.  Of course, we were pushing at all stages for there not to be any move or any fish lost, but if there was to be fish lost or reallocated from the EU fleet to the UK fleet, we wanted that done in a way that spread the pain and the burden across member states.  We knew the challenge in that we are the member state that shares the most species with the UK and, given our proximity, the species that are really important to us are really important to them.  That was always a big challenge from our point of view and why, right through the negotiations, we pushed that principle of burden sharing.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, the outcome of the agreement does not reflect that and does put more of a burden on Ireland, and it is an issue that I, with European colleagues, will be looking to have addressed.  That will undoubtedly be challenging because every member state is massively protective of its fish share, and fish is equally important to fishermen everywhere.  However, there is a reality in terms of the fact Brexit has disproportionately impacted our fisheries sector in particular, along with other parts of our economy.</p> <p>  In terms of constructive solutions at European level, I will explore different options, including the Hague principles, to see how that might be addressed.  I do not for one second underestimate the challenges but we all have to, and I certainly will, push to make it very clear that the outcome is unfair to us and needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

I represent a Border constituency like that of Deputy Mac Lochlainn and I am Chairman of a committee Deputy Mac Lochlainn serves on, the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  I am here today to show my appreciation of and concern for what is an issue that affects all of our island, even though we have different political administrations, North and South.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister.  The last time I spoke to him it turned out he had Covid but, thankfully, we were both wearing masks at the time and it was on a main street.  I wish him well and I wish him success in the work he is doing.  We would be very happy to familiarise ourselves, as a committee, with any issue we can articulate and support, and to try to get support, North and South.  We all know fish know no borders.  We have a border in this country and we must do our very best to alleviate the significant adverse impact Brexit is having on our communities and on our fisheries.  I am speaking in that context.  The Minister is very welcome to come before our committee at the appropriate time.  I know Deputy Mac Lochlainn was anxious to articulate that our committee is extremely concerned and would love to be in involved in the appropriate way with any initiatives the Minister may have, or that we could possibly assist in, because we have representatives from other parties that are not represented in our Parliament.  There are many people who want to see continued commercial success for the fisheries industry, North and South, if we can manage to hold a line that both parts of the island can support and articulate.</p></speech>

They do not want to be divided by this agreement.  They want to unite.  I will feed back to the Minister what they are saying and I urge the Department to engage with the fishing organisations in the North to hear what they have to say.  It might be surprised that they have a very different view from the fishers across the water.</p><p>The framework of the Common Fisheries Policy has been relative stability, which is based on fishing practices in the 1970s and 1980s.  This framework of relative stability has been fundamentally undermined by this trade deal in which the British Government put zonal attachment, whereby the fish would benefit the fishing communities closest to the waters.  I argue that the Minister needs to advance this proposition and that Ireland needs to argue for similar treatment.</p><p> While we say the British were looking for their waters, we have to be realistic, and I say this in the context of Ireland and Britain.  We are exporting into a market of 500 million people in the European Union.  Therefore, everybody accepts there has to be compromise in accessing the waters.  The problem for Ireland is we have given away far too much of our share of the fish in our waters.  We have to rebalance this.  This is an opportunity to rebalance the injustice not only of this deal but of deals of the past.  This is why we tabled an amendment to the Minister's motion in recent days.  We need to unite across all political parties on this island.  Every political party on this island needs to unite and demand that our fishers get a fair share, not an unreasonable share, of the fish in our waters.  I ask the Minister to join and unite across the political divide on this objective.</p><p> I ask that this allocation of &euro;113 million for our fishing community arising from Brexit be increased substantially and that the fishing industry that Deputy Pringle spoke about, the fishers themselves and the people who work in the factories, be involved in how that money is allocated to our communities.  It is so important that the money goes to all of the people impacted by this.</p></speech>

Those countries have a deal with which some of them are happy enough.  They have a far better deal than what we got.  In my view, it should be shared equally throughout Europe but, unfortunately, it looks like this will not be the case.  If this is the case, we will be left with a situation where we will have massive job losses.  Does the Government have ready-made jobs to replace those we will lose from the decommissioning?</p></speech>

I welcome Deputy O'Dowd's support as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  To touch on Deputy Mac Lochlainn's point, the all-island aspects of this are important.  I met the Minister, Mr. Poots, and his team on Tuesday night for a thorough discussion on emerging Brexit issues.  It is very important that there is strong engagement and co-operation and this is something I very much value.  It is something I have had very strongly with the Minister, Mr. Poots, and the Northern Ireland Executive since I was appointed and it will continue, particularly with regard to the fisheries aspect after Brexit.</p> <p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn made a point on relative stability and zonal attachment which, of course, was a key argument the British Government made in advance of Brexit and throughout the negotiations, in terms of ensuring its national quota would reflect what is caught in British waters.</p><p>Taking back their fish and waters was one of the key objectives put to the British people to vote for Brexit in the first place and throughout the negotiations.  Despite looking to take back 100% of the fish caught in UK waters, the final arrangement from the negotiations resulted in a 25% allocation over four to five years.</p><p> Britain is now outside the European Union and the Common Fisheries Policy but there is still reciprocal access to waters, thankfully, as a result of the trade and co-operation agreement.  Thankfully, we managed to hold the 100% ask about the reallocation of fish caught in their waters to 25%.  That is still 25% too much in our estimate.  It means a 15% impact on our national quota.  That pain is a reflection of why we do not want to give any.  Despite the UK having left the European Union, there is still that opportunity for ourselves and other EU fishermen to catch fish in UK waters, however.</p><p> It is always massively contested at European level.  Every country values the quotas they have.  There is reality, however, with the Brexit negotiations, our proximity and the number of species we share with Britain.  This has resulted in a disproportionate burden on ourselves compared to other EU member states.  I will be taking that forward looking for constructive ways to have that addressed with the objective of making sure that we prioritise quota share for Irish fishermen.</p><p> That is a battle we will be having.  We know there will be an impact and a readjustment as a result of Brexit.  That is the key rationale behind moving to set up the task force.  It will use the experience, understanding and insight from coastal communities and those involved in various aspects of the sector.  That will very much inform how we can address investing in coastal communities and in the fishing sector in the time ahead.</p></speech>

From 1 April, they will be prohibited from landing their catch in the UK and transporting it back to Ireland for processing.

He was a good friend and colleague to all of us.</p> <p>  In terms of the question that was asked about the task force, we obviously welcome it but there are two things I am concerned about.  The first is that it could become a talking shop and the second is that it could delay us from the immediate action we could take here.</p><p>I did not hear all of the Minister's presentation but, as I see it, we need to take up the burden-sharing immediately.  That cannot mean waiting for a task force to make such decisions.  The task force should examine matters such as those Deputy Mac Lochlainn outlined to the Minister, namely, the issues with relative stability and the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, review.  I think they would be long-term issues rather than short-term ones.  When I talk about the short term, I am talking about addressing the burden-sharing in the next two months rather than next year.</p><p> I will leave the questions on scallops and processors to my colleagues in the IS&amp;EFPO, given that we are not directly involved in the scallop fishery.  I hope I have answered the Deputy's question on the task force.</p></speech>

It was much appreciated.  Deputy Kehoe's question to the Minister in regard to scallops is very relevant to our organisation.  All seven of the Irish scallop boats are our members.  I have asked a similar question of the Department and am awaiting an answer.  The issue is that from 31 March, our scallop vessels will not be able to land in the UK, as they currently do when they are fishing in the Channel.  It is too far to come back to Ireland and the cost of getting the product back from France to Wexford to be processed would be double the cost that it is now when doing so from the UK.  I believe that to land in the UK after 31 March, scallops would need a health certificate for onward transportation.  To my knowledge, the product would have to go through a processor in the UK to achieve this and testing would have to be done on the scallops before they could be exported from a third country back to the EU.  What was being asked for was some form of derogation or system whereby the truck could be sealed in the UK and not opened until it reached the factory in Ireland.</p></speech>

No one knows more than they do the catastrophic crisis the industry faces.  The issue greatly affects my constituency, so I welcome their contributions to the meeting.</p> <p>  The Minister stated when the deal was done that it was a fair one.  I was astonished when I heard that.  He stated that there would be losses of &euro;34 million, but it now transpires that the losses could be anything up to &euro;43 million.  Our guests might comment on that.</p> <p>  I asked the Minister the following question but he did not give a clear answer.  Has the Government given any indication to our guests' organisations whether it has any ready-made jobs to replace the ones we are guaranteed to lose?  There has been much talk about the task force, and task forces are fine and great, but the crisis is here and now.  Approximately 60% of the cuts will emerge in 2021, so the impact will be felt immediately.  No matter how good the task force is, it will not resolve the crisis that we face now.  Mr. Murphy of the ISWFPO might be able to answer some of those questions.  Is tourism our way out?  Is that what the Government has in mind to replace these jobs?  What is the indication from the Department, if any?</p></speech>

The acknowledgement and the minute of silence the committee gave were much appreciated.</p><p> I will start with a bit of information on scallops and why this is a problem.  Scallops digest and filter water and in that water there is plankton.  Sometimes that plankton creates a toxin in the gut of the fish.  Normally they are tested to see that they are within the proper parameters so they can be moved and shipped.  For that to happen, those vessels would, as Mr. Lynch said, have to be processed in the UK and only the meat sent back.  The processing would be done over there so the solution would be a derogation for those fish to be tested before being processed here.  They would be sealed in closed lorries and sent back for processing.  That would resolve the problem there, keep jobs and help those boats to be viable in their costings.</p><p> On the question of the task force, we welcome that and any engagement whatsoever, particularly with the knowledge base we can see that we all share.  We come from different parts of the industry.  I cover a number of them so I hope I will be able to contribute to developing something that would mitigate the damage.  I agree with my colleague, Mr. O'Donoghue, that this is an immediate threat.  We are going to lose fish.  We have already lost fish at the start of this year, and each month we sit together and try to share out what we have between our vessels.  It is hugely complicated by the landing obligation.  If we catch the lowest denominator of fish, it means we cannot catch the rest of the fish because we would be engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated, IUU, fishing.  With opportunities being narrowed, it has a huge effect on us trying to earn a living.</p><p> We will look into the task force but I think Mr. O'Donoghue has articulated what we need.  We need a correct and proper share-out of the burden.  We have to understand this burden is not just the loss of fishing from our industry that our boats lose.  It is also the fish that we have to pay from our waters.  It is hard to explain to the fishermen that they have to leave the jobs that are there not because there are no fish there but because we are giving the fish to somebody else.  The reason we are giving it to somebody is else is that they have claimed more fish under zonal attachment, and that zonal attachment means that because fish are in one's waters, one gets more fish.  It is a contradiction in terms and it is hard for our industry to be told that perhaps a quarter of those working in the industry will have to leave and, not only that, but future generations will not be able to enter the industry either.</p><p> The positive side is that we asked for the setting up of a task force with immediate effect.  We have to know what the next measures to be taken are and we cannot wait, as Mr. O'Donoghue said.  It has to be immediate because the effects are immediate.  We know that from this month's quota for monkfish.  We are already looking for swaps from foreign countries to keep our boats fishing in areas.</p></speech>

I join the Cathaoirleach in extending sympathy to the family and friends of Hugo Boyle.  I had the privilege of meeting Hugo on a number of occasions and speaking to him on many occasions.  He was a thoroughly decent man and a genuine person for uniting the industry to stand together and stand up for their interests.  He will be badly missed.  I am proud that he was a Donegal man.  I am sure he will be thinking of us and will be with us in spirit for the next big fight we have to make.</p> <p>  I made the appeal earlier to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue.  I have been speaking to all facets of the fishing industry in Ireland: the producer organisation leaders, the inshore sector, the island sector and all the people across the island.  I will meet with leaders of the fishing industry in the North of Ireland today.  My appeal is that we unite across all political parties and all sectors of fisheries to defend our interests right now.  We have accepted reluctantly the relative stability model for many years.</p><p>The approach of the British Government in its trade negotiations was for zonal attachment.  Truth be told, it never believed in a million years that it would get what it said it wanted because it is exporting to a market of 500 million people.  In the presentations made by Mr. Murphy and Mr. O'Donoghue to the committee before the deal was done, it was pointed out that approximately 74% of British fishing produce is exported to the EU.  Of course, the British was never going to get what it specified but it has got acceptance of the principle of zonal attachment, which is a game changer.  We now need to build on that.  I agree with Mr. O'Donoghue's comment that in the short or immediate term, we need to fight for burden sharing.  The submission is spot on in that regard.  We need to secure burden sharing immediately in the negotiations in the days, weeks and months ahead.  We must also agree together that the practice of relative stability, which bases the share of fish in Irish waters that we get on the fishing practices of the 1970s, makes no sense anymore.  We are not looking for all the fish in our seas.  We are aware that we have to export to the EU, with its population of 500 million, but we are looking for a fair share that allows sustainable living for all our fishermen.  I ask all the IFPO leaders to give me their thoughts on the call to unite together across the island of Ireland, the industry and all political parties.  Hopefully the task force can be part of that.  I refer to making a united call regarding what we want from the immense marine resource around our island.</p><p> This is the only remaining island state in the EU.  It is the only island state in the EU surrounded entirely by water.  We have a Minister responsible for agriculture, food and the marine and two Ministers of State but neither of the Ministers of State has responsibility for the marine.  That is the situation we are in.  We do not have a focus and we have taken our eye off the ball.  That is how we allowed this situation to arise.  There is no point crying over spilt milk, however.  We have to talk about how we move forward.  Do the witnesses agree that we all need to unite and ask for a different approach in the Common Fisheries Policy than that of relative stability, which has failed us over the years?</p></speech>

As far as the producer organisations are concerned, we have no problem at all regarding the request.  We are united in trying to do something about this terrible Brexit deal that was given to us.  I would go a little further than the Deputy in that the real problem we have is that we are very much the junior partner in a very large Department.  Unfortunately, the agriculture element of the Department is very sizeable and very important to the country.  While the marine is at the coat-tails of agriculture, we will never get the representation that we require.</p></speech>

I had another meeting and it ran on.</p> <p>  Without repeating what has been said, I contend Irish fisheries have been the poor relation in our relationship with the EU for too long.  The core problem, as Deputy Mac Lochlainn said, is the notion of relative stability.  It has been a burden that no Government has seriously tried to address.</p><p>I mean no disrespect to the Minister but his efforts in engaging with his fellow ministers at that level will not result in the type of sea change, or even shorter-term burden sharing, that is required.  No other fisheries minister in Europe has an interest in or anything to be gained from trying to ensure a deal or change of that nature.  Therefore, the approach needs to be Government-led and across all Departments when we engage with the EU.</p><p> If we seek fundamental reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in isolation, the answer will be "No".  We must tie it in with other concerns, as other member states do on other matters all the time.  We could say, for example, that we will not support any further EU treaty change unless the policy is also reviewed and reformed.  We could indicate that we will not agree to other major fundamental reforms being pushed by the EU unless this also becomes part of the conversation.  We have seen during the Brexit negotiations that for an Irish priority to become a European priority, it must be led by the Government.</p><p> This is not to say the Department does not have a fundamental role.  I welcome Mr. Ward's response to Deputy Mac Lochlainn but do the other speakers agree with our analysis that there is a need for a Minister with responsibility for fisheries to ensure the approach I speak about can be prioritised within our Government in the first instance?  I deal with the Department all the time and it is clear fisheries and the marine are the poor relation.  Part of the problem undoubtedly arises because for a long period we have not had political leadership prioritising fisheries in the Department.  I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on such matters.  I thank them again for taking the time to attend this morning.</p></speech>

I fully agree that we need a full approach across all sectors with everybody pushing together.  I do not want to be sidetracked from the immediate position, however.  We have a very bad fisheries deal that is hitting us here and now.  We need action.  I do not need sympathy from the Government or Ministers; I need action.</p> <p>  The burden sharing can be achieved and there is precedent for doing it.  It was done between 1976 and 1983 when we were setting out the relative stability keys that we have been talking about.  These are quota shares, to put it in layman's terms.  It is forgotten that the UK benefitted hugely at that time, getting an extra 90,000 tonnes of fish that it held right up until the trade negotiations.  We fought tooth and nail that it should have been taken from the British but they managed to keep that allocation as well.  It is valued at &euro;80 million.  I have said that the value transferred by the EU to the UK is &euro;182 million but we should add another &euro;80 million because the UK held on to those extra quotas.</p> <p>  This was done through "equalisation" and that 90,000 tonnes of fish came from other member states.  We need to sit down with colleagues immediately and indicate that Ireland has been hit disproportionately by this.  We have done a very detailed analysis of the 124 stocks that are part of the trade agreement.</p><p>We can show exactly what member states got hit the worst and there is no doubt but that Ireland is greatly disproportionately hit than the other member states.  I note that the Minister mentioned that Germany is in a similar position to us.  Germany is not in a similar position because we got hit on our two main species to the tune of &euro;26 million on mackerel and &euro;7 million on prawns.  As I have done the analysis, I can show that no other member state got hit like that and we need to address the matter.  </p><p>  As Deputies Carthy and Mac Lochlainn mentioned, back in the 1970s we had the Hague preferences that addressed the inequity in burden sharing and relative stability.  I stress to this committee that we need action now.  As the decommissioning of vessels and communities is unacceptable, together we must move might and main to ensure that will not happen.</p></speech>

We had one for many years although it might only have had a junior Minister.  The reality is that there is no political responsibility so having a Department will not make a difference because Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have never put fishing at the heart of their demands.  If we had political responsibility then it would not matter whether we had a specific Department.</p> <p>  Three times the Minister has refused to answer what actual deal he had.  He said that he had discussions and meetings with Mr. Barnier and the EU fisheries Commissioner where he outlined Ireland's concerns about the deal.  The Minister did not outline any of their responses on three separate occasions, which is telling.  Much was made at the June Brexit negotiations that our fishery organisations had tied in with the fishery organisations of the six member states to campaign on fisheries.  What response did the Minister and his colleagues in member states to the fisheries deal that Ireland got?  If we know that then it might give us some indication of the best way to move forward from here.</p></speech>

A core principle of the alliance is that no member state or fleet segment should be disproportionately affected.  On 19 December, we sent that clear message to the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and we have since sent it to the European Parliament.  My colleagues in the European Fishing Alliance have accepted the principle.  I expect that our Government will rigorously pursue the disproportionality because there is an immediate need.  I think I have answered the Deputy's question on what their views have been on this matter.</p></speech>

It was initially set up to give the Irish and the UK a degree of preferential treatment in the context of quotas and total allowable catches, TACs.  In the context of the UK's departure from the EU, do the witnesses believe the Hague preferences have been utilised to the fullest extent possible by the Irish fishing industry?  </p> <p>  I fully agree with Deputy Mac Lochlainn on the importance of approaching this with a completely united front, North and South.  I am a bit taken aback that since Deputy Mac Lochlainn's contribution, we have seen what is a very serious and important issue being turned into a political football.  There is no future in that.  We need to act collectively here, as a united front, to get the best results for our fishing industry.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.291" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021012200002#U00200"><p>Mr. Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Donoghue has set out very clearly the approach that we need to adopt if we are going to undo what is a devastatingly bad deal for our country.  The Hague preferences were designed to mitigate the damage to coastal communities when quotas were cut.  If cuts were to be made to ensure the sustainability of stocks, the burden of those cuts would be mitigated or lessened for the country in whose waters the fish were located.  That was an acknowledgement that, as I said earlier, the fish are in Irish and UK waters.  If one looks at maps of Irish and British waters, one can see the continental shelf, which is one of the reasons we have so many visiting fishing fleets in our waters.  They come here because the fish are here.  Again, it is hard to tell my fishermen and members that not only are they giving up fish but the fish in our waters are being used to pay the bill for other countries.  That is an added stress that we have to endure.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Collins asked a very relevant question earlier.  If this deal goes ahead as we fear, it will lead to job losses.  We cannot have a fishing industry that does not have enough fish to catch.  The regulations will force us to engage in illegal, unreported and unregulated, IUU, fishing.  It is difficult enough with the small quotas that we have to keep the fleet going.  I remind members that in 2006, we had 280 vessels over 18 m in our demersal fleet but now there are only 164 such vessels on the register.  How many of those boats will have to be sacrificed?  Those boats represent jobs, real lives and real communities and that fact keeps getting lost in the discussion.  A sum of &euro;43 million might not seem like a lot of money in the greater scheme of things but as Mr. O'Donoghue said, it will mean the shutting down of coastal communities.  It will mean the loss of jobs and the closure of factories.  The herring industry has already been decimated.  We have given up all but 1% of Irish Sea herring to the UK.  Nobody else was sharing that fish stock.  That is what we gave up.</p> <p>  I wish to return to a point made by Deputy Pringle earlier.  Most of the vessel owners I represent are also operators and crew members.  We represent all of the different segments of the industry.  I started off in the inshore segment but have a different role now as CEO of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation.  We have inshore members as well and as part of the task force will be representing a multitude of other stakeholders in the industry.  We will be representing people like my father, for example, who operates an angling boat and a ferry service.  We have everybody's interests at heart.  We represent the coastal communities of Ireland, not just the fishing sector because we are all linked together.  Many fishermen do not earn enough from the inshore industry and have to do other jobs like small farming and so forth.  We are all linked together and are all in this together.  This deal will devastate coastal communities.  Mr. Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Donoghue must be listened to and we must act immediately.</p><p>We are asking the committee to pursue the ideas and the strategies Mr. O'Donoghue has clearly outlined.  This is not new territory; it has been done before.  We are begging your good selves at this stage to follow on from this.  It is not just today.  It starts today, I hope, and we move on from there.</p></speech>

I remember very well the stark warnings they gave.  I also remember the presentation they made in recent months, and here we are today.</p> <p>  I want to talk about the task force.  Mr. O'Donoghue is right that we have to get to get down to business immediately and deal with the various crises, but we also have to plot a future for the industry.  We will need to have a united voice in that regard.  We have to agree what our call will be.  When we go to the European Union, what is it that we want from our Government?  What approach do we want to the Common Fisheries Policy?  All those issues have to be dealt with by the task force.  I have heard reference to the figure for financial compensation  This committee should reject any proposals on decommissioning, but financial supports will be required in the short term to deal with the impact.  I was speaking to the Foyle Fishermen's Co-operative Society in Donegal yesterday and in recent days and the impact of this on them is up to one third of their income.  They have just invested &euro;3 million in their new building on the harbourside in Greencastle.  The repayments on that will not be sustainable if they are to lose one third of their income.  That is the scale of the immediate crisis.</p> <p>  We have obtained over &euro;1 billion as part of the Brexit fund.  My understanding is that only &euro;113 million of this money is for the fishing sector.  Do the witnesses agree that we need a much bigger share of that &euro;1 billion for the sector?  Do they also agree that the task force needs to reach agreement on how we will get that to those who are most in need?  There is nobody better placed than the witnesses, as representative of the entire industry, to understand that.  Third, should that task force outline with a united voice from the fishing industry a direction to all of us in politics what it is they want and what it is we need to do for them to fight for them?  Do the witnesses agree with those three points?</p></speech>

Deputy Mac Lochlainn is absolutely correct, but I really want to emphasise that our first priority - and we are united in the industry - is to put this in simple terms.  We need to get back our fish that we unfairly lost in the trade deal.  We cannot get that off the UK now so it has to come from the other member states.  The Deputy is quite correct: after that, a financial package will be done.  I can tell the committee that the hundred-and-whatever million is just peanuts.  It is an irrelevancy in trying to tackle the issue.  I am sure the Commission will try to say, "We will give you a few more extra euro and that will solve the problem."  It will not because we are not prepared to accept that we need to downsize our industries or indeed our communities.  I fully agree that the task force needs to have a very clear vision as to how we will achieve what we need to achieve in redressing the imbalance.  It has to be based on fact rather than fiction.  The equalisation, the Hague preferences and the third-country negotiations all need to come into the mix.</p><p>This is where a task force - if it is worth its salt - will put very concrete things together.  I assure the committee - and I meet my other three colleagues regularly - that we have a united front in terms of this and we agree with the committee on it.  I am very concerned that a task force might end up being a talking shop.  We cannot have that.  That message must go out very clearly to everybody.  The committee is right.  If, at a second level after getting our fish back, there is a significant financial package as such, this is where the task force can come in and say "This is the way it should be done".  We have bitter experience in terms of the useless tie-up scheme we got in respect of Covid.  If that is the road we are going down, I do not want any hand, act or part in it.</p></speech>

Are there any ready-made jobs in rural communities that are guaranteed to lose the jobs?  Has the Taoiseach told the organisations that he is guaranteed to win the battle regarding burden sharing with other EU countries?

We left the Taoiseach in no doubt that we need to get our fish back.  We are not just saying that today.  We made it clear to him on 28 December.  My colleagues can confirm that he gave us a commitment that it would not be our first and last meeting and that he would work with us.  We called it a really bad deal.  The Taoiseach did not put it in those terms but he recognised that there is a significant problem for our industry and gave us a commitment that he would work with us to address this.  I was of the impression, and if I am listening to what the Minister has said prior to this, I believe they have been making interventions in terms of burden sharing.  It needs to be upped a notch.  We really need to bring this to a level whereby the EU will begin to understand that unless it is addressed come hell or high water, there will be significant consequences in terms of going forward with relative stability keys.</p></speech>

I have neighbours and friends from Germany who sent me their version of an article in a German newspaper that asked why the Irish are complaining about this.</p><p>The author stated that all the fish are in Ireland's waters and asked why the Irish do not simply go and catch them.  He questioned whether we were not good fishermen.  That is the understanding by the ordinary common person in Europe about this.  They know the fish are here.  It makes no sense to Europeans why we are in the situation we are in.  They simply do not understand it.  They maintain that the fish are here and simply ask why we do not go and catch them.</p><p> We have to set this right and the only place that can be done is at the top.  We need our leaders to go to Europe and explain to people there and show them what is clearly evident, namely, that a bad deal was foisted upon us.  Deputy Pringle asked who was present when this was being negotiated, who signed off on it, what are the details of the deal and what are the responses.  This will not be solved here, but it can be started here, as Mr. O'Donoghue has said.  We need support to do that.</p><p> I reiterate that 25% of our fish have been lost.  To me, it is a question of simple mathematics: 25% of our industry has to go.  Can committee members imagine pointing to one in four people in coastal communities and saying to them that their jobs are gone?  I reiterate that it is not because the stocks are in poor condition or because the fish are not in our waters, it is because we had to give them away for the benefit of others.  I cannot allow my brain to process this information.  How can the European Union turn to any country and tell its people that the policies were meant to protect the coastal communities?  They were enshrined in the legislation to protect the coastal communities.  Now, it is a case of deciding they will take our fish and try to mitigate the problem by putting coastal communities and their future generations out to pasture.  It beggars belief.  I thank the Chairman for allowing my intervention.</p></speech>

I will close this session.  On behalf of the committee, I thank the representatives of the Irish Fish Producers Organisation, the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation, the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation and the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation for engaging with us on this important issue.  On behalf of the committee, I wish to say that our door is open to the fisheries industry for those involved to make their points to us.</p> <p>  We had the Minister before the committee earlier this morning.  I am from an inland county but it is clear that the issues facing the fisheries industry are grave indeed.  In his final contribution, Mr. Murphy referred to 25% of the fish being lost.  That will have a major economic effect on the whole fisheries industry.  We have to get a resolution that will allow our boats to stay in Irish waters and allow our fishermen and their families to earn a living.</p> <p>  My thanks to the witnesses for their contributions.  The door of this committee is open to the fisheries industry to come here.  The Minister announced that he is setting up a task force.  The representatives of the organisations should not hesitate to contact us if they think there is any issue we should be focusing on for them.  I know the members of the committee will keep fisheries to the forefront of our agenda.</p></speech>

Apart from myself and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are participating remotely.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputy James O'Connor and Senators R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey and Marie Sherlock.</p> <p>  Today I am pleased the committee is able to begin its pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of companies (corporate enforcement authority) Bill 2018.  The previous committee in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il commenced its consideration of this legislation but its work was far from completed.  The matter is one of the priorities for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I also have a keen interest in seeing its passage through the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  I am pleased we are joined remotely from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement by Mr. Ian Drennan, director, Ms. Suzanne Gunn, enforcement lawyer, Mr. David Hegarty, enforcement manager, Mr. David McGill, digital forensics specialist and Mr. Conor O&rsquo;Mahony, head of insolvency and corporate services.</p> <p>  In line with normal practice, members have been provided with documentation on this matter, including Mr. Drennan's opening statement, a briefing from the committee secretariat and the Library and Research Service regarding the general scheme, as well as written observations on this matter from several experts and stakeholders.</p> <p>  I must explain some limitations in parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to another person in their evidence.</p> <p>  Witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Today's witnesses, however, are giving their evidence remotely from a location outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.</p><p>Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.</p><p> To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite Mr. Drennan to make his opening remarks.  As his written statement has been circulated, it would be helpful if he were to highlight the main issues in it.  Unfortunately, due to Covid restrictions we are limited in the amount of time we can allow speakers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.319" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Drennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012200002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to appear before the committee and for the opportunity to discuss the general scheme of the companies (corporate enforcement authority) Bill 2018.</p> <p>  As referenced in the submission furnished to the committee on 4 December 2020, given the centrality of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, to the general scheme, it is submitted that any assessment of the proposed legislation requires an understanding of the ODCE, that is, what it does, how it does it, the environment within which it operates, the resources at its disposal and the challenges that it faces.  My principal functions as director are set out in section 949 of the Companies Act 2014.  They include: to encourage compliance with the Act; to investigate instances of suspected offences under the Act; to enforce the Act, including by way of prosecution of offences summarily, by referring cases to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, where there are reasonable grounds for believing that an indictable offence has been committed; and to exercise a supervisory role over the activities of liquidators and receivers in the discharge of their functions under the Act.  In the context of the foregoing, it is important to note that the ODCE is independent in the discharge of the statutory functions conferred upon it by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  Flowing from the aforementioned functions the ODCE has, in broad terms, two remits, namely, advocacy and enforcement.  Across those two broad categorisations, the ODCE engages in, among others, the following activities: encouraging compliance with company law through the provision of information and guidance to stakeholders; examining complaints and other expressions of concern be they from members of the public, disclosures under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, statutory reports, whether from auditors, liquidators or professional bodies, referrals from other law enforcement agencies and internally generated issues; conducting investigations into indications of breaches of company law; resolving lower level breaches of non-compliance in a cost and resource effective manner through a range of non-judicial interventions; examining and adjudicating upon liquidators&rsquo; reports in respect of insolvent companies; operating a statutory disqualifications and undertakings regime in respect of directors of insolvent companies; taking disqualification proceedings against directors of unliquidated insolvent companies; prosecuting cases summarily in my name and referring files to the DPP for consideration as to whether charges should be directed on indictment; and engaging in a full range of litigation associated with the foregoing categories of activities as necessary or as otherwise appropriate.</p> <p>  Over the last three years the aforementioned activities have given rise to, among others, the following: the publication of a suite of information and guidance documents aimed at assisting those involved in companies, for example, shareholders and members, directors and creditors, to understand their duties, obligations and rights, respectively; in excess of 100 production orders and requirements being issued to companies and individuals; 18 search warrants being executed by ODCE officers; voluntary cautioned interviews being conducted with 25 individuals; 18 individuals being arrested; on the application of the ODCE, the appointment by the President of the High Court of inspectors to Independent News and Media; 290 directors of insolvent companies being restricted; 88 directors of insolvent companies being disqualified; almost 100 statutory directions being issued requiring liquidators to comply with their statutory obligations; in more than 40 cases in which suspected directors&rsquo; loan infringements had been reported by auditors, or had otherwise come to attention of the ODCE, rectifications totalling in the order of &euro;37.6 million; directions to charge summarily or otherwise in respect of five separate investigations; directions being received from the DPP to charge on indictment, or otherwise, in respect of seven separate investigations involving a total of 77 separate criminal charges being preferred as against eight individuals relating to breaches of company law, for example, fraudulent trading and provision of false information and to breaches of criminal justice more broadly, for example, theft, deception and money laundering; facts proved in the District Court as against two individuals relating to breaches of company law; and convictions being secured in the Circuit Court as against four individuals for breaches of the aforementioned categories of offences.  As of today High Court inspectors continue to investigate the affairs of Independent News and Media; a number of criminal trials are before the courts; and a number of investigations are ongoing in respect of possible civil breaches of company law and-or criminal offences.</p> <p>  Part 2 of the general scheme is of most relevance to the ODCE, in that it provides for the establishment of the corporate enforcement authority, CEA, and for the transfer of the ODCE&rsquo;s statutory functions to the CEA.  As stated in the submission, the ODCE&rsquo;s assessment is that the general scheme, as drafted, meets its statuary objectives in that regard.  </p> <p>  The ODCE further welcomes the provisions of heads 38, 41, 43, 45 and 46, respectively.</p><p> The general scheme has been in gestation for some time, as was alluded to by the Chairman in his opening remarks, and as such it is understandably a priority for Government that it be enacted as soon as practicable.  The ODCE fully supports timely enactment but would recommend that immediately following enactment, consideration be given to a number of important emerging issues in order that, where practicable, the CEA's effectiveness might be further enhanced.  </p><p> Specifically, and as outlined in the submission, early consideration should, it is recommended, be given within company law and elsewhere, as applicable, to legislation to address: certain evolving legal issues in respect of which greater legislative clarity is desirable for investigators; technological advances in the law applying to search and seizure; complexities associated with white-collar investigations; and existing legal processes where scope for further streamlining exists.</p><p> The legislative amendments proposed by the ODCE would, in addition to further enhancing the CEA's effectiveness, also serve, to the extent practicable, to future-proof the CEA.  I trust that these opening remarks I have read, in conjunction with the submission, are of assistance to the joint committee.  My colleagues and I look forward to discussing the general scheme further with members over the course of the meeting.</p></speech>

This is all a bit new to us, that is, having committee meetings by Zoom or Teams, but I am sure we are picking it up as we go along.  I have a few questions and if I do not get to ask them all, I will hopefully get a chance to come back in at some stage.  Mr. Drennan listed the successes of the office over the past three years in his statement but he has also spoken a lot, not just here, but in other arenas, about resourcing.  Can he estimate how many crimes or transgressions might have occurred and gone without investigation due to lack of staff?  Does he feel that there are a number of white-collar criminals that are currently walking the streets and walking about freely because they slipped through the cracks due to the fact the ODCE did not have sufficient resources or oversight to pursue them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.323" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Drennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012200002#C00400"><p>The best way to answer that question is to say that everything that comes into the ODCE in the nature of a complaint or an expression of concern is treated seriously.  It is assessed by reference to its respective gravity, seriousness and so on.  The suggestion that anything of a serious nature that comes in would not be dealt with is not borne out by the facts.  The possibility that serious issues are being brought to our attention but are not being dealt with as a consequence of a lack of resources is something that just does not happen.  If it is sufficiently serious, it is dealt with.  We obviously prioritise on an ongoing basis and we reprioritise as necessary.  We would never simply ignore something if it is serious in nature.</p> <p>  It might be helpful to set out how we go about dealing with the issues that come across our desks.  The first thing that happens is that a preliminary assessment is conducted.  For those at the less serious end, we try to deal with them in a cost- and resource-effective manner.  We do that through, for example, issuing warnings and requiring evidence of remediation, if necessary supported by a third party, for example, an auditor.  If that is sufficiently suggestive or if it evidences that the matter has been addressed, and we get an undertaking that the matter will not be repeated, that will generally speaking be sufficient from our perspective.  In the event of a recurrence, we will deal with that accordingly.  </p> <p>  At the more serious end, we have a range of options at our disposal.  These include civil remedies where an application can be made to the court, for example, an order to compel an individual or a company to comply with its obligations.  It is only in the most serious cases that we would conduct criminal investigations.</p> <p>  In essence what I am trying to explain is that criminal investigations are very much the top of the pyramid, for want of a better term.  We will only deal with the most serious issues that way.  There is an awful lot that happens underneath the water, if you like, that gets dealt with otherwise.</p></speech>

With all due respect, if the office is attending to all of the work that is coming across its desk and it is prioritising and dealing with everything, what is the office going to do with the additional resources?</p></speech>

I am aware of the additional HR and information technology requirements.  When the office become a stand-alone entity, it will need all of that.  I am talking about the nuts and bolts, the work that is being done.  I know there are issues with regard to resources.  There is a compelling argument for additional resources if there are issues that are not being dealt with and if there are issues around white-collar crime that Mr. Drennan does not have the resources to get to.  I am not suggesting people in Mr. Drennan's office are not doing their work, of course they are.  What I am asking is if the office had more people, would it be able to tackle more white collar crime?  The logical extension of that is that there is white collar crime there that is not currently being addressed because resources are not there.  Is Mr. Drennan saying that all the resources required are only for the additional responsibilities and that those the office now has are fine to transfer over but that it needs information technology, HR, tax-----</p></speech>

I am not going to go into in detail on the first one because the Deputy clearly appreciates that there are additional processes internally and so on.  The second is what we have set out.  If this organisation is to realise the vision that has been set for it, it will require additional capabilities assigned to it.  In the event that we are successful in that, then cases currently at a lesser level of priority can be escalated to a higher level of priority.  The more resources one has, the more one can do.  I was trying to give assurances to the Deputy that there is no question that things are not being looked at now as a consequence of resources.  I want to allay any concerns there might be a suggestion that is the case.</p></speech>

On Mr. Drennan's points on the tendency of interested parties to litigate - this is not just an issue for Mr. Drennan, it is an issue many people have - before the civil courts, many are very well resourced as are their professional advisers.  Does Mr. Drennan feel the parties being investigated have a substantial advantage over his office?  I have heard members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other commentators say that drug gangs and other criminals have an advantage over the Garda and it is sometimes down to resourcing.</p> <p>  Can Mr. Drennan expand on the points he made in his submission on the propensity to litigate and the advantages that the people have in terms of their professional advisers?  Does it put the office at a disadvantage in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.332" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Drennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012200002#D00700"><p>The first thing is that any citizen of the State is entitled to litigate on any particular issue that he or she so wishes to defend his or her interests, whether in the context of a civil investigation or criminal proceedings.  The point I was making in the submission which the Deputy referenced - the trial court down the line is criminal litigation - was that we find ourselves engaging in quite a lot of civil litigation for a variety of reasons.  People are better resourced and better equipped to do that.  That is a challenge but by the same token, it is part of the job.  It is a part of the job we deal with on a daily basis.  The Deputy referenced An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When one is conducting civil or criminal investigations at this level, dealing with large corporate entities and that have a very significant financial quantum involved, people will defend themselves or seek to defend or vindicate their interests.  We see that as part of the job.  It is an integral part of the job.</p> <p>  Is one at a disadvantage?  One can be, on occasion.  If one is hit with large-scale civil litigation, it presents very significant challenges to the organisation.  At the same time, it is part of what we do.  It is an integral part of it.  One deals with it as and when it arises.</p> <p>  I refer to the Deputy's earlier question and my response. That is a perfect example of why one might need to reprioritise something.  It is because one needs to mobilise resources to deal with something that is urgent - for example, if one has been issued with proceedings.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting for a moment that people are not doing their work.  Clearly, they are.  That is not my point.  My point is that what makes it necessary to reprioritise in terms of limited resources means that something else is not getting attention.  It is not that the office is not prioritising and dealing with urgent issues.  Clearly, it is.</p><p>Obviously, there are issues that cannot be dealt with if resources need to be shifted in order to deal with an issue which Mr. Drennan described as being at the top of the pyramid?  The issues at the top of the pyramid are going to get attention.  Nonetheless, there are people at the bottom of the pyramid who are affected by the issues and who would have an interest in ensuring that there are sufficient resources to deal with the whole pyramid.</p></speech>

It would be an exaggeration to say that we do so on a daily basis because one could come into work, open the newspaper and see something in it that requires us to take action immediately.  The point I am making is that it is just a daily part of what we do.  If someone serves proceedings on us, that is their entitlement and we deal with the matter accordingly.</p></speech>

Competition and Consumer Protection Commission affected the office's ability to tackle white-collar crime?  Can Mr. Drennan provide more information about how the judgment has created difficulties, particularly in the context of differentiating between people's home, personal and work devices?  Can he elaborate on the points that are made on page 20 of the submission in the context of amendments.  I know that this is a matter that goes beyond the role of the office.  There is a discrepancy between what is working and what is not.  Obviously, people have the right to switch off but we all use our personal devices for work from time to time.  There is something of a grey area in this regard and has that given rise to difficulties for the ODCE?</p></speech>

As we touched on in the submission, we all, as citizens, have certain privacy rights.  These are fully respected but, on occasion, particularly in the context of criminal investigations, tensions arise between citizens' privacy rights and the duty of the State or us, in that particular iteration of the State, to investigate potential criminal activity.  As a result, there are can be tension between the two.  The judgments handed down by the Supreme Court to which the Deputy referred have a direct bearing on our work on a daily basis.  We put it in the submission because this is a particularly complex issue that creates significant difficulties for us on a day-to-day basis as investigators.  If the Deputy does not mind, I will ask Ms Gunn to supplement my remarks so that the Deputy will get a better understanding of the impact.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.338" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Gunn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012200002#E00500"><p>The CRH decision the Deputy referenced really has brought into sharp relief the interaction between the constitutional right of privacy, as it is afforded to individual citizens, within the confines and context of regulatory and, in fact, all criminal prosecutions and-or investigations.  I will not go into the granular detail of that particular case because there were three quite detailed judgments from the Supreme Court in respect of it.  I will not take up all of the time talking about the case but the nub of it relates to the uptake of an entire email folder by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  That folder contained thousands of emails.  The contention of the Supreme Court in this regard was that in circumstances in which such a significant volume of material was taken, in the absence of safeguards to protect the interests of non-relevant material to that investigation or material outside the scope of the warrant, this had the potential impact of disproportionately breaching the privacy rights of the individual concerned.  So it has wide application but it really creates acute issues when it comes to electronic evidence or electronic devices.</p> <p>  As the Deputy stated, everybody these days carry vast swaths of information around about themselves, their businesses and everything in their pockets, on tablets and in their bags.  There is an enormous amount of information contained in those devices.  The courts have always held the view that a certain level of material outside of the scope of a warrant is always at risk of being taken up in the course of a search.  The issue for the court in the case of CRH was the vast quantities of data involved.  How the court delineated that one might deal with that issue was by way of representations or engagement with the person whose rights were affected.  It also took into consideration the deletion, destruction and, potentially, the return of material that was outside the scope of the warrant executed.</p><p>All of that raises acute issues in the context of criminal investigations and prosecutions.  It does not underscore it to say that it has given rise to a significant level of complexity and risk in respect of the investigations in which we are particularly involved.  Colleagues in other regulatory bodies have experienced similar issues.  As the Deputy has said, some albeit not all of the parties we are investigating are well financed, instructed and advised and they are live to these issues.  There is no doubt whatsoever but that it has created complexity and risk in how we navigate through those issues.  In the submission that is before the committee, we included our view as to how that might be dealt with, namely, by putting protocols on a statutory footing, such that might outline the obligations of an organisation like ours in respect of navigating those issues.  That certainly would create a significant degree of clarity and would offset many of the issues we experience, not daily, but not on an infrequent basis.  Without doubt it is an issue that needs to be dealt with.  It does affect quite a considerable number of stakeholders.  How and by what means that is resolved is a matter for the Deputy's side of the house.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012200002#F00300"><p>First, I thank Mr. Drennan and his staff for the work that has been done and the progress made in professionalising the area of corporate enforcement.  I welcome the changes that are being put into law to give the organisation the status of an independent authority with the ability to recruit staff and have its own strategy, with a stronger collegiate three- or four-member form, or whatever it ends up as.</p> <p>  I have some questions.  When the financial crisis hit, it certainly seemed that regulatory failures were not really matched by clear offences and that some of the difficulties in enforcement were due to our laws not having anticipated the sort of abuses that had crept in.  From the organisation's perspective, has the 2014 Act fixed that or are there still major areas in which we need clearer or stronger law?</p> <p>  The courts found that the ODCE lacked skills, experience, risk management and various capabilities when the problems arose.  Will the control over recruitment, which will be inherent in the new authority, give the organisation the capacity to meet those challenges in a new way?</p> <p>  The third question concerns powers.  The witnesses have suggested that there may be a need for more powers for the organisation.  Are there powers that should be considered in this particular Bill, as well as the continuing improvement?  For example, administrative penalties seem to be a feature of some agencies now and is a new power.  Is that something that would be important in any areas of the office's work?</p> <p>  On the issue of the relationship with the Garda, I believe that much closer relationships have been forged now and members have been seconded.  Is additional provision in legislation required to ensure that this relationship, which is critical to some of the ODCE's work, is adequately set out?  </p> <p>  We all know about the need for surge capacity in other areas of our public service.  In the enforcement area, when surge capacity may be needed, for example, in a particularly large case, how does that get catered for in the arrangements the organisation has with the Government?</p><p>Do we need to distinguish between the obligations of large companies and the obligations of small companies in the legislative approach?  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, obviously has to make risk-based assessments on when to pursue different requirements.  In regard to obligations like reporting and filing, and all these sorts of things, do we need to have different expectations as between some operators and others?  Those are my questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.343" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Drennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012200002#G00200"><p>Deputy Bruton covered quite a lot of territory in those questions.  I am conscious he is a former Minister in the Department and probably knows more about some of these matters than I do.  I will start towards the back of his questions.<br/><br/>Administrative sanctions, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, are in the nature of fines and so on.  In our assessment, they are more suitable and akin to regulatory or supervisory-type bodies, and that is not what the ODCE is or does.  We are not a supervisor or a regulator in the same way as, for example, the Central Bank is <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>financial institutions.  Rather, we are an enforcement body.  We do not have any particular burning desire to be conferred with administrative sanctions, to be short on that.  I do not think they would necessarily make our lives easier or help us to be any more effective or efficient in what we do.<br/><br/>In terms of surge capacity, I can tell of the practical experience of having been served judicial review proceedings at very short notice.  The surge capacity is that everybody rolls up their sleeves and gets stuck in, and we deal with it over the space of 48 or 72 hours in terms of trying to put together a response and a defence to it.  As I touched on in response to Deputy O'Reilly's earlier questions, it is part of the job, is part of what we do and is part of the risks associated with what we do that we are always susceptible to judicial review.<br/><br/>Deputy Bruton touched on the question of whether there is the wherewithal to bring in additional people.  Whereas there is, on occasion, the reality is that when dealing with something that is highly specialised, they are not necessarily going to be of enormous use to us, and we need people who are fully conversant with the granularity of the issues involved.  We engage external counsel on an ongoing basis and we have a very competent team of internal counsel as well.  That is primarily how we do it but, on occasion, we need to hire in additional resources and we do that as is required on a short-term basis, primarily in the form of professional third parties.<br/><br/>On the question of small companies versus large companies, as the Deputy will be aware, there are already fairly significant concessions to small companies.  For example, they have a different reporting regime and they have the latitude, on occasion, to have audit exemptions and so on.  That represents a fairly significant easing of the burden on small business and I know successive Governments in recent years have been very keen to try to reduce the administrative burden on smaller companies.  Against that, at the upper end of the spectrum, there are listed companies that have to comply with the full range of Stock Exchange regulations, the combined code and so on.  Is there scope for reducing smaller companies&rsquo; obligations?  To be candid, it is not something we spend a lot of time thinking about and we do not have a strong policy view on it.  We just get on with enforcing what comes across our desks.  Given there are already very significant concessions in place for smaller companies, we would certainly not be aware, from our engagement with stakeholders, that there is any very strong, burning justification for a further reduction in that sphere.<br/><br/>The Deputy talked about having more powers.  Again, what I would like to say is that we have very significant and substantial statutory powers and, for the most part, they serve us well on a day-to-day basis.  I think it is important that the committee not be left with a perception that we are looking for significant additional powers.  There are additional things we think would be useful and could render the corporate enforcement authority, CEA, more effective.  I will give an example of that, which is that we made reference to the custody regulations.</p><p>The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, is comprised of both civilians and seconded garda&iacute; and those garda&iacute; are with us pursuant to a Government decision that was put in place at the same time as the Company Law Enforcement Act was enacted back in 2001.  They carry with them all their powers as sworn members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which gives us the wherewithal to arrest people and so on.</p><p> The issue that arises from our perspective is that when we arrest somebody for the purpose of questioning pursuant to the custody regulations, which are the responsibility of the member in charge who is detaining the individual in the relevant Garda station, under our legislative code, it is only members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are permitted to interview the individual concerned.  As to the type of work, we are looking at complex financial transactions and voluminous quantities of corporate documentation and, for example, digital forensics where we are dealing with devices and so on.  It is, to put it mildly, suboptimal for staff to be sitting outside the room having to try to deal with the answers that have been given to the interviewing garda&iacute; and then trying to formulate supplementary questions arising from those answers, and doing all that in real time.  We are up against the clock from the time the individual is detained because there are constraints on the length of time an individual can be detained.  They are entitled to rest periods and so on and all of that eats into one's time.  If we want to put a significant number of charges to an arrested person, we have to question that person in respect of each charge separately so we very quickly run through the time.</p><p> What we are proposing is akin to what the Criminal Assets Bureau and also the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, have in respect of certain matters, namely, that non-garda&iacute; - in this instance, officers of the ODCE, civilian officers, be they accountants, digital forensic specialists or whatever - would be allowed, under the custody regulations, to participate in those interviews and bring the additional expertise to bear.  That is not for a moment to suggest that our Garda colleagues do not do that but obviously there are limits to anyone's special expertise.  We believe that would confer, as it has done elsewhere, significant additional efficiency and effectiveness benefits and dividends on us in terms of the value we can get from a suspect interview.</p><p> Deputy Bruton referred to the financial crisis and so on.  He will have been closer to this than I was, but one of the unpalatable issues that arose from that was that certain of the activities that gave rise to where we ended up, for example, mismanagement of the financial institution, taking unnecessary risks or not understanding the risks being taken, do not necessarily constitute criminal behaviour.  While they give rise to competency issues, that is a different matter.  The ODCE, with a mandate for company law, was only able to investigate certain issues that on their face would appear to have constituted breaches of company law, and it did that.  As a former Minister, the Deputy knows that the ODCE, having submitted files to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, subsequently secured a number of criminal convictions on indictment in respect of certain of those matters.  To answer his question as to whether the Companies Act 2014 has addressed that issue, the Companies Act 2014 was not really the problem in the first place in that to any extent that other activity that might have been perceived to be, or could have constituted, criminal activity resided in other statutes, be that Central Bank legislation or various other codes of legislation.  I am not an expert and I am not in a position to speak to the amendments that have been made to those various codes of statute in the interim.  However, I am conscious that the Law Reform Commission, in its report a couple of years ago, recommended the creation of a new offence of egregiously reckless risk-taking which, if memory serves, was consequent upon a recommendation made by a former Governor of the Central Bank.  I am aware that a recommendation was made that this would not fall within company law but, rather, would fall to be legislated elsewhere.  I am not the best person to speak about where that is at or the potential impact it might have on other regulatory bodies.  I think that answers all the questions the Deputy posed.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses comment on the issue of liquidation?</p><p>Companies will be under pressure soon due to what is happening at the moment unfortunately.  We have had some discussion in this committee on how liquidations have been carried out in the past.  The heads give some additional powers with respect to restricting directors who fail to convene or properly manage the appointment of liquidators of a company.  I ask the witnesses to comment on those points.  I might come back in later.</p></speech>

I would like to defer to my colleague, Mr. O'Mahony, on both those issues as they come within his remit.  By way of introduction, Mr. O'Mahony is the head of both corporate services and insolvency.  I ask him to speak about our budgets and to deal with the Deputy's questions on insolvencies and liquidations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.349" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012200002#J00300"><p>Regarding budgets, as the director outlined earlier, we anticipate that we will have a requirement for additional staff to deal with the sort of administrative-type issues that arise for an authority or an agency, as opposed to an office.  We have been in discussion with the Department on that.  Our budgets were increased in anticipation of that.  We got an extra &euro;1 million in 2019 in anticipation that the legislation would be going ahead at that stage, but for various reasons that did not happen.  Financially we are probably in pretty good shape.  We have that budget, which should be adequate at least in the short to medium term to cover the staffing requirements that we anticipate and some of the other issues.  I think that aspect is fairly good.</p> <p>  Deputy Bruton mentioned the financial crisis.  After the financial crisis there was a real surge in liquidations and the numbers peaked in 2011 at about 1,400 cases a year.  Those numbers have steadily dropped in the interim and we expect just over 400 insolvent liquidations in 2020.  That has been a slow and steady reduction.  Arising from the impact of the pandemic, there is a general view that the numbers are likely to surge again.  The extent of that is quite unknown at this time because obviously, account needs to be taken as to the difference the Government supports will make.  There are many different types of supports and many different impacts on different businesses.  Some are completely devastated, others are doing okay and managing to get through it.  Some of them are greatly helped by the Government supports, the Revenue's deferral of charges and other things of that nature.  We are expecting a surge of liquidations and that will be a challenge for the office.  We are trying to get ourselves ready to handle that.</p> <p>  The Bill makes provision to deal with companies where a liquidator is not appointed.  Thankfully, this is a rare issue.  This recommendation came from the Company Law Review Group a few years ago.  The opportunity is being taken in the Bill to provide for that.  It provides that if the directors allow a liquidation to proceed without a liquidator being appointed, they will face automatic restriction in the context where no liquidator is there to assess their performance, provide a report to us and then for a decision to be taken on whether that matter should go before the courts for restriction.  It is a kind of a backstop to incentivise people and let them know there will be consequences if a liquidator is not appointed.  We expect that provision, if it is enacted as is, to act as a significant disincentive for anybody to try to game the system by not appointing a liquidator.</p><p>I think that deals with the two questions, unless anybody wants to ask anything else.</p></speech>

I should start by thanking all the guests for their comments and Mr. Drennan for his presentation.  This issue of directors not putting insolvent companies into liquidation is a point of particular concern to an awful lot of us.  It is an issue of huge frustration for trade unionists, employees and companies.  I will not name any companies but I think we are all aware of key examples of what I am talking about, whereby employees have been left facing nothing after years of service.  I was a little concerned by one comment Mr. O'Mahony made.  I do not want to misquote him but I think he mentioned that the issue of directors not putting insolvent companies into liquidation is rare.  I am not sure I would agree with him on that but I do not want to misquote him.  Is that what he said?</p></speech>

There is then what one might call a zombie liquidation in place, there is nobody there to prepare a report for us and the normal supervisory role etc. does not flow from that.  That is a different situation from what the Senator is talking about.  What he is talking about is insolvent companies that are not liquidated and are effectively just left to whither on the vine and usually, eventually, are struck off.  In respect of that category of companies, we have a very specific enforcement programme.  There is a particular provision of the 2014 Act, section 842(h), not to get too technical about it, which states that if one allows a company to be struck off the register with debts, one is liable to be disqualified.  We have an active programme for dealing with those companies.  We have in the past three years disqualified more than 60 directors who have been guilty, if one likes, of allowing that situation to arise.  We do not go after all companies because some companies might have relatively modest debts or we might not be aware of significant debts.  However, once we have evidence that there is a reasonably high level of debts, we will pursue disqualification against directors who allow that to happen.  The Company Law Review Group has looked at a separate issue.  In 2017 work was also done by the then chairman of the Labour Court, if I am not mistaken, on how the social welfare system deals with such situations, trying to ensure that people who have lost their jobs by virtue of a company ceasing to trade will be given access to the Social Insurance Fund and the protections that flow from that.  That particular dimension is not within our remit but, as I said, we do have a programme for dealing with companies that end up being struck off and do not go through a liquidation process at all.  That is a different scenario.  I hope that clarifies the matter.</p></speech>

I have a follow-on question.  Does Mr. O'Mahony's organisation have a role in so-called strategic liquidations, whereby assets are basically moved from one company to another to enable a liquidation that basically saves values in the company but at the employees' expense?</p><p>Is that something that his office does or should deal with?</p></speech>

We will review the liquidator's report and any other information available to us in determining whether the directors of that company should face sanction, whether it be restrictions, disqualification or referral to the enforcement side for more serious investigations.  We will take all relevant factors into account.  If there is evidence that something underhand has been done which appears to us to be irresponsible - there is a lot of jurisprudence which underpins what responsibility and irresponsibility look like - then we will not grant relief in that case, the case will go before the courts and the directors will face restriction.  That course of action is open to us but there are things that are possible and permitted under the Companies Acts and not everything that people might be uncomfortable with meets the threshold of every responsibility as defined by the High Court over many years of jurisprudence.</p></speech>

The Company Law Review Group, CLRG, had a slightly different proposal.  It proposed that the director of an insolvent company who failed to take appropriate steps to nominate a named liquidator should be deemed to be subject to a restriction order.  What is Mr. O'Mahony's opinion on that?  Does he think the CLRG is looking to a higher standard than that in the Bill?</p></speech>

Those recommendations will go into the Department, the Department will review them, consult with the Attorney General and draft up provisions or not, depending on what is approved by the Minister or Government.  They are essentially matters of policy on which it would not be appropriate for us to comment.</p></speech>

A number of us are interested in the investigation into the Football Association of Ireland, FAI.  I think the ODCE seized 280,000 files before Christmas.  Does the ODCE have enough resources right now to investigate this important case?</p></speech>

I will not comment on an individual case but I echo the comments of my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly.  I am conscious of what Professor Deirdre Ahern stated in her submission.  She said it is clear that the witnesses' organisation has been under-resourced for some considerable time.  I have a concern in this regard.  That seems like a huge investigation to undertake.  Am I right in saying that the current staffing is around 41 people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.364" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Drennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012200002#L00800"><p>That is correct.  When I took up the position, I undertook an assessment of the ODCE's then capabilities.  I identified that we had a significant deficiency in accounting expertise, by which I mean we only had two, one of whom was coming relatively close to retirement.  We also had no internal digital forensics capability whatsoever and so were entirely reliant on third-party providers.  By digital forensics, I mean when one seizes a device, that one has the ability to image it in an evidentially integral way and so on.  As a result of that exercise I referred to, I prepared a document for the Department and sought a significant increase in our resources in those areas.  All of that was forthcoming and successive Ministers and their officials have been supportive of our endeavours to further professionalise the organisation and make it more effective at what it does.</p><p>We now have an approved core of seven accountants from a variety of backgrounds such as enforcement, the private sector, banking, the public sector, policing and so on.  We have a digital forensic accountant who is a leading expert in that field.  We have a state-of-the-art digital forensics laboratory, which is bar none in terms of what we can do in it.  There has been some very significant investment in the organisation.  That said, these are large investigations.  As I said earlier in response to Deputy O'Reilly, of course if one has more, one can do more.  As I said at the committee previously, my personal philosophy is not about us needing more and more; it is about getting the right people.  The right resources are much more important than more resources.  It must, however, be balanced.  As Deputy O'Reilly referred to, we have outlined in the submission that for reasons associated with the legal change in the structure of the organisation and the vision that has been articulated for the organisation, we will undoubtedly need some extra people.  We have been very measured in trying to identify that.  We clearly need additional resourcing in the area of digital forensics and legal, for some of the reasons that were outlined earlier.</p><p> If I may, I will kill two birds with one stone because it occurs to me that I did not answer one of Deputy Bruton's questions on garda&iacute;.  We reach pinch points at any given time and one cannot resource an organisation on the basis that it will always be in surge.  One tries to staff and structure an organisation such that one can deal with the day-to-day activities and have a certain amount of redundancy built in so that when surges happen, the organisation can deal with them.  Clearly, there are limits to that and it is not credible to go to a Minister or to anybody else looking for resources that one cannot justify on a day-to-day basis.  That is a delicate balancing act.  An organisation does reach pinch points from time to time.  Relatively recently we identified a pinch point with the volume of witness statements that need to be taken.  I communicated with the Garda Commissioner and asked him to deploy some additional detective garda&iacute; with us for a certain period on a temporary basis.  I am glad he indicated that not only would he do this but that they would be deployed in the very near future.  Those pinch points arise from time to time and they have been reflected in the submission.  Clearly, one of the areas we could certainly benefit from is additional members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, given that they are very important in what we do, as the committee touched upon earlier.</p><p> Deputy Bruton asked if we needed any legislative provisions to reflect our important relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The short answer to that is "No", but there are some administrative level issues that could be dealt with by way of a memorandum of understanding, MOU, for example, between the new authority and the Commissioner.  I have written to the Commissioner in anticipation of the corporate enforcement authority being set up, with a view to try to put in place an MOU that would formalise certain of those issues to make things more efficient and effective in the future.  I hope this answers the Senator's questions and addresses Deputy Bruton's earlier question.</p></speech>

I fully take his point on it not just being about quantity and that even if one had 100 people, if they were not suitable they will not be of use.  Will he comment on how many people, and what grade, group or category or worker, are needed to perform the other functions, separate from IT?  Perhaps he could put a figure on the detailed work that the office needs to do with regard to numbers of accountants, forensic accountants and those IT supports.</p><p>Perhaps Mr. Drennan could give us an idea in terms of numbers and grades how many additional personnel will be needed?</p></speech>

Leaving aside HR, finance and so on, to which the Deputy alluded, we have indicated that we will need, by way of additional resourcing of the corporate enforcement authority, a new digital forensics professional who would work with Mr. McGill, another legal professional to work alongside the lawyers we currently have and one administrative support officer to assist them and, in terms of additional garda&iacute;, one additional detective sergeant and eight additional detective garda&iacute;.  Can I ask Mr. McGill to deal with the first part of the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

In fact, an awful lot of data is stored in cloud storage, which means it does not actually reside on the devices themselves.  The current powers under section 787 of the legislation allow us warrants to access these devices while we are on site.  The proposed head 46 of the Bill will basically ameliorate these powers to give us the opportunity to balance our need to access these devices and access the information contained within them, with the impact that we are having on the people impacted by the search warrant.</p> <p>  For example, if we are entering a company or private residence we obviously want to minimise the amount of time that we are there because we understand that it is impacting on people's lives.  We currently have provisions under section 788 for extended powers of search off site.  The provision in head 46 extends that to allow us to do cloud searching off site as well so that we can secure the data as it is and conduct the sift off site in the same way we do with physical documents, but now with electronic documents.</p> <p>  What was alluded to in the submission made as part of this meeting was to consider extra powers outside of this.  Currently, we apply for a warrant to search a premises and everything that stems from that is based on the warrant to search a premises.  We envisage meeting potential future needs to apply for a warrant to search the cloud itself or to search an account which is the property of an individual or an entity.  I hope that answers some of the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

It does sound complicated and obviously the kind of work for which a huge amount of training is needed.  Given that technology very often moves faster than every Department, than politics and than everything else, I fully appreciate the job of work the witnesses have there.</p> <p>  This is a bit speculation but following the collapse of the retrial of Sean FitzPatrick, there was some criticism of the resourcing and the structure of the office.  Again I respect that the witnesses might not want to comment on this, but have they a view on whether resources could have been provided in advance to ensure that this did not happen?  Commentators have said, and I would tend to agree with them, that the under-resourcing was almost Government policy, and that a concerted effort was made not to give the office the resources that it needed.  If it had had the resources, do the witnesses believe that the trial would have collapsed in that way?</p></speech>

I am quite happy to do so in due course if the committee really wants to do that.</p><p>From our perspective, I have no desire to re-litigate these issues.  They occurred approximately 11 or 12 years ago or thereabouts.  In short, I could not possibly answer that question in the time allotted here.  That is something that would require going back to where we started by making a submission to the committee so that we could fully understand it.  I do not know whether anyone has the appetite to do that.  For what it is worth, I would seriously question the value of doing that.  If that is where the committee wants to go, then so be it but it is not something I can address today because of the complexity of the issue.</p></speech>

As I said, when one does some research and looks at the ODCE, this case comes up.  It is an issue about which there has been a huge amount of commentary.  Indeed, there are plenty of people who have a view on the level of funding and resources and who have written much more about this than I have time to read.  I fully accept that we do not have the time today nor the scope to do it and that is why I am happy to pass on that question.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012200002#O00600"><p>I am sorry but the Chair must have missed my hand up.  I would like to ask one or two other questions if I can.  Head 18 talks about the disclosure of information to the authority.  Many of the companies we deal with in Ireland have international links.  Can our guests let us know what is the situation regarding getting information internationally?  What kind of contacts has the ODCE had with other such bodies internationally?  Should head 18, as it stands, be expanded to include any other agencies?  That is my first question.</p> <p>  The number of persons on the authority, according to the heads, is one, two or three.  One submission recommends that this figure should be five in order to provide flexibility.  Mr. Drennan might comment on that.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly and others have spoken about the fact things are changing very fast in respect to technology and how things are happening.   Is there anything coming down the tracks?  Does Mr. Drennan think that the heads, as set out, give sufficient flexibility to adapt to unanticipated change?  Does it provide the flexibility so that the ODCE will not have to come back to the Oireachtas looking for more changes to the proposed legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Drennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021012200002#O00700"><p>Please bear with me while I check head 18.  It references disclosure of information to the authority.  That is for the most part a re-enactment of the extant legislation.  We have a statutory duty of confidentiality and it flows both ways.  We can provide information to certain other parties where there is a reason to do so.  For example, we can share information with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if we are satisfied it is relevant to its remit.  Head 18 is already on the Statute Book and it permits certain other entities to share information with us.  In terms of the way in which that is constituted, I do not think we have anything in particular to say on that.  We are quite happy we do not experience on a frequent basis a difficulty with having other people share information with us.  Typically, they tend to be professionals, such as other regulatory bodies, law enforcement bodies or professional bodies.  We do not have any particular issues with that.  There are certain mechanisms in place whereby we can share information with entities outside the State and that is done through mutual legal assistance and other mechanisms like that.  We can co-operate with police forces and other entities in other jurisdictions.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s third question was about flexibility.  What we have sought to do is highlight and incorporate in our comments certain areas where we think a corporate enforcement authority could be further enhanced in terms of its effectiveness by way of statutory amendments.  Having said that, and as I set out in my submission, the Bill is for a particular purpose.  The question we were asked by the committee was whether we believed it was fit for purpose and our answer is yes.  Clearly, what gets legislated for in due course is a matter for the Minister, the Government and ultimately the members as legislators.  I do not think that any piece of legislation can ever entirely future-proof an organisation.</p><p>As was talked about earlier, digital forensics, information technology and all those areas are evolving at a very fast pace.  My colleague, Ms Gunn, referenced earlier on privacy and the sort of issues that arise there.  That is a moveable feast as well and will evolve over time.</p><p> Can I guarantee that we will never be going back to the political system looking for amendments?  No, but I do not think any other regulatory or enforcement entity could do so on the basis that things evolve.  Deputy Stanton's second question, which I am taking last, is on members of the authority.  That is clearly a policy matter for the Minister, the Government and ultimately for the Legislature.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on that.</p></speech>

Nobody else seems to have indicated.</p> <p>  On the comments Mr. Drennan made on the question from Deputy O'Reilly on a previous case that collapsed, I would be interested to tease those out with him at another time.  I will not do so at this committee but I refer to Mr. Drennan's response to her.</p> <p>  On the Bill we are talking about now, I reiterate how important I believe it is to establish a corporate enforcement authority that will be separate from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is an issue I raised in the last D&aacute;il numerous times and I am pleased we are beginning to make progress on creating this new and important entity.  There is a perception that many crimes are not crimes if one wears a suit and that often white-collar crime is never investigated properly or on the scale required.  I hope the work of the corporate enforcement agency will show the people that we, as a State, will prosecute crime no matter what resources are at the disposal of the suspected offender.</p> <p>  I have three short questions.  My first question is as follows.  In the last D&aacute;il I spoke on the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, numerous times.  One of the big concerns I raised was on staff numbers at the ODCE.  In terms of funding, is Mr. Drennan confident that he will have sufficient resources to hire the necessary specialist staff required to maximise the effectiveness of the corporate enforcement agency?  My second question is as follows.  In a submission, there is reference to existing barriers to maximising the effectiveness of the corporate enforcement agency.  Could Mr. Drennan provide some detail as to what those existing barriers to maximising the effectiveness are?  </p> <p>  My third question is on whether Mr. Drennan will agree with Professor Ahern's submission that in the proposed membership structure of the corporate enforcement agency, one to three members is too small.  It strikes me as being too small.  Mr. Drennan might comment on that.</p></speech>

What I would say in response to that is that in the last couple of years, we have submitted files to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who has in turn directed charges, including fraudulent trading, theft and money laundering against individuals who were the subject of investigations in this office.  I do not think that one has to wear a suit to engage in criminality under the broad rubric of white-collar crime and, frankly, we do not really care what people are wearing.  We have carried out thorough investigations and have submitted them to the DPP and she in turn has deemed it appropriate to prefer very serious charges against those individuals.<br/><br/>On the Chair's question on whether we have enough resources, I refer to the response given to Deputy O'Reilly.  The Deputy asked me for details of the additional investigative resources that we have indicated to the Department we believe would be appropriate in trying to assist this entity in realising the vision set for it.  Clearly, there are political decisions as to whether those additional resources are granted.  In the event they are granted, one would expect the additional resources to discharge the salaries and associate costs that go with those resources would be forthcoming and, similarly, with the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I referenced in my response to Deputy O'Reilly.  There is not much more I can say about that.<br/><br/>The Chair sought further information on barriers we see as being potentially problematic in progressing investigations and what they might be.  Again, I reference some of what we have previously said during the course of the interaction.  I spoke about custody regulations to Deputy Stanton but apologies if that was not to whom I was speaking.  Mr. McGill spoke about warrants and the information technology aspects of those.  Ms Gunn earlier on spoke about the privacy issues emanating from the Supreme Court judgment in CRH <i>v</i>. Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the constitutional right to privacy and how that interacts.  There is a tension between it and criminal investigation.</p><p>We shared with the committee our observations as to how those issues might be dealt with.  Finally, the Chairman asked about the membership and size of the authority but that is a policy matter upon which it would not be appropriate for me to comment.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Celeste O&rsquo; Callaghan, Mr. Gerry O&rsquo; Brien and Mr. David Smith from the Department of Health, along with HSE colleagues.</p> <p>  It is almost 12 months since the establishment of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and the beginning of our response to Covid-19.  To date, approximately 182,000 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Ireland.  Sadly, more than 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 have been reported.  I extend my heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends who have lost loved ones to this disease.  </p> <p>  Ireland is now experiencing a severe third wave of infection, as are many other jurisdictions.  The country has experienced a dramatic increase in disease incidence, hospitalisations and mortality since late December, with 532 deaths notified with a date of death in January so far.  While there are some positive signs in recent days that transmission levels are reducing, incidence rates remain very high, at levels ten to 15 times greater than those observed in early December.  The situation therefore remains extremely worrying with older and vulnerable individuals at greatest risk.  Numbers of cases in hospital are tracking close to optimistic model predictions but it is important to remain cognisant that, even assuming a continued reduction in case numbers, there will still be a very slow decrease in numbers in hospital.  Similarly, the total number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care units is at a very elevated level and it must be noted that a significant number of patients are also receiving advanced respiratory support on general wards.  </p> <p>  As well as the concern regarding the health and well-being of those hospitalised, there is a clear risk for the capacity and operation of the healthcare system more broadly.  A priority for NPHET throughout this pandemic has been the protection of non-Covid health and social care services and, unfortunately, this has been very significantly impacted by the recent deterioration.  It remains imperative that all members of society collectively adhere to the public health advice, as well as the restrictive measures that have been put in place by Government.  </p> <p>  It is important to reflect that the basic objective we are trying to achieve is to interrupt transmission of this virus from person to person.  It is clear that the vast majority of the public are playing their part to reduce transmission, which is perhaps best emphasised by the fact that the average number of close contacts per case has decreased from almost five at the end of December to just 2.1 today.  These efforts are more important then ever at this time and it is vital that they are maintained over the coming weeks.  </p> <p>  I am pleased to say that our Covid vaccination programme is now well under way.  By Wednesday evening last almost 122,000 vaccines were administered, with 73,100 for front-line healthcare workers and almost 49,000 to long-term care facilities, where both patients and staff were vaccinated.    This is the largest ever vaccination programme conducted by the State.   Vaccinations will be offered free to all residents who are indicated and wish to receive it, and we hope to see full public uptake.  On a particularly positive note, the proportion of people who say that they will definitely or probably take the vaccine when it is offered to them has risen from 76% to 85% over recent weeks.  </p> <p>  However, while the vaccine programme is being rolled out, we must continue to rely on the tools that are available to us.  The use of face coverings, social distancing, hand and respiratory etiquette, working from home where at all possible and, ultimately, staying at home unless it is essential to be out remain vital to suppressing this virus.</p><p>We are also continuing to monitor the prevalence of new variants of the virus as they emerge.  Viruses change constantly through mutation.  While most of these will not have a significant impact, some mutations may provide the virus with a selective advantage, such as increased transmissibility or the ability to evade the immune response.  We are monitoring three variants in particular at this time, one each of which was first identified in the UK, South Africa and Brazil.</p><p> I reiterate that the Government continues to advise against all non-essential travel at this time, a recommendation the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, yesterday identified as key to slowing down the importation and spread of new variants.</p><p> To conclude, I acknowledge that hardly any aspect of Irish life has not been impacted in some way by this pandemic, and I thank the public for their continued efforts.  However, much more progress must be achieved and sustained over the coming weeks to bring this disease under control and to substantially reduce the ongoing profound impact on all key public health priorities.  At this stage, we need everyone to stay at home, other than for essential reasons, in order that we can continue to suppress the virus and minimise, to the greatest extent possible, any further impact on public health.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.397" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee.  I am joined by my colleagues Ms Angela Fitzgerald, deputy national director of acute operations, and Dr. Vida Hamilton, national clinical adviser and group lead for acute operations.  Dr. Hamilton is also an intensivist working in Waterford hospital.  We understand that the committee wishes us to address capacity in our hospital system and the general demand, particularly relating to Covid patients, and to talk about the private hospitals and increased capacity available to us under the private hospital arrangements recently put in place.  As the Chairman noted, the vaccine is subject to further separate dialogue next week.</p> <p>  As for managing demand, the experience of the pandemic over the past ten months, moving towards a year, has taught us a number of lessons.  In March and April, the number of emergency department, ED, attendances fell sharply.  Non-urgent routine care was suspended, in line with the NPHET guidance in late March, and we acquired capability of 18 private hospitals to provide assurance of protected space in which to provide non-Covid care.  The private hospital capacity at that stage was proactively used for significant volumes of non-Covid care, namely, 60,000 day cases and 10,000 inpatients.  Extraordinary measures were taken to deal with an extraordinary and unprecedented challenge at that time.</p> <p>  During the first surge, 2,200 beds were vacant to support anticipated need, although there were staffing challenges with that, and Covid patient numbers peaked at 825.  The plan worked for two reasons, namely, the extraordinary efforts of staff and carers throughout the health system and the magnificent response of the public in reducing transmission.  The lessons learned at that stage were how to manage care of all acute patients, Covid and non-Covid alike, the extension of telemedicine, which very much supported care outside of the hospital environment, community care being brought closer to individuals' homes, the use of remote monitoring for people at home, which is ongoing, and the increased delivery of home dialysis to keep patients away from hospital space where feasible.</p> <p>  In regard to additional bed capacity, by the end of 2019 there were 10,988 inpatient beds, including 255 critical care beds in the system nationally.  In response to Covid, we opened an additional 426 beds and, based on the Estimates for 2021, we will open a further 720 beds during the course of this year.  The additional capacity from the start of last year, therefore, will be 1,146 beds in total.  The intention is that will allow us to operate at 85% occupancy, which is the international norm.  In addition, the Estimates for 2021 provide for the opening of 66 critical care beds by the end of 2021, which includes permanent funding for 40 beds, funded temporarily in response to surge.  To date, 33 of these beds have been opened, with a further seven expected to do so in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  As for the preparation for 2021, the circumstances we face now are very different from those of March, and in many ways more challenging.  The disease is much more transmissible.</p><p>Backlogs have built up in scheduled care.  Social distancing and increased infection control measures mean our existing capacity cannot deliver at previous levels and overcrowding in emergency departments has been reduced significantly.  We cannot tolerate high trolleys due to the risk of infection.</p><p> Significant numbers of healthcare workers are absent due to infection, close contact or the need to care for others.  In the acute hospitals alone, we have more than 6,000 workers on sick leave at present.  Almost half of them are nurses.  On a positive front, the availability of early roll-out of a vaccine will be a key factor in mitigating risk in the future relating to our staff. </p><p> We are currently in a new pandemic surge.  Numbers infected and hospitalised on either wards or in ICU are at levels not seen before.  The number of measures already invoked include strong guidance from our chief clinical officer, all non-urgent and non-time-dependent cases in the public sector have been paused in public hospitals and surge plans have been activated across the entire public hospital system, increasing surge capacity by 400 beds.  For critical care, our surge plans aim to deliver 350 ICU beds.  Derogation measures are in place to maximise available staff.  Safety net arrangements have been agreed with 18 private hospitals and more than 800 patients have already been treated.</p><p> The private hospital support in 2020 provided access to their entire capacity for three months in the earlier part of 2020.  Temporary mechanisms beyond that period saw private hospitals provide care right though to the year end.  The new safety net arrangement, which will be in place for up to 12 months, allows us to trigger capacity by prior arrangement in the event of need associated with surge, which we are now in, and guarantees access to a maximum of 30% capacity and beyond by agreement with private hospitals.  The HSE is paying commercial rates for activity already carried out.  The focus for private hospitals is on delivering urgent, time-dependent elective care and unscheduled care.  Continuity of care concerns are being addressed in two ways.  Public hospitals will determine the patient profile that will transfer and private hospitals can continue to deliver care for their patients in the remaining capacity, much of which will be urgent and necessary.</p><p> In conclusion, I would like to stress two points.  We need people to continue to use the health services during this time.  We are alert to the fact that in the first phase of this, there was the risk of patients not attending emergency departments for strokes and heart attacks in particular.  Meeting the exceptional challenges which present to acute care depends heavily on the public response and the management of the infection in the community.  That concludes my opening statement.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

Before I open up the meeting to members, I thank Mr. Woods on behalf of the committee for the work he and his colleagues have done, and continue to do, to address the onerous challenges posed by the spread of Covid-19.  Our first questioner this morning is Senator Conway.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and reiterate his comments in terms of thanking our guests for the fantastic work they are doing on all our behalf.  I have a couple of questions for Mr. Woods and then a couple for Dr. Glynn.  I will start with Mr. Woods.  I can only imagine it is worrying from his perspective that 6,000 staff in the acute hospitals are out sick at the moment.  I imagine the vast majority of them are out with Covid-19, either self-isolating or with Covid-19 itself.  Has the HSE done any work or analysis on the outbreaks of Covid-19 in the acute hospitals?  Has it carried out analysis as to how it is getting in so readily at this stage?  Has Mr. Woods figures to hand of patients who present to the acute hospitals with non-Covid conditions who are actually contracting Covid-19 within the hospital setting?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.401" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#D00400"><p>I thank the Senator.  In brief, in terms of staff absence the Senator is right in saying we are talking about both Covid-positive and Covid-contact scenarios.  Indeed, there are staff who are cocooning because they are vulnerable to the condition.</p> <p>  In terms of infection, the Senator is absolutely correct.  We have data on the numbers of outbreaks.  Right now, for example, there are 120 open outbreaks in the acute setting.  We have also got those data for community settings.  We also look at hospital-acquired cases.  By way of example, in the week to 17 January, we had 442 hospital-acquired cases of Covid-19.</p><p>We are also keeping a close eye on laboratory-confirmed positive cases.  The measures in place to address that, without taking too much of the Senator's time, are very much the infection prevention control guidance that we have in place through Professor Martin Cormican and colleagues, a lot of training and support, as well as provision of personal protective equipment, PPE, that is thankfully at this stage available, whereas the Senator will recall we had struggled with that in the first phase.  Of course, the infrastructure we are working in and the increasing modernisation of that infrastructure is of assistance but some of our infrastructure is quite dated and that presents additional challenges.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#E00200"><p>In terms of the private hospital capacity, does Mr. Woods have to hand figures on how much of the private hospital capacity the HSE is using at present either for Covid or non-Covid public patients?  I understand that the HSE is at surge and I would be interested in those figures.</p> <p>  On a general point, is Mr. Woods confident that the high level of care that has been provided in our hospitals over the years is being maintained or has there been compromise to the care of patients due the enormous strains and pressures that are on the system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.404" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#E00300"><p>As for private hospital capacity, in the past week 800 patients were treated.  That was the first week within which the arrangement was triggered.  To give the Senator a figure, 30% of capacity is just under 600 beds.  As I said in the opening statement, we have access to more by agreement with the private hospitals.  Our purpose at present is to grow to the use of that capacity.</p> <p>  The kind of care being provided in the private system is primarily non-Covid.  The intention is to move patients to the private system who need urgent surgery where the private hospitals have that capacity.  We are not at present consciously sending Covid-related patients.</p> <p>  On the point relating to confidence, clearly in a system where we have significant staff absence, very significant surge and high community infection, we are concerned about risk.  Staff across the system are working as best possible to mitigate that risk but it would be unrealistic to expect the same outcome as in previous times, as the Senator suggests.  We are very alert to that.  I might ask my colleague, Dr. Hamilton, if she wishes to comment on that as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.405" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Vida Hamilton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#E00400"><p>The Senator is absolutely correct.  We are in surge capacity and, therefore, we have to deploy different methods of staffing to ensure best care.  Our critical care nurse escalation plan is in place.  We trained 1,600 non-critical care staff to support critical care services.  We deployed them in a one-to-one ratio working directly with a critical care nurse in a buddy arrangement in the first instance.  Then, as we entered surge, we had one critical care nurse supervising two, and then three, non-critical care nurses but maintaining a nurse-patient ratio of one-to-one for optimal safety.  We have a daily critical care major surge working group with very close engagement with the National Office of Clinical Audit, NOCA, which is monitoring occupancy and staffing levels.  We have daily contact with units that are not declaring capacity to ensure they have arrangements in place for further emergency admissions and we are very actively managing that situation.  As to whether the care is of the same standard, the answer is "No".</p></speech>

For level 2 patients, the normal ratio is one critical care nurse to two level 2 patients but for units that are in surge, yes, we are using that escalation model as the Senator described.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Hamilton and Mr. Woods.  I have a couple of questions for Dr. Glynn.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Glynn for all the great work he is doing.</p><p>On 30 December, the restrictions in existence now were introduced by the Government.  Is Dr. Glynn disappointed that there are still 2,000 to 2,500 cases a day given the fact that we are now over three weeks into new level 5 plus restrictions?  Would he have expected that we would be in a better position on 22 January after these restrictions were introduced?</p></speech>

The Senator asked if we are surprised that we have not made greater progress.  We are not.  We saw levels of infection in this country that we have never seen previously and neither have many countries internationally.  Unfortunately, when one gets to levels as high as what we have experienced, it will take a long time.  The pressures that we are seeing currently in the hospitals and ICU are reflective of what we have seen in the community in terms of case numbers in recent weeks.</p></speech>

In general terms, we have a long way to go before we get back to a level of reopening that we have seen previously.  I would emphasise at all times that from my perspective I do not believe there is too much value at this point, given the pressures on our health service, of looking too far back in history or looking too far forward.  At the moment, we need to focus on the next days and weeks.  NPHET and society have a number of key priorities that we are trying to protect and keep going as much as possible.

That is not realistic in that there are essential services we have to keep going.  Our best indicator of compliance and population buy-in is the average number of close contacts per case.  That has fallen to 2.1 on average per confirmed case.  The challenge is not so much to improve on that.  It is how to sustain and maintain that over the coming weeks.  That is going to be very difficult.  The majority of people have stayed at home and have not met up with friends or family members.  That becomes increasingly difficult as we move forward over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I commend all of those on the front line in our healthcare services who are doing a Trojan job.  I also commend those in the HSE who are rolling out the vaccine and wish everybody well.  Best wishes to Dr. Woods and his team and Dr. Ronan Glynn and his team as well.</p> <p>  I appreciate the point that Dr. Glynn made that there may not be best value in looking back too much at this point because we have a very real crisis in the here and the now.  Everybody accepts that.  I am sure Dr. Glynn will also accept, however, that looking back is also important to learn lessons.  We went from a situation before Christmas from having some of the best data in the EU.  We were one of the best performing countries in terms of having very low rates of transmission.  Towards the end of December into early January, we went quickly to being one of the worst performing.  As Dr. Glynn said, this involved record numbers that were not anticipated and numbers in the thousands every day which has resulted in transmission rates which are off the charts.</p><p>If I am to be blunt, we lost control of the virus.  I have to ask whether losing control of the virus was as a result of a failure of public health advice that was given or a failure to act on public health advice.  What Dr. Glynn said, and he is right, was that all of us need to follow the public health advice in the individual asks but we also need to stay at home.  This is the best way to help those on the front line so we have fewer cases, less transmission of the virus and fewer hospitalisations.  If that is the case now, surely it was the case before we lost control of the virus.  My direct question is whether losing control of the virus was down to public health advice that failed or our failure, as politicians, to act on the health advice given.</p></speech>

It is clear that a number of factors played into the situation that led to where we ended up at the end of December and early January.  To be honest, it is not for me and it will take time to look back and separate out the relative contribution of the various elements but there is no doubt that increased levels of socialisation, the opening up of society, the extent to which generations, families and households mixed and the introduction of a more transmissible variant at the end of December were all factors that contributed to where we ended up in early January.  If there is a lesson to be learned - the Deputy's question was premised on learning lessons - it is a one that we have known previously and it is very important that we bear it in mind as we move forward.  It is that when we have to act on this virus we have to act quickly when things are going wrong.  On the other side of this, when we are coming out-----</p></speech>

If we do not learn lessons about why we lost control, we could lose control again.</p> <p>  With regard to public health intervention and the public health advice being given at present, there is a legitimate debate about whether we are doing enough about travel, for example, having mandatory quarantine for people coming into the State and onto the island.  Is NPHET advising mandatory quarantine?</p> <p>  The secondary issue is that we have never got testing and tracing right.  We have never used it to hunt down the virus effectively.  Dr. Glynn said it will take some time to get to a point anywhere near where we were during the summer - that is because of mistakes that were made - and we hope the vaccination programme will help also.  When we get to that point we will need to use testing and tracing very effectively.  What more can be done in this area?  Is NPHET advising the Government that we should have mandatory quarantine of people coming into the State and onto the island?</p></speech>

This is not simply NPHET's position, it is the position clearly articulated by the ECDC as recently as yesterday, particularly in relation to the emergence of new variants.</p></speech>

The question I asked is whether NPHET is in favour of mandatory quarantine.  It is a very direct question.  Dr. Glynn appreciates why I am asking the question because it is a source of public discussion and an important one.  People have a reasonable expectation that we will do everything possible to prevent the virus coming in when we get the numbers down low.  I am asking Dr. Glynn a direct question as to whether NPHET is advising mandatory quarantine with regard to travel.</p></speech>

This is the most important measure.  Beyond this, our advice is there and it is published.  We have asked for mandatory quarantine previously and recently we asked for any element of discretion as it applies to travel to be removed insofar as is possible.  However, we are not the experts on what is possible.</p><p>What we want is a situation where essential travel is reduced to the greatest extent possible, through whatever means are required to bring that into effect.</p></speech>

To be clear, what Dr. Glynn is saying is that NPHET has previously recommended mandatory quarantine and its position has not changed, and the reality of how that will happen has to be worked out by Government, but NPHET&rsquo;s advice is there should be mandatory quarantine.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Mandatory quarantine is one way in which that could be done, but there may be other ways that could be done that I am not privy to from a health perspective.  As I said, the key is that as few people as possible come into this country for non-essential reasons over the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>

I say all of that because it is important that we do everything we possibly can to have the strongest public health interventions to reduce the transmission rates and to reduce the number of people who contract the virus.

In terms of the actual numbers, 287 was to become 301 at the end of quarter 1 of 2021 and then to grow to 321 by the end of the year.

Would Mr. Woods accept that is going to present real challenges for hospitals when we start to reopen that care again and that we are going to need a very substantial catch-up plan?  I say this because the front-line staff I talk to daily are exhausted and absolutely at breaking point - not near it, they are at it.  They have had a very tough year, they are dealing with a very tough time, and they will now face into all of the catch-up care that will have to be done.  First, what are we going to do to make sure we have all of the additional capacity we need to make sure they are protected?  I want to ask a second question.</p></speech>

I absolutely share his view on the difficult year it has been for staff and, of course, there will be significant catch-up.  We have learned that from the first phase, where there was significant loss of activity, which we are experiencing once again.  We are looking to offset that as best we can into the private environment right now, but the Deputy is right in saying that when we get through this wave, we will still have significant catch-up.  In terms of capacity, the 1,146 beds we are putting in is a contribution to that.  Obviously, the NTPF has significant additional funds this year as well.  I think its budget may be &euro;130 million this year, and that can also support and assist.</p> <p>  I might ask my colleague, Ms Angela Fitzgerald, if there is anything further she would wish to add to that and I will come back in on Carrick-on-Suir.</p></speech>

For context, in the bed capacity review, it brings us to where we should be by the end of this year.  As we know, and the Deputy made the point well, that capacity will not give us as much as it would have before.  In our plan this year, we are recognising that we will not get the same yield in our activity both in theatre and in social distance requirements.  We have three plans: one, to grow capacity; two, to leverage the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, which, as Mr. Woods noted, has &euro;130 million to spend this year; and three, a fund of &euro;150 million coming through in the Estimates for the access to care plan.  We are trying to use as much of it in the public system but the Deputy's point is well made around the fatigue in staff and the challenge in the short term of growing that capacity.  We have a target of about &euro;45 million to spend in the public system doing more public work through extended day and out-of-hours and using new capacity.  We are also looking at using the private sector for a broader range of initiatives than we would have seen before.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke of learning lessons.  We have learned a lot about how we can work more effectively with the private sector.  When our doctors work alongside their doctors, we get a better yield.  That is a model that we will continue to use.  Some exciting innovations are coming, which Dr. Hamilton may wish to speak on.  For example, one challenge we face is endoscopy.  No matter how fast we run, the growth in the waiting list gets ahead of us and Covid has made that a much more challenging issue.  We are doing a couple of things.  We are looking at rolling out PillCam, a camera that we can use, as part of our response.  It has two benefits.  One is to-----</p></speech>

The CMO's position on this, as my own, has been articulated on a number of occasions.  I refer the Deputy and others, as I have done previously, to our letter of 5 January.  I will read out again what we said because our advice has not changed:</p> <blockquote> 	...while the experience from September to December 2020 has clearly demonstrated that schools are in themselves a safe environment, the current epidemiological situation has deteriorated to a point where the significant levels of mobility and linked activity that the full reopening of schools would generate, constitutes a very significant additional risk in the context of what are already unprecedented levels of disease transmission in the community. </blockquote> <p>In that letter we also pointed out that measures should be taken to limit the impact on the healthcare workforce and that specific measures be taken to ensure that more vulnerable children can be best supported over these weeks.</p></speech>

Would NPHET favour the return to school and the facilitation of the return to school of children with special needs?</p></speech>

From our perspective, would 3%, 4% or 5% of that full cohort going back have a significant impact on the very high levels of community transmission that we are seeing at present?  No, it would not.  That would not have a significant impact on mobility at community level.</p></speech>

The next question, and we are three minutes into my questions now, is whether NPHET favours the prioritisation of teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, with regard to vaccinations or is it comfortable with the existing priority list?</p></speech>

It will look at that on an ongoing basis.  It is up to that committee in the first instance to look at the prioritisation list and if there are any changes to that list, it will be submitted to NPHET in the first instance and then considered by the Government.</p></speech>

Pending the abundance of supply that may hopefully arrive at the beginning of the second quarter, does NPHET see some degree of flexibility or elasticity in that priority list as situations demand or as supply arrives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.461" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#K00500"><p>Clearly, as supply arrives there will be greater flexibility in rolling out the vaccine but in the first instance the prioritisation list has to be guided by our experience of the pandemic to date.  It has to be premised on protecting those who are most vulnerable and who have suffered the severest effects of this.  Obviously, that is older people and people living in residential care facilities.  It also has to be premised on protecting our healthcare staff, both for their protection, and the protection of the health service, but also for the protection of the patients they care for on a daily basis.  Beyond that, if there are any changes to the prioritisation list, even with volume the reality is that if we raised a group up a prioritisation list, there is no getting away from the fact that in doing so we are deprioritising another group.  There are significant moral and ethical questions to be asked and decisions to be made in all of that.  That is a process that needs to take place over time as more evidence becomes available and as we learn more about the volume of vaccines we are going to get and when we are going to get them and, crucially also, as we learn more about the impact of these vaccines on transmission.</p></speech>

I mean this as a serious point but I believe there is a need to repurpose the messaging because NPHET has exhausted almost every adjective in the dictionary at this stage.  The situation was viewed as grave a year ago when we were down at level 5, and I am not belittling all of this, but many people are not listening now.  I live very close to the M50.  Last year during level 5 lockdown, the M50 was like a quiet country road.  One could hear individual cars on it.  Today it is buzzing, and we heard figures this week of 60% of transport being on the road.  What are Dr. Glynn's ideas about that?  People have switched off.  They often ask me why the daily briefings are continuing as it is too much to take in.</p><p>The recent message that this will go on for at least a year had a serious negative impact on people's mental health.  I found it quite disheartening to hear.  While we are at level 5 in theory, Dublin is not at level 5.  There is a significant amount of activity.  The city is quiet but there is much going on in the suburbs.  That is not a criticism of the witnesses.  Do they have any ideas on how the messaging can be changed to reinforce its impact?</p></speech>

One of the challenges in this is that much of the messaging has not changed because the basic premise of the messaging has not changed.  The underlying issue has not changed, namely, that this virus is dangerous and the way to stop transmission is to get people not to come into contact with one another.</p> <p>  We have a behavioural subgroup which does fantastic work behind the scenes.  NPHET expects to receive a paper from it next week, specifically looking at how to sustain the high levels of compliance we have seen over recent weeks.  One key thing the subgroup tells us is that we need to be careful about overemphasising the small minority of people who are not adhering.  I take the Deputy's point that there is more activity on the roads but we can see from the close contacts that average confirmed cases have that the vast majority of people are complying to the greatest extent possible.</p> <p>  The natural reproduction number of the virus is probably between three and four.  Approximately 60% of cases in the country are probably related to the so-called UK variant, B117, which is more highly transmissible.  Despite that, we have managed to get down to a reproduction number which was estimated by Professor Nolan yesterday evening as being between 0.5 and 0.9.  A key part of what we need people to understand is that they are not alone in doing the right thing.  There are outliers and people who are not following the guidance but the vast majority of people in the country are still listening to the basic messages.  It is incredibly difficult for them but they are sticking with it.  Hopefully they will stick with it in a year that will be much quieter than last year, although unfortunately there can be no guarantees about that.</p></speech>

Part of the role is to reflect public opinion and what we hear as constituency politicians.  When people who are making an effort see workers on a building site or a shop open, it can have a corrosive effect.  It might be useful, if it is appropriate, for Dr. Glynn to share with the committee the behavioural paper to which he referred.  We would find it useful to look at some of the background.  We want to be helpful too.</p></speech>

I have questions for Dr. Glynn.  NPHET's most recent letter, which was published yesterday, is explicit about international travel and I welcome that.  In the last couple of paragraphs, it refers to the current arrangements where a person is required to restrict his or her movements and there is no requirement for a post-arrival test.  The letter explicitly states that we need to remove the discretion in both those areas.  My interpretation of that is that if one removes the discretion, one is then calling for a mandatory arrangement.  Am I right in that reading of the letter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.469" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#L00500"><p>As I said earlier, we are certainly not the experts regarding what measures or blend of measures might be usefully applied.  Ultimately, we are interested in reducing non-essential travel to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>Mandatory quarantine is one potential solution there.  There may be others.  Ultimately, we want discretion removed so that as few people as possible, who do not need to be travelling, are travelling.</p></speech>

For some reason, the Government seemed to think it was okay to introduce a regime whereby one had a pre-departure test, then it was discretionary and it was advised that people self-isolate.  Most of us view that as totally inadequate in respect of safeguarding the country.  I am aware that politics involved in this and NPHET is very careful not to stray into the political arena.  It has been said before that while mandatory quarantining would be welcome, it is viewed as not politically feasible.  Given the escalation of the situation and the new variants that have emerged, I wonder why NPHET does not come out and provide clear advice on what is in the best interests of the country in respect of international travel.</p></speech>

We do not want non-essential travellers coming into this country.  We have been clear on that for months.  It has happened, although obviously the volume of travel has been way down, which is welcome.  There is no doubt that travel continues to play a role in the transmission of this disease in this country and will make it more difficult to maintain suppression over time.  That is particularly the case in light of the new variants.</p></speech>

It is incumbent on political leaders to take a new approach.  I welcome the clarification provided in the letter.</p> <p>  Dr. Glynn talked about the basic tools that can be used, and have been used from the beginning.  I wonder why improving ventilation is not included as one of those tools.</p></speech>

The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has had guidance up on ventilation for many months.  We have been clear that ventilation does play a role.  However, we need to be careful that we do not become too reductionist in our approach.  There is no one measure that can stop this virus.</p></speech>

I am just making the point that it would be helpful if NPHET representatives and the public messaging stressed the importance of good ventilation.  It has been lost, and it should be more centre-stage, in my view.  The general advice would concur with that.</p> <p>  On the question of when restrictions might be lifted, the approach that has been taken to date has been to introduce the various restrictions for a period of time.  I recognise that NPHET had recommended that the previous level 5 restrictions be introduced with a view to bringing the incidence rate down to between 50 and 100.  What is Dr. Glynn's view of the level of the virus at which it would be safe to lift the restrictions?  I am talking about daily case numbers.</p></speech>

We need to see how things play out with the E117 variant, which is the British variant, as it becomes even more dominant in this country.  We need to see the extent to which we remain successful in containing the South African and Brazilian variants.  In the first instance, we need to see whether we can maintain the current rates of improvement over the coming weeks.  There is no guarantee on that.  It is simply too early to talk-----</p></speech>

There is some very early suggestion that the South African variant in particular, and perhaps the Brazilian variant, may have an impact in reinfection and may have an impact on the effectiveness of the currently available vaccines.  I stress that this is very early, and we certainly need more evidence before we could conclude on that.  Clearly, we must adopt a precautionary principle and the key now is to stop these variants from being imported here in the first instance.</p></speech>

They have heard it a few times at this committee on health.  We are very aware of the amount of work they are doing and how hard they are working.  They are trying to deal with a very difficult situation.</p> <p>  I will return to the issue of beds and staffing.  I want to unpack a bit around the bed and staffing outlook for 2021.  In some of the opening statements today we heard there were 274 beds planned for 2021, which is reliant on staffing and recruitment.  Could we hear a little more about this?  Is recruitment increasing or decreasing at the moment?  What happens in the event that we are unable to attract staff to those beds and at what level do we think this will hit those 274 beds?</p></speech>

There are 6,300 additional whole-time equivalents, WTE, which is slightly more in staff numbers, in the health system currently.  Of those, some 3,900 are in the acute environment.  We can provide data separately on the balance of 2,288 because I do not want to read out numbers for too long here.  There has been a significant increase in staffing.  Some of that is associated with the capacity already open and the Deputy is right in saying that the critical dependency for 2021 is our ability to recruit.  The service plan and the Estimate budget for 2021 provides for very significant recruitment.</p> <p>  On the acute side I will ask Ms Fitzgerald to comment on the beds.  We have already opened some of those beds and they are staffed.  We have opened six beds in the high dependency unit in Limerick, the latest beds opened, which is also staffed.</p></speech>

We started with a target of 11,046 beds in 2020.  During the first wave of Covid we opened 426 of those beds on a temporary basis.  Thankfully we are now in a position to keep those open.  The link with staffing is very relevant.  Obviously, if we know the beds are opened permanently then we can attract permanent staff.  This is very important.</p> <p>  The second thing we did was to look to open the balance of beds.  By the end of last year we had a total of 677 additional beds opened.  That included the 426.  This leaves us with a further number of beds to open this year, which is about 470.  The plan is to try to open half of those in the first quarter and the remainder will be over the year.  We have been successful in being able to get most of those beds open on time.  To the extent there are beds in the back end of the year it is because they are largely dependent on capital works.  The Deputy has raised an important point.</p><p>The objective is to get additionality, and one of the challenges we face right now is that, typically, in any one year we would have up to 100 out of our 11,000 beds closed, either because of infection control issues or refurbishment.  At the moment, that number is 600, so while we are opening beds, we are also challenged every day by beds that are closed because of outbreaks.  They are closed necessarily because of safety reasons.  I hope that as we get ahead with this vaccine, what it will give us is that 1,146 beds.  I am happy to give a breakdown on the 66 critical care beds, if the Deputy wishes.  In summary, 40 beds were opened temporarily under the arrangements in March and up to May and we are opening those permanently.  We have 33 of those beds opened permanently.  As Mr. Woods said, we are stretching to open other ones on a temporary basis in response to the surge, but the objective is that by the end of quarter 1 we would have the 46 beds open.  The 20 beds that are in the back end of this year are again due to capital works.  The 66 additional beds will give-----</p></speech>

She raised an issue I am generally interested in, which is permanence and attracting staff.  In 2019, we had some of the lowest levels of acute care beds and ICU beds in the EU.  As we move through this crisis, we have seen significant support for the health system and beds opening up, but what will we be looking at as the numbers, hopefully, continue to reduce?  Are we going to be left with permanent beds or will we see beds closing?</p></speech>

We have to acknowledge the collaboration with the Department.  The 1,146 beds will be permanent beds.  They directly align with the targets that are set in the capacity review, which set a very similar figure to have in place by the end of 2021.  We are getting to a place.  What that will do is allow us to operate at 85% occupancy, which is the international norm and it is what the bed capacity review recommends.  That will allow for a safer and more effective flow of patients.  It does drive other efficiencies because one can use one's beds more effectively.  Deputy Hourigan is quite right.</p></speech>

The target at the end of this year in ICU capacity is to have 321 beds, from a starting base last March of 255.  We can provide more data.  I will not keep talking about numbers, but Dr. Hamilton might want to give more context around the ICU capacity and what that means.</p></speech>

Supporting that, we have the critical care programme and a very strong critical care nursing training infrastructure to ensure that we have a continuous supply of appropriately trained staff as those beds open.  We are also working very closely with the Joint Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine of Ireland and the national doctors training and planning in workforce planning from the medical side also.</p></speech>

I have two questions for Mr. Woods.  In his statement, he indicated that 6,500 healthcare workers are on sick leave at present.  That includes 2,500 nurses.  That is a colossal hole in the public health service.  At the apex of the surge in April and May 2020, what was the breakdown of healthcare workers out of work due to the pandemic?</p><p>What is the tipping point because obviously that is not sustainable?  If it gets to the stage where so many nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers are out of work, it will have a very detrimental effect on doing the basics in our health system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.501" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#P00200"><p>The peak from April last year was about 5,700 as I recall, of which about half were in the hospital system with the balance in the community sector.  We have now exceeded that.  The Deputy asked about the implications and where the tipping point is.  At the moment we have over 500 beds vacant in the hospital system which is primarily associated with staffing.  As Dr. Hamilton said, we have also moved staff to support ICU and we have stopped non-urgent elective procedures and outpatient services.  The system is focused on the core emergency flow and dealing with Covid.</p> <p>  As Dr. Glynn mentioned, subject to the current positive trend in reducing numbers of cases, although they are still very high, we think the service pressure as a result of patients with Covid in hospitals is peaking around now.  The ICU peak may still be a week ahead; there is always a lag in the ICU pressure.  We think we are very close to peak demand if the public measures remain in place.  I acknowledge we are also at a point where what is being asked of staff is truly exceptional given the workload that is currently being undertaken.</p></speech>

There are question marks over the colossal amount of public money that went into private hospitals last year.  I think it was &euro;113 million per month.  How different is the deal this time?  I understand the initial cost is &euro;38 million.  Is this value for money?  What are the Covid and non-Covid capacity issues for private hospitals?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#P00400"><p>The Deputy is right that there is a fundamental difference.  For three months last year, the HSE took on the full capacity of the private system and paid at cost for that.  The estimate for the full cost is about &euro;300 million, but I would need to confirm that number.  This time the arrangement is that we are taking on upfront 30% capacity and therefore it is not a cost-based arrangement.  We are paying commercial rates.  The key focus for us now is to move patients to the private hospitals from public hospitals to alleviate the pressure the Deputy mentioned in his first question.  It is a key safety valve for us.</p> <p>  The other learning from the last time was that private hospitals are already undertaking significant urgent elective activity.  It is not necessary or helpful to displace that activity.  It is important that continues or it would potentially come into the public hospital system.  We are working with the private hospitals right now to optimise the use of that 30% capacity.  If we are at the ceiling of demand, we will continue to do that depending on certain trigger criteria which are set out and which are fundamentally based on the incidence of virus in the community and some hospital factors.  There is a difference.  The difference is that we have taken less capacity, but the private hospitals continue to do significant private work that is of benefit.</p></speech>

The estimate will fundamentally depend on the duration.  The arrangement is for 12 months, but it is triggered when we hit particular surge points and we are in one of those right now.  The cost will depend on how frequently it is triggered and how quickly it stands down.  The figure the Deputy mentioned is an initial estimate of the first surge cost, but that could vary quite a bit, based on the degree of uptake of work in the private system.</p></speech>

While I am trying not to be political here, it is hard for Deputies not to be political.  It is obvious that the Government's living with Covid policy is in tatters.</p><p>We are in the third lockdown and this is even worse than the previous two.  The Government went against NPHET advice in late November and we are now living with the consequences.  It is like living with an abuser; we cannot live with Covid.  The policy of "living with Covid" simply do not work.  How has this gone so terribly wrong in the space of six weeks?  Ireland had one of the lowest rates of virus incidence and it now has one of the highest in the world.  It is a result of the policy of living with Covid so we must do something different.</p></speech>

In the next month we will learn much about the future of dealing with the virus, particularly the extent to which the existence of these variants becomes known across Europe as more testing is done in member states and the extent to which we will be successful in containing or avoiding their import.</p> <p>  Just yesterday NPHET commenced work on where we go in the medium to longer term, looking at a 12-month view.  In the first instance we would deal with the next four, six, eight and 12 weeks, an acute phase in which we try to manage what is facing us now.  We need to build on that and put in play what we hope will be a very positive impact from the vaccines over the medium term.  We clearly need to start talking about the longer term as well, as the one action we cannot take is go back to a position where we do not understand the very significant impact that globalisation can have on us in Ireland if we do not have enough focus on infectious diseases and their impact.</p> <p>  Looking at the global experience of this pandemic, Dr. Mike Ryan has said this may not be the big one and he may very well be right.  What we have seen internationally with this pandemic is that experiences like this affect the most disadvantaged and vulnerable and those living on the margins of society.  In the longer term, if there is to be any legacy from this, we must put in place a process that learns from the experience to ensure we can be in a better position in future.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the exceptional work carried out by front-line workers and health officials over the past few months.</p> <p>  Christmas was always going to be a threat over any other time of year due to the nature of Irish people and the season coming after a difficult year.  It coincided with the UK-identified strain of the virus arriving in the country.  Was socialising through private gatherings and family homes the main source of infection that is responsible for our current position?  Did we misread the threat or virulence of the UK-identified strain?  The virus has mutated and new strains have been identified.  There are different strains of flu annually so does Dr. Glynn anticipate there will be an annual vaccine for Covid-19 for older people or those with underlying conditions next winter and in following winters?  Is this something that we hope will go away?</p><p>I have two questions for Mr. Woods afterwards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.512" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#R00200"><p>There is no doubt that when this virus gets into a household it is very difficult to stop it spreading within the household.  If we listen to our clinicians</p> <p> or GPs all across the country at the moment, any time one hears them speak it is very evident that containing spread within households had become much more difficult in recent weeks.  That is most likely linked to the increased transmissibility of the new variant B117.  However, to say that that was the primary factor, I do not think we could conclude that at the moment.  What NPHET was clear about was that the significant risk was, which I am not attributing this to any particular sector or any particular setting, is in general terms we were worried that over the first three weeks in December there would be an opening up of society where, I suppose, younger people in the first instance would take advantage of that, would meet each other, would stick within the guidelines but there were far more opportunities for them to interact.  What we were concerned about was that would lead to a volume of disease within a cohort of our population and then that would be followed through the Christmas and new year period by very significant intergenerational mixing where, unfortunately, that would lead then to very significant volumes of disease in those who are most vulnerable and elderly.  Unfortunately, that has played out.  </p> <p>  We can see from the mobility data that on 22 and 23 December we were back to levels of mobility in this country that were equivalent to what we saw pre-pandemic.  That is the only time it happened since last February and that was in the week leading up to Christmas.  Again, without being specific to a sector, and certainly not in any way seeking to attribute blame, I said in December that just because people could do something did not mean that they should do something.  The reality is that people could do an awful lot.  Unfortunately, we are where we are and it will take time to separate out the relative contribution of each of those elements.</p> <p>  Did we misread the threat?  To misread a threat one has to be aware of the threat and it was only notified by the UK authorities, and I would need to double-check for sure, but I think it was 19 or 21 December.  We acted on that immediately.  We can see from our own data that we had very low levels of the variant in the country.  Looking back, there was probably less than 2% in the country up to 13 December, certainly less than 10% up to the week after that and then rising to approximately 16% in Christmas week, which is the week in which we first became aware that this variant was an issue.  So there is no doubt that the variant is playing a significant role now and will be a significant challenge for us as we seek to achieve further suppression of this disease.  There is no doubt that it played a role in making things as bad as they have got.  Again, it was one contributor in a crowded field of contributors to the situation that we have found ourselves in.</p> <p>  Regarding the annual vaccine, on a positive front, the wonderful thing about the mRNA vaccines and the new technology we have is that it appears, in relative terms, that it is simple to swap out the key part of that vaccines and swap in other elements that can help to address the threats posed by other variants of this virus.  That is not entirely clear at the moment but the scientific community seems reasonably confident that the swaps to update these vaccines will not be as onerous as the process that we had to go through to develop the vaccines in the first instance.  In any event, this is not just about vaccination because were this vaccine to have the effect that we want it to have it needs to have an effect all over the world.  If populations all across the world do not get this vaccine and are not immunised, we are going to see the emergence of new variants in other parts of the world.</p><p>They will eventually arrive here and will have very significant implications for public health in this country.  It is in all our interests to do what we can to ensure that there is equitable access and supply across the world to vaccines.</p></speech>

I am inquiring about the nature of the ICU beds required for those who have Covid but no other underlying conditions.  Do they require the same level of support as an ICU bed that we would be more familiar with before this for somebody in post-operative care or stroke care?  Are they more or less intense or are they patient-dependent?  Second, how important are individual single-occupancy en suite rooms in the prevention of the spread of Covid?  I am thinking of the new 75-bed ward in GUH versus a traditional ward in the hospital.</p></speech>

They have single organ failure.  They are being supported outside of the intensive care unit but they are doing very well.  We are providing ICU outreach to support the ones that are flagged by the respiratory teams to critical care.  Does that answer the Senator's question?</p></speech>

I reiterate what everyone has said.  I thank all the witnesses so much for being here and for the work that they and their teams are doing.  It is deeply appreciated by all of us here and, I am sure, many members of the public.</p> <p>  I will focus on two areas.  The phrase "colossal health crisis" has been used in this session.  We are obviously in a colossal health crisis but we arguably have an even more colossal health crisis coming down the line in dealing with the backlog that is being created and the knock-on consequences of Covid.  We briefly talked about waiting lists.  Has Mr. Woods any figures available - I would be happy to take them in writing - on how much the waiting lists have increased by?  Before the Covid crisis we were constantly talking about waiting lists and the numbers going up.  Has he figures for the waiting lists, particularly for cancer care and coronary care?  For example, does he know how many cancer diagnoses there were in 2019 compared to 2020, which would perhaps tell us have we missed cancer care diagnoses?  I had a meeting with the Irish Cancer Society over the summer and the society estimated by then that 600 cancer diagnosis had been missed.  In the months following that, they estimated there would have been many more.  Has Mr. Woods any thoughts on those waiting lists and those whose care we may have missed out on despite the best efforts to not do so?</p></speech>

I will pass over to my colleague, Ms Angela Fitzgerald, in a moment.  We can provide specific commentary back to the Senator in writing from the cancer programme on what has happened in cancer care and maybe, more generally, on waiting lists.</p></speech>

The effect of the decisions in March to curtail non-urgent elective care, which were appropriate because we were at a very early stage of understanding the disease, had a significant impact.  While the system recovered, we have given ourselves a very big challenge.  To put it into context, at the end of last year we had 66,000 patients waiting on our inpatient and day-case waiting list.  At the peak in the middle of the summer, that rose to 85,000.  That was largely because we were not able to schedule cases.</p><p>We are back down to 72,000, but 72,000 is obviously an unacceptable number.  I mentioned earlier the access to care plan, but that is very challenged because, as the committee can see, alongside lockdown measures we also have to curtail elective care that is not time-dependent.  It is important to say - and I think Dr. Hamilton will be able to come in on this - that we did, as far as possible, try to protect time-dependent care in two ways: not only in our public hospitals but also through the arrangement we had with private hospitals, which was intended to protect that care.  While a lot has been said about the success or otherwise of the private hospital initiative, the committee will see in the pack and the opening statement we have provided the scale of work that was done in that time.  Much of it was supporting cancer and other care.  We did over 50,000 inpatient and day cases during that time.  We also moved cancer care from public to private hospitals very successfully and moved the doctors with it.  We saw that in St. Vincent's, in the Mater, in the Whitfield and in Cork.  That will be an important part of surviving this current surge.</p><p> Regarding outpatients, which comprised a very challenging number to begin with, we had made significant inroads last year, although we were still at a very high figure.  We went from a figure of about 565,000 at the end of last year up to more than 600,000 now.  While typically none of these are patients waiting for cancer care, they are people who need to be seen and they pose a very significant challenge.  One of the things we did successfully during the peak of the first surge was to shift some of our outpatient appointments to virtual appointments.  At one point during the peak almost half our patients were being seen virtually.  We would like to take that forward as part of the way we do our business but we also recognise that new patients need to be seen in person.  At macro level the figures have deteriorated.  Over the year we have seen them go, as I said, from 66,000 to 72,000 and from 560,000 to 610,000.</p><p> Regarding cancer, we have separate data coming through from the NCCP, and Dr. Hamilton may wish to comment on that, and our rapid access services, which are our early ways of detecting cancer, continued throughout.  One of the challenges was that people were delayed in presenting because many people did not present.  That is a challenge, and I think Mr. Woods made the point earlier that we see a direct relationship between attendance at ED and lockdown measures.  People tend to stay away.  It is a difficult message to get out.  We are trying to prevent people from moving around unnecessarily but we still want people to present to their GPs and to the ED if they need to do so.  The messaging that NPHET and others have got out on this is better and we are seeing better traction on it now.  We are happy to share the detail of this with Senator Hoey if she so wishes.</p></speech>

Could any of the witnesses offer their thoughts on the following?  We have talked a lot about mandatory quarantine, and there has been comment from some political corners to the effect that it is not necessary and that we will not go down that route.  I think it is important and necessary.  Certainly, we in the Labour Party are supportive of it.  What impact do the witnesses think not introducing mandatory quarantine will have on tackling the spread of this virus?  We can say we do not want people travelling unless it is absolutely essential.  Have we learned over the past ten months, however, that people will keep travelling and we simply need to go down the mandatory quarantine route, or what do the witnesses think the impact will be if we do not go down it?  There was not a huge amount of support or calls for mandatory quarantine earlier in the pandemic.  Do the witnesses think that was the wrong call?  Perhaps the media portrayed things for which there was no support, and I recognise that the things the media report on have to be taken with a pinch of salt, but it felt like there was not a huge amount of support earlier in this crisis for mandatory quarantining.  Do the witnesses think that has had a knock-on impact on the spread of this virus?</p></speech>

Again, however, I would caution that the experience over the past year has been - and this is very understandable - that we typically bounce from question to question and from theme to theme as though if we could just do this or that one more thing, we could all go back to normal.</p><p>Unfortunately, that is simply not the case.  We all want to go back to normal.  From NPHET's perspective, we want any measure brought in that will suppress this to the level we saw last June.  As I said, I am sure a variety of different measures are being considered that are way outside my sphere of understanding or expertise that might further help to reduce levels of incoming travel to this country.  I remember voicing concerns before Christmas that incoming travel could contribute to issues we would see at this time so I am not downplaying it in any way but it is also worth again reflecting in these conversations that the vast majority of people in this country have listened to the advice and have restricted travel.  Travel volumes are down very substantially on what they were previously.  The one thing I do not want to happen in this debate is for people out there to feel they are in the minority or are the stupid ones for not booking their holiday this summer.  That is not the case.  The majority of people have listened to the advice.  I know last summer was particularly difficult for people but they continued to listen to the advice and I do not think we should lose sight of that in the debates we have on this issue.  </p></speech>

I cannot even imagine the pressure they must be feeling.  I have more of a comment to make than a question to ask.  I hope I have not misinterpreted the vaccine arrangement that NPHET thinks will allow travel.  It is important to look at mandatory quarantine.  I read a tweet that really impacted me this morning from a young woman who said that she put up on Twitter that she quarantined in a room by herself for two weeks after her husband died, meaning she could not go to his funeral and could not be comforted by anyone for two weeks right after the most traumatic day of her life.   She then wrote "and you're all worried about inconveniencing tourists".  I do not mean to trivialise the travel issue because I understand there are important matters-----</p></speech>

I will repeat what I said as quickly as possible.  I was talking about the importance of mandatory quarantine.  I did hear what Dr. Glynn said about NPHET's current position on travel, namely, that the regime is not sufficient.  I heard him say that earlier to Deputy Shortall.  I wanted to put on the record that I read a tweet this morning from a young woman who said she quarantined in a room by herself for two weeks after her husband died, meaning she could not go to his funeral and could not be comforted by anyone for two weeks right after the most traumatic day of her life.  She then wrote "and you're all worried about inconveniencing tourists".</p><p>I do not want to trivialise this in any way with regard to travel.  I understand there has to be essential travel.  However, I do believe mandatory quarantine is important.  We see that it has worked in Australia.  It leads to reduced numbers and that is really important.  I do not really have a question as such because Dr. Glynn has answered many of the questions around that.</p><p> There is another question I would like to ask.  Before Christmas, Dr. Holohan was asked about alcohol and the role of alcohol in spreading the virus.  Has there been any more information around alcohol and how it can spread or has spread the virus over the Christmas period?  We all know how alcohol can lower people's inhibitions.  I hope the committee members and witnesses were able to catch all that.  I wanted to ask Dr. Glynn about the role of alcohol in spreading the disease.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.537" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#V00200"><p>I will keep it brief.  There is no new quantitative information.  What we have heard over and over again throughout the duration of our response to this pandemic are the granular qualitative stories, narratives and data that our public health doctors and their teams have given us.  It is difficult to put all of that into a weekly or regular report.  However, time and again they have told us about the extent to which socialisation has an impact on this, whether it is extended family gatherings, friends meeting up or, in particular, hospitality settings.  Again, this is not in any way seeking to attribute blame.  The reality is that when people consume alcohol, they drop their guard.  That is precisely what this virus wants us to do.  It is difficult enough for a person to remember to keep a distance of 2 m, avoid touching his or her face, wash hands, wear a mask appropriately and avoid crowds at the best of times.  I do not believe there is anyone who can say with confidence that they can do all that appropriately having consumed any significant level of alcohol.  It is a factor.  It is one more factor that we need to continue to address.  Again, I am simply trying to reflect.  Dr. Holohan was trying to reflect the concerns expressed to us by those who are at the coalface dealing with the impact of this on families and communities throughout the country.</p></speech>

We have seen a large amount of misinformation online in recent weeks on vaccination.  How can we communicate to those people and others that the reality is that the vaccine is safe?  That is all I have to ask.</p></speech>

We should not overly obsess over or give a platform to those who are seeking to promote misinformation.  The reality now is that 85% of people in the country are saying that they will probably or definitely take the vaccine when it is offered to them.  That does not mean they do not have questions or concerns.  Our job in the coming weeks and months will be to answer those questions and concerns and not worry too much about those on the extreme who will never be convinced by anything we say in respect of these vaccines.</p></speech>

My thanks as well to all the staff across the entire health service.  It has been a singularly challenging time during the past ten months.</p> <p>  I will open on the issue of messaging.  I am concerned because there are several instances I have come across where people seem to be totally blas&eacute; about the issue of Covid-19.  I am unsure whether we are getting the message out strongly enough.  One case involved someone who went into a medical clinic without advising that he was awaiting the results of a Covid-19 test.  After the medical clinic was over, he made a call saying that he had tested positive.  The following day he was contacted by people from the facility.  His friend picked up the telephone and handed it to the person who had identified as positive for Covid-19 because the person was driving.</p><p>People, therefore, are just not following the guidelines and it is something that we need to really work on.  Maybe the witnesses might give some comments on how we could focus on getting a stronger message out there.</p><p> The second issue I want to raise is nursing staff, who have had huge challenges over the last ten months.  The HSE representatives have given the figures on the number of them who are out.  Over 6,000 are out due to being a close contact or actually having Covid.  Can we get the figures of the people who have left the health service over the last ten months?  This may have been for various reasons, including family reasons and the difficulties they now face in trying to deal with it.  I have heard of quite a number of nursing staff who have resigned from the service.  When people are leaving the HSE who have resigned, are they being asked to fill out a questionnaire so it can be established why they have left?</p><p> The final thing I want to ask about is people who are coming back from abroad who are qualified nurses trying to get registered with An Bord Altranais.  I have one case at the moment where the person has been waiting for 16 weeks to get registered.  She trained and worked in the UK, has come back, self-isolated, put in an application and 16 weeks later still has not received her registration.  Can any of the witnesses deal with why it is taking four months for someone to register as a nurse here?</p></speech>

We have been as explicit as possible that people who have symptoms, think they might have Covid or have any suspicions should stay at home and contact their GP by phone in the first instance.  However, I absolutely take the Deputy's point that we need to continue to look at the messaging, try to freshen it up and try to target different groups of the population whether by age or by geography.  One of the ways in which we are doing that is we have asked our behavioural subgroup to bring a paper to NPHET next Thursday.  I am sure we can share it with the committee following on from that NPHET meeting.  There is no doubt however that it is an ongoing challenge, accepting again, as I always emphasise, that the vast majority of people are listening and are trying to do the right things.</p></speech>

On the number of nurses who have left, we can and will give the Deputy a report on nursing retirements.  I know he is also referring to nurses who have left without retiring and I will talk to HR colleagues and see if we have anything on that.  One of the challenges in that analysis will be that one of the big causes for leaving is movement to somewhere else as well, in normal times.  I understand that the Deputy is not referring to that but I will certainly see what data we have that would point toward this.  I think it would be usual that there would be exit questionnaires, as the Deputy referred to, or dialogue at least.  We may therefore be able to tap into some of the reasoning behind that but there is not a system that does that as a singularity.  Of course, half of the staff we are referring to will be in voluntary entities but again, we will have some data around that, particularly in retirement instances.  We would also potentially have some data, if we can obtain it, on age of retirement which would be an indicator in terms of what the Deputy is referring to.</p> <p>  On the An Bord Altranais issue, I will follow up with HR colleagues; I was not aware of that.  I am aware that under the existing legislation brought in earlier last year there is an exemption from registration fees for Covid response but I was not aware of that kind of delay.  I will certainly follow up with my HR colleagues.</p></speech>

Why is a comprehensive exit survey not done?  The stories I am getting back from nurses who walked away from the system describe situations where they feel that the issues they raised were not being taken on board.</p><p>I am a bit concerned that we do not have comprehensive exit surveys because it is only by conducting those that we can deal with the challenges that nurses are facing on the front line and that is extremely important.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that nurses, like all front-line staff, are working under enormous pressure at the moment and have been since 29 February last year in response to this pandemic.  I will dialogue with our colleagues in HR to see what is available.  I did not want to mislead in my reply, but there may be some information available which we can provide on that matter.  That information would certainly exist at a local hospital group and local hospital level.</p></speech>

We have agreed that the HSE can take over 30% of capacity in private hospitals.  What happens in areas where there is greater demand?  In Dublin and Cork, for example, there are quite a number of private hospitals whereas in other areas, there might be only one facility.  Is there any provision whereby the HSE can increase the volume of work that can be put into that private hospital beyond the agreed 30% because of the demands on the local HSE facility?  Is there such a mechanism in the agreement that has been reached?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.550" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#X00400"><p>There is an arrangement within the agreement that allows for going beyond that 30% where both parties consent.  It is also the case that the distribution of private hospitals around the country is variable, as the Deputy suggested, with a larger number in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  Patients are, in some instances, moving across facilities and are not necessarily limited by geography, depending on their particular requirements.  There is a basis for extending beyond the agreed 30% should it be required.</p></speech>

It is a considerable challenge because many of them are attending a medical facility three times a week and many of those patients and their families are extremely concerned.  What additional mechanisms have been put in place to make sure that those vulnerable patients do not contract Covid-19?  What can be done to assist them?  My understanding is that they are down the panel for vaccination.  We are talking about quite a small group of people, in real terms.  What is planned to deal with that situation?</p></speech>

When it came to access to hospital sites, the HSE ensured, to the greatest extent possible, separate entrances and egresses, and strong compliance with infection prevention and control guidance.  Dr. Hamilton may wish to say a bit more about that issue.</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, they cannot cocoon in their homes and have to leave to access dialysis.  We work closely with the dialysis programme.  We increased our dialysis delivery in satellite centres, away from the main hospital, by 20% in March 2020 in order to move people away from hospital settings for haemodialysis.  We also increased the number of individuals who could avail of home dialysis and provide their own care in the home.</p> <p>  We put in robust guidelines on the management of patients while receiving dialysis, including instigating the use of masking during haemodialysis.  With their agreement, our patients stopped eating and drinking during the dialysis period so that they could maintain masking and robust infection prevention and control practices.</p> <p>  We have audited our outcomes in terms of the acquisition of Covid-19 and outcomes from Covid, and they benchmark very favourably internationally.  There have been low acquisition and mortality rates compared with international comparators in that vulnerable group of patients.</p><p>We are very conscious of their vulnerability and we continue to work actively with the relevant doctors to increase the number of home dialysis solutions and other solutions.</p><p> An additional challenge has been the difficulty in delivering transplant services for patients with renal failure due to the increased risk among transplant recipients if Covid-19 is acquired in the post-transplant period.  That has put additional pressure on our renal services, but we are managing this extremely carefully.</p></speech>

Afterwards, colleagues who have already asked questions will be allowed one question each.</p> <p>  Yesterday, during Leaders' Questions, the T&aacute;naiste said 30% of cases arise in the hospital setting.  I heard Dr. Colm Henry state this morning that great efforts were being made to make hospitals as safe as possible.  We are talking about 2,000 people in the hospital setting with Covid.  One third of that figure is 666.  I heard Dr. Glynn state this morning that he wanted people to continue to use health services at this time.  Clearly, however, we have a problem with our hospitals.  Dr. Henry said this morning that there were difficulties with the way hospitals are designed and so on.  I am aware of the sacrifices staff have made.  We are already aware that 600 staff are out sick and that this is causing difficulties.  What could we be doing differently?  We have identified a cohort with a considerable rate of infection.  What can be done differently within the hospital setting?  I am aware that PPE and so on have a role but people are using such equipment.  In the first lockdown, people were talking about the possibility of looking for accommodation for staff in the health service.  Are we considering that?  What are we going to do differently because of the rise in the number of cases?</p> <p>  Many of us feel hopeless.  We are following all the guidelines.  I am not talking about the hospital setting, in particular, but it would be really helpful if people were told each week where there is a rise in the numbers.  I refer, in particular, to the track and trace system.  It would be helpful if we were told how people are getting infected.  It was mentioned this morning that infections are occurring in the home and that people may be going out partying.  There was a suggestion that people are going to shebeens.  It would be helpful if people could take ownership in respect of what they want to avoid doing.  If I knew infections were occurring in Tesco or Dunnes Stores down the road, I would avoid going there.  The same would apply to a certain shopping centre or other locations.  It would be really helpful if we could circulate the message on what people can do themselves aside from avoiding social contact and washing hands.  My key question, however, concerns what we can do in the hospital setting that we have not been doing to make hospitals safer for staff and patients.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.556" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#Y00300"><p>I will take the first question.  With regard to infection in hospitals, the key control is the infection rate in the community.  It is very visible that where there is a high rate of community infection, there are genuine challenges in the hospitals.  There are many measures in place within hospitals to control infection but the reality is that hospitals are treating vulnerable patients and doing so in a way that complies as best as possible with all the policies, including those on the use of PPE, handwashing, social distancing and all the other measures that we could talk about.  Fundamentally, however, the control concerns reducing the virus in the community.</p><p>Once the incidence of the virus in the community is high, it is a battle in hospitals to minimise its impact.  Hospital staff, however, live in community.</p><p> To the point about hospital staff who need to self-isolate, there has been provision in Citywest, as an example, where a facility is provided for such staff.  In fact, its use is now quite high.  Some recently concluded studies have identified trends in this area and the strong indication is that one of the key drivers is the community infection rate, which brings us back to the core requirement to manage this pandemic, namely, compliance with the public health rules.</p><p> Dr. Glynn may wish to comment on the Chairman's broader points, which were about messaging.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.558" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021012200002#Z00200"><p>There is not much more that people individually can do, unfortunately.  To a certain extent, we are asking them to do less, that is, to stay at home.  I absolutely take the point that it would be great if we could say to avoid a particular shop or building.  Unfortunately, however, with the presence of transmission that is in the community at the moment, everyone needs to assume that the virus is all around them, that anyone they come into contact with can infect them and that they themselves are potentially infectious.  As we have said on many occasions, the single biggest issue with trying to control the virus is that many people are infectious before they are symptomatic, so they can pass it on to others before they are symptomatic.  People can access the Covid data hub, which offers significant information on the incidence of the disease at a local level.</p> <p>  On messaging in general, people may be aware that we monitor public behaviours over time through a tracking service.  To focus on the positive, in our most recent survey, which was conducted on Monday last, 88% of respondents said they were staying at home rather than going out.  I acknowledge that the immediate response to that is "Of course that is what they will say because that is what they want you to hear."  In fact, if we look back through the responses from August, September, October and November, the percentages were down in the 60s and 70s. The most recent occasion on which the figure was above the current level was in April, and even then it was at 90%.  The vast majority of people are doing exactly what we want them to do.  The challenge is to sustain that over the weeks ahead.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the original presentations.</p><p>To begin in the political arena, I disagree with a point made by Deputy Gino Kenny, although normally I agree with much of what he has to say.  We need to recognise one matter.  We are not unique in the globe in having a serious problem with this virus.  Throughout the world at present, an emergency battle is taking place.  There has been surge after surge, and some of the countries that at the beginning were the leading lights in this area fell down, as we did too.  It is not fair, therefore, to say the system or the people involved in the system have failed or that we are worse or better than anybody else.  This is a battle that has to continue.</p><p>To be fair to the front-line workers, they have put their lives at risk and continue to do so.  Many of them have lost their lives in the course of their duty to the system.  We need to recognise that and to recognise that when we criticise the system, we may be criticising them indirectly and that is not fair.</p><p>At what stage can we expect the level of vaccination to move from 20%, to 30%, to 40% and so on?  To what extent has it been calculated the degree to which the rate of infection is likely to drop in line with that, proportionately?  It would be helpful if we had some figures on that because at least we would have something to look forward to.</p><p>We have all received emails, including in the past week, from allegedly well-informed <i>personae</i>to the effect that there is no virus at all and that this is a figment of the imagination of some very creative people.</p><p>There are many pages of this.  It is doing terrible damage.  It is doing damage and is disheartening for the people who are providing frontline services.  We must all cop onto ourselves.  In case anybody doubts, there are people who have made huge sacrifices in terms of de-congregation, avoiding meetings in the home and so-----</p></speech>

I was on the road at 7 a.m. this morning, in the frost, and I do not intend to go home without saying my piece.  I will conclude by saying simply that I will avail of the replies by written means if necessary.  I have two other questions.  The first concerns the degree to which the service can avail of extra staff in the event of further emergencies.  Deputy Colm Burke made reference to it already.  Are they there, are they available, have they offered their services and are they awaiting inclusion?</p> <p>  Second and last, in the event of there being a further surge upon a surge, do the services have available to them the necessary beds to meet that surge?  In other words, outside the private hospital system, is it possible to set up field hospitals and so on and are we prepared for that in the event of it being necessary?  I thank the Chairman and apologise for coming in late.  It was not my fault but the fault of technology.  I am sure it was not his fault either but the fact that I sat here for the entire duration does not mean I have nothing to say.</p></speech>

I echo the Deputy's comments that at this stage, while I say there is no room for blame in relation to the vast majority of what happens in this pandemic - it is an extremely infectious disease - as far as anyone who denies its existence or seeks to downplay the impact it has on individuals and families across this country is concerned, there should be no place for them at this stage given the impact it is having on families across the country.</p></speech>

On the piece about extra staff, outside the private hospitals there is no magic bullet in terms of staff available for nursing or other services.  We should of course acknowledge that the Army and the military generally have given us assistance in various areas of this, as have other staff cohorts but for direct service provision there are very few options and we are at the limit of that.  The Deputy was projecting what would happen if there were a surge on top of the surge - our entire hope is that we are levelling off and beginning to see some decrease in total volume.  Dr. Hamilton might comment on the field hospital idea.</p></speech>

The advantage of the private sector is that it comes with staffing so opening a field hospital is not a feasible solution.</p></speech>

I advise members that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has contacted the secretariat in relation to its statutory role to input into legislation with human rights or equality elements and it will be making a written submission on the Bill.</p> <p>  No. 1 is adoption of the draft report on pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Water Environment (Abstractions) Bill 2020.  The amendments agreed at the private meeting on Tuesday, 19 January have been incorporated into the draft report and there are a couple of technical amendments to be made, such as adding links and proofing the terms of reference for changes to Standing Orders.  Subject to those amendments being made by the secretariat, do members agree to adopt the draft report; agree that the report be laid before the Houses, printed and published; agree that the report be launched by way of a press release; and agree that a debate on the report should be held in the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Agreed.  I thank members.</p> <p>  No. 2 is pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the electoral reform Bill 2020.  We are joined remotely by the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, who is accompanied by Department officials from the franchise unit: Mr. Barry Ryan and Ms Petra Woods, principal officers, and Mr. Martin Hehir and Ms Paris Beausang, assistant principal officers.  The opening statement and briefing materials have been circulated to members.</p><p>It is important for members to acknowledge the work that was done by the previous committee on electoral reform and the report it published.  Several of the concerns and recommendations raised have been included in the scheme of the Bill.</p><p> I will ask the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make his opening statement and then members will be invited to address questions.  As usual, we will try to keep our questioning to five minutes.  I will welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and invite him to make his opening statement in a moment, but I have to read a note on privilege first.</p><p> Members attending from their Oireachtas offices are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their participation in this meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse the privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if the statement of a member is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the member will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that members comply with any such direction.</p><p> For witnesses attending remotely there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present would.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p> I call on Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I apologise for the technical hitches, but it is great to be here with the committee, and I thank the committee for inviting me to appear before it to discuss the general scheme of the electoral reform Bill, which was approved by the Government on 15 December 2020.  Today is my first time to appear before this committee, and I am really delighted and honoured to be here with such a positive set of policy proposals.</p> <p>  Regarding electoral reform, the general scheme is ambitious and forward-thinking.  It provides for the establishment of a statutory, independent electoral commission for Ireland; the modernisation of our electoral registration processes; the regulation of online political advertising around electoral events; and, finally, measures which would assist with the holding of an electoral event safely should Covid-19 restrictions be in place.  Some of these reforms have been a long time coming.  For example, an electoral commission has been a fixture in programmes for Government for many years, as alluded to by the Chairman.</p> <p>  We live in an evolving society.  With the advent of new technology, changes in living patterns and changes in how we receive information, there has been a need for some time to regulate new media formats and to ensure that our people have transparency surrounding online political advertising, which may influence how we vote.  We can also harness new technology to bring about a more secure, accurate and user-friendly electoral register.  In addition, it is responsible and prudent to consider how we would run an electoral event with Covid-19 restrictions in place.  We have been working with officials to make the necessary provisions for this, and it is to be hoped this will not be the case for too long.</p> <p>  I wish to bring the committee briefly through each element of the general scheme.  First, the electoral commission we propose to establish will bring about a more cohesive and efficient administration of electoral functions in Ireland.  It will address the challenges we currently face and will be a bulwark which will protect and enhance our electoral system into the future.  It will be independent of the Government and will report directly to the Oireachtas.  The commission will have seven members, a mix of public officials experienced in electoral functions and experts who will be recruited through a Public Appointments Service, PAS, process on the basis of their skills and experience.  The commission will be an organisation of substance, taking on board a broad range of new and existing statutory functions.  These include a new policy research and advisory function to inform and advise both the Government and the Oireachtas on electoral issues.  The commission will have a voter education and awareness function, working to increase participation in our political processes.  It will have a monitoring role in respect of the modernised electoral register.  The commission will have responsibility for the regulation of online political advertising, which I will come back to shortly.  Lastly, the commission will take on several existing statutory electoral functions from other bodies, including the work of the Referendum Commission, the Registrar of Political Parties, the Constituency Commission and the local electoral area boundary committees.  The commission will be established by the end of this year, in line with the programme for Government commitment.</p> <p>  The general scheme lays the foundations for a modernised electoral register.</p><p>This ambitious project will deliver a single, continually updated or rolling electoral register; the simplification of forms and processes, including the gradual roll-out of optional online registration; a central national electoral register database; the use of personal public service numbers, PPSNs, as part of a data verification process; provision for anonymous registration for persons whose safety may be at risk if their name and address were to be published; and the preregistration for 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds.  Overall, it will make the process of registering to vote more accessible and streamlined.  The register will continue to be administered by local registration authorities.  The commission will oversee its management and operation.</p><p> Regarding the regulation of online political advertising, in recent years we have been hearing more about the spread of disinformation in the run-up to electoral events.  We have heard concerns raised and debated, both nationally and internationally, on its prevalence online as well as its potential to damage trust in our electoral processes and undermine our democratic institutions.  To ensure our elections remain free from hidden influence, I am legislating for the compulsory labelling of online political advertisements during electoral periods.  This will ensure transparency during the run-up to electoral events.  This labelling will provide a link to certain information for the electorate in a transparent and conspicuous manner on who is behind the advertisement and why they are being targeted.  The general scheme sets out that such information must be displayed in a transparency notice clearly linked to the advertisement.  This will mean the rules which currently apply to the more traditional forms of advertising will be extended into the online advertising space.</p><p> The general scheme will include measures to assist with the holding of electoral events where Covid-19 restrictions are in place.  These include conducting a poll over two days to facilitate social distancing as well as providing a postal vote for those on the special voters list should nursing homes and similar institutions be inaccessible.</p><p> The principal reform measures set out in this general scheme are founded on political consensus and public support which have been built up over several years through reports and public consultations.  The 2016 report of the Oireachtas joint committee on the establishment of an independent electoral commission has been of particular benefit in framing the provisions.  The establishment of the electoral commission and the modernisation of the electoral register will see many of the recommendations set out in the 2016 report come into effect.</p><p> Many of these reforms are long-promised.  We have an opportunity to address long-standing electoral issues and put our system on a stronger and more robust footing.  The progression of this legislation is timely.  The next scheduled electoral events to take place throughout the country will be in 2024.  We have a great opportunity to have each of these electoral reforms in place and firmly bedded down over the intervening period.</p><p> I look forward to working with the committee on this process.  I thank the officials for the amazing work they have done to date.  I also thank previous committees for the work they have done on this transformative piece of electoral reform legislation.  I look forward to a constructive discussion today.</p></speech>

He has outlined some of the important issues in the Bill.  They are really sensible, particularly the pre-registration of 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds.  We often get somebody who has just turned 18 years of age several days before an election asking if they can register.  Unfortunately, we have to tell them that they had to register 14 days before and it is a huge disappointment for them.</p> <p>  Will members identify themselves clearly so the Debates Office can pick up on who is contributing?  I call Deputy McAuliffe.</p></speech>

In many ways, it is an exciting day.  Many people over many decades have spoken about the delivery of an electoral reform Bill and the establishment of an electoral commission.</p><p>As the Chair said, it is worth noting the work done by the Department under the previous Government.  It is obvious we are ready to go with this measure as a result of that work.  However, I still believe, in terms of committing to it and establishing it, that it often could be described as not being a priority but as it underlies the very foundations of democracy and how we run the country, I believe it is very important.  </p><p> I want to comment on some of the changes such as the pre-registration, giving people who may live in Dublin but who are from a rural area an ease of access to change their address, the removal of those who are deceased from the register and the registration process itself.  All of those are incredibly positive moves and in many ways will drag our electoral laws out of the last century but there is a big job of work still to be done.</p><p> I have a number of questions for the Minister of State.  I will ask some of them in my allotted time, Senator Fitzpatrick will then contribute and then I will come back again.  The Minister of State might answer the questions where he can.  The key issue concerns head 66.  It would appear that under head 66(2), the total number of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, subject to Article 16.2.2&deg; of the Constitution, is identified as being between 166 and 172.  That would be a substantial increase from the current number.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the rationale for that.  Has it to do with population growth?  Is there any immediate expected change?</p></speech>

Certainly, it is in terms of the expected population growth.  I think it is the number of Deputies per head of population.  Perhaps Mr. Ryan might come in on that issue as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.592" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012200002#G00300"><p>To clarify regarding this particular question, on the face of it, yes, it looks like there is an increase.  At the moment there are 160 elected Members in the D&aacute;il and that change from 166 to 172 has already been legislated for.  It was legislated for when the D&aacute;il constituencies were reviewed the last time in 2017.  The increase from 166 to 172 is already on the Statute Book.  The general scheme is just repeating what has already been legislated for.  The Minister of State is correct.  The change was made back in 2017 because at 160 we are at the limit of what the Constitution provides in terms of the one representative per 20,000 or 30,000 and we are right up against the 30,000 limit.  Consequently, when the constituency revisions were being enacted in 2017, this change was made to the terms and conditions of the Constituency Commission and they are simply being replicated in this general scheme.</p></speech>

There is still a lot of detail yet to be established, probably by ministerial order, about how the interaction will work.  It appears that local authorities will continue to maintain a register and then provide an update directly to the commission.  As a lot of people would have imagined that the commission would have been the central resource of the register, I ask the Minister of State to please clarify how that will work.</p></speech>

I ask Ms Woods to come in on that issue specifically as it is her area of expertise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.595" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Petra Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012200002#G00600"><p>It is a recognition of the role of local authorities and the confidence that people have in how they manage the register.  In part, that says that they should still continue to hold that role and that they would manage those registers in the context of this shared national database, which would make the identification of duplicates and people moving between local authorities so much easier.  The other reason is a practical one.  There is a lot of local knowledge in local authorities in terms of addresses and changes in their local areas that will need to be reflected in the register.  Furthermore, in times where there are peaks of engagement by the public, it would not be reasonable for the commission to be able to draw in staff, in the way that local authorities can draw staff from other parts of their authorities, to assist with that work.</p><p>The decision was made to leave that role with local authorities and we will make it easier for them.  They will be required to report annually on the activities they have undertaken in managing their registers.  The commission, in turn, will issue a report that will look at the national picture overall of the register on the basis of those reports.  The designated authority to manage the central database is also required under these heads to report to the commission on the functioning of the database and any matters that might arise.  In addition, the commission can conduct research of its own to supplement that information in producing its own report.</p></speech>

I thank them for their responses.  I can see hands up on the screen but I will follow the usual rota we have in committees.  Is it Deputy Gould or Deputy &Oacute; Broin that is going next?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.601" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012200002#H00600"><p>It is me.  I thank the Minister of State and the departmental staff and echo the comments of colleagues on the phenomenal volume of work that has gone into producing the heads.  It is very substantial legislation and it is great to see it finally coming forward.  Like others, our party is very supportive of the key provisions of the Bill.  I would say this is one of the least contentious pieces of legislation we will deal with in the coming period.</p> <p>  I have a series of questions I will run through and if we do not have enough allocated time for replies, the witnesses might come back at a later stage in the meeting or in writing.  One of the functions that the commission does not have is one requested by the previous Oireachtas housing committee, separate to the policy function, of having an electoral and referendum research budget and function.  This is something Governments previously funded through groups of academics from a number of universities and it seems logical that this is something that could be located in the commission and it could work with academic institutions to conduct not only significant studies, such as exit polls and other work into referendums and elections, but also independent studies into non-voting and the reasons people do not vote.  If there is not a dedicated budget and function, this may not happen.  Will the witnesses respond to that omission?</p> <p>  The regulation of online advertising seems to be the weakest section of the Bill.  I have no objection to the proposed provisions but we have very strict spending limits for elections, which is one of the very progressive parts of our system compared with others.  There is consideration of similar spending limits for similar periods with online advertisements and the application of other kinds of restrictions.  I cannot buy a variety of terrestrial or broadcasting advertisements during election campaigns, for example, so why is such a low bar approach being taken with online advertisements, given their significance?</p> <p>  With the register, personal public service, PPS, numbers are crucial but there may be GDPR or privacy concerns.  Will the witnesses speak to those?  Is it the intention to match a PPS number with a unique voter identification number on the register?  I presume if we have rolling registration, it will remove the need for Garda forms to be signed.  Will the witnesses confirm that?</p> <p>  It is disappointing to see there is not an expanded provision for postal and proxy voting, as is the norm in many European jurisdictions.  Why is this the case?  There may be people travelling, on holidays or students who may not be able to attend a vote.  This is something that should certainly be explored.  A provision for access to the electronic version of the register for political parties does not seem to be in the Bill.  We currently get direct access to it.  If it is not in the Bill, it will be of particular disadvantage to smaller parties or those which only have electoral representation in certain areas.</p><p>I ask for more information about rolling registration, the marked register that will still be available, because obviously that is very valuable to us in the political process.  I ask for more information on the oversight role of the commission with respect to the register.</p></speech>

I will take the research element and defer to Mr. Ryan and Ms Woods on the register.  It is anticipated that the commission will have a very strong research, advisory and voter education function.  We will see that evolve over time.  We all know we need to engage with hard to reach communities in electoral processes for referendums.  The research element of that will be vital.  I take on board the Deputy's point on the additional resources for the research element.  We envisage a very strong role for advocacy and for voter education.  It is vital to engage young people and minorities to get them to take part in the electoral process, become activated and stand for election.  All this is vital in our electoral system.  We envisage the commission evolving to having a strong role in this over time.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Ryan and Ms Woods to deal with the Deputy's other questions.</p></speech>

I do not think that precludes it from engaging with academics and others to assist it with that research function.  The commission will have a budget specifically for that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the online advertising piece in the general scheme.  The provisions we have included in the general scheme are grounded in the outcome of the work of the interdepartmental group on electoral processes and disinformation.  That group looked at our election processes and held an open policy forum and a public consultation on the issue.  A balance needs to be struck between the regulation to be introduced in this area and the freedom of expression arguments that are often put forward.  The group recommended the introduction of measures which would, in many ways, replicate what we have in the offline space in terms of transparency.  Any advertisements that are placed online should have that transparency during electoral periods.  That was the thinking behind the measures included in the general scheme.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if consideration was given to expanding the postal voting regime.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to review this and specifically to ask the electoral commission to consider the issue of postal voting with a view to expanding its use.  As the Deputy knows, postal voting is fairly restricted in Ireland under our electoral codes.  While it is not in this general scheme, it would be the intention that once the commission is established, it could research the matter and make recommendations on expanding the use of postal votes.</p></speech>

This is very exciting, progressive and timely legislation, particularly when considering holding elections during Covid-type events.  I will focus on section 3 on the franchise and register of electors.</p><p>Some of the questions have already been posed but I would like to tease them out a bit.  As the Chairman said at the outset, it is very progressive that we are looking at the pre-enrolment of 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds.</p><p> The section on the anonymous registration of victims of domestic abuse is an important part of the legislation, especially in light of what has been reported from the courts in recent days.  The online element and the simplicity of the forms is also important.</p><p> I wish to focus on data protection matters and how we overcome them.  In 2008 the then Data Protection Commissioner told the then Oireachtas committee that to overcome legal obstacles to using PPS numbers and other data held by State agencies to identify electors, the Oireachtas could either seek voluntary consent from electors to use their PPS numbers or other data from State agencies for the purposes of compiling an electoral register or it could legislate to overrule the right to privacy in the interests of the common good, that is, the interests of enhancing the integrity of the electors.  Is that still the position of the Data Protection Commission, in light of the legislation that came into force in 2018?</p><p> How is it proposed that we marry the existing register with the requirement for PPS numbers, confirmation of address and Eircode details, as is contained in this legislation?  To do this correctly, would we essentially have to start from scratch?  Does the commission have the ability to link in with Revenue and the Department of Social Protection to confirm the 80% of electors who are currently on the register?  Will there be a grace period for those who are not on the register?  How exactly is it intended to marry the existing system with what is required under the new legislation?</p></speech>

The general scheme does provide for data sharing for the purposes of obtaining and maintaining the electoral register.  That would include sharing data between local authorities and enabling data to be matched against other public sector data, for example, the public services identity data held by the Department of Social Protection.  I might ask Ms Woods to respond to the other points the Senator raised, if that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.609" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Petra Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012200002#K00300"><p>Those are good questions.  We looked back at the evidence given by the Data Protection Commissioner in 2008.  A key part of that is to look at what the options are and what problem one is trying to solve.  We want to make sure that everybody is on the register who should be on it and that he or she is only on it once.  The use of a unique identifier has long been a discussion point on the register.  Currently, we do not have one, partly because we have 31 separate registers managed by each local authority.  The provisions set out in the general scheme are designed to work with that.</p> <p>  This speaks also to a previous question.  The PPSN will not be used in polling stations.  It will not appear on the register.  It will not be the electoral identity of an individual but it will be used to check and match the data that have been provided on a form by an individual to ascertain that all the pieces of information such as name, date of birth and PPSN are coherent, that they relate to the same individual and that the data are also matched to existing data held by another public sector body.  In this case, we are looking specifically at the Department of Social Protection.  That information will be shared on a yes-no basis, as in, there will be confirmation of that information and then we can carry on and register the person or make the changes to his or her record.  Where no match is possible, the registration authority will then go back to the individual concerned and ask him or her to bring a form of ID or some sort of documentation back to the registration authority or get a form signed at the local Garda station, much like the supplement provisions now.</p><p>That would only be the case if a match was not possible on the information provided.</p><p> On how we get from the existing register to a modernised register, we are not proposing to start from scratch.  It is a strategy but not necessarily the one we believe would be the most effective here.  We have a register that works and has served the country very well.  We all acknowledge that it does need work but we are not suggesting that we risk a situation where large numbers of people would be removed from the register because they do not meet a certain deadline or so on.  We propose a two-step process, including a major awareness campaign.  Once we have made it easier for people to update their details, which we hope to do in the course of this year, we will engage in a large-scale public awareness campaign to really encourage people to engage with us to help us to update their records on the register.  Giving people the opportunity to update their own information is one of the key provisions.  Minding the accuracy of their own data is also important under data protection legislation.  Where we cannot identify a person or where we do not have records that are addressed by individuals we will then seek to identify where people may have passed away.  We will do this through other data we can access safely, such as a date of death for example, that is linked to a person.  To be clear, we are not talking about removing people from the register without a significant number of attempts.  The general scheme of the Bill provides for three documented attempts with an individual before he or she is removed.  The person will have ample opportunity and it will be covered by a large-scale public awareness campaign to make sure people are aware of what is happening.  I hope this helps the committee and I am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

This is a very positive Bill and proposal.  We are all aware that elections and referendums are an important feature of the democratic process.  It is exciting and important.  The previous committee did a lot of work on this and we made several recommendations, one of which was around education, the promotion of elections, and research.  This is important but with that must come funding and it must be ring-fenced.  More important, one of the points we made as a committee was that any research would be published.  I believe it is important that there is a very open and transparent process around any research and that it is public knowledge.  I would like to hear from the Minister of State about the proposals in that regard.</p> <p>  I welcome the proposal for pre-registration for 16 to 18-year-olds.  I would like people being able to vote from the age of 16, certainly as a start at local elections.  Clearly, that is not going to happen despite a lot of talk by many of the main political parties.  It has not been mentioned.  Perhaps the Minister of State will outline for the committee if there is a view or a feeling within the Government that this might be reviewed within the life of the Government.</p> <p>  The pre-registration is very important and positive.  To suggest that the electoral registers are in any way in good shape across the 31 local authorities would be crazy.  They are a mess.  People are on registers who have been dead for ten years.  This is my experience of some registers, having been involved in elections for a long time.  I thought the commission would have a more centralised system but this is clearly not an option.</p> <p>  I welcome the idea that we could tap into local knowledge, as one of the Minister of State's officials has already said.  I agree with that but we would, therefore, need to resource the local authorities.  I know from my local authority that for many years it has not gone out to do field work.  By field work I refer to door-to-door knocking, which would have traditionally been done, to check the registers and to see and encourage people.</p><p>I would like to hear more about the resources that will be given to local authorities.  I heard this morning from one of the Minister of State's officials that each local authority will be asked to do an annual report on how it is engaging and working on its registers.  I welcome that.  Overall, it is a positive proposal and I fully support it.  </p><p> The only question I want to ask is in respect of the marked registers.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin pointed out earlier that these are very important for those studying elections and for identifying groups or areas where people are engaging.  It is important information which is only held for so many months after an election.  What plans does the electoral reform Bill include for the management of those important registers?  Are there any plans to change it?  I thank the Minister of State and his officials for attending the committee today.</p></speech>

It will have to produce a three-year strategy.  It is absolutely vital to have the data and quantitative and qualitative research element there.  It is a well-made point.</p> <p>  On the issue of local elections and pre-registration for those aged 16 and 17, it is my understanding that voting for 16-year-olds could be introduced without legislation by the Minister.  I may be corrected on that.  I certainly agree with the Senator.  I would love to see us move to a situation where, at least for local elections, the voting age could be reduced to 16.  It would spark a huge engagement in our electoral system.  Young people want to have their say.  We have seen that with the climate strikes.  It would be most welcome it that could be pursued.</p> <p>  I agree with the Senator on his point about fieldwork.  Calling to houses is a vital component of that.  On the condition of the register, it is important to say that local government and authorities have performed invaluable work over the years in respect of the electoral register.  We do appreciate that and we want to continue that role for them within this particular Bill.  Perhaps Ms Woods and Mr. Ryan want to come in on specific points raised by the Senator.  I thank him for his positive comments.</p></speech>

It would have its own Vote of expenditure.  That would certainly help in framing a budget for the research and education piece.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned his view on the issue of votes for 16-year-olds.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government that the Scottish experience will be examined in respect of reducing the voting age.  That could be another valuable piece of work that the commission may be able to undertake - conducting research to look at that experience and make recommendations.  Ms Woods can talk about pre-registration and the marked registers.</p></speech>

Some make more use of fieldworkers than others.  There are obviously difficulties now with fieldworkers in cities.  Many people are living in apartments and are not at home all day.  I understand that in other areas there are issues with gates, and so on.  Fieldwork is still an important part of managing and updating the register, and will continue to be so.  The heads of this legislation provide that we will expand and encourage local authorities to look at other ways of reaching out to people and encouraging them to engage with the registration process.</p><p>The schools programme is for 16 and 17-year-olds but they may also want to do registration drives at their local authority offices or in supermarkets on particular days, or to encourage people more generally.</p><p> We are aware that local authorities already do much good work for resourcing.  There is provision in these heads for a funding model that will look at the work on the central database and how that service is paid for and resourced.</p><p> No change is being made to the marked registers.  We have not strayed beyond making the registration process more accessible.</p></speech>

It is subject to available financial resources and no longer requires the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is good that it has independence but who will ultimately decide the commission's financial resources?  Is that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage?</p> <p>  Head No. 26 is about the strategy statement.  In sub-head 5(a), it seems that the words "shall" and "may" are used together, which I find slightly confusing.  I suggest that we remove the word "may" in sub-head 5(a).</p> <p>  Head No. 65 is about constituency reviews after publication of the preliminary CSO data.  A ministerial order is no longer required to look at the representation versus population.  That report will be presented within three months, which is positive.  Does it trigger that same action for local electoral areas and the make-up of local municipal districts or the numbers that would be represented at local level?</p></speech>

A chief executive is responsible for implementing the policies and decisions of the commission.  I ask Mr. Ryan to address that, the other amendment that the Chairman proposes and the electoral areas.</p></speech>

It would compete for resources in the budget in the normal way with other organisations.  To answer the question directly, it is not funded from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It will have a stand-alone Vote.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair for the technical suggestion about the "shalls" and the "mays".  We will take that on board when drafting the Bill.</p> <p>  On constituency reviews, we needed to come up with a slightly different mechanism to trigger the constituency review.  The existing legislation requires that the Minister would establish the constituency commission following the publication of preliminary census results by the CSO.  We have a commission continuously in place now so there is no need for that ministerial order.  The general scheme provides that the publication of those preliminary results triggers the constituency review work of the electoral commission.  The same would be envisaged for LEAs.</p><p>Currently, LEAs tend to follow on from constituency reviews based on the census results.  The intention is that an LEA review would follow on from a review of D&aacute;il and European constituency boundaries.</p></speech>

It will not come down purely to the numbers.  It will still take that into account.</p></speech>

Where that will fall to be decided will be in the terms of reference that will be given to the electoral commission in reviewing LEA boundaries.  Those terms of reference will come before the relevant Oireachtas committee for discussion and input.  The intention is that, ultimately, they will be approved by a resolution of both Houses.  There is an opportunity in that respect for the Oireachtas to feed into the terms of reference and the issues the commission should take account of when it is reviewing LEA boundaries.</p></speech>

I had questions on this in reference to appointments to the commission and the suggestion that at least one member of the commission, and perhaps more than one, should have expertise in online information - digital information - from that web of complex layers that lie within online political advertising.  What are Mr. Ryan's views on that?  Is that too prescriptive?  Does he believe it would be good to have somebody with that level of expertise or would that be a role for a consultant?</p></speech>

We have tried to be as specific as possible in terms of what we are calling the selected members of the commission.  Initially, the four selected members would have specific skills and experience.  I refer to a former elected Member of the Oireachtas or a local authority, somebody with experience in international electoral matters, somebody with experience of Irish electoral matters and then, in terms of general public administration, somebody with financial experience and so on.  Within all of that it may be that we will be able to couple with that experience also or else, as the Chairman said, it will be still open to the commission to engage that expertise if it needs to do so.</p></speech>

This is good legislation.  A lot of work has gone into it.  There has been very good consultation on it.  Overall, I am very welcoming of it as it is very important.</p> <p>  I will address three areas.  Voter participation, education and outreach are very important and form an essential part of democracy.  In other countries where we see groups of people who tended not to get involved in the democratic process or vote in the same numbers being involved in outreach, being educated and participating more in the process, it changes the entire participation of more marginalised groups in society, in decision making and in politics and has a transformative effect.  Everyone might not be interested in the nuts and bolts of this but it is very important.  There are very good practices in New Zealand where people who have a visual impairment or are hard of hearing can participate in elections.  For example, people with a visual impairment can vote over the telephone using a dictation service.  There has been very good outreach to younger people and youth advocates.  There has been outreach to homeless people also.  Will the commission be asked to examine the very good practices in New Zealand?  One of the methods New Zealand used, as did other countries, to drive up participation was to have early voting available.  Will the commission be asked to look at that?  That is my first question.</p> <p>  I welcome what the Minister of State said about the voting age of 16 for local elections.</p><p>What is he going to do to try to advance that?  </p><p> While it is not in the legislation, the programme of Government refers to the regulation of election posters.  What does the Minister of State intend to do about that and when might we see some proposals?  What are his thoughts?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.631" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012200002#P00200"><p>The voter participation element is absolutely critical.  The commission will have the ability to look at other jurisdictions that are good examples, such as New Zealand.  That will certainly be in its remit and it is a vital part of it.  This is about getting young people, other hard to reach groups and minorities, including the Traveller community, and everyone else involved in our electoral processes.  Our team has met a voter disability alliance around participation in electoral events, such as access to polling stations, information on candidates and referendums.  We are continuing that work with these groups, with which we have had really good engagement.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to make 16 years the voting age for local elections, and we will task the commission to do that.  I very much take the Deputy's point.  I would love to see that commitment realised for the 2024 local and European elections.</p> <p>  The regulation of election posters is a pet subject of mine.  I ran a successful general election campaign without the use of a single poster.  I would love to see the money that candidates and parties now use for posters being put into much more informative resources, online and otherwise, to inform the electorate about their policies and programmes for elections.  That would be a far better spend of public money and candidates' money.  I would love to see either a significant reduction in posters, perhaps the use of designated sites in urban areas, or a complete ban on posters.  I do not think they have any place in the electoral system and many people have turned away from them.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy on that.  It is an issue the commission can be tasked with considering.</p></speech>

I will focus, therefore, on online political advertising during the election.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, this is probably the weakest element of the Bill.  Does this have to be a paid advertisement that is explicitly marked or, where third parties get involved, could they be required to explicitly state what they are doing for the duration of the election?  I have in mind more nefarious third-party actors that might create and spread disinformation, memes and so on.  We have an opportunity to learn some lessons from what has happened in other countries and put in place a robust system of challenging technology companies and the influence they have on elections.  In India recently, the main nationalist party did very well in what was called the first WhatsApp election.  I am concerned about private messaging groups where actors spread misinformation and engage in fearmongering.  We need to consider regulating them.  Is there scope for the electoral commission to examine that issue?  If not, could we, on Committee Stage, consider not only official paid political advertising but the use of information to influence an election?</p> <p>  I refer to expanding votes for immigrants.</p><p>At the moment, we have a situation where non-citizens can only vote in local elections but people have to be citizens to vote in D&aacute;il elections or referendums.  This has particularly come to the fore since the Brexit referendum, when a lot of people living in Ireland for a long time realised they could not vote in referendums.  Are there any proposals on the table or any thinking around the electoral commission taking a look at referendums and expanding votes beyond citizens to people who live here for a certain amount of time?  I know many European citizens do not get citizenship because they consider it to be prohibitively expensive.  We have one of the highest citizenship fees in the world.  Those are the two issues I would like to ask about.</p></speech>

As far as I am aware, the area around online advertising is really around transparency in regard to who is paying for the advertisement.  In a sense, we are probably the first jurisdiction to legislate for this, which is important.  Mr. Ryan alluded to the issue around freedom of expression and the content of such advertisements, but what this is really about is the buyer of the advertisement and ensuring the voter has an awareness and understanding of who is paying for the advertisement.  It is around that transparency element.  I will ask Mr. Ryan to come back in on those other issues the Senator raised in regard to non-citizens and referendums.  I thank her for the questions.</p></speech>

To reiterate, the Minister of State is correct in that the extent of the proposals in the general scheme are around online political advertising.  It is very much around the transparency piece and it is certainly not in the space of monitoring content, which is a whole different ball game, although it is absolutely for the committee to discuss and consider it.  In terms of the recommendations we were legislating for, the recommendation from the interdepartmental group was very much around transparency during electoral periods.  That is the way the provisions have been framed.</p> <p>  In terms of voting rights, as the Senator is aware, there are different categories of voter rights.  Irish citizens who are residents can vote in all our elections and referendums.  British citizens, with the reciprocal arrangements we have with the UK, can vote in D&aacute;il elections and local elections, although, with the UK no longer being a member of the European Union, they are no longer entitled to vote in European Union elections, which is just for Irish citizens and citizens of the European Union.  Citizens from outside the European Union have the right to vote in local elections.</p> <p>  As the Senator mentioned, there are constitutional issues in regard to referendums and expanding some of those rights.  Certainly, in the context of the research and the advisory piece, that is the sort of issue the commission could look at and make a recommendation to the Minister and the Government on if it felt there was merit in such proposals.  While I do not think there are any current proposals to look at that, it is certainly among the issues an electoral commission could consider.</p></speech>

This is very important, as other speakers have said.  Democracy is fragile and without a fully functioning electoral process, it is impossible to have fair and free elections, which are essential.  The idea of the independent electoral commission is very welcome and long overdue.</p><p>I am interested to know whether there is any estimate of what the required budget will be for an independent electoral commission.</p><p> I want to talk a bit about, and understand better, the proposals on the register of electors.  It is all contained in section 13.  I am not convinced that commencing from a position of assuming our registers of electors are in a fit for purpose condition is a safe point of departure for us.  We have a huge opportunity here and we need to be careful to maximise the opportunity to ensure the integrity of our elections and the effectiveness of our process.  This can only be achieved if we are working from a database that has integrity.</p><p> I have some concerns.  From speaking to colleagues throughout the country, I know that, in Cork after the previous local elections, councillors who were elected said there were as many dead people on the register as there were people who were alive.  In the constituency of Dublin Central in some very modest properties there are the equivalent of communes registered.  I do not really accept we should start with thinking the register of electors is in a fit for purpose condition.  Even if we did, from a data management perspective I do not understand the strategy of us having the local authorities compile databases while at the same time we are creating a centralised database.  I want to understand how this will work because as a basic principle to guarantee the integrity of the database there should be only one database.  I want to understand how this will work.</p><p> I also do not understand why, if we are moving to a centralised online rolling database, there would be localised databases.  It just does not make any sense.  If it is a centralised online database, it is available remotely from any place but it should be centralised to ensure its integrity. I want to understand this.  It is important that we understand it before we pass the legislation.  The way the legislation is written at present to me clearly speaks about these two different functions, with the local authorities continuing to have a function.  I must commend the staff in Dublin City Council, with whom I have engaged many times on the electoral register for the constituency of Dublin Central.  To be fair to them, it was not possible to clean it up.  If we are going to invest in all of this and take this important move towards strengthening our democracy, we need to ensure we are not undermining it by starting with a messy database.</p><p> With regard to the postal vote and the marked register, again if we get the database correct and it is online, then the marked register, which is only available in PDF form, should be something that is available afterwards in a dynamic digital format as opposed to a PDF.  We need to reflect the fact the postal vote is great for people in a semi-permanent situation, but people who have to travel for business at short notice cannot qualify for a postal vote.  These are people who pay their taxes and contribute to their communities and who are entitled to have a say.  Sometimes, and very often, they cannot vote because they do not qualify for a postal vote.  We should address this while we have the opportunity.</p><p> Funding political advertising and political messaging is very important.  It is important that we capture where the funding is coming from outside of the State.  I thank the Minister and the officials.</p></speech>

These are start-up costs, salaries and ongoing costs.  There have been subsequent costs of approximately &euro;1.5 million to &euro;1.7 million per annum.  It is quite modest.  Additional costs could be anticipated as the commission would ramp up its activities over the years and be in the mix for annual budgets and have to make its case, just like other Votes.</p><p>For what we are gaining from this, it is a modest outlay for the Exchequer.</p></speech>

We see and hear about these issues every time there is an electoral event.  We are aware a significant body of work has to be done.</p> <p>  The proposal to start from a clean slate - essentially remove everyone from the register and require re-enrolment - is a strategy tried in other countries.  It works over time but there is always a risk that one will lose people and will not get them back.  It can affect young people and, in particular, older people who may not re-register because they have always been registered.  It is harder to reach some of those people.  There is a recognition that we need to work at it.</p> <p>  We are not moving overnight to anything new.  One key point which came through from various consultations is that people are not in favour of a big-bang approach relating to the electoral register.  We need to have a functioning system available at all times in the event that an electoral event is called.  While none are scheduled, it is important that the system stands ready.</p> <p>  The database issue feeds into the idea of working on the register over time.  We are moving towards one single database.  Head 90, a new section 13B, sets out that there will be a single national database.  Within that, local authorities will manage the registers for their areas.  There will not be a series of databases.  There will be one database and local authorities will manage their registers within that.</p> <p>  We currently have 31 registers.  We have to work towards the process of integrating those into one single database.  There is a process and much data cleaning required to make each individual local authority ready.  The database itself is not set up and ready to be scaled nationally.  That is work that will be undertaken and is under consideration already.  The key point is that we are aware that a significant amount of data cleaning is needed as we move from a series of databases held individually by local authorities to a national database.</p> <p>  We know there are people on the register in two counties.  For example, a person may have gone to university and forgotten.  The system relies on people providing information from their previous addresses or previous registrations to enable local authorities to get in touch with other local authorities to remove them from one register and add them to another.  Streamlining the process by using this centralised database will help clean up such duplication.</p></speech>

Younger people, marginalised groups, those in rented accommodation, minorities and those from disadvantaged areas are most affected by the weaknesses and gaps in voter registration.  A question raised with me by many people is that if the Department of Social Protection can take a son or a daughter off the children's allowance benefit as soon as they turn 18, why can they not be added to the electoral register then.  When Ms Woods referred to matching data, would that be included in that?  The preregistration of 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds is a good idea.  Will this be done by matching data from schools?</p><p>I support the 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds being allowed to vote.  It is something we need to look at and do more on.</p><p> In the previous general election, for example, in my constituency, Cork North-Central, the proportion of people who voted in different polling stations varied from 30.1% to 69.1%.  What we know from these figures is that people in more affluent areas vote and fewer people in more disadvantaged and marginalised areas vote.  These statistics are probably borne out right across the country.  We need to do more to make sure that people are registered and that people can vote, and that also ties in to voter education.</p><p> In Cork, in Sinn F&eacute;in, we produce a mock ballot paper so that people can understand what it looks like because we find that a lot of people have not voted or very rarely vote.  We are trying to help them.  It is much more difficult for people when there are multiple votes - a referendum, a local election, a general election and European election.  It can be very confusing for people who are not used to voting or who might have issues with literacy.  That needs to be dealt with reasonably here.</p><p> Last year, before the general election, we held a number of events where we would register people.  Cork City Council did it as well in the libraries.  We found it a great success and so did Cork City Council.  We need to do more of that - going out to supermarkets and areas where people are to meet them.</p><p> On the postal vote, which was touched on already, people book their holidays in advance and they feel very upset that when an election is called at short notice, they are not able to vote.  It is also for people who are working either up the country or in different areas of the State, who are working abroad, or for students.  More work needs to be done on the postal vote.</p><p> Overall, I welcome this, but more can be done.  I hope I can get some feedback on my questions.</p></speech>

I might let Ms Woods take the issues of the voter registration.  I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy on voting in disadvantaged areas.  There is a significant job of work to be done, not only by the commission but other actors, in terms of community development projects in public participation networks, PPNs, or local community development committees, LCDCs, at local authority level, and in the schools.  There was some fantastic work done - I am not sure if it is still being done - by the Vincentian Partnership in terms of immigrants and voter education.  We have a significant job of collective work to do.  We as political representatives also have that responsibility to do that.</p> <p>  Deputy Gould makes a good point about registration events in supermarkets.  It is fantastic to bring those type of activities out to the public where they can interface with local authorities or us, as political representatives.  We have a significant collective role as politicians to do that as well.  I would hope that the commission will lead on the research elements of the voter participation but, as I said, there is a collective role right across society to engage those hard-to-reach communities in the electoral processes.</p> <p>  I might ask Ms Woods to come in on those other issues that the Deputy raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.644" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Petra Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012200002#T00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for those questions and comments.  One of the key things we are doing in terms of promoting registration is making it easier for people to register.  At present, changing address or details requires different forms at different times of year, and often a trip to a Garda station, and for people who are renting who move address more regularly, that is a significant burden in terms of the administration.  We are simplifying that process and it will be a lot easier and a lot less onerous to do, and it will be the same all year round.</p> <p>  In terms of the data matching, we have tried to start with quite a limited approach.  We have a significant amount of work to do.  We are trying to ensure that we have identity data correct, that we have name, address, PPSN and dates of birth that match, so that we can identify each individual.</p> <p>  We have not made any steps towards getting information about child benefit or data from schools.  Our public consultation showed that people were happy with data sharing but wanted some sort of limitations on it.</p><p>That is not to say that those innovations cannot be undertaken in the future or be the subject of further work.  To be clear, there is no provision to do that at present.  The schools programme is very much aimed at getting engagement from young people aged 16 and 17 in school before they leave.  In general, people talk a lot about students falling off the register.  In reality, however, students are usually quite well served by students' unions and so on.  We have many people who do not go on to university who may not then fall into an area where people are actively engaging with them.  That is one way of doing it.  A key function here is to try to make it easier for people to register.</p></speech>

I cannot see the screen clearly.  Who is due to speak next?  Is Senator Seery Kearney or Deputy Higgins?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.653" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1566" speakername="Emer Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021012200002#U00900"><p>I will go next, if that is okay.  I thank everybody who worked on this legislation.  It is an exciting piece of reforming legislation which has the potential to transform electoral registration and empower more people to become active participants in democracy.  People in Dublin had the opportunity to trial <i>voter.ie</i>and it has been a huge success and has proven to be user-friendly.  Students' unions right have called for it to be rolled out nationwide.  I am sure they will be pleased with much of what is contained in the Bill.</p><p>I will pick up on a point made by Ms Woods when she stated that there will be no change to the marked register.  One thing I noticed in my constituency's marked register this time around, post <i>voter.ie</i>, is that it seems to follow a different format.  It used to be laid out with house numbers within estates and now it is done alphabetically - by surname within estates, which is not quite as user-friendly for politicians who want to use it to develop canvass plans.  Perhaps, that is something at which Ms Woods might look.</p><p>I agree with much of what Senator Fitzpatrick said on the data needing to be better managed and also in the context of the need for extra flexibility in respect of people who, for example, are renting and who, in terms of their PPSNs, are registered at their parents' homes.</p><p>As Fine Gael spokesperson on social media, I have a keen interest in the ambition, catered for in the Bill, to regulate online political advertising during election periods.  I agree with much of what Senator Moynihan said on this issue.  A great deal of work is going on at EU level at present.  Just before Christmas, the European Democracy Action Plan: Making EU Democracies Stronger was published.  The aim behind the plan is to ensure that digital platforms do not destabilise democracies.  I doubt there is a politician at this committee who does not have an online presence and who does not use that to get his or her message out to the electorate and build his or her brand nationally.  I know there certainly is not an Irish political party that does not have such a presence.  Right now, a pretty impressive political campaign is happening online, which has racked up costs of more than &euro;7,000 on Facebook alone, and that is outside of election period.  The question is: why do politicians invest in social media strategies?  It is because an online presence gives us a national audience and the ability to target our communications at our electorate and amplify and explain our views and ambitions.  That is all to be welcomed.  Nowadays, social media is an important channel of communication.  It helps politicians and campaigners reach out to people and get them involved in politics.  We saw this in online initiatives such as #HomeToVote, which amplified movements such as the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment of the Constitution and the marriage equality referendum.  This is one of the huge benefits social media offers when it comes to democracy.  It also poses a great threat to democracy, however.  It allows for easy viral spreading of disinformation, the generation of patterns of online hate messages and for bots that are created solely for political gain.</p><p>The briefing paper on this Bill clearly cites regulating political advertising as a way of reducing the advantage access of money brings to political competition.  The Minister of State described it as bringing political advertising rules to the online sphere.  A big difference between traditional and online advertising, however, is what behind-the-scenes armour one can get if money can buy it.  I am talking about apps and bots in particular.  Using a bot to create multiple online presences to help a person with a political goal is, in my view, the worst sort of political campaigning anybody could engage in.  It is deceitful, disingenuous and threatens our democracy by spreading falsehoods.</p><p>There is a clear need to regulate fake and automated accounts in the context of political advertising.  Politicians and political parties that put money behind social media posts that deliberately attempt to mislead people, such as on the topic of a D&aacute;il vote, is a direct attack on democracy.  It is not good enough to mandate social media platforms to remove such content; we need to start fining those behind it.  Democracy is fragile.  We saw that this month when supporters who had been egged on by tweets from the then US President Trump stormed Capitol Hill.  Allowing social media to become a political weapon threatens our democracy; it is that simple.</p><p> What will the Bill do to ensure that social media cannot be politically weaponised through bots and applications?  What will it do to monitor and regulate the moneys behind political advertising during election campaigns?</p></speech>

To be clear, in respect of the regulation of online political advertising, the Bill relates strictly to electoral events and the intention is to have transparency in regard to who is paying for the advertisements.  The Deputy mentioned EU level, where there are policy areas relating to the content of online advertising.  This legislation does not deal with that, so that has to be dealt with at different levels.  The Bill relates strictly to electoral events.</p><p>The Deputy made a good point about <i>voter.ie</i>.  I might ask Mr. Ryan to comment specifically on the issue of freedom of expression.  It certainly does and can threaten democracy, but it can also be a tool to strengthen democracies.  The Bill concerns just regulation and transparency in regard to who is paying for the advertising.</p><p>Mr. Ryan might add to that, followed by Ms Woods on <i>voter.ie</i>and the nationwide roll-out of that.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State mentioned and as we noted earlier, the provisions in the general scheme are very much framed around transparency and seek to replicate online what is offline, in terms of posters, election literature and so on.  What is always a challenge, and internationally this has been shown to be the case, is the balance between the regulation in this space and maintaining the right to freedom of expression.  We are very aware of the initiatives and the progress and developments at European and international level in this area.  Nevertheless, as the Minister of State noted, we are probably one of the first to dip our toe in the water in respect of the regulation of online political advertising in any regard.</p> <p>  As for the money issue, it was mentioned earlier that we have a robust spending and donations regime.  Spending online by political players for an electoral event comes within the spending limits and the regulation that is in place under the Electoral Act 1997.  Spending in that regard falls within those limits.</p> <p>  I might pass to Ms Woods to respond to the questions about the register.</p></speech>

On WhatsApp and other applications, users can hide their identity.  I was recently targeted on one such application, where a user portrayed themselves as somebody else.  They can remove any trace of their identity.  As long as they do not use Facebook or a messaging service but instead certain applications, it is not traceable.  Legislation is needed for matters such as this.  If anything is uploaded on any device, the device should be registered to a person.</p><p>It does not bother me but it is an issue from the point of view of putting out false spin and using other people's names on this false spin, which meant we had to waste valuable Oireachtas time to correct something that was put up falsely.  I was able to correct it but it was false spin that went out through an area where there was no traceability on these apps.  There has to be regulation on something like that.  Anything like that has to be traceable or linked to somebody, no matter what is put out on social media.</p></speech>

I can hear but there is a bit of an echo on mine.  I do not know if there is an echo on other attendees' side.</p> <p>  I welcome this legislation.  I welcome that it is looking at online transparency, which is really important.  I will also mention the postal vote for people who have gone abroad.  That is important.  It is something I have addressed on several occasions when people have gone on holidays.  What is the window of time for people with regard to signing the form when we have a general election?  There used to be that time.  Maybe the Minister of State could answer that.</p> <p>  On the local authorities, we have all seen where people got two voting cards, people have passed away or people have been taken off.  Is anything in place for local authority funding for staff?  Local authorities will play the biggest role here going forward and it is important we make sure they have proper staffing.  As the Minister of State knows, people died for the vote.  It is important now that local authorities are given funding for extra staff.  I request that.</p> <p>  We spoke about boundary committees.  We would have spoken in years where we had boundaries set up.  In my area on the Carlow-Laois border, there could be a housing estate with one side in Carlow and the other in Laois.  People come to me and say that Carlow local authorities look after their maintenance but they are voting for people in Laois and they ask why they are doing that.  That is unacceptable.  We need common sense here.  We need to look at local authorities, and if people's local authorities are in the neighbouring county, they should be allowed to vote in the area where they work and their kids go to school.  It is so important with boundaries that common sense prevails.  We have seen committees set up on boundaries and they came back but the boundaries never changed and there is confusion where there is a housing estate half in one area and half in another.  It does not make sense.  With this commission, we have to use common sense and to get it right.  This is important legislation and I welcome it.</p> <p>  I also want to ask about information to ensure communication with everyone and that everyone gets information.  When it comes to areas like this, because we are politicians we love politics and we think people should go out and vote.  We need to give more information and make sure it reaches schools, whether by going into different areas or taking other measures to add communication.  I think funding should be put in for advertising.</p></speech>

The issue of resources for local authorities has been raised  on a number of occasions, so it is something we have to give consideration to.  Regarding electoral boundaries, I am aware of the area the Deputy referred to in Carlow.</p><p>The commission will take on the existing work of the constituency commissions in that regard so they will be part of the deliberations.</p><p>I ask Ms Woods to address the points on postal votes and the general condition of the existing register.</p></speech>

The first question was about postal votes for people who are out of the country.  As stated previously, the work did not involve a consideration of expanding postal voting to other groups.  There is provision in the programme for Government for the commission to do work on that.  It will come back again.</p> <p>  I was asked about the timing of the closing of the register in terms of getting forms signed and so on.  The fact that it will be a rolling register will essentially mean that it will be open all year round.  It will close 14 days before an electoral event.  On the 15th day, a person will need to have his or her application in.  The register will reopen on the day after an electoral event and will remain open until 14 days in advance of the next electoral event.  Under the heads, we have essentially removed the draft, final and supplementary pieces of the register.  We will move to one rolling register that can be added to at any time.</p> <p>  I note the comments on local authorities, staffing resources, data work and advertising campaigns.  We will certainly consider them.</p></speech>

I am coming from a privacy rights perspective.  Fundamentally, I come from the position that digital identity is the property of a data subject and that the subject should own and have control over it.  While GDPR technically gives that control, it allows that once the subject is within a contract with terms and conditions, as needed on a digital platform, this arrangement circumvents the subject's power and control over the rights in question.</p> <p>  The review of and inquests into the 2016 US presidential election and the role of the now defunct Cambridge Analytica and its subsidiary and associated companies have shown what occurred when polling data identified African Americans would have voted for the Democratic candidate.  What was engaged in by third parties funded by supporters - not political parties or political candidates themselves - was a campaign of voter suppression.  In that regard, a specific campaign was undertaken, using social media platforms, to promote disillusionment in a community to suppress the vote.  It was classified as a deterrence project.  The data scientists involved coined the phrase "hope don&rsquo;t show up to vote" campaign.  It was run distinctly differently from the usual political campaign.  It involves a misinformation campaign that looks like an opinion piece or editorial.  It looks like posts from individuals.</p> <p>  We see it happening at present in Dublin in that there are digital advertising boards in public places with false information on vaccines, stating things about the Government, the HSE and public broadcasting.  The information is being filmed and put on social media by unknown individuals, and it is then supported by very much co-ordinated pile-ons.  This is an ongoing disruptor-funded campaign that is undermining our public health message.  It is a deliberate campaign.  This can happen with political campaigns.  I ask that the commission's powers be broadened in this regard.</p> <p>  I fear that the manner in which we are giving powers to the commission and considering the control of political advertising is such that this Bill will be grossly out of date by the time it is enacted, however quickly that will be.  I hope it will be very quick because it is very fine legislation otherwise.  Considering what occurred in the US election campaign in 2016, we are already five years out of date regarding what can happen.</p><p>Just because Cambridge Analytica is gone does not mean there are not other organisations out there using privacy rights and digital identity for targeting and profiling purposes.</p><p> I ask that the commission be given a role in oversight of ensuring a digital literacy campaign goes on; that it be allowed to put up and run advertising similar to that which we see RT&Eacute; running at the moment about fake news and what is correct news; that we have a means by which the commission can undertake reporting and enforcement; and that, where we see dark patterns in the use of algorithms for political purposes and we see trends in social media usage, the commission would have a role in reporting that and engaging with the Data Protection Commission.</p><p> I believe there is a huge body of work that needs to be done before we sign off on the political advertising aspect of this to ensure social media platforms are compelled to remove content, that the rules around publishing and putting up content on social media are not determined by Facebook and that our democracy is not controlled by Facebook or Twitter, as we have seen in recent weeks.</p><p> I am disturbed to hear freedom of expression being used because, outside of social media, freedom of expression is not an unqualified right.  It is very much a qualified right with regard to print media or to any of us here who are cautioned when it comes to the use of privilege.  Freedom of expression is not an appropriate motive for us to neglect the need on social media to regulate what is being done with profiling of voters in response to political polls.  I think that aspect of this very fine Bill is too refined and, while we may be taking an initiative way ahead of others, that does not mean it should fall short of the reality in the public at present of how social media is being used and people's privacy and digital identity are being used.  We need to do an extra piece of work around that section of this legislation.</p></speech>

Mr. Ryan might come in on this but generally our ambition with the electoral commission is to start with a specific set of functions and that will be ramped up over time.  There is a risk in trying to load too heavy a workload onto it.  The Senator makes a really good point in relation to this space.  On the issue of digital ad boards, perhaps they could be regulated by local authority by-laws.  I am not sure.  On trusted source news, all of that is something the commission could engage in a piece of research on with a view, perhaps, to the Oireachtas coming back with legislation on it.  The Senator is correct that Twitter and Facebook acted very  late in the day.  It took the storming of Capitol Hill for them to act so there is an issue there.  I ask Mr. Ryan to come in on that point around the commission's functions and how those functions would evolve over time.</p></speech>

It is an important point which we have not touched on in our discussion this morning that the general scheme is framed in line with the report of the Oireachtas joint committee in 2016 and subsequent public consultations that took place in the intervening period.  The outcome of all that was that we should start with a commission, establish it on a statutory basis, which we are doing, and give it an initial set of functions with a view to building on those functions over time.  Not only are we not ruling out additional functions, we are already working on what functions could be further assigned to the commission when it is up and running.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned media literacy and the campaign being run by RT&Eacute;.   It is true that there are other organisations in this space.  It is worth mentioning the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, as well as Media Literacy Ireland and the Be Media Smart campaign they ran.</p><p>That also helps in this particular space.  As the Minister of State said, I would not rule out a role for the commission in the future because the intention is certainly to build on its functions over time.</p></speech>

Sa Bhille seo t&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;anamh iarracht go mbeidh tuilleadh cumhachta&iacute; agus tuilleadh oibre ag an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  Nuair a th&aacute;inig an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga os comhair an choiste n&iacute;os luaithe i mbliana, ba mhaith an rud &eacute; gur leag s&eacute; amach cad gur ch&oacute;ir tarl&uacute; agus na h&eacute;ilimh a bh&iacute; aige.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute;, cos&uacute;il le a l&aacute;n daoine, go raibh f&aacute;ilte roimh Bhille nua agus sin at&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis.

T&aacute; s&eacute; sin soil&eacute;ir sa tuarasc&aacute;il a bh&iacute; an Teachta ag pl&eacute; c&uacute;pla n&oacute;im&eacute;ad &oacute; shin freisin.  Is g&aacute; d&uacute;inn cinnti&uacute; go bhfuil cumhachta&iacute; breise acu si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag cosaint na Gaeilge agus &aacute; cur chun cinn.  T&aacute; d&uacute;shl&aacute;in mh&oacute;ra ann ach t&aacute; dualgas ag an St&aacute;t &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</p><p> N&iacute; rud r&oacute;chasta at&aacute; sa leas&uacute; seo so n&iacute; d&eacute;arfaidh m&eacute; m&oacute;r&aacute;n eile faoi ach is &eacute; an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga ceann de na hoifigigh is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge anois.  C&eacute; go bhfuilimid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an leas&uacute; seo t&aacute; leasuithe eile molta agam maidir leis an gcoimisin&eacute;ir ach t&aacute; roinnt acu d&iacute;cheadaithe.

N&iacute; hiad na daoine at&aacute; sa Roinn thar na blianta at&aacute; i gceist ach iad si&uacute;d sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras a bh&iacute;onn mall ag cur dualgais bhreise orthu f&eacute;in agus mall ag cur ualach breise airgeadais orthu f&eacute;in n&oacute; ar an gc&oacute;ras i gcoitinne.

Ansin nuair a bh&iacute; an gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im aitheanta i dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, n&iacute; raibh siad radacach go leor chun na c&eacute;imeanna cu&iacute; a ghlacadh.

T&aacute; roinnt acu d&iacute;cheadaithe toisc go bhfuil riail sa Teach seo a choisceann muidne sa Fhreas&uacute;ra &oacute; aon leas&uacute; a chur chun cinn a bheadh costas air.  D&eacute;anann s&eacute; sin &eacute; thar a bheith deacair d&uacute;inn leasuithe a chur chun cinn.  Tuigim an f&aacute;th go bhfuil s&eacute; sa Bhunreacht, mar n&aacute;r ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an Freas&uacute;ra n&oacute; fi&uacute; backbenchers in ann ualach airgid a chur ar an Rialtas.  Tuigim &eacute; sin, ach m&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh a bheith praitici&uacute;il agus ruda&iacute; for&aacute;sacha a chur chun cinn, n&iacute; ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh muid go hioml&aacute;n srianta.  Ar a laghad ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an tAire St&aacute;it ag f&eacute;achaint ar na leasuithe sin mar n&iacute; mise amh&aacute;in at&aacute; ag smaoineamh ar cad is f&eacute;idir liom a chaitheamh isteach sa Bhille agus ag caitheamh ama &aacute; dhr&eacute;acht&uacute; at&aacute; iontu.  Seo tuairim&iacute; Gaeilgeoir&iacute; agus muintir na Gaeltachta.  Seo na ruda&iacute; at&aacute; siadsan ag iarraidh go nd&eacute;anfaidh muidne chun an teanga agus an Ghaeltacht a chosaint.  S&iacute;leann siad gurb iad seo na ruda&iacute;, ar a laghad, at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il chun go mbeadh cosaint tugtha d&oacute;ibh.  In ainneoin gur leas&uacute; beag simpl&iacute; &eacute; seo i sl&iacute; amh&aacute;in, t&aacute; s&eacute; ceangailte le a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; eile at&aacute; curtha faoi bhr&aacute;id an Aire St&aacute;it.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; s&eacute; deacair ar oifigigh Oifig na mBill&iacute; f&eacute;achaint air seo mar n&iacute;or chuimhin leo athr&uacute; d&aacute; leith&eacute;id cheana.  T&aacute; s&eacute; beag&aacute;in&iacute;n ceangailte leis an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; &aacute; r&aacute; againn i dtaobh leas&uacute; Uimh. 1.  Is f&eacute;idir an bun-Acht agus a bunfheidhm a athr&uacute; n&oacute; is f&eacute;idir soil&eacute;iri&uacute; a thabhairt ar an mbunfheidhm sin, agus is &eacute; sin at&aacute; &aacute; lorg agam tr&iacute;d leas&uacute; Uimh. 2.  D&eacute;ile&aacute;lfaidh m&eacute; le leas&uacute; Uimh. 3, at&aacute; d&iacute;cheadaithe freisin, chomh maith agus ansin d&eacute;ile&aacute;lfaimid le leas&uacute; Uimh. 4, at&aacute; in ord.</p><p>Is iarracht &eacute; seo breithi&uacute;nas a rinne an Pr&iacute;omh-Bhreitheamh, an Breitheamh On&oacute;rach Hugh Kennedy, an ch&eacute;ad Ard-Aighne agus polaiteoir de chuid Chumann na nGael, in 1934 a ch&oacute;d&uacute; i reachta&iacute;ocht.  Thug s&eacute; an breithi&uacute;nas sin i gc&aacute;s &Oacute; Foghludha <i>v.</i>McClean.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute;, &oacute;s &iacute; an Ghaeilge an phr&iacute;omhtheanga oifigi&uacute;il, t&aacute; s&eacute; de dhualgas ar an St&aacute;t gach a dh&eacute;anamh laistigh d&aacute; raon gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta chun &iacute; a bhuan&uacute; agus a chaomhn&uacute; ina st&aacute;das mar theanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus &iacute; a aithint mar theanga &aacute;isi&uacute;il chun gach cr&iacute;och oifigi&uacute;il.  Ba &eacute; an rud a bh&iacute; i gceist agam n&aacute; &quot;gach&quot; a chur isteach seachas &quot;cr&iacute;che oifigi&uacute;la&quot; amh&aacute;in chun nach mbeidh Rialtas n&aacute; Aire &aacute;balta a roghn&uacute; c&eacute;n cr&iacute;ocha oifigi&uacute;la a bheadh i gceist.  Toisc nach bhfuil s&eacute; sa Teideal, ba mhaith liom a chur isteach go bhfuil gach uile cheann i gceist agus go mbeadh an Teideal ina chur s&iacute;os ar bhunphrionsabail an Achta.  N&iacute; bheimid in ann a r&aacute; go mbeidh tionchar m&oacute;r ag an leas&uacute; seo ach glactar leis faoi l&aacute;thair, faoin Teideal mar at&aacute;, go bhfuil dualgais shoil&eacute;ire san Acht &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn chun cr&iacute;che oifigi&uacute;la sa St&aacute;t.  Aonta&iacute;mid leis sin, dar nd&oacute;igh, ach t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh dul chun tosaigh air sin.</p><p>Ina leabhar, <i>Acht na Gaeilge &ndash; Acht ar Strae: L&eacute;irmheas ar Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2003</i>, a foils&iacute;odh i ndiaidh Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, 2003, m&iacute;n&iacute;onn an Dr. P&aacute;draig Breand&aacute;n &Oacute; Laighin go mbeadh gach cr&iacute;och oifigi&uacute;il i gceist, is &eacute; sin le r&aacute;, n&aacute;r ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh aon phrionsabal de chuid den St&aacute;t riamh ag cur i gcoinne cur chun cinn &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge.  N&iacute; c&oacute;ir go mbeadh &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge srianta go cr&iacute;och amh&aacute;in, mar sin, n&iacute; bheadh s&eacute; i gceist sa tsocha&iacute; go ginear&aacute;lta d&aacute; dtac&oacute;dh an St&aacute;t leis an nGaeilge an m&eacute;id is a thaca&iacute;onn s&eacute; le h&uacute;s&aacute;id an Bh&eacute;arla.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn an fhocla&iacute;ocht seo an fheals&uacute;nacht at&aacute; sa dl&iacute; cheana f&eacute;in de r&eacute;ir an bhreithi&uacute;nais ch&uacute;irte sin agus meon an roghchoiste seo de r&eacute;ir Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, ina gcuireann Airteagal 8 an Ghaeilge chun cinn mar phr&iacute;omhtheanga oifigi&uacute;il.  Gan an focal &quot;gach&quot; a bheith istigh ann, t&aacute; an cuma ar an sc&eacute;al go bhfuil cead ag an St&aacute;t polasaithe a lean&uacute;int ina mbeadh c&eacute;im siar ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge molta, n&oacute; ina gcuirtear faoi bhr&uacute; &iacute; mar thoradh.  N&iacute; c&oacute;ir go mbeadh cead ag an St&aacute;t &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh, go h&aacute;irithe agus an Ghaeilge i mbaol faoi l&aacute;thair.</p><p>Mar a d&uacute;irt P&aacute;draig Mac Fheargusa ina aighneacht, a leagadh amach ar leathanach 124 de tuarasc&aacute;il na bliana 2018, &quot;M&aacute; t&aacute; strait&eacute;is i leith an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht &aacute; coth&uacute; ag an st&aacute;t, n&iacute;or c&oacute;ir go gceal&oacute;dh n&aacute; go lag&oacute;dh aon reachta&iacute;ocht nua an strat&eacute;is sin, de thaisme n&oacute; d'aonturas.&quot;  Is &eacute; sin at&aacute; i gceist.  Is cinnti&uacute; at&aacute; i gceist seachas aon rud eile.  T&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;anamh cinnte go bhfuil gach uile ghn&eacute; den St&aacute;t gafa le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus nach dt&oacute;gfaidh siad aon ch&eacute;im siar.</p><p>T&aacute; leas&uacute; Uimh. 2 as ord de bharr costais n&oacute; ioncaim agus t&aacute; leas&uacute; Uimh. 3 as ord toisc nach lu&iacute;onn s&eacute; le for&aacute;lacha an Bhille f&eacute;in, rud at&aacute; ait agus muid ag caint faoin nGaeilge a chosaint sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras agus cur chuige n&iacute;os fearr a bheith ann &oacute; thaobh an st&aacute;tch&oacute;rais agus ceart.  D&uacute;radh sna leasuithe &quot;CHUN COMHIONANNAS CEART AGUS PRIBHL&Eacute;ID&Iacute; COMHIONANNA A CHOTH&Uacute; MAIDIR LE h&Uacute;S&Aacute;ID TEANGACHA OIFIGI&Uacute;LA, GO h&Aacute;IRITHE MAIDIR LENA n&Uacute;S&Aacute;ID IN IMEACHTA&Iacute; PARLAIMINTE&quot;.  Tiocfaimid ar ais chuig an gceist a &eacute;ir&iacute;onn as sin.  Sa D&aacute;il, n&iacute;l s&eacute; de cheart agam, n&oacute; n&iacute; f&eacute;idir liom, an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id i ngach uile ghn&eacute; de mo ghn&oacute; parlaiminte.  T&aacute; an c&aacute;s seo iontach - foils&iacute;odh an Bille i nGaeilge agus bh&iacute; m&eacute; in ann leasuithe a chur isteach i nGaeilge.  Foils&iacute;odh gach Bille eile i mB&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in agus n&iacute;l cead agam leasuithe a chur isteach i nGaeilge.  Mar sin, n&iacute; f&eacute;idir liom an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  N&iacute;l na n&oacute;ta&iacute; m&iacute;ni&uacute;ch&aacute;in n&aacute; an reachta&iacute;ocht foilsithe i nGaeilge agus i mB&eacute;arla ag an am c&eacute;anna.  Fi&uacute; agus muid ag cur isteach leasuithe - agus is l&eacute;iri&uacute; &eacute; seo - bh&iacute; orainn roinnt leasuithe a chur isteach i mB&eacute;arla toisc nach raibh an bunreachta&iacute;ocht ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge f&oacute;s, mar shampla Acht maidir leis an nGarda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Bh&iacute; orm casadh ar an mB&eacute;arla, c&eacute; nach bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist agam &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh, chun go mbeadh s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir cad a bh&iacute; i gceist agam sa reachta&iacute;ocht sin.</p><p>Tharla s&eacute; seo dom cheana.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh leas&uacute; a mholadh d'Acht an Chol&aacute;iste Ollscoile, Gaillimh (Leas&uacute;), 2006 nuair a bh&iacute; athr&uacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar an choinn&iacute;oll Gaeilge n&aacute; an dualgas &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge ach n&iacute; raibh cead agam &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh toisc go raibh s&eacute; i mB&eacute;arla.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh a bheith r&eacute;as&uacute;nta.  In arg&oacute;int&iacute; le hAir&iacute; difri&uacute;la thar na blianta mhol m&eacute; go bhfoilseodh, ar a laghad, na meamraim m&iacute;ni&uacute;ch&aacute;in as Gaeilge.  N&iacute;l aon st&aacute;das dl&iacute;thi&uacute;il acu agus, mar sin, n&iacute; g&aacute; ach aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh orthu.  Bheadh siad mar &aacute;is dom agus d'aon Teachta eile mar bheadh an fhocla&iacute;ocht againn &oacute; thaobh cad at&aacute; i gceist sa reachta&iacute;ocht.  Thug an t-iarAire, Joan Burton, geall&uacute;int dom go dtarl&oacute;dh s&eacute; sin nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il raic maidir le reachta&iacute;ocht nach raibh ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge agus &iacute; ag iarraidh &iacute; a th&oacute;g&aacute;il isteach n&iacute;os tapa n&aacute; ba ch&oacute;ir toisc nach mbeadh s&eacute; aistrithe in am.  Thuig m&eacute; a c&aacute;s mar bhain an reachta&iacute;ocht leis an minimum wage.  N&iacute; raibh m&eacute; chun moill a chur ar ard&uacute; sa minimum wage ach bh&iacute; prionsabal eile taobh thiar de.  Bh&iacute; an Rialtas ag r&aacute; go raibh s&eacute; ceart go leor moill a chur le haistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n an Bhille in ainneoin na geall&uacute;na a thug s&eacute;.</p><p>T&aacute; &eacute;acht &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an dream a dh&eacute;anann aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in sna Tithe agus a aistr&iacute;onn Achtanna. Is l&eacute;ir &oacute;n bhfadhb a bh&iacute; againn maidir leis na leasuithe a moladh don Bhille seo gur jab m&oacute;r agus jab t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute;.</p><p>D&uacute;radh go dt&oacute;gfadh s&eacute; c&uacute;ig bliana roimh a bheidh gach uile ph&iacute;osa reachta&iacute;ochta at&aacute; againn aistrithe go Gaeilge.  T&aacute; fadhb dhl&iacute;thi&uacute;il ansin.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ar chl&aacute;r Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta inn&eacute; agus bh&iacute; abhc&oacute;ide ar an gcl&aacute;r ag r&aacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; scanr&uacute;il go bhf&eacute;adfadh roinnt de na c&aacute;sanna at&aacute; os comhair na gc&uacute;irteanna faoi l&aacute;thair a bheith caite as an gc&uacute;irt toisc nach bhfuil an bunreachta&iacute;ocht ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge, de r&eacute;ir bhreithi&uacute;nas a thug an Breitheamh Adrian Hardiman.  Measaim gur in 2004 a rinne s&eacute; an cinneadh sin agus d&uacute;irt s&eacute; d&aacute; dtiocfadh aon rud mar sin os a chomhair go gcaithfeadh s&eacute; amach l&aacute;ithreach &eacute;.  T&aacute; fadhb ansin mura bhfuil an reachta&iacute;ocht aistrithe agus an bealach is &eacute;asca d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis n&aacute; i mbeala&iacute; eile.  Sin at&aacute; i gceist le comhionannas san obair parlaiminte at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn.</p><p> Is f&eacute;idir liom sampla&iacute; eile a thabhairt d&rsquo;&aacute;iteanna gur s&oacute;rt afterthought a bh&iacute;onn sa Ghaeilge go minic sa chomhr&aacute; a bh&iacute;onn againn &oacute; thaobh na parlaiminte de agus &oacute; thaobh cleachtais pharlaiminte agus a leith&eacute;id.  N&iacute; h&eacute; go bhfuil naimhdeas ann n&oacute; go bhfuil daoine &aacute; gcur ina coinne, ach go nd&eacute;anann siad dearmad uirthi.  M&aacute; t&aacute; na ruda&iacute; seo leagtha s&iacute;os go beacht agus go dl&iacute;thi&uacute;il, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go n-&uacute;s&aacute;idfaidh roinnt den ch&oacute;ras i gcoitinne &iacute;.  Sin a bh&iacute; i gceist leis na leasuithe a d&iacute;cheada&iacute;odh.  Tuigim nach bhfuil n&oacute;ta ag an Aire St&aacute;it f&uacute;thu.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; n&iacute;os luaithe, imp&iacute;m ar na daoine sa Roinn agus ar an Aire St&aacute;it f&eacute;achaint ar cad at&aacute; i gceist leo.  M&aacute;s f&eacute;idir leo in aon chor, iarraim orthu f&eacute;achaint ar an bhfocla&iacute;ocht agus a leas&uacute; f&eacute;in a chur isteach ar Ch&eacute;im na Tuarasc&aacute;la n&oacute; sa Seanad chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na bearna&iacute; at&aacute; sa reachta&iacute;ocht go dt&iacute; seo agus na bearna&iacute; sa chosaint do Ghaeilgeoir&iacute; mar n&iacute;l s&eacute; maith go leor ag an bpointe seo.  Chuideodh s&eacute; linne d&aacute; gcuirfeadh an tAire St&aacute;it leas&uacute; isteach mar is f&eacute;idir leis &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh nuair at&aacute; ceist airgeadais i gceist ach n&iacute; f&eacute;idir liomsa.  Sin ceann de na fadhbanna at&aacute; ann agus t&aacute; s&eacute; go maith sa ch&aacute;s seo go bhfuil an Leas-Chathaoirleach s&aacute;sta deis chainte a thabhairt d&uacute;inn ar na leasuithe at&aacute; d&iacute;cheadaithe. </p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; intuigthe m&aacute; t&aacute; spriocdh&aacute;ta curtha istigh sa reachta&iacute;ocht, m&aacute; deir s&eacute; go dtiocfaidh rud &eacute;igin i bhfeidhm s&eacute; mh&iacute; tar &eacute;is a s&iacute;n&iacute;tear &eacute; n&oacute; go nd&eacute;anfaidh an tAire an cinneadh seo n&oacute; an cinneadh si&uacute;d laistigh de bhliain.  Tuigfidh daoine ansin go bhfuil an Bille achtaithe agus go mbeidh coiste comhairleach ann bliain n&iacute;os d&eacute;ana&iacute; agus go mbeidh s&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh p&eacute; rud at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh aige sa tr&eacute;imhse sin.  Beidh cinnt&iacute; maidir le st&aacute;isean&oacute;ireacht, foirmeacha oifigi&uacute;la n&oacute; earca&iacute;ocht le d&eacute;anamh.  M&aacute; t&aacute; spriocdh&aacute;ta ann, sin an spriocdh&aacute;ta, ach n&iacute;l spriocdh&aacute;ta&iacute; leagtha s&iacute;os do a l&aacute;n de na for&aacute;lacha seo, so n&iacute;l a fhios againn go d&iacute;reach c&eacute;n uair a bheidh feidhm leis an reachta&iacute;ocht.  In ainneoin gur fhan muid 17 n&oacute; 18 bliain &oacute;n Acht deireanach agus go bhfuilimid ag dul tr&iacute;d seo anois, d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh roinnt den Bhille seo teacht i bhfeidhm in dh&aacute; bhliain, tr&iacute; bliana n&oacute; ceithre bliana.<br/><br/>Sin an rud a bh&iacute; muidne ag iarraidh a dh&eacute;anamh anseo.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil s&eacute; d&eacute;anta beag&aacute;in&iacute;n ciotr&uacute;nta againn ach n&iacute; mise a th&aacute;inig ar na focail.  Is i dtuairisc an choiste a th&aacute;inig m&eacute; air seo.  Is Conradh na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn &eacute; agus &eacute; ag tabhairt aighneachta don choiste.  Sa tuairisc ar sc&eacute;im ghinear&aacute;lta Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;), 2017, mar a bh&iacute; ann ag an am, d&uacute;irt s&eacute; gur ch&oacute;ir d&oacute; teacht i bhfeidhm chomh gasta agus is f&eacute;idir.  Luadh an rud ceannann c&eacute;anna in aighneacht an abhc&oacute;ide D&aacute;ith&iacute; Mac C&aacute;rthaigh.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; ann chomh maith.  N&iacute; h&eacute; gur mise amh&aacute;in agus liom f&eacute;in go huaigneach at&aacute; i gceist anseo ach an gn&aacute;th easpa muin&iacute;ne at&aacute; ag muintir saol na Gaeilge ar chinnt&iacute; maidir leis an Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; siad ag iarraidh go dtiocfaidh na for&aacute;lacha sa Bhille i bhfeidhm l&aacute;ithreach m&aacute;s f&eacute;idir.  Sin &oacute; thaobh an chuid den phr&iacute;omh-Acht nach bhfuil go hioml&aacute;n achtaithe n&oacute; ag obair, na hathruithe d&oacute; at&aacute; ag teacht de r&eacute;ir an Bhille seo agus gach rud at&aacute; sa Bhille f&eacute;in.<br/><br/>B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur f&eacute;idir linn f&eacute;achaint ar seo.  T&aacute; m&eacute; den tuairim gur ch&oacute;ir go bhfanfadh s&eacute;, ach mura bhfuil an tAire St&aacute;it s&aacute;sta leis an leas&uacute; seo, bheadh orm dul ar ais ag an mBille agus f&eacute;achaint ar gach uile fhor&aacute;il at&aacute; istigh ann agus spriocdh&aacute;ta a chur s&iacute;os d&oacute;ibh chun cinnti&uacute; go bhfuil spriocdh&aacute;ta&iacute; ann.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n acu curtha s&iacute;os ar aon chaoi sna leasuithe a chur m&eacute; chun cinn go dt&iacute; seo ach t&aacute; roinnt acu si&uacute;d d&iacute;cheadaithe.  F&eacute;achfaidh m&eacute; ar&iacute;s air.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; seo mar chuid den Bhille.</p></speech>

Is d&oacute;igh go bhfuil m&eacute; beag&aacute;in&iacute;n leadr&aacute;nach ag r&aacute; an rud ceannann c&eacute;anna.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh dul abhaile, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, mar t&aacute; m&eacute; br&eacute;an agus traochta den chur i gc&eacute;il seo.

Sin an fhadhb.  N&iacute;l muin&iacute;n agamsa ansin, ach n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; f&oacute;s, n&iacute;l muin&iacute;n ag muintir na nGaeltachta&iacute; agus na Gaeilge.  Luaigh an tAire St&aacute;it alt a 13.  Ar&iacute;s, &uacute;s&aacute;idtear an focal &quot;f&eacute;adfar&quot; ann agus an m&eacute;id sol&uacute;bthacht at&aacute; i gceist leis sin.  Deir s&eacute;:</p> <blockquote> 	(1) F&eacute;adfar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;), 2019 a ghairm den Acht seo.<br /><br />(2) F&eacute;adfar Achtanna na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, 2003 agus 2019 a ghairm d&rsquo;Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, 2003 agus den Acht seo le ch&eacute;ile.<br /><br />(3) Tiocfaidh an tAcht seo i ngn&iacute;omh cib&eacute; l&aacute; [sin na focail mhillteanach] n&oacute; laethanta a cheapfaidh an tAire Cult&uacute;ir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta le hord&uacute; n&oacute; le horduithe i gcoitinne n&oacute; faoi threoir aon chr&iacute;och n&oacute; for&aacute;il &aacute;irithe, agus f&eacute;adfar laethanta &eacute;ags&uacute;la a cheapadh amhlaidh chun cr&iacute;och &eacute;ags&uacute;il n&oacute; le haghaidh for&aacute;lacha &eacute;ags&uacute;la. </blockquote> <p>N&iacute; f&eacute;idir glacadh leis sin m&aacute; t&aacute; an Rialtas i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.</p><p>Tuigim go bhfuil deacrachta&iacute; ann.

N&iacute;l na focail agam don reachta&iacute;ocht sin agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh duine &eacute;igin in ann cabhair a thabhairt dom maidir leis an Ghaeilge ar wards of court.  T&aacute; teipthe orm faoi l&aacute;thair na focail a fh&aacute;il.  T&aacute; an reachta&iacute;ocht sin ann &oacute; 2015 agus n&iacute;or cuireadh formh&oacute;r de i bhfeidhm f&oacute;s.

T&aacute;imid ag r&aacute; sa Bhille go ligfimid d&rsquo;aon Aire sa todhcha&iacute; &eacute; a chur a bhfeidhm nuair a fheileann s&eacute; d&oacute; n&oacute; di.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir glacadh leis seo.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil na focail beag&aacute;in&iacute;n awkward ach an rud at&aacute;imid ag iarraidh a chur in i&uacute;l ar&iacute;s agus ar&iacute;s n&aacute; go g&aacute; d&uacute;inn Bille l&aacute;idir a chur i bhfeidhm chomh sciobtha agus is f&eacute;idir.

Maidir leis an Acht &oacute; 2003, n&iacute; fheicim aon fhadhb anseo.  Cuireadh roinnt mhaith orduithe tosaithe i bhfeidhm thar an d&aacute; bhliain tar &eacute;is acht&uacute; an phr&iacute;omhAchta in 2003.  D'oibrigh s&eacute; go maith.

An bhfuil an tAire St&aacute;it ag r&aacute; go bhfuil d&aacute;ta n&oacute; pr&oacute;iseas luaite le gach rud?  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; gur tugadh orduithe isteach laistigh de thr&iacute; bliana tar &eacute;is an Achta dheireanaigh.  N&iacute;l aon amhras faoi sin.

Measaim f&eacute;in n&aacute;r ch&oacute;ir &eacute; sin agus is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil g&aacute; ann spriocdh&aacute;ta&iacute; nua a chur s&iacute;os.

Sa ch&aacute;s seo, is Acht leasaithe at&aacute; i gceist, mar a thaispe&aacute;ntar sa Teideal.  Leagtar amach in alt 1(2) den Acht &oacute; 2003, go raibh ar gach rud a bheith cr&iacute;ochnaithe laistigh de tr&iacute; bliana, is &eacute; sin, faoi 2006, seachas na p&iacute;osa&iacute; a raibh spriocdh&aacute;ta&iacute; n&iacute;os d&eacute;ana&iacute; n&aacute; sin leagtha s&iacute;os d&oacute;ibh.

Is f&eacute;idir leis an Aire s&iacute;neadh ama a thabhairt ina leith.  Is &eacute; sin an s&oacute;rt ruda nach bhfuil lucht na Gaeilge &aacute; lorg.  T&aacute; siad ag lorg a fhios a bheith acu c&eacute;n d&aacute;ta faoina mbeidh feidhm le for&aacute;lacha &aacute;irithe n&oacute; leis an Acht in ioml&aacute;n.  B'fh&eacute;idir nach mbeidh siad s&aacute;sta leis ach ba mhaith leo a bheith ar an eolas faoi.  Munar f&eacute;idir linn &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh, t&aacute; seans ann go mbeidh moill ann, mar a d&uacute;irt an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.

Chuile uair a deir duine go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag f&aacute;il bh&aacute;is n&oacute; gurb &iacute; seo an ghl&uacute;in dheireanach, cuireann s&eacute; i gcuimhne dom rud a d&uacute;radh 170 bliain &oacute; shin:</p> <blockquote> 	As to the Irish language, toleration and patronage have come too late.  It cannot be saved alive by any human power.  It is at present confined to about one-third of the peasantry, and these are the most ignorant and uncivilised.  As a spoken language, it can hardly survive the present generation.  The fathers and mothers will retain it till their death, but by the children it will be neglected and forgotten.  The time for educating them in their native language has gone by for ever.  It is not the language of business, of modern civilisation, and it will not enable a man to get on in the world.  However we may regret that any language, especially one so primitive, so expressive, so powerful as the Gaelic should cease to live, its doom is inevitable. </blockquote> <p>Nach mbeadh s&eacute; thar cionn d&aacute; bhf&eacute;adfadh muid an duine sin a thabhairt ar ais inniu agus a r&aacute; leis gur i nGaeilge at&aacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo, go bhfuil TG4 agus Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta againn, go bhfuil Gaelscoileanna ar fud na t&iacute;re agus go bhfuil an mhe&aacute;naicme tite i ngr&aacute; leis an Ghaeilge?</p><p>N&iacute; dh&eacute;anann s&eacute; m&oacute;r&aacute;n leasa a bheith i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag r&aacute; go bhfuil s&iacute; ag f&aacute;il bh&aacute;is.  Is fearr d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar na bagairt&iacute;.  N&iacute;l mise dall ar na bagairt&iacute; mar t&aacute; m&eacute; ag c&oacute;na&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht, ach t&aacute; &uacute;dar d&oacute;chais ann.  Ag breathn&uacute; ar na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; thar 100 bliain, is l&eacute;ir murach iarrachta&iacute; mhuintir Chonradh na Gaeilge agus an obair ar fad a rinneadh, bheadh s&iacute; b&aacute;saithe.  N&iacute; raibh an rud a d&uacute;radh ag an am m&iacute;-r&eacute;ala&iacute;och.  Bh&iacute; an Ghaeilge ag dul go B&eacute;arla thar dh&aacute; ghl&uacute;in.  T&aacute; obair mhaith d&eacute;anta ach t&aacute; tuilleadh le d&eacute;anamh.  Scr&iacute;obh &uacute;dar an leabhair seo abairt d&iacute;reach i ndiaidh an r&aacute;itis sin agus is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil ciall leis.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute;, &quot;How often in the last hundred years have these words been re-echoed by those who considered that the survival of the Irish language was not worth an extra effort!&quot;  T&eacute;ann s&eacute; ar aghaidh agus deir s&eacute;:</p> <blockquote> 	Shall it be said of the language of the Goidels, of the Irish missionaries who evangelised Europe in the Middle Ages, of the countless Irishmen who preserved it in spite of hatred, oppression, and conquest, that it died in our time or in our children's time in a free Ireland? </blockquote> <p>An d&uacute;shl&aacute;n at&aacute; romhainne n&aacute; a bheith d&oacute;chasach agus cinnte a d&eacute;anamh nach bhfaigheann s&iacute; b&aacute;s, gan g&eacute;illeadh go bhfaighidh s&iacute; b&aacute;s agus gan g&eacute;illeadh go bhfuil an cath caillte.</p><p>Mar a deirim, bh&iacute; go leor daoine ann cheana f&eacute;in a d&uacute;irt go raibh an cath caillte agus t&aacute; s&iacute; f&oacute;s beo beathach.</p></speech>

In 2003, n&iacute;l a fhios agam p&eacute; Roinn a bh&iacute; ann agus athra&iacute;odh c&uacute;pla uair &oacute; shin &eacute;.  Bogann c&uacute;rsa&iacute; na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge timpeall &oacute; Roinn go Roinn agus uaireanta b&iacute;onn c&uacute;rsa&iacute; &quot;cult&uacute;ir&quot; agus &quot;oidhreachta&quot; n&oacute; rud &eacute;igin eile curtha l&eacute;i.</p><p>Is &eacute; an rud at&aacute;im ag iarraidh a dh&eacute;anamh, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in leis an mBille seo ach le Bill&iacute; eile a bhfuilim ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo, n&aacute; a chinnti&uacute; go n-athr&oacute;fa&iacute; teideal na Roinne go huathoibr&iacute;och gach uair a leasa&iacute;tear Bille.  Sa bhealach sin, beidh s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir c&eacute;n Roinn ar a bhfuil freagracht as an nGaeilge, an Ghaeltacht agus pobal labhartha na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; na leasuithe ar fad sa ghr&uacute;pa seo beagnach mar an gc&eacute;anna.  Is &eacute; sin at&aacute; i gceist, seachas a bheith ag cur isteach teidil nua.  D&aacute; mbeadh toghch&aacute;n ar maidin, bhogfadh p&eacute; Rialtas a bheadh i gcumhacht ruda&iacute; timpeall agus, mar sin, bheadh an tAcht as d&aacute;ta l&aacute;ithreach.  N&iacute;lim ag caint faoin mBille seo amh&aacute;in.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh reachta&iacute;ocht curtha le ch&eacute;ile mar sin i ngach c&aacute;s chun nach mbeadh aon dabht ann riamh.  Mar shampla, sa D&aacute;il dheireanach chaill an Roinn m&iacute;r d&aacute; teideal.  Ba &eacute; an cult&uacute;r n&oacute; an eala&iacute;n.  N&iacute; cuimhin liom; t&aacute; s&eacute; athraithe chomh minic sin.  D'imigh s&eacute; as teideal na Roinne so n&iacute; raibh s&eacute; ann.  I rith D&aacute;la eile, n&iacute; raibh an oidhreacht ann.  Bh&iacute; na dualgais f&oacute;s ann, &aacute;fach.  Bh&iacute; siad ar an Aire agus sa liosta dualgas a fuair s&iacute;, c&eacute; nach raibh s&eacute; sa teideal.  </p><p> N&iacute; raibh pobal labhartha na Gaeilge sa teideal riamh.  Bh&iacute; Aire na Gaeltachta ann ar feadh tr&eacute;imhse, ach n&iacute; raibh Aire na Gaeilge ann.  Sa Ch&eacute;ad D&aacute;il bh&iacute; Aire sinsearach dar teideal Aire na Gaeilge.  N&iacute; raibh a leith&eacute;id de theideal ann &oacute; shin.  Is &eacute; mo thuiscint go bhfuil an dualgas ag bogadh timpeall, is cuma c&eacute;n Roinn ar a bhfuil s&eacute;.  Is rud teicni&uacute;il &eacute; nach nd&eacute;anfaidh m&oacute;r&aacute;n difr&iacute;ochta i gc&aacute;s na reachta&iacute;ochta seo ach, nuair a fheicim ruda&iacute; mar sin, measaim gur ch&oacute;ir iad a leigheas.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; luaite in aighneachta&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la gur ch&oacute;ir go n-athr&oacute;fa&iacute; an teideal.  Chuaigh mise chun tosaigh ar an m&eacute;id sin.  </p><p> T&aacute; sampla agam a thuigfidh an tAire St&aacute;it.  Is Aire s&oacute;isearach le freagracht as an gcosaint &eacute; anois ach is &eacute; an teideal at&aacute; ar a phost san Acht Cosanta 1954 n&aacute; "R&uacute;na&iacute; Parlaiminte an Aire Chosanta".  De r&eacute;ir freagra a fuair m&eacute; an l&aacute; deireanach, n&iacute;l dualgais an Aire ar an Aire St&aacute;it.  T&aacute; siad coime&aacute;dta ag an Aire, Teachta Coveney.  Sa ch&aacute;s seo, in ainneoin gurb &eacute; Teachta Chambers an tAire, t&aacute; duine eile i gceannas.  T&aacute; an teideal ann toisc gur g&aacute; &eacute; a bheith ann chun an chomhairle chosanta a bheith bunaithe de r&eacute;ir an Achta sin.  T&aacute;imse ag r&aacute; gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh na dualgais san &aacute;it ch&eacute;anna ina bhfuil an fhreagracht.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuilim ag iarraidh f&aacute;il r&eacute;idh leis an iomrasc&aacute;il focal sin.  Ba ch&oacute;ir an cinneadh sin a dh&eacute;anamh agus, amach anseo, n&iacute; g&aacute; d&uacute;inn teideal na Roinne a athr&uacute; gach uile uair at&aacute; Bille nua ann.

F&eacute;achaimid ar an gcaoi go bhfeidhm&iacute;tear ruda&iacute; agus gur feidhm&iacute;odh iad thar na blianta fada nuair a bh&iacute; inni&uacute;lacht sa Ghaeilge i gceist, i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; plean&aacute;la n&oacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; poist a fh&aacute;il, nach raibh a fhios ag &eacute;inne c&eacute;ard a bh&iacute; i gceist.  Thug m&eacute; cuairt ar Cheanada nuair a bh&iacute; an Bille &aacute; dhr&eacute;acht&uacute; an uair dheireanach.  Bh&iacute; tr&iacute; chaighde&aacute;n i gceist acu si&uacute;d.  Mar shampla, d&uacute;irt siad nach mbeadh g&aacute; d&rsquo;fh&aacute;ilteoir a bheith in ann gn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, n&oacute; tr&iacute; Fhraincis mar a bh&iacute; i gceist ansin, ach bheadh s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go bhf&eacute;adfaid&iacute;s beann&uacute; a thabhairt do dhaoine agus duine &eacute;igin a fh&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh.  Ar an taobh eile den sc&eacute;al, d&aacute; mbeadh duine ag dul ag d&eacute;anamh gn&oacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, theast&oacute;dh cumas an-ard Gaeilge uaidh n&oacute; uaithi.  </p> <p>  Tarla&iacute;onn s&eacute; go bhfuil caighde&aacute;n Eorpach ann a aithn&iacute;tear trasna na hEorpa.  T&aacute; an ceart ag an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh go gcaithfimid rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh maidir leis an gceist seo, at&aacute; ina chn&aacute;mh spairne &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an St&aacute;t.  Go minic leagadh s&iacute;os caighde&aacute;n ard ag an t&uacute;s agus shleamhnaigh s&eacute; agus shleamhnaigh s&eacute;.  Luadh, mar shampla, an scr&uacute;d&uacute; a chuirtear ar aturnaetha.  C&eacute; mh&eacute;ad aturnae a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh duine dul chucu agus labhairt leo i nGaeilge?  F&oacute;s f&eacute;in, d&eacute;anann siad scr&uacute;d&uacute; Gaeilge.</p> <p>  T&eacute;ann s&eacute; seo siar go dt&iacute; an cheist a fiafra&iacute;odh ar ball maidir le d&aacute;ta&iacute;.  Mura mbeidh cinnteacht anseo c&eacute;ard a chialla&iacute;onn muid le duine a bheith inni&uacute;lacht?  T&aacute; an ceart ag an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh.  Is ioma&iacute; duine a cheaptar i jab agus bh&iacute;odar ag dul ag foghlaim na Gaeilge ach n&iacute;or fhoghlaim siad &iacute; agus thiontaigh siad oifigigh a bh&iacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; sa Ghaeilge, na custaim&eacute;ir&iacute; agus chuile dhuine ar an mB&eacute;arla.  &Eacute;istfidh m&eacute; leis an Aire St&aacute;it ach bheadh s&uacute;il agam go nglacfadh s&eacute; leis seo.  Caithfimid d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an gceist seo agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir linn &eacute;al&uacute; uaithi.  T&aacute; s&eacute; seo i bhfad n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; n&aacute; go leor ruda&iacute; eile a bheidh muid ag pl&eacute; sa Bhille seo, mar mura r&eacute;it&iacute;mid an cheist seo t&aacute; a fhios agam c&eacute;ard a tharl&oacute;idh.  Ceapfar 20% den st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s le Gaeilge ach n&iacute; bheidh aon Ghaeilge acu.  D&aacute; mbeadh comhlacht ag ceapadh tiom&aacute;na&iacute; le dul ag tiom&aacute;int leora&iacute;, n&iacute; smaoineodh aon duine sa St&aacute;t riamh a r&aacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; suas don chomhlacht &eacute; f&eacute;in a sh&aacute;samh go bhfuil an tiom&aacute;na&iacute; in ann tiom&aacute;int agus gur breithi&uacute;nas de chuid comhlachta n&oacute; dream n&oacute; eagra&iacute;ocht &eacute;igin &oacute; cheann go ceann a bheadh i gceist.  Is &eacute;ard a tharla&iacute;onn sa ch&aacute;s sin n&aacute; go ndeirtear leis an duine go gcaithfidh an cead&uacute;nas cu&iacute; a bheith aige n&oacute; aici &oacute;n dream sin a cheada&iacute;onn tiom&aacute;naithe agus mura bhfuil s&eacute; sin aige n&oacute; aici n&iacute; f&eacute;idir an jab a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh.  Deirtear leis n&oacute; l&eacute;i imeacht chuig an NDLS, an ch&aacute;il&iacute;ocht a fh&aacute;il agus a theacht ar ais.  Caithfidh s&eacute; a bheith mar an gc&eacute;anna leis an nGaeilge m&aacute; t&aacute;imid d&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  T&aacute; go leor for&aacute;lacha sa Bhille seo a bheadh go bre&aacute; ach m&aacute; theipeann orainn ar an bpointe seo bainfear an buan ar fad de na briathra sin, tr&iacute; gan bheart a dh&eacute;anamh de r&eacute;ir &aacute;r mbriathar.</p></speech>

The framework should be based on the Association of Language Testers in Europe, ALTE, framework with clear definitions of the meaning of the different levels of proficiency that are consistent, for example, between a Health Board and a Local Authority.  That would ensure consistency across the various sectors and facilitate bilingual workforce planning.   </blockquote> <p>Is &eacute; sin a bh&iacute; &aacute; mholadh ag Rialtas na Breataine Bige.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Eugene Drennan, president, Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA; Commissioner Gerry Harrahill, director general, customs division, and Ms Celine O'Neill, Brexit policy branch, Revenue Commissioners; Mr. Eoin Gavin, vice president, and Mr. Ian Barrett, director, Shannon Chamber of Commerce; and Mr. Paul Savage, assistant secretary, international trade and Brexit division, and Ms Hazel Sheridan, head of operations, Dublin Port, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I thank them all for facilitating this meeting at such short notice in these extraordinary Covid times.  In particular, I thank the departmental officials for attending as we only issued the invitation yesterday afternoon.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the statements are potentially defamatory, in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as enjoyed by witnesses who are physically present.  The witnesses participating in this committee session who are from a jurisdiction outside of this State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House campus.  In this regard, I ask all members that prior to them making their contribution to the meeting to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting online, Oireachtas members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chair, and the necessary staff essential to the running of this meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented Covid circumstances, and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask that everyone bears with us if technical issues arise.</p> <p>  This is a two-hour meeting based on Covid limitation.  I advise the witnesses that we have assigned five minutes for statements.  I ask them to keep to that and if their statements are longer, to give a summarised version.</p> <p>  I call Mr. Drennan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank him for taking us back in as he promised to do when I was here before Christmas.  I wish to also acknowledge another member of the committee, Senator Timmy Dooley.  He was the person to contact me originally.  I have tried to give him some information but the issue is quite complex with a lot of numbers and letters.  All of that may have left him further confused but I acknowledge his efforts.</p> <p>  I will now read our opening statement but I would like to give a foreword.  Other than what has been reported, the IRHA and hauliers are not trying to change, overcome or bypass the Brexit rules in any way.  We are looking to the enormous costs that are placed on hauliers and the cost of doing business now for Ireland that will have to be passed on and will end up with the consumer.  All of this is summed up in one word - costs.  We are at the forefront of it and are getting the brunt of it.  We are here to talk about how we do our business, and how we can streamline costs and get more efficiencies. </p> <p>  The new systems set up by the Revenue Commissioners for pre-boarding notification, PBN, new requirements for safety and security declarations, and import and export declarations, are not working effectively.</p><p>It is clear neither the Irish authorities nor industry took an opportunity to trial the new systems before they came into effect.  Consequently, the new systems have been overloaded and goods are being blocked and delayed.  Licensed hauliers, as carriers of the goods, have borne the brunt of these disruptions.</p><p> The information technology systems being employed by the Irish authorities are not working and require substantial revision to ensure they can be effective at clearing the backlog of goods stuck in the system and preventing such problems occurring again.  Currently, the system is being challenged at a time when import and export levels are lower than normal due to stockpiling before 31 December.  The systems will collapse entirely once trade volumes are restored to normal levels if something is not done.  It is deeply frustrating that despite the long lead-in to Brexit - a process now five years old - the systems and approaches being operated by the Irish authorities to manage post-Brexit trade are not fit for purpose and are actually frustrating rather than facilitating trade.</p><p> There are a number of specific measures that could be introduced to address the current crisis.  There must be co-ordination between the different systems being operated by the Irish authorities, as there are alarming indications that the systems - information technology and otherwise - being operated by the Revenue Commissioners, customs authorities and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are not working in tandem.  New protocols and procedures should be applied at the Irish ports to work with and support those involved in the transport of goods.  Currently there is very limited communication or information being provided and there is a distinct lack of engagement at all levels.</p><p> There should be a review of processes to address the imposition of unnecessary or repetitive checks on goods being imported to Ireland.  A risk-based approach to inspections is badly needed to prevent unnecessary blockages to the trade in goods.  There is a distinct lack of oversight of the operations of the different Irish authorities in the ports.  There is no central entity or office assessing how each of the Irish agencies is responding to Brexit and consequently the current problems being experienced are not being diagnosed and addressed.  Given the lack of preparedness of the Irish authorities for Brexit, some form of adjustment period will be required to allow them to get their systems and processes to work effectively.</p><p> Licensed hauliers must meet a plethora of new protocols and requirements to keep goods moving, including securing some or all of a master reference number, a pre-boarding notification identification, an entry summary declaration number related to safety and security, a transit accompanying document, an export safety and security declaration, customs checks, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine checks and HSE checks.  The systems are not speaking to each other and co-ordination and streamlining are absent.  The effective result is that the just-in-time model is virtually impossible to achieve for Ireland.  We will put ourselves into a position of a second world country within the EU if we do not take radical action to correct this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.857" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Harrahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012200002#C00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to brief the committee on the operation of customs checks since the end of the transition period on 31 December, including some practical aspects from a Revenue perspective on how matters have progressed with trade and business.  I hope it is helpful to the committee for me to give a clear picture of how goods are imported and the practical operation of customs formalities operated by Revenue and how that interacts with other State agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the HSE.</p> <p>  In a standard goods import from Great Britain since 1 January there are a number of parties involved.  These include the exporter on the Great Britain side and possibly the customs agent representing the exporter; the importer in Ireland and possibly a customs agent representing the importer; the logistics, freight forwarder or haulage business involved in actually moving the goods from Great Britain to Ireland; and the driver of the truck and the goods it contains, who boards the ferry and arrives, for example, in Dublin Port.</p> <p>  The key customs components are the export declaration on the UK side, the import declaration on the Irish side, the safety and security declaration on the Irish side and the Irish pre-boarding notification, process, which applies on both the UK and Irish sides and which effectively permits the truck and its goods to board the ferry.  All of these elements are critically dependent on data and their accuracy and timeliness.  Getting those data elements together means that all the players in the supply chain need to be aware of their specific role, have access to and be capable of providing that data at the right time and share this information so that declarations can be completed correctly and on time.</p><p>Any delay or disruption in that process impacts on key features of that integrated supply chain, including the ability to board a ferry or the driver's ability to leave the port immediately following disembarkation at the port of destination.  Since 1 January 2021 there have been 9,318 inbound freight movements across 250 ferries from Great Britain, involving approximately 668,000 declarations of various types.  In addition, approximately 61,000 export declarations for movements to Great Britain were processed.  All of these declarations have been successfully processed by Revenue's systems.</p><p> With the exception of specific notification requirements for certain sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, products, the interaction with other State agencies is driven by the work undertaken by Revenue in receiving and processing customs declarations, risk-assessing those declarations and giving one of three routings to the goods movement when it arrives in Ireland: green means it is good to leave the port; orange indicates that a documentary check or similar control will have to be implemented; and red means a physical examination or inspection of the goods involved is required.</p><p> Sophisticated IT systems have been developed between Revenue and the other agencies to allow for maximum information sharing, automated communications between the Departments, reuse of data in order to reduce duplication of effort by both business and State agencies and to allow as much work as possible to be done while the ferry is sailing and in advance of the arrival of the goods in Ireland.  Revenue's approach is to ensure that trade flows efficiently through the ports on arrival in Ireland and that where goods require any form of documentary or physical examination or other checks whether by Revenue or the other agencies, such interventions can be accommodated in the most efficient way possible.  The customs ro-ro service is key in supporting this approach by providing a direct channel of communication with the haulage sector which was not possible previously, by reusing data and thereby reducing the number of customs declarations required and by giving visibility to the multiple stakeholders at each step of the process before, during and after the ferry journey.  Based on engagement with the haulage representative groups, Revenue is exploring further ways to enhance this.</p><p> Additionally, the PBN process ensures that Revenue and other State agencies have full sight of all consignments on any given truck which allows the necessary work on risk-assessing those consignments to begin while the goods are still on the ferry.  Being able to do this work in advance allows Revenue to determine whether the consignment is red-routed, orange-routed or green-routed.  I am aware that it has been advocated that the PBN process should be scrapped.  Without the PBN process, which is a core element of the Revenue ro-ro service, 100% of goods movements arriving in Ireland would have to be red-routed rather than the position that we have achieved where more than 70% of consignments are being green-routed, allowing the goods to move directly from the ferry out of the port.  Anyone advocating the abolition of the PBN process and the customs ro-ro service is advocating that a hugely effective measure in facilitating the speedy movement of trade through our ports would be scrapped and replaced by a requirement that all goods movements would be presented to customs.</p><p> The critical infrastructure needed to be able to manage and process the flow of traffic through our ports and airports after 31 December is in place and operating as intended.  The relevant State agencies have been working together since 2018 to ensure not only that the infrastructure needed is in place but also that we have developed good working relationships and a streamlined approach to import controls.  That is evidenced by the introduction of the new IT systems referred to previously, the co-location at the State facilities in Dublin and Rosslare ports and the co-ordinated approach taken by operational staff on the ground.</p><p> I want to briefly mention the IT systems operated by Revenue.  I have already touched on certain elements such as declarations.  As Deputies and Senators will probably be aware, in line with the objectives of the Union customs code, completion of customs formalities is heavily dependent on IT processes and systems and so data accuracy and data timeliness are hugely important.  Revenue's IT systems have performed well and as intended.  The fact that a specific transaction is not accepted by Revenue's IT systems or cannot be processed is not a fault of the system if the data being submitted is incorrect or incomplete.  The solution must be one that involves compiling the required, correct data.  Revenue must have the necessary information to be able to carry out the risk assessment to which I referred and to make sure that declarations are valid and that goods requiring a documentary check or other processes can be processed efficiently.  There were two specific performance issues in relation to Revenue's customs systems and on those occasions, we notified trade and business, clarified what the fallback procedures were and restored the systems to full operation as quickly as possible.  We apologised for the inconvenience caused when this happened, and I repeat the apology today.  It should be noted that all declarations lodged into our import system during the performance issues were received correctly and were processed on resumption of the full system.</p><p> I will comment on the first three weeks of experience.</p><p>All of the State agencies recognise that the new trading arrangements with Great Britain represent the biggest change for trade and business since Ireland joined the European Economic Community almost five decades ago.  So far, we are seeing that exports to Great Britain are moving relatively smoothly.  In the context of imports, traffic movements overall into Ireland are down on previous years for the same period by approximately 20%.  Early indications suggest that freight or goods movement may be down further, possibly by up to 50%.</p><p> It is important to acknowledge that some businesses are successfully continuing to trade because their levels of preparation have been excellent and they addressed all of the challenges of the new trading environment well before of 31 December.  It is also clear that some businesses, large and small, are having difficulty, in some cases severe difficulty, adapting to the new system and controls.  We are seeing that, even in the case of significant international businesses the information required to complete the various declarations is proving very challenging because, in many instances, the effort required to assemble all the necessary information was underestimated.</p><p> We understand how being delayed is very frustrating for hauliers.  Our officials are talking daily to hauliers and drivers on the ground, and sometimes on an hourly basis.  It is particularly frustrating for hauliers who are dependent on either the importer, the exporter or their agent to fix shortcomings in documentation before the goods can be cleared and moved from the port.  In many of these cases as far as the haulier is concerned they have been stopped by customs systems.  We are actively working on how we can give the haulier greater visibility on what is causing the delayed movement on the ground.</p><p> I am aware of a view among some businesses that Revenue should set aside full compliance with the Union customs code, UCC, in part or in whole for a period of time while trade and business get to grips with the requirements.  This would carry with it serious consequences for the view taken by other member states of exports from Ireland and their automatic right to free circulation within the European Union.  Such an approach would be highly detrimental to Irish trade and business and to the Irish economy in general.</p><p> I am very happy to address any questions or concerns the committee may have.  However, I need to refer to the provisions of section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act and our duty of confidentiality in respect of any individual taxpayer.  Subject to that I will be very happy to address members' concerns and questions.</p></speech>

I am the owner of Eoin Gavin Transport, which operates across the 26 EU countries and into the Eastern bloc for the past 25 years.  I am delighted to get this opportunity to further expand on the contents of letters submitted by Shannon Chamber to Government Ministers and to our local elected representatives on 11 January in which we outlined issues being experienced in the movement of goods to and from the United Kingdom from businesses in the mid-west region.</p> <p>  Hauliers and freight forwarders, exporters and importers, expected that Brexit would result in some teething problems, as with any major change in our economy.  We accept that some exporters and importers must take some of the blame for the current delays being experienced by hauliers in transporting goods from Ireland to the United Kingdom and from the United Kingdom back to Ireland.  Some of the systems in place for trading also have procedural flaws, which need to be addressed.</p> <p>  We understand the requirement to complete an import and export declaration when trading with a third country and that a three-step process is now required on import for hauliers trading with the UK.  First they must prepare a customs declaration and get a movement reference number, MRN, or pre-clearance to ship.  They then need to complete an entry summary declaration, which is a safety and security declaration and which duplicates most of the customs entry detail in the previous declaration.  Third, they need to prepare a pre-boarding notification. PBN, which is permission to board a ship with the load.  This must incorporate all the MRNs.  Here lies the problem.  As these three layers are being completed, Revenue's systems try to tally and match them up in the background but this does not seem to be working.  In many cases this is resulting in one stage wiping out the other stage.  Also, the more entries one has to make the more likely there will be human error.</p> <p>  Why are the customs declarations and the security declarations not being combined for imports from the UK as is currently happening with Irish export declarations and as happens for exports from the UK to mainland Europe, which are also combined into one declaration?</p> <p>  I also question why the obligations under steps two and three have shifted to the operator and the haulier, and not to the carrier, which is the vessel and the ship, which is the requirement under the UCC that was brought in after 9/11.</p><p>There are other reasons for delays.  These relate to drivers getting notifications of the status of their goods - green, orange or red - before disembarkation from ferries at Irish ports.  The only way they can check this is by logging on to the Revenue website on their phones, or with a transport office doing it for them, and trying to create a routing.  There is an immediate need for routing status display screens on ferries to expedite the disembarkation process at our ports.<br/><br/>I will provide the committee with a practical example.  A truck going from London to Paris<b></b>with a load requires an export declaration.  This creates an MRN and a barcode.  The driver arrives at ferry in Dover and presents his papers with the MRN in order to check in.  The ferry company uploads the details and he can board.  On the ferry, the driver checks the display screen in the restaurant area to see which lane - green or orange - he needs to follow on disembarkation at Calais.  That is the process for exporting a load from London to Paris.<br/><br/>The same load going from London to Dublin<b></b>requires an export declaration.  This creates an MRN number and a barcode.  The driver&rsquo;s transport office needs to create a separate entry security declaration which has the same details as the export declaration.  This creates another MRN number and barcode.  The driver&rsquo;s transport office then needs to enter both MRN numbers on the Revenue website to get a PBN.  The office then needs to upload this to the ferry company#s website in order to confirm the booking.  The driver can then drive to the port to check in on the ferry.  Thirty minutes out from Dublin Port, the driver&rsquo;s transport office needs to enter the PBN number on the Revenue website to check which lane the driver needs to follow on disembarkation from the ferry at Dublin Port.  Members will agree that there is quite a contrast.<br/><br/>I am here today to request that these issues be followed up on and prioritised by Revenue as a matter of urgency because they are having a significant impact on the economy.  They will result in trade being stifled and in our export-led economy slowing down.  This matter requires urgent attention.  The solution must be executed as a priority.  We would ask that a timeline for action be provided as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

Additional administrative burdens are being placed on operators and State agencies.  All of those engaged in the trade and movement of goods have to acknowledge this reality an appreciate that these new arrangements are permanent.</p> <p>  In addition to the new customs requirements that have already been outlined, EU regulations require that certain types of consignments entering the EU are checked at specialised facilities called border control posts before being placed on the EU Single Market.  These are called SPS checks.  The consignments that have to be subjected to these checks are those consisting of animals, plants and plant and animal products, including food.  The purpose of these controls is to ensure that plants and animals, and products made therefrom, meet the food safety standards of the EU and do not pose a risk in respect of the introduction of plant or animal diseases that we do not have in the EU.  If they were introduced, they could have a devastating effect on the agri-food industry in Ireland and across the EU.  Foot and mouth disease is one such example.</p> <p>  The controls also ensure that products being imported have been produced to the same standards.  These controls are not new.  They have been in place since the Single Market was first created in 1993.  The difference now is that on 1 January, these controls came into force for consignments of plants, animals and plant and animal products coming from the UK, except Northern Ireland.  The requirement for these controls is not affected by the trade and co-operation agreement struck on Christmas Eve, so they are required in any event.</p> <p>  SPS controls consist of three types: documentary, identity and physical.  The frequency of SPS controls is laid down in EU legislation and member states do not have any discretion in that regard.</p><p> With some exceptions, consignments of plant and animal products, including food, coming from Great Britain must now be accompanied by a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian in the case of animals and animal products or by an official plant health inspector in the case of plants and plant products.  This includes consignments that may have originated from other non-EU countries.  On arrival at the port, certain products must undergo identity checks.  These checks must be carried out on all live animals and 100% of animal products.  Identity checks on plant products are carried out on a risk basis.  Identity checks can be of two types.  In the event that an official seal has been applied to a truck and the details are entered on the health certificate, the identity check will consist of a check of that seal.  If an official seal has not been applied, the identity check will need to involve unloading the truck to check the identity on the boxes or whatever packaging is involved, which will take longer to carry out.  Some commodities will also need to undergo physical checks.  The rates are related to the risk posed by the product and can vary from as low as 1% to as high as 100% depending on the exact nature of the consignment.</p><p> These checks will take time.  The European Single Market was created to enable borderless trade between members of the European Union.  The decision of the UK to leave the European Union means that this no longer applies to the border between Great Britain and the European Union and, as such, the border is now no different from the border that exists to the south and east of the European Union.  To treat this border differently from the other borders would fundamentally undermine the integrity of the European Union and the Single Market.  This is the single most significant change to agrifood trade flows between Great Britain and Ireland that has been seen since the Single Market was created in 1993.  As such, it presents a significant challenge for all stakeholders, including State agencies, in adjusting to this new reality.</p><p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is working closely with business operators to help them to adapt to this significant change.  Following the extensive engagement undertaken through a range of fora and communications channels in the period leading up to December 2020, we are continuing to assist operators with practical matters such as the submission of documents and the resolution of technical difficulties.  The Department has run nine webinars on a variety of topics to help all stakeholders to understand the implications of the UK now being outside the Single Market and customs union.  This series of webinars began in September 2019 and the most recent one was run last week in response to the immediate difficulties that have been experienced recently by business operators in complying with sanitary and phytosanitary requirements.  The webinar last week had more than 800 attendees and a recording of it, as well as all previous webinars, can be found on the Department's website along with advice on issues such as how to access the various IT systems that business operators now need to engage with, what health certificates are required for the different commodities and also what businesses can do to reduce the time that sanitary and phytosanitary checks in the ports will take.</p><p> The Department has given presentations on sanitary and phytosanitary requirements at various fora, including the Brexit stakeholder consultative forum run by the Department of Transport and our own Brexit stakeholder consultative committee, which has met regularly recently.  At all these presentations, stakeholders were advised that the sanitary and phytosanitary requirements would apply regardless of whether a free trade deal was concluded with the UK.</p><p> Regarding the experience since 1 January, in general, traffic has been moving well through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's inspection facilities at Dublin and Rosslare ports.  Throughput is still quite low compared with what we expected and are ready for following significant investment in new infrastructure, staffing and IT systems over the past two years in particular.  While the majority of agrifood businesses are making significant efforts to comply with the requirements for import into the European Union, there have been delays in some instances due to failure to provide advance notification, absence of health certificates and problems with health certificates.  It is not the responsibility of, for instance, the driver of the haulage company to ensure compliance with these requirements.  That is the responsibility of the importer or the person to whom the importer has delegated that responsibility.</p><p> I hope this gives members a good sense of the role and experience of the Department in the operation of new arrangements since 1 January.  My colleague, Ms Sheridan, and I are happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

We hope we have all the stakeholders today and that out of these discussions will come a system that people will understand better.  If the system requires amendment or tweaking, that should be done to ensure we continue to trade with and be connected to the UK.</p><p> I will move on to members.  The first speaker is Deputy Carey, who has seven minutes.  As we are on Microsoft Teams, I want the witnesses to know that the members will have a full seven minutes to put questions to them in a back-and-forth manner.

We would not be having this meeting if there was not a problem.  I have been contacted by a number of hauliers in respect of this issue.  As an island nation, trade - the import and export of goods - is of critical importance to us.  I was taken by the presentation from the vice president of Shannon Chamber in which he outlined an experience where he is exporting from London to Paris.  One normally encounters a very streamlined system there but when one comes back from London to Dublin one must get through layer upon layer of red tape.  It was expected that Brexit would throw up difficulties.  Mr. Gavin has highlighted those and the practical challenges faced by hauliers.</p> <p>  I would like to ask Mr. Harrahill the type of engagements that Revenue has had with the Irish Road Haulage Association.  I know that Revenue meets hauliers on the ground every day but what type of formal engagement has it had with the Irish Road Haulage Association?  What does he say to Mr. Gavin in terms of the system that is operating from, say, a third market, namely, the UK, to France?  What does he think of that streamlined system where a driver gets a single barcode, is assigned a place on a ship and then gets over to where he or she is going in comparison with the a huge blockage that exists in the Irish system?  Under our system, people have to enter barcodes.  That does not make sense.  It was said that it needs to be there and so on but why can it not be streamlined to make it easier to navigate around?</p> <p>  On the question Mr. Gavin posed about the role of the shipping companies operating the ferries, why is all of this being put upon hauliers?  Why do they have to deal with all of these issues?  Mr. Harrahill might respond on those questions first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.871" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Harrahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012200002#H00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will try to pick up on most or all of those.  In terms of the distinction between ourselves and the UK, I might invite my colleague, Celine O'Neill, to comment.  On the question of engagement, for the past three and a half or four years we have had extensive engagement not just with the haulage sector but with all relevant businesses through a number of fora.  First, we have a customs consultative committee which is broadly representative of all of the key stakeholders in terms of customs and customs formalities.  That would include the haulage industry, the freight forwarders association, the customs agents and the IT software providers.  That is a standing forum that has been in place for probably ten or more years in terms of a formal opportunity for engagement.  We have had very productive engagement, including with the Irish Road Haulage Association, through that forum in terms of signalling developments that were coming and plans around development systems and processes so that is in place.</p> <p>  The second element that has happened is that in the closer lead-up to Brexit a number of stakeholder fora have been put in place under the aegis of the Department of Transport.  Again, the Irish Road Haulage Association is represented on that.  We have had a very positive and productive engagement with the Irish Road Haulage Association.  As an example of that, I referred in my opening statement to some of the frustration for hauliers that we recognise in terms of their being caught in the middle.  They are moving the goods but they are not necessarily in charge of all the customs formalities.</p><p>One of the things that has come out of that is an opportunity for us to be able to give them greater visibility as to what precisely is giving rise to the delay, such as a truck or goods consignment being detained in Dublin Port and Rosslare.  That will help in terms of being able to identify it.  It is being described as a delay by customs.  The other thing that is hugely important is that the processes we have put in place are all designed to try to accommodate two critical requirements from our perspective.  One is that we are members of the European Union and are obliged to implement the provisions of the EU customs code which is effectively the legislation that governs the requirements.  We want to do that so that the confidence we want in other member states is readily available when Irish goods arrive in mainland Europe, and that we are in full compliance.  The second element is to do it in a way that tries to facilitate the legitimate trade.  I have spoken at probably 30 or 40 seminars with trade and business.  I always start by saying that our primary objective is to facilitate legitimate trade.  Everything we do is designed to try to do that.  We are trying to get balance with compliance with the legislation and the EU customs code and trying to facilitate trade in the best way possible.  </p><p> I will ask my colleague, Ms O'Neill, to take the members through the process as some of them have asked about the apparent difference between ourselves and France in the three declarations required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.873" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Celine O'Neill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012200002#J00200"><p>To clear up some confusion that can often arise in this regard, there are always two aspects to a customs procedure, namely the export formalities from the UK and then the entry formalities into the EU.  When exporting from the UK, an export declaration is needed combined with safety and security information.  It is possible for those two to be combined at export but it is not the same on import.  That is the first thing that always has to happen on the UK side.  For import into the EU, an import or transit declaration is always needed along with a safety and security declaration.  That requirement is the same whether the goods are coming back into the EU in France or in Ireland.  France has a system called SI Brexit which operates in a very similar way to our customs ro-ro system.  It allows declarations to be paired together and matched with a specific vehicle that is carrying those goods.  This is critical, particularly because a lot of groupage loads move backwards and forwards between the EU and the UK.  It gives the customs and other authorities the best opportunity to know precisely what goods are arriving and when they are going to arrive.</p> <p>  The method for pairing the information when going into France is slightly different from the method when coming into Ireland in that barcodes are scanned at the ferry terminal or port terminal for the short sea straits.  That is done by the ferry operator or the tunnel operator.  It has the potential to slow down significantly the boarding of the ferries.  What we have provided on our customs ro-ro service is an opportunity to do all that work before someone gets near to the ferry terminal, ensuring that the process of boarding the ferry is maintained as smoothly as possible.  We are in regular contact with our French counterparts who have been reporting the same challenges that we are noticing.  There are difficulties with the safety and security declaration - either no declarations are being made or the data is incorrect.  Some customers are trying to use the incorrect declaration types to move their goods - they are trying to use paper declarations rather than electronic declarations, or are using different documents that are not readily understood.  Some people are presenting the UK export declaration instead of the EU import declaration.  Again, they are reporting challenges on SPS products.  Despite what might have been heard, the challenges are the same in Ireland and in France, but they may be presenting themselves slightly differently.</p></speech>

As the last speaker said, we would not be here if there were no difficulties.</p><p> I am especially interested in focusing on the solutions, middle ground and opportunities for improving on the current situation.  I will say at the outset, as all other speakers have said, that there was no such thing as a good Brexit and it comes with hurdles that are impossible to avoid.  I hope we can agree that there are some hurdles that have been, at least in part, self-imposed and there is an opportunity to refine, improve or advance on those.  We have heard about replication and systems duplication and triplication.  We have heard that there are systems running in tandem and administrative and bureaucratic requirements associated with that.  I ask Mr. Harrahill, in the first instance, what he believes are the opportunities for improvement in these systems.  Does he agree that there is an opportunity?  What might that look like?  We have heard that he is of the opinion that we cannot scrap the preboarding notification, PBN, and that the introduction of a transition period might be detrimental.  Does Mr. Harrahill agree that there is room for improvement?  What might that look like?</p></speech>

Could I ask Mr. Harrahill to address the changes to the systems that are in place at his end?  Are there changes that can be made at his end?  I appreciate there is an element around education and familiarity with the systems that are in place.  What scope is there, if there is any, to improve or refine the systems that are in place at his end?  Is there scope to improve and align those systems in order to cut out duplication and replication, if they exist?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.878" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Harrahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012200002#K00400"><p>I do not believe that significant changes can be made to the core of the structure and framework that is there.  We are certainly open to refining and tweaking things as best we can.  I mentioned the education piece because I think that part of what is being described as a problem with the systems is capable of being addressed if we can get the knowledge and understanding piece right.  That was why I mentioned that particularly.  One of the things that we have done in recent days is to publish on our website a list of the common problems and errors that are happening.  We need to fast-track the learning process around that.  That is the first thing that I would say is hugely important.</p> <p>  I would describe the second important element as an integrated supply chain.  I say that because I think it is important that all of the players and individual components in the supply chain, including all the State agencies, understand the part and contribution they make.  There is information to which a haulier, for example, will not have access.  If a truck and driver are in the port and there is information that somebody else has to contribute to that, it is important to have that information.  We have taken some steps in the past couple of weeks to try to address some of those issues.</p> <p>  We are in constant and ongoing dialogue with all of the trade and representative bodies and the hauliers on the ground.  I can absolutely commit that if there is something we can do at a practical level that will contribute to an easement while at the same time respecting the fact that we have to implement the Union customs code, we will be happy to look at and examine that.  As an example, the suggestion that came from the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, in terms of being able to look up movement reference numbers, MRNs, is a practical example of our being more than willing and happy to do that.</p></speech>

He has heard the response from Mr. Harrahill and the various contributions from representatives of the Revenue and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Will Mr. Drennan outline the experience of red-routing of some of his members?</p><p>I have heard stories of individual drivers who are well into their 60s spending three and four days at ports in tractors that are not designed for overnight stays and having no access to toilets and basic facilities for washing and that sort of thing.  I ask Mr. Drennan to touch on some of the practical experience in that regard.  Will he also comment on the opportunities to improve systems and what he see as the appropriate forum for engagement in that regard.</p><p> Finally, I refer to the need for an adjustment period.  I raised this issue yesterday and received a response from the Minister to the effect that the adjustment period happened in 2020.  Is it fair to say that the IRHA is of the opinion that these systems came in immediately in January, that there has been no adjustment to them and that an adjustment period would be important?</p></speech>

There are links in the chain that were outlined and that are missing and that is why we have called for this.  I will address the matter of drivers first and then I move on to the other points.</p> <p>  Drivers come to different terminals.  They go in with their phones, leave their phone numbers and then they wait in no-man's land for information.  Much of that information has not been forthcoming as quickly as has been indicated and it is wrong that they cannot leave the terminals.  Customs will reply that a driver is allowed to leave the terminal - but he cannot leave without his truck.  Most of these are international drivers and everything they require for life is in their vehicles.  It is said that we can swap them in and out but we cannot do so as a result of Covid.  We cannot swap drivers in and out unless they live in Dublin.  A haulier from the country cannot have people running up the road to swap in and out.  If customs or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine want the goods, we will leave the goods with them and come back to collect them whenever they are finished doing whatever their due diligence is.  They are virtually keeping the drivers prisoner.  It is not good enough and it is not fair.</p> <p>  I turn to the way the system is working, particularly in the context of red-routing.  I will address the agriculture input first because that is causing some extra dimensions.  Mr. Savage very correctly outlined what has to be done.  When doing it, however, if a company is bringing up these declarations for agriculture and there is also a phytosanitary connection to it, a person has to carry out three uploads on the computer and make about six declarations.  A lot of the product that comes from agriculture is repetitive.  It will be the same product tomorrow as it is today.  Declarations cost money.  We are talking about the costs here and how it works.  The declarations at the start have caused food to be dumped.  They are probably saying that there is no food dumped in Ireland.  That may be but it was turned back and sent abroad.  The timeline has been missed and food has been dumped.  It goes to the core of Irish people, dating back to the Famine, that we do not want food to be dumped.  It is short-term life or just-in-time produce.  When we called for an easement, it was not possible to get one as the customs code had to be protected, yet Belfast has an easement on that type of ready-prepared food.  They also have one on the parcel-type service with DPD delivery.</p> <p>  Many people got caught out on this at the turn of the year because they had ordered stuff for Christmas and the backlog was so great that they did not get it.  They fell into the crack of being caught in the new system and they did not get their deliveries.  When they did, VAT, duties and whatnot were due on them.  This happened to such an extent that international freight people withdrew from the Irish market for a week because it was so bad.  That is on the parcel side.  Also, the major international freight agents got so frustrated, they withdrew from doing Irish-English work for three, four or five days.  They and their staff could not handle it because it was so cumbersome.  The system is correct; they are trying to do all their protocols.  I agree with that.  Even though we have had a great deal of engagement, as was indicated, the nature of that was to tell us what is coming down the line and what to do.  We did not see our involvement or our proposals reflected in the results.</p><p>Some of the stuff that was indicated to us never happened.  I wish to acknowledge the ladies from customs who participated in our engagements.  They battled hard and worked hard.  I am not going to name them but I would like to acknowledge them.</p></speech>

The first point is on the submission of declarations.  As we know, there are requirements similar to what is happening on the customs side relating to Union Customs Code requirements that have to be complied with.  The same applies on the SPS checks side in terms of agrifood goods.  There is a requirement to submit declarations for products coming in that have to be potentially checked in the port as they come through.  I will not comment in detail on how many documents are uploaded or how many checks are carried out.  I will leave that to Ms Sheridan.  She will come back on the detail relating to the information and data being supplied.</p> <p>  Another point was mentioned about easements.  It was said no easements are available in Dublin while they are available in Belfast.  The easement is being granted in the context of the overall agreement and the implementation of the protocol.  The easement relates to the movement of goods that are going directly from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.  These goods are going directly into retail outlets in Northern Ireland.  There are clear restrictions on how that easement works and the conditions attaching to it.  For example, they have to go directly to supermarket outlets in Northern Ireland.  They have to be labelled as such and the label must state they are not for consumption outside Northern Ireland.  They have to move as part of a dedicated channel or routing to those areas.  That is the purpose of the easement being granted in that case.</p> <p>  In a more general sense, other products coming in that are not specifically destined for Northern Ireland have the same checks applied to them as are applied in Dublin Port or Rosslare Europort on products coming from Great Britain.  That should clarify the point on easements.</p> <p>  More generally, from our perspective it is very much as Mr. Harrahill mentioned in terms of the room for manoeuvre as far as compliance with the Union Customs Code is concerned.  We have to comply with EU regulations on the implementation of SPS controls.  Our room for manoeuvre is limited and we have to comply.  A certain flexibility is built in for member states in applying a risk-based approach to the nature of the controls that have to be carried out.  We apply this approach where we can, but we have a responsibility to operate the controls properly and to maintain the integrity of the Single Market.  Our objective at all times is to do so in a way that continues to facilitate trade.  We will continue to do that, including through engagement with hauliers and others where we have experienced difficulties in the submission of documents and otherwise.</p> <p>  A question on the submission of documents was raised as well.  Mr. Drennan referred to the number of uploads or documents that have to be submitted in the case of SPS checks.  I will ask Ms Sheridan to explain a little more on that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.889" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Hazel Sheridan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012200002#M00800"><p>I am happy to provide clarification for committee members on SPS checks and controls.  There are two major controls.  There is a requirement in EU legislation for the operator responsible to submit advanced notification.  This is not necessarily the haulier.  It is the person responsible for the importation.  It could be the importer or someone to whom the importer delegates that responsibility.  That is an EU system and it is an obligation.  We have no discretion in that regard.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has built an internal information technology system designed to facilitate industry.  The key facilitation in this system is that it enables importers to upload the health certification in advance.  The advantage of that is twofold.  The first is that for certain types of commodities, principally plants and plant products, this will allow for the checks to be carried out on the documentation in the system.  Those consignments, therefore, will not have to stop in the port.  To date, we have not had businesses making use of that system to the maximum extent.  We will work with businesses to encourage them do so.</p> <p>  The second advantage of uploading documentation to the system and providing advance notification is that it enables us to see what is coming in.  We can see if there are problems with what is coming in and then liaise with the operators responsible before the trucks arrive in the port.</p><p>None of us wants to be trying to resolve problems when the trucks are in the port because that leads to delays and it is the hauliers who suffer in those instances.  Again, it is very important that we know who is responsible for these imports and that they engage with us.  We are there 24-7 to provide support and are very keen for people to get in contact with us.  We are prepared to work with them to resolve any issues.</p></speech>

I am particularly taken with what Mr. Drennan and Mr. Gavin said because, quite frankly, they have first-hand experience through their individual operations and the network of hauliers.  While I accept that Revenue and the State generally have done everything they can to assist trade and business, it is often the case that those who will encounter the greatest difficulty are the hauliers on the ground because the practical manifestation of the rules that govern are theirs to try to address.  They will be coming under pressure from their customers, often with a lack of full appreciation of what is involved in the minutiae of crossing these frontiers.  I am surprised to some extent because Revenue has been a leading light in terms of developing its online systems.  For quite some time, the Revenue online service, ROS, has been rightly held up for all sorts of awards and credits for being way ahead of other Departments and indeed countries.  It is to be hoped Revenue will be able to find a resolution through some technological advancements or investment in that area that will provide the kind of solutions.  In particular, Mr. Gavin has pointed out some of this work can be done or some of their problems can resolved through better use of technology.  I would be interested in seeing how that might advance.  Will Mr. Harrahill tell me where he sees some solutions that might come forward in that regard?</p> <p>  I know Mr. Harrahill indicated that Revenue met different players.  Perhaps as an outcome of this meeting, at a minimum, Revenue and the Irish Road Haulage Association would get together in some formal way in the next week or so to try to thrash out, insofar as they can, some of these problems and communicate back to the committee because there is no point in us all going away today when the problem remains.  Revenue might write back to the committee to give us some information about what might happen at such a meeting and if issues have been resolved.</p> <p>  A number of hauliers have contacted me regarding goods transiting through the UK.  Switzerland was given to me as an example.  So many tonnes of goods go through Switzerland.  There are certain green routes based on the fact that the goods are not for distribution or breakage within Switzerland and it is just passage through.  Can the same kind of solution or system be found to allow goods to make it to Ireland effectively through the UK system?</p></speech>

In terms of technology and IT investment, close to 100% of the potential that is there in the way the customs system operates is based around IT.  This is not just the situation in Ireland.  Practically the entirety of customs movement across the EU is supported very directly by significant investment in IT.  There is an ongoing programme of implementation of the modernised Union Customs Code and there is a significant programme of investment across all EU member states between now and 2025.</p><p>A very heavy part of that is investment in technology.  There is an acceptance across the EU and at European Commission level that Ireland is at the forefront in that regard, just to give the committee the assurance that we are always looking at the opportunities to put IT supports and solutions in place.  That is exactly what drove our approach to the investment surrounding the customs ro-ro service to try to automate as much of it as possible and, as I said, to try to avoid all goods arriving in Ireland having to be presented to customs, which was the situation before 1992.  That is exactly what used to happen.  Every item that came into the country had to be presented at customs.  Thankfully, we are outside of that now and, as I said earlier, over 70% is currently getting green-routed.</p></speech>

There was the old system, called AEP.  The Revenue Commissions have two systems and have not extinguished one before the start of the other, which is called AIS.  Some people have fallen into the cracks between the two systems.  That development was not done.  It was not turned on in time.  It was turned on only in November, and 24 December, Christmas Eve, or 23 December - whichever - and then there was some other part of it on 28 December, and it is supposed to work.  We have been five years getting ready for Brexit and we are a year late.  If this investment was made, the questions that have to be asked are why it was not ready, why it was not tried and tested and why we are having the glitches.  I agree with what Mr. Harrahill has said: there is this checking and looking to the new system in Europe.  It is light years away.  This is what we need.  We should have had it by now.  We have been five years at this.  We should have the new system that combines and streamlines all of Europe.  We should have it now.  This connectivity fund or the &euro;2 billion that is coming or whatever it is that is coming should be moved forward and should be in by next year or the year after because Ireland is suffering without it.</p></speech>

To pick up and finish off on the issue of the technology and the two import systems in place, big IT programmes take a significant investment and a lead-in time.  We were already engaged in a new import system called AIS before the British Government and the British people decided to leave the Single Market.  What we had, therefore, was an unfortunate coincidence of a new system being introduced at the same time as Brexit coming a couple of weeks later.  Specifically, and just as a demonstration of our responsiveness, our very strong encouragement to businesses was, if they were investing in technology for the first time, to invest for AIS because that is where the future will be.  Specifically, at the request of trade and business, we extended the duration of the old or the existing AEP system.  That was an example of the responsiveness of Revenue to practical difficulties that were arising for trade and business.</p><p>We have had significant uptake for the automated import system, AIS, in recent months.</p><p> Senator Dooley asked a question specifically around transit.  It is important to explain that there is a common transit convention to which all EU member states, as well as the UK, are parties.  Goods coming from mainland Europe through the UK to Ireland generally come under the transit convention.  The whole idea behind it is that we recognise end-to-end transactions.  The amount of interaction required with the party in between is limited.  The Irish authorities, including Revenue and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, are specifically ensuring that when goods move from Ireland to mainland Europe, our European colleagues do not take a view that because the goods have transited through the UK, they have any less standing in the EU.  We have invested heavily to achieve that in terms of commitment and engagement.  I must acknowledge the significant support we have received from our European colleagues to ensure goods transiting are not placed at a disadvantage compared with goods that go direct.  Obviously, there are delays but we have made significant investment regarding the standing of the goods and the way they are treated and viewed and it has been successful.</p></speech>

The meeting between the Irish Road Haulage Association and Mr. Harrahill and his colleagues will be most important.  It needs to take place early next week.</p> <p>  An issue is coming up with many of the hauliers.  My understanding is that every product in a container on a truck requires a master reference number.  A haulier may be transiting or taking goods for a large number of suppliers.  If the MRN or customs documentation for one of the goods is not correct, the truck will be pulled in and checked at the port, causing major delays.  Hauliers operate a just-in-time model in their dealing with suppliers in the UK and customers in Ireland and the UK.  Will Mr. Harrahill explain this to me?  Am I correct in that?  Mr. Harrahill stated 70% of trucks are not checked and are green-routed.  Are the other 30% checked on the basis of problems with MRNs?  Let us suppose a haulier has a container with goods for 50 customers and one batch of goods has not been put through properly and the MRN is not correct.  If the truck is pulled in for checking at the port, it has major time implications.  Will Mr. Harrahill deal with that particular point on the practicality?  Mr. Drennan might then comment on whether I am correct in my analysis.</p></speech>

One of the challenges in the new trading environment is that, as the Chairman correctly pointed out, we can have a truck with 50 consignments for 50 different customers.  In the case of 49 of the customers, the particular consignment may be green-routed but the remaining consignment may be red or orange-routed.  That means the entire truck and its contents will be delayed while the issue is resolved.</p> <p>  We have consistently pointed out to those in trade and business the importance of understanding that groupage loads carry with them a risk that, for example, one consignment out of 50 could cause an entire load to be delayed.  We have suggested in our seminars, as have colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, that businesses think about the goods that are more likely to get a risk routing compared with others.  Let us suppose someone mixes sanitary and phytosanitary products with general groupage.  Clearly there is a greater likelihood of that consignment being delayed than a general groupage consignment.  That is one practical element.</p><p> The second element, which I touched on in my opening statement and which may be worth repeating, is that we have made available a facility for hauliers to be able to look up the MRNs for all the consignments that are on the truck and they will know whether it is one consignment or ten consignments that are giving rise to the difficulty.  It is an issue that will still have to be resolved but, for example, if one has an unaccompanied load in Dublin Port, rather than turning up to collect it when there are three consignments that are still red routed, one knows, from an economic point of view, that if one wants to collect a load that has been green routed, one can go down, collect it and leave the port without difficulty.  I hope that practical element of providing visibility in respect of the MRNs will be of considerable assistance to hauliers.</p></speech>

Have the changes Mr. Harrahill mentioned made a difference?</p></speech>

They would have made a little difference.  Having a haulier check up to see which consignment would cause difficulty means the haulier must be on guard 24-7.  That is not possible.  If we or the declarant got notification of the consignment with which there is a difficulty and did not have to look it up, it would be far easier.  To give the Chairman an example of how it works, the Port of Rotterdam just put up notification yesterday of how it will handle it.  It has a platform of continuous information as to where the routing is, how it is going and when it will be ready.  It goes to everybody involved - the declarant, the haulier and the driver.  The truck driver does not need to come near the port until it is cleared.  They do not have lock up and keep away in that instance.</p></speech>

They should surely be easily identified and a simplified system could be put in place for them, which would ease up matters in respect of the system.</p></speech>

When the Department officials were clarifying matters, they forgot to tell the Chairman that in Ireland they are looking for 24 hours' notice whereas the officials in Belfast are looking for four hours' notice.  In Europe and UK, the requirement is four hours' notice.  It is not as simple or as easy for the haulier to keep them notified in Ireland.</p></speech>

Mr. Harrahill, rather than hauliers having to go up and check, is there a system whereby Revenue could notify them?  Can Mr. Savage address the point about the 24 hours' notice period that is required to be provided in Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>that required by our counterparts in the North and across Europe?  I call Mr. Harrahill first.</p></speech>

In our ongoing experience and engagement with trade and business, as we are seeing issues which we would describe as common causes of difficulty.  We are publishing details of those and providing information on the possible causes and some of the solutions.  It is an important part of our ongoing role and responsibility to educate, support and help business to get the thing right.  I will ask Ms O'Neill to comment specifically on the MRN issue.</p></speech>

To address the point Mr. Drennan raised about the system introduced yesterday at, I believe, the Port of Antwerp, it is possible for those things to happen at Antwerp and Rotterdam because there are port community systems in operation there that are not in operation at Dublin Port.  We have already engaged with the Dublin Port Company on the possibility of introducing something similar in Ireland.  Those systems allow the involvement of multiple stakeholders.  It is clear from all the interventions today that there are many different stakeholders each responsible for different aspects of the movement and each entitled to different pieces of information that we cannot share outside of who is entitled to receive it.  These systems allow the stakeholders to see the information they are entitled to see without confidentiality being breached or data protection issues arising.  It is something we are actively pursuing to see if we can introduce it in Ireland.</p></speech>

Finally, Mr. Savage might address the 24-hour notice in Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>four hours in the UK and mainland Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.919" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Savage" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012200002#R00200"><p>I thank the Chairman.  As I said at the start, from our point of view our imperative here is to facilitate trade as best we can and move product through the port as quickly as possible.  The notification period is there to try to facilitate that and make sure we can essentially speed up the process for everybody who is using the port and to try to minimise the kind of problems we have been seeing over the first two to three weeks, for instance, in terms of people getting used to the new arrangements.  It is an important point, therefore, because it allows the trade, operators and users to use and engage with the system much more effectively.  It speeds up checks at the port.  As Ms Sheridan mentioned, it means we can clear certain consignments in advance if we have all the documentation with us and we are happy that everything is okay.  We can green route consignments through the port immediately, again, reducing people's delays or interaction with any services in the port.</p> <p>  The third point is that from our perspective, we found that even among existing third country trade, approximately two thirds of all problems are caused by documents and notifications not being in order.  To be honest, from our perspective and from the user's perspective, it is much better, therefore, if those documentary errors and issues can be sorted in advance so they do not have to be investigated in the port and delay people.  Approximately two thirds of those we have experienced up to now in third country trade have those kind of documentary issues.</p></speech>

First, I am speaking from LH2000 within the Leinster House campus.  It has been said that we are all here because there is a problem.  We knew there were going to be problems as regards Brexit.  Some may have been foreseen, to a degree, but I believe we are dealing with a situation with systems that could not be tried and tested beforehand.  We have the switch from the automatic identification system, AIS, we have people operating paper systems, multiple IT systems, the manual transfer of movement reference numbers, MRN, and so on, and that all causes problems.</p> <p>  I would like to deal initially with the fact, as I believe has been said, that it is absolutely vital we have the stakeholders-----</p></speech>

The fact is that many companies in Britain that are exporting have not made the preparations that have been made here and we are all suffering, particularly hauliers.</p> <p>  We need something done about systems.  I accept Mr. Harrahill said there are difficulties with just how far we can go with regard to a leeway period or whatever but there are definite difficulties.  Groupage is a problem in the sense that the entire business model has probably changed for many hauliers.  I would like Mr. Drennan to lay it out because we would be under much more pressure only for the fact that there has been significant stockpiling.  That is the reason a reduced number of people are transferring.  I am led to believe, however, that hauliers operate on small margins, within approximately 4%.  Therefore, with the added costs regarding the systems, hold-ups and all these factors there are major issues.  My worries are, first, that hauliers will go out of business and at a point in time when we fix all these systems, they will not have capacity to stay in operation.  Haulage firms will not be there to pick up the slack when it is necessary.  Could Mr. Drennan deal with that, please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.928" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eugene Drennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012200002#R01100"><p>Yes, indeed.  As the Deputy noted, we had a protest yesterday in Dublin and hauliers not too far from his area were in it.  The level of problems is so high now that a number of them are shipping empty trailers back to Ireland from England to try to service the export volume but that cannot be sustained.</p><p>If something is not done and unless it is streamlined quickly, hauliers will go out of business.  I am speaking about the system and not changing the rules.</p><p> There was massive stockpiling and we will see this disappear quickly.  On the other side, Ornua is a major exporter of food from here and it has massive warehousing in the north of England.  England will kick in its own rules and regulations in a couple of months' time.  We have huge business with it and we do not want it to see us as being overcumbersome and overburdensome.  We still have to trade with the UK.  We have to try to find some way to do it in as streamlined a way as possible.  If the UK comes back and kicks us in the teeth, our exports will be in serious trouble, as will farming.</p><p> To get a feel for how it is out there, when anyone thinks about the supply line, we immediately think of the shop shelf but across the board in industry and services, people are having difficulty getting parts.  There is not a garage in the country that is not short of parts or slow in getting in the parts.  Every sector of haulage is affected, whether people have groupage, pallet or singular loads and whether it is parcel delivery or bulk delivery.  It is evidently not working and it needs urgent immediate addressing.  This is why I again call on Deputies to support me.  We need an independent overviewer.</p><p> We are telling the Deputies all about different numbers and all about new systems that are all new to us.  They are a necessity for the customs code.  What has been said here about the customs code is that it is similar to dealing with outside EU countries, perhaps such as Hungary, Iran, Iraq or Russia.  We have an agreement and it has to be matched into the customs union code.  Singular loads should simply be transferred.  The simplicity can be brought in, even to the customs union.  I do not pretend to know absolutely anything about the big bible of the customs union but surely if there is an agreement, some of this can be simplified.  We need action.</p></speech>

Something else that has been said by many hauliers, and it was alluded to here earlier, is that in a groupage situation there may be one particular problem that may relate to one movement reference number, MRN, but hauliers could be waiting three or four hours or more before they find this out.  Mr. Harrahill has spoken about the need to offer this information.  I accept there may be GDPR problems but we need to find what means will be used and how quickly this will happen from the point of view of being able to tell hauliers where the problem is in order that they can at least play a part in sorting it out and moving on the goods.  Again, we are getting away with some of this on the basis we do not have the regular numbers yet due to stockpiling.</p></speech>

The agreement had the very important benefit of dealing with the question of tariffs, in particular with regard to UK originating goods.  Essentially, all of the other pieces were already very clear that customs formalities would apply.  In all of our engagement with trade, we made this very clear from the very start.  It is very important that everybody understands this.</p> <p>  Another part of the question was with regard to giving greater visibility.  We have just put this in place in the past week for hauliers.  It is particularly beneficial in that if people know they have three different consignments on a truck and they are not clear whether all of these have cleared or not, then by looking up the MRN facility that we have now made available, they will know whether they are red, green or orange routed.</p><p>It will not necessarily solve the problem if they are red or orange routed, but at least it will mean a driver will not turn up to collect an unaccompanied trailer when something is clearly not ready to leave the port.  That is already in place.  One of the options we are looking at is to see how we can build on that and if there is anything else that we can do to provide greater transparency and information to the haulier without, as Ms O'Neill stated, breaching commercial sensitivity on some of these issues.</p></speech>

I welcome this meeting, which I believe was necessary.  The presentations have been concise and precise.  I am sure everybody is acting in good faith.  The reason the meeting is necessary is that in recent weeks we have heard contradictory statements in the media and in the D&aacute;il.  Today's meeting is useful in that it clarifies some of the issues that have been raised.  In a simplified way, Ministers, and everybody who is commenting on behalf of the Government and Government agencies, are saying that the transport providers, in particular the hauliers, are not educated in the new system and are not prepared for it and as a consequence they are making errors which are causing the delays.  Revenue is taking every opportunity to tell everyone who cares to listen that Revenue is not the problem and it is blaming the industry.  Today, we hear practical examples of what has happened.  What surprises me is that neither the industry nor the authorities trialled the system before it was up and running.  We must be conscious of the fact that people did stockpile.  I see it in business every day.  All the major groups have stockpiled.  I would like Mr. Harrahill to address Mr. Drennan's statement that the stockpiling is coming to an end and therefore we will have far more transactions and activity.  Mr. Drennan stated that once trade volumes are restored to normal levels the systems will collapse entirely.  Does Mr. Harrahill agree with that?  Is there any danger whatsoever of that actually happening?</p> <p>  I feel great sympathy for the hauliers.  As everyone said, Brexit was on the way and we were warned about it, but it is surprising that given that we had five years to prepare, we are still not prepared.  The IT issue needs to be resolved one way or another.  The reason I have sympathy for hauliers is that the procedures are complicated, complex, cumbersome and time consuming.  According to the hauliers, they are unacceptable as an overhead.  Listening to everybody here today the only conclusion that I can come to is that it is a spaghetti junction of bureaucracy.  It is mad to think that the UK system for clearance is simpler and easier than our system and that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  Could we get a direct answer on the necessity for independent oversight and verification of the IT system?  We are talking about moving from 2 million transactions to 20 million and the question arises as to whether the system is capable of carrying the additional load.  Do we have the trained expertise in the public sector or in the private sector to handle the expected volume of transactions and activity?  If trade slows down, it is lost and if we lose trade, the economy suffers.</p><p>It has been suggested to us as public representatives that after the events of 11 September 2001, the European Union introduced directives or legislation on a security declaration.  The arrangement placed a requirement on third countries trading into the EU, meaning that the carrier was to bear responsibility regarding the proceedings.  The carrier, in this instance, is an aircraft or a vessel.  How did it arise that the ferries came to an arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners that effectively transferred the IT and administrative obligations to the hauliers and factories?  It has been suggested that an agreement was reached to the satisfaction of the ferries and that it added a greater burden to the transporters, particularly the hauliers.</p></speech>

I will try to pick up on all the issues he raised.  As the director general for customs in Ireland, I am in no circumstances blaming anybody for the challenges we face at the moment.  I mentioned in my opening remarks that we are in circumstances that have not arisen since before Ireland joined the European Economic Community almost 50 years ago.  While all of us said at various stages that Brexit would be challenging, we now realise it has been challenging, and a bit more to go with it.  The only way to deal with the practical difficulties that a number of Deputies and Senators referred to is a collaborative approach involving the State agencies and all the key stakeholders.  That is in the interest of everybody whose motivation is to ensure we keep our good standing within the EU at the same time as allowing legitimate trade and business to go ahead.</p> <p>  On the second issue, namely, trialling the system, with the exception of the customs ro-ro service, all the components for import and export to a third country effectively have been in place for many years.  What has brought a particular focus with the UK's departure is that our nearest neighbour is now a third country.  Therefore, the just-in-time business model that has worked so successfully is severely challenged by the fact that we have trade with a third country right on our doorstep.  That has brought some unique features.  Many of us who have been involved in this process over recent years probably have been aware of this matter but it is really a case of rubber hitting the road in that regard.</p> <p>  On Deputy Lowry's question on whether we have the expertise and knowledge to handle the systems, the answer is "Yes".  We have invested considerable time, energy, expertise and knowledge to ensure we are ready to handle the volumes resulting from Brexit.  I remind members that since 1 January, or in the first 21 days, we have processed 668,000 customs declarations successfully.  Where we did not manage to process declaration successfully, it was not because the system by and large has not worked but because some of the core information and data have not been available.  I am not attributing blame to anybody; I am just saying it is a fact and that there is work we can do in that regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.941" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Harrahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012200002#U00400"><p>On an ongoing basis, we examine each IT project and IT systems development, in both the early and more mature stages, to make sure it is operating as intended.  On the question on an external review, we have not had one directly but it is important to state that our customs systems are subject every year to a review by the European Court of Auditors.  It looks into whether we collected all the customs duties that were properly due and payable.  Every year, we get a positive bill of health.  Obviously, issues are flagged on occasion.</p><p>Our core systems are looked at annually by the European Commission and European Court of Auditors.  All of our systems, not just our customs systems, are subject to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General at any time.  I have no difficulty with any of those processes running to provide confirmation about what we are doing.</p><p> I ask my colleague, Ms O'Neill, to address Deputy Lowry's question on the safety and security declaration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.943" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Celine O'Neill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012200002#V00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question about safety and security.  As he said, it is a requirement for third countries and specifically relates to concerns about preventing international criminal organisations, weapons of mass destruction and such issues.  Unfortunately, the UK did not want to be part of the EU's safety and security zone, so there is no possibility of not requiring that declaration.  The legal responsibility for the submission of that declaration rests with what is known as the "carrier".  As the Deputy pointed out, with an airline, the airline would be the carrier, but it is not as straightforward with a roll-on, roll-off vessel.  When a vehicle is accompanied by a driver, the mode of transport is legally considered to be that vehicle and, therefore, the carrier is the haulier or the haulage company.  For unaccompanied trailers, the legal responsibility rests with the ferry operator.  Any carrier that has the legal responsibility to provide that declaration can pass that responsibility on to another person in the supply chain.  Where the ferry operators have done that, it is because they were legally entitled to do so but it would not alleviate the requirement for the haulage sector to provide declarations about accompanied vehicles.  That should clarify who has those responsibilities and how they can be fulfilled.</p></speech>

Were customs officials and Revenue working with the road hauliers?  Had they done trial runs with trucks?  It seems to me that if it was wargamed, it was not wargamed correctly.  If it was not wargamed, why not?  There was a feeling around here that it was never going to happen but we all knew it was going to happen and we find ourselves in a bit of a mess.  Were the road hauliers, at any stage, brought in and run through processes so that they would have an idea of how things would go?  If not, perhaps customs and Revenue officials can explain why not.</p></speech>

I would not call it a consultation.  We were told what was coming, how we were to go about it and what we had to do.  We do not feel that we were consulted.</p> <p>  The previous speaker referred to ships and the safety and security declaration.  In the declaration, under the customs union, customs officials have been strict about telling us that the carrier of the load is the registered number of the ship.  If the carrier under the Union Customs Code is the registered number of the ship, why does the truck owner now have to take responsibility for the safety and security declaration?  If we are the carriers of the load, the truck's trailer should be the identifier.</p><p>In these systems if one does not put in the correct ship registered number and one travels on a different ship, which happens regularly, that triggers a check.  One will have to go through the process of being checked.  Also, one has to amend the declaration.  If one does not get checked in Dublin, one must amend it within four days.  That is yet another declaration and uploading.  That is part of the cumbersome method.</p><p> In addition, I wish to cover something that was said a minute ago, and I believe we have a breakthrough here with Mr. Harrahill.  I agree with him.  It is a collective approach, but the agreement has allowed us to identify what is GB product and Irish product.  If the agreement allows us to do that, all of that product surely could come into a simpler system.  This is why we need an independent person from business to try to tie these systems with customs' other system relating to what they do themselves.  Agriculture has its system relating to what it does itself.  The issue is the tie-up, the connectivity and to simplify it.  If the agreement allows identifying the product, surely the system of taking that product could also be simplified.</p></speech>

You might deal with the points raised by Senator Craughwell and those followed up by Mr. Drennan.  You might also deal with a previous question from Deputy Lowry, taken up by Mr. Drennan, which was why, if they are making declarations, they must put in the reference to the ferry, yet the hauliers are regarded as the carrier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-01-22a.949" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Harrahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021012200002#W00300"><p>I will respond on those issues.  First, it is important to refer to yesterday and the comment of Michel Barnier, when he was getting his award, that the consequences of Brexit are that the full application of all the rules and regulations that apply to a third country apply to trade with Great Britain.  He was unequivocal about that in his response.  That is worth having as the line in the sand as to what we can and cannot do.</p> <p>  The second element is that you and Senator Craughwell asked a question about the IT systems.  I will explain briefly what we have done.  In preparation for January, we had a comprehensive programme of testing drawn up, undertaken and completed not just of the Revenue Commissioners' systems but also the interaction between ourselves, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the health and safety executive of the HSE.  We built the substantial work, including capacity modelling that was undertaken across the transition period.  It included items such as systems testing, traffic flow simulations and management, physical testing around our sites and, ultimately, the integration of all of those elements.</p> <p>  Full end-to-end testing of the customs systems before 1 January was not possible simply because the UK did not become a third country until 11 p.m. on 31 December.  The opportunity to have a type of play time with the new system simply was not possible.  That is why we put so much effort and focus on the trade and business engagement programmes, going through all facets of the customs formalities and trying to explain to business, including through practical examples, how those customs formalities apply and what they would mean for the different players and actors.  Even today, if any of the members wish to go onto the Revenue Commissioners website, they will see a series of webinars that take them through the full spectrum.  I believe there are 16 separate webinars available.  There are journey maps that simply take people through some practical examples.</p></speech>

When the peak volumes kick in when supplies are used up, will the system be robust enough, apart from the cumbersome nature which I hope will be addressed in the meetings between the Revenue Commissioners with both the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine early next week?</p><p>Will the system be able to take the volumes of declarations that will be going through it?  Has Revenue road tested that in a simulated way for the volumes that will go through?  Mr. Harrahill referred to the number increasing from 2 million to 20 million.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I acknowledge that Ms O'Neill admitted that the French have a different system.  I appeal to the committee and Revenue to look at the French system.  The flow of traffic between the UK and the Common Market is now easier than the flow of traffic between Ireland the Common Market.  That should not happen.  The UK is still our biggest trading partner.</p> <p>  If anything is to come out of this meeting, I hope it will be that Revenue will look at the French system.  It has admitted that the French system is different.  I appeal to Revenue to look at and case test that system.  My business and my customers' businesses have case tested it this week.  We have a driver who loads in London every week and delivers in Brussels.  I have not spoken to him in four days.  We have a driver who loads in London and delivers in Shannon and my staff are on the telephone to him 24-7.  There are five administrative steps to bring a load from London to Shannon.  There is one administrative step to bring a load from London to Paris.  I appeal to the Revenue not to reinvent the wheel but to look at the French system and see what technology France has used.  It is all about technology.</p> <p>  That will link back to the role of the ferry companies.  All they need to do is have the technology at the check-in.  The ferry from Holyhead sails every four hours.  The ferry from Dover to Calais sails every ten minutes.  It is not about holding up traffic in a ferry port.</p></speech>

The European Union customs code is very clear on who the carrier is.  Where it is an accompanied vehicle moving on a ferry, the mode of transport is considered to be the vehicle, that is, road, and therefore the responsibility rests with the carrier.  What Mr. Drennan is confusing that with is the other requirements on a customs declaration to identify the vessel on which the vehicle is moving.  There are different elements that must be included on a customs declaration.  Each is required independently of the other and they should not be confused with the legal responsibilities surrounding the requirement to provide a declaration.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presence today.  Everybody seems to be making contradictory statements.  The important point is that there is consultation.  If we get anything from today's meeting, it should be that there needs to be real consultation and engagement.</p> <p>  Does Revenue accept the statements of the hauliers that there are disjointed custom and clearance systems which have been creating crippling delays in trade?  Given the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the D&aacute;il yesterday about the new realities of Brexit, can we have real engagement and consultation to iron out such matters?</p><p>We accept our new reality but such concerns cannot be allowed to continue to obtain.

It would make sense for it to happen with the agencies - ourselves, Revenue and possibly the HSE - talking to the association about these matters.  As Mr. Harrahill has said, there has been very close collaboration between all the agencies on information technology systems and operational arrangements on the ground.  That will continue and it would be very useful for the IRHA to engage with the agencies on a joint basis.  We are happy to facilitate that.</p> <p>  We must emphasise the point that it is appreciated that the hauliers and drivers can sometimes be caught in the middle because of the way controls must be applied.  It would be useful in the hauliers' engagement with operators in the industry to get the message across to customers and companies moving goods that they must supply the correct documentation to customs and department officials.  They must be able to meet the requirements.  If companies can ultimately supply information to us in an accurate manner, the burden falling on hauliers and drivers would be far less.</p></speech>

I am asking for an independent review of these processes.  I remind the committee that the State has gotten into such a mix with self-policing in many public bodies.  Any of the big problems we have had, whether with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other institutions, arose because the entities were self-policing.  We need an independent chairman if we are to come to the table because we feel that we were not consulted before this.  Perhaps the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts could get involved because this is about costs.  It is about costs for the hauliers, in the first instance, and for the country.</p></speech>

We will take it that the IRHA will invite the other parties to a meeting early next week.  I ask that the witnesses report back to us on what we can do and on whether the processes are working.</p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses for attending today and engaging with the committee.  We will have a private meeting at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, 26 January and our next public meeting is scheduled for Friday, 29 January.</p></speech>
