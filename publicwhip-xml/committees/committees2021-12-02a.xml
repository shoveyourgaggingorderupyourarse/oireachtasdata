    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120200002#A00600"><p>I welcome everyone to the meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.  Unfortunately, this week we had a bit of a step backwards but hopefully this will not be for too much longer.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  This morning we engage with officials from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to examine the 2020 appropriation account, Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners; account of the receipts of revenue of the State collected by the Revenue Commissioners 2020; and, from the 2020 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts of the public services, chapter 12 - controls over the temporary wage subsidy scheme, and chapter 13 - Revenue's management of suspicious transactions reports.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by officials from the Revenue Commissioners.  In attendance are Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman, Mr. Gerry Harrahill, commissioner, and Mr. Brian Boyle, assistant secretary, all of whom are very welcome.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so that we do not pick up background noise or feedback.  I remind all those attending to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references speakers may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precinct is protected pursuant to the constitutional statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside of the Leinster House precincts and as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to seek legal advice on this matter.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  To assist our broadcast and debates services, I ask members to direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not being directed to a specific witness, I ask that each witness state his or her name the first time he or she contributes.</p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120200002#A00700"><p>As members are aware, the Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the collection of taxes, duties and other levies and charges, and for their prompt transfer either to the Central Fund of the Exchequer or to other fund accounts or public bodies as provided for in law.  Revenue accounts for these receipts and transfers in what is generally referred to as the Revenue account.  The 2020 account was certified by me on 20 April 2021 and received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  Tax receipts payable to the Exchequer in 2020 amounted to a net &euro;56.2 billion, a decrease of &euro;2.1 billion or 3.6% when compared to 2019.  The most significant change related to net VAT receipts, which decreased by &euro;2.7 billion or 18% year on year.  This decrease was offset by an increase of &euro;946 million in corporation tax net receipts.  Non-exchequer net receipts collected by Revenue on behalf of other agencies decreased from &euro;15.8 billion to &euro;15.3 billion, a reduction of nearly 4%.  Pay related social insurance, PRSI, contributions account for nearly 75% of such receipts.  PRSI net receipts decreased by 7.5% in 2020 as compared to 2019.</p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s administration and operational expenses are charged to Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners rather than to the Revenue account.  Revenue&rsquo;s total gross expenditure in 2020 was &euro;467 million.  Salary costs of &euro;329 million account for 70% of Revenue&rsquo;s spend.  Taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;60 million, net expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;407 million.</p> <p>  In my report on the appropriation account for 2020, I draw attention to non-compliance with procurement rules.  This is disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial controls.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, was introduced to enable employers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions to receive support from the State in relation to their wage costs.  The scheme was operated by the Revenue Commissioners and funded by the Department of Social Protection.  The scheme operated in two phases over a 22-week period from 26 March to 31 August 2020.  It was succeeded by the employee wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which is also operated by Revenue and funded by the Department.  The scheme provided very substantial assistance to employers.  In 2020, subsidies totalling &euro;2.8 billion were paid to 66,370 employers in respect of approximately 678,000 employees.  This represented support to an estimated 36% of all employers registered with Revenue pre the pandemic.</p> <p>  Similar to the administration of the tax system, the scheme operated on a self-assessed basis.  This meant employers self-declared that they met the eligibility criteria and calculated how much they were due and received subsidy payments on that basis.  In June 2020, Revenue commenced eligibility checks on all employers who received subsidies.  By the end of July 2021, subsidies totalling &euro;311 million had been identified by Revenue as repayable.  The bulk of this, approximately &euro;252 million, related to subsidies paid during the initial phase of the scheme when a flat rate of &euro;410 per week was paid.  Of the &euro;311 million repayable, &euro;212 million had been repaid and a further &euro;81 million was warehoused for future collection.  The balance of &euro;18 million was outstanding for recovery.  These figures are as at the end of July 2021.  Overall, we found that while there was a material level of excess funding of employers under the scheme, Revenue had signalled to employers from the outset that they would be required to repay any excess.  Revenue implemented a comprehensive compliance regime that has identified overpayments and has substantially recovered them.</p> <p>  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 introduced the requirement for certain designated persons to submit reports to Revenue where they have suspicions of terrorist financing or money laundering, including the laundering of the proceeds of tax evasion.  These are referred to by Revenue as suspicious transaction reports, STRs, and potentially provide useful intelligence to Revenue in tackling shadow economy activity.  Over the five-year period 2016 to 2020, Revenue received approximately 125,000 STRs or an average of approximately 25,000 STRs per year.  The STRs received are matched to taxpayers, where possible, and are risk rated.  Revenue was able to match nearly 90% of the STRs it received in the years 2016 to 2020 to identified taxpayers.  Some 40% of the matched cases were considered high risk.  Of these, nearly half were subsequently closed without a Revenue intervention and 20% progressed to some form of compliance activity.  Ultimately, very few STRs directly yielded additional tax revenue.  Only approximately 500 of the reports received between 2016 and 2020 had yielded additional revenues by end February 2021, amounting to just over &euro;23 million.  STRs are also used to feed into Revenue&rsquo;s risk assessment of taxpayers, however, and so may indirectly contribute to a later targeted audit or other intervention.</p> <p>  The examination reviewed a sample of 50 closed cases to assess whether the appropriate course of action had been taken and in nearly 85% of cases reviewed, no issues were identified.  In a number of cases, Revenue officials considered the STRs to be relevant to other Revenue branches for possible further investigation but there was no evidence of activity following referral to the other branch.  Revenue carried out a review of aged cases and concluded that a new protocol was needed to manage the transfer of STRs between divisions.</p><p>Overall, we found that Revenue complies generally with international good practice in the management of STRs.  The examination made five recommendations in relation to the management of STRs, all of which were agreed by Revenue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120200002#B00200"><p>I understand that today&rsquo;s meeting is to focus on: the 2020 appropriation account; the 2020 account of the receipt of revenue of the State; chapter 12, controls over the TWSS; and chapter 13, Revenue&rsquo;s management of suspicious transactions.  I am accompanied by Gerry Harrahill, commissioner and director general of Customs and Excise and Brian Boyle, accountant general.</p> <p>  In the context of today&rsquo;s discussions, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.  In 2020 Revenue collected total gross Exchequer receipts of &euro;82.3 billion, including &euro;15.4 billion in non-Exchequer receipts collected on behalf of other Government Departments and agencies.  The net Revenue receipts were &euro;56.2 billion, which was a decrease of &euro;2.1 billion or 3.6.% on the 2019 figures.  Up to the end of October this year the net Exchequer receipts collected by Revenue were over &euro;50.2 billion, some &euro;8.4 billion or 20% more than the same period last year.  Revenue&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2020 was &euro;467 million compared with &euro;449 million in 2019, an increase of &euro;18 million or 4%.  The increase primarily relates to increased staffing levels, ICT expenditure and Brexit infrastructure costs.  Revenue had 6,680 staff serving at the end of 2020, with &euro;329 million of Revenue&rsquo;s &euro;467 million expenditure related to salaries.  The other main item of expenditure was ICT, which accounted for &euro;64 million in 2020.</p> <p>  In chapter 12 the Comptroller and Auditor General reviews the controls over the TWSS.  The scheme was introduced at an unprecedented pace, such was the immediate and serious impact of Covid-19 on the cashflow and trading abilities of businesses, with Revenue making the first TWSS payments just four days after the scheme was announced.  The technical infrastructure developed for real-time payroll reporting provided the platform that allowed us to deliver these vital financial supports quickly and efficiently to impacted employers and employees.  The visibility of payroll data that PAYE modernisation gave us enabled us to design TWSS in an extremely limited timeframe and in a way that significantly reduced the opportunities for abuse of the scheme.  Under the scheme, subsidies totalling &euro;2.8 billion gross were paid to 67,222 employers in respect of 689,422 employees.</p> <p>  Beginning in June 2020 Revenue engaged in a phased programme of compliance checks on all participating employers.  Compliance checks as at November 2021 are now 99.5% complete with 359 checks ongoing.  Completed checks have confirmed 97.5% compliance by employers with the conditions of the scheme with Revenue accepting that the employers concerned had a reasonable expectation on entry into the scheme that turnover would decrease significantly.  Revenue has recouped just over &euro;29 million in TWSS related overpayments from 1,658 or 2.5% of employers.  We also undertook a reconciliation exercise which identified an aggregate liability of &euro;308 million, the majority of which related to the transitional period up to 5 May when we paid &euro;410 per week per eligible employee to employers.  Bringing the compliance and reconciliation exercises together, the aggregate amount of TWSS identified for recovery amounts to &euro;324 million.  Some &euro;251 million of this has been repaid to Revenue, &euro;60 million is included in the tax debt warehouse, &euro;3 million is at appeal and a further &euro;10 million is now available for collection.</p> <p>  In Chapter 13, the Comptroller and Auditor General reviews Revenue&rsquo;s management of STRs.  Revenue has been in receipt of STRs since 2003.  STRs provide vital intelligence in the investigation of money laundering and terrorist financing as well as in the detection of tax evasion.  Based on global developments and the expansion of designated reporting entities, it is expected that the number of STRs received will continue to rise as increased measures are introduced to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.  In September 2020, Revenue introduced a new online system to require all designated bodies to submit STRs online through the Revenue online service, ROS.  Enhancements were also introduced to improve how STRs are processed within Revenue, including automatic uploading to linked profiles in Revenue&rsquo;s case management system.  The five recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General have been agreed by Revenue.</p> <p>  As was the case for many other organisations, 2020 was an unprecedented year for Revenue.  Our investment in real-time payroll reporting meant that working with the payroll software sector we were able to quickly provide financial support directly to businesses, while also continuing with our core business as a tax and customs administration.  Brexit resulted in a fundamentally changed trading environment between Ireland and Great Britain since 1 January 2021.  Brexit infrastructure and accommodation costs were over &euro;9.6 million at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort, with further expenditure of over &euro;14 million expected in 2021.  Further changes to the UK Government&rsquo;s import requirements from January next will mean more adjustments.  We will continue to work collaboratively with trade and business, both collectively and individually, to ensure trade flows remain as efficient as possible while meeting our Single Market and customs union obligations.</p> <p>  The TWSS was replaced by the EWSS from 1 September 2020.  EWSS subsidy payments to date have amounted to &euro;5.65 billion while PRSI credits have amounted to over &euro;877 million.  The total amount claimed under the Covid restrictions support scheme to date is &euro;704 million in respect of 25,500 premises.  The total amount paid out under the business resumption support scheme has been &euro;6.2 million in respect of 1,680 businesses.  In addition, there was over &euro;2.8 billion of debt warehoused at the end of October 2021.  I have responded to the committee in recent times on matters related to the misclassification of workers as self-employed and arrangements in place for couriers since the late 1990s; contracts that were non-compliant with procurement guidelines; and a tax settlement in a specific case that was of interest to the committee.</p> <p>  Remote working, facilitated by our secure and sophisticated ICT framework, has been the norm for the majority of Revenue staff throughout the pandemic.  On a daily basis Revenue staff engage with taxpayers, take and make telephone calls about a wide variety of issues such as Brexit; tax repayments; local property tax; complex international tax issues; and the Covid support schemes.  In 2020 and 2021 there have been significant seizures of drugs and cigarettes and we continue to work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our international partners in tackling illegal activity.  Revenue staff have responded excellently to the changed environment arising from Covid-19.  I take this opportunity to thank them for their resilience, commitment and professionalism.  I again draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.  Subject to this constraint, I am happy to answer members' questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120200002#B00300"><p>Good morning everyone.  It is not ideal that we are not in the committee room but those are the times we are in.  I would like to ask Mr. Cody a few questions and time is short so I would appreciate it if he could keep his replies as short and succinct as possible.  I want to start off with the debt warehousing scheme.  Understandably, that was an initiative that sought to keep as many businesses afloat as possible.  The scheme was interest free for 12 months and then there was a low interest arrangement and a phased payment that had to be agreed.</p><p>How much has been warehoused by Revenue since the legislation was implemented?  What is the total value of the debt currently warehoused and when will it be liable for full repayment?  How long are the phases?  For example, what type of phasing is being permitted?  There are many viable businesses that are in a particularly difficult position at the moment.  We are far from out of the difficulties.  I ask Mr. Cody to address those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120200002#C00200"><p>The debt warehousing initiative was introduced in the July stimulus package back in 2020.  At the time, the Department of Finance was engaging with us about the challenges businesses were facing.  We had suspended our normal enforcement activity from 10 March.  We had suspended the imposition of interest and the referral of cases to the Revenue sheriffs.  We were looking at how we would manage this process in the midst of a pandemic.  We proposed to the Department that the best way to do this, to give a legal framework to build a successful system, was to bring forward legislation.  We came up with the concept of the debt warehouse.  In the July stimulus, there was an anticipation that we were going to come out of Covid and that there was a process in which businesses would recover.  Unfortunately, that has not happened.  Subsequently, the debt warehousing period was extended again in the Finance Bill.</p> <p>  In terms of how it works, the first period is up to the end of this year.  That covers VAT liabilities up and including November-December 2021 and PAYE and PRSI liabilities up to and including December 2021.  They are the loss periods for the first periods of the debt warehousing.  For all of 2022, for any debt in the warehouse repaid in that period there will be no interest.  No interest accrues on any of the debt that is in the warehouse from March 2020 to 31 December 2021.  As of 31 October, 98,000 individual customers are availing of the debt warehouse facility.  At the end of October, there was &euro;2.8 billion in total in the debt warehouse.  We publish figures every month on debt warehousing.  We will be publishing figures for the end of November next week.  </p> <p>  For 2022, the debt is warehoused.  Businesses have to engage with us at the end of 2022 to come up with appropriate arrangements.  It is not yet set out what the maximum period will be.  We will take an appropriate arrangement from each individual business having regard to its individual circumstances.  The key condition - it is really important that businesses are ware of this - is that they must keep current returns to up date even if they cannot pay.  We have written to the 98,000 customers in the past three weeks to remind them to file their returns.  It is really important that have their returns in and up-to-date as otherwise they might fall out of the warehousing and, thus, be subject to the normal interest rates.  That is really important. </p></speech>

I presume reviews will be undertaken.  Are there any plans with regard to the how this will work?  Is it likely to be targeted or will it continue to be general?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120200002#C00400"><p>In terms of current plans, we communicated with the relevant taxpayers in November.  The last returns are due in January and February.  Sometime in the middle of the first quarter, we will write to all of the businesses that are in the warehouse setting out their final position and total amount and reminding them of the need to keep their 2022 returns in and paid.  Towards the end of 2022, we will be engaging with individual taxpayers.  There will not be a one size fits all.  Some businesses will be in a position to start repaying on an instalment arrangement quicker than others.  Ultimately, at the end of the process some of this amount will be uncollectible and will be written off.  I have noted a lot of commentary that there will be a cliff effect.  We would not have come up with the idea around the debt warehousing to support businesses and to keep them in business only to then pull the plug immediately.  That would not make any sense.  We will take a proportionate response.  I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General will be keeping an eye on us.</p></speech>

I want to move around some of the areas we are going to cover this morning.  I want to discuss the suspicious transaction reports, STRs.  I note there is a very low level of additional tax relative to the number of reports that Revenue gets, but we do not know if, following a Revenue audit, something further and substantial would be gathered as a consequence.

Financial institutions are obliged to submit STRs to Revenue if they feel there is a suspicion.  The suspicion could be an unusual pattern such as a person making a lodgement that is not in accordance with the norm.  The financial institutions are required to send a suspicious transaction report to Revenue an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We then have them risk-rated.  The key issue is that the STRs are essentially a form of third-party information.  All third-party information we receive provides a backdrop to our overall risk rating system.</p></speech>

We have relaunched that work to look at whether there are factors we can see from patterns to enhance the risk rating system.  That work is ongoing.  It ties in with some of our realignment of our structure in building up our intelligence, investigation and prosecution division.  The STRs are part of that.

In regard to the review, would Revenue be looking at bitcoin cryptocurrencies which are much more dominant now than they would have been in 2014.  In a reply to a parliamentary question, I was told that VAT applies where payments are made using those types of currencies.</p><p>For example, Revolut was not used in transactions.  How speedy will the review be?  Will it capture the more heavily used currencies or payment methods?</p></speech>

Essentially, there are no holders of cryptocurrencies in Ireland but there are developments at EU and OECD level.  The EU is bringing forward a directive on administrative co-operation.  There is a series of directives on administrative co-operation, DACs, which are entitled DAC1, DAC2 and so on.  DAC8 is expected to be implemented in the next couple of years to deal specifically with the exchange of information relating to cryptocurrencies.  That will be an important part of the tools to deal with those risks.</p></speech>

I do not mean to be rude.  Time is short.  I appreciate the 1997 Act, but there have been high-profile cases.  I refer to one case in particular that went to the Tax Appeals Commission but was still being negotiated with Revenue at the time.  It was subsequently settled for substantially less than the original amount of money for which the firm was deemed liable.  I will mention the name of the firm - it is Perrigo.  The matter is in the news.  It is not that the identity of the firm is not known.  In the context of the amount that was settled on, the transaction that gave rise to the tax liability was &euro;3.25 billion and the amount of tax that was ultimately settled on was &euro;297 million, which is approximately 2%.  Why would something be deemed intellectual property when a tax liability is issued but then subsequently negotiated as a different type of tax liability?</p></speech>

Section 851A of that Act is a provision that makes it a criminal offence to speak about the affairs of taxpayers.  Every time I appear before this committee or other committees, I always highlight the fact that section 851A limits what I can speak about in the context of individual cases.  We have provided a comprehensive reply to the request for information by the committee on the case.  I have no problem going through the reply with the committee, but I will bow to the direction of the Chairman on when he wishes to take that.  I am sure many of the committee members are interested in a discussion on the case.</p> <p>  As an introductory piece, I refer to the self-assessment system.  The original assessment in this case was determined by the taxpayer and the original assessment was a nil liability.  That must be borne in mind as well.  We then wrote under self-assessment and we would carry out our audit and inquiries.  We raise assessments when we believe it is appropriate based on the information we have and having regard to timelines.  We are bound by timelines in the context of when we can raise assessments.  In the normal course, once the assessment is raised, the taxpayer is entitled to appeal that assessment and provide additional information following the raising of the assessment.  In many cases, that gives rise to a settlement before the matter goes to appeal.  The background, to the extent I can discuss the case, is set out in the letter.  It is important to note that the explanation of how the self-assessment, appeal and assessment systems work is also set out in that letter.  I am willing to go through it.  I believe there was a bit of a misunderstanding.  Originally, the Chairman thought the committee had written to us but we had not responded.  I was watching the proceedings.  The Chairman was surprised that the committee had not received a reply, but we had not received the request.  We replied in line with the request, as we always do.</p></speech>

We were not involved in that meeting.  There was no subsequent follow-up discussion with us.

These couriers are taxed through PAYE, they are availing of the flat-rate expenses and they do not submit self-assessment forms.

In 1997, we were looking at a challenging area and at a reasonable level of casual working non-compliance.  The process the office was trying to address was to ensure the sector - the motorcycle and cycle courier services - was brought into the tax net.  It was done under a background of social welfare rulings in regard to the status of social insurance rulings around the fact individual couriers had been classified as self-employed for social insurance purposes.  We also had situations in the late 1980s where we had raised assessments on courier companies and where, subsequently, the courier companies could produce decisions that the couriers were self-employed for social insurance purposes.  As a result, we had to waive and remove our assessment in regard to PRSI because we were the collection agent rather than the determining agent.</p> <p>  It was also against a backdrop of the treatment of owner-drivers and the trends across the industry.

If we go back to the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, there was a move towards owner-driver processes.  There was a case in Readymix - I can mention the case because it is a court judgment - in regard to owner-drivers of ready-to-pour concrete vehicles.  That process happened all through the 1980s and 1990s, and we have seen it with milk collection but also with milk deliveries.  On the whole process of self-employment and employment, the grey areas that overlap in classification and misclassification are a challenge in which we are only one of the parties.  From a tax purpose, the tax liability is actually the same whether persons are taxed under "self-employment" or under "employment", except in the treatment of expenses that are allowable.  We were dealing with this against a backdrop of non-compliance across a sector.  The person in our office dealing with this was working on it for a considerable period in the 1990s.  What he was trying to achieve was to ensure the sector was brought fully into the tax system.  We were not determining social insurance or employment rights.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that, in 1997, Internet and online shopping and all of that sort of thing did not really exist, and it is fair to say Revenue could not have seen that coming.  However, it is also fair to say Revenue has sat on its hands for the past 20 years and has done nothing as more and more workers are exploited.  Surely Mr. Cody would recognise that this is an issue for workers.</p></speech>

I want to raise three issues.  The first is in regard to second-hand cars being imported and the assessment for relevant duty that is payable.  I have received a number of complaints from importers of second-hand cars where the assessment was carried out when the cars arrived and the money was paid to Revenue.</p><p>They have obviously sold on the cars on the market and calculated the price they would charge on the basis of what they paid the supplier and Revenue, and leaving a margin for themselves.  A number of them are getting new assessments for duty six months later.  It will be very difficult for them to meet those additional demands.  Once a vehicle has come in to the country and a full disclosure has been made, why is a new assessment coming down the road six months later?</p></speech>

Regarding second-hand cars imported into the country, this is all linked to the impact of Brexit.  If a car is imported, the customs duty, as appropriate, is payable on importation.  VRT and VAT are payable.  Generally, that will be the end of it.  I would have to look at individual cases but if it is the case that vehicles were routed through Northern Ireland-----</p></speech>

I know the Deputy asked a number of questions about the second-hand car piece but if he provides us with details on that, I will definitely look into the matter for him.</p></speech>

They did not come through Northern Ireland.  The importers dealt with Revenue regarding when they were imported and paid various taxes.  They then sold the cars and now, six months later, they are getting totally new assessments.  It is not just one importer but a range of importers who have been affected by this.  One company told me it was closing up shop because it can no longer deal with this because it does not know what is coming down the road.  This is the problem the importers have.  They understood when they paid the tax that everything was above board and they were finished with Revenue.  They then went on to the next stage in the market.</p> <p>  The second issue I raise concerns the importation of tobacco.  During the lockdown in 2020, my understanding is that the value of sales of tobacco products increased by &euro;150 million.  I presume that is related to fewer people travelling abroad and being able to bring in tobacco products legally.  I am not talking about bringing in cigarettes and other tobacco products illegally.  What is Revenue's view regarding dealing with this issue?  On one hand, we have a health issue relating to trying to reduce the level of tobacco consumption while, on the other, we are facilitating in real terms the importation of these products with no tax paid and at a much cheaper price?  Where are we in terms of reviewing that?  Finland will not allow any product in unless the health warning is in Finnish and Swedish whereas here, the health warning can be in Spanish and there is still no restriction in real terms as regards people physically bringing in these products.  Is this being looked at?  I know health is not the responsibility of Revenue.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right.  It is a balance between health requirements and lowering the level of cigarettes where prices go up budget on budget.  There were significant seizures in 2020 and 2021.  In 2020, we seized 48.2 million cigarettes with a value of &euro;32.8 million. while up to the end of October 2021, we had seized 55.9 million cigarettes with a value of &euro;40 million.  Regarding the level of tobacco seizures involving roll-your-own and, increasingly over the past number of years, loose-leaf tobacco, there is evidence that illicit cigarette manufacturing is taking place on the island.  We have detected cigarette manufacturing facilities and I spoke to this committee a couple of years ago about the large seizure at a factory in County Louth.  There were tobacco seizures to the end of October 2021 to the value of &euro;23.1 million, which is by far the highest figure for roll-your-own tobacco we have ever had.</p> <p>  We take cigarette smuggling very seriously.  It involves organised criminal gangs.  The lockdown has had an impact on the legal market obviously because people can buy duty-free cigarettes depending on where they are coming from and if they go to Spain, cigarettes are cheaper there and they can bring them back legally.  Every year, in conjunction with the tobacco regulator, we carry out a survey of illegal cigarette smuggling.  The market for illegal cigarettes runs at around 15%.  It fluctuates between 12% and 15% of the market.  The Deputy is right.  The health dimension is not my area but, clearly, there are strong health considerations in the level of legal-----</p></speech>

I will send the committee a note, if that is helpful, summarising the position as we see it.</p></speech>

I will start on the point Mr. Cody finished on.  I was a member of the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  Part of our work involved looking at the meat processing sector.  We found that components within that sector regularly used agency staff to employee companies.  These companies often consist of just one single person.  The company is often incorporated in a country that person has never been to.  Serious concerns were raised about the potential for exploitation.  Am I correct in understanding Mr. Cody as having said that as far as Revenue is concerned, that matter is entirely one for the Department of Social Protection and not one that Revenue would concern itself with?</p></speech>

One of the trends that has evolved over the past ten or 15 years is the use of corporate structures.  Two formats are used.  There are personal service companies, which generally involve one individual and he incorporates his business.  Therefore, it would be Niall Cody Limited that provides services to a principal contractor.  Then there are what are called managed service companies, MSCs, which generally involve five directors, sometimes not linked to each other, sometimes providing a kind of service to different principal contractors, generally facilitated through a professional services firm that specialises in these types of structures.</p> <p>  We know that in certain sectors there are international dimensions to some of those because there are employment agencies that are used by some of the sectors.  That happens throughout the contracting process.  The personal service companies, PSCs, and MSCs are fairly common in the area of ICT.  There is some of it in the construction sector and some of it in the meat sector.  It is in pharma and throughout the media.  It has probably replaced a lot of the self-employment.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General will remember that he did a review of our national contractors project in the report for 2014 where we carried out a fairly extensive inquiry into the practices of PSCs and MSCs in relation to expenses.  We had significant publications and settlements of cases where the structures were used and in the use of the structures the whole ratio of expenses were manipulated.  Some of them involved the use of family members as employees of their own company.  We recovered significant moneys on the tax risks in relation to PSCs and MSCs.  Irish legislation does not have a provision to look through the corporate structure which has been a trend in some other companies.  We paid close attention to that subcontracting use in corporate structures and have had some-----</p></speech>

He referred to some actions in this area.  It is difficult to assert how there would be a benefit to the worker on the basis that they are described as a company employed through an agency to work for a single factory in the sector I mentioned.  Is that of concern to Revenue?  Has it carried out specific analysis of that and is further action planned?  Mr. Cody mentioned what I presume he is acknowledging is a deficiency in Irish law.  Is that something he would like to see changed?</p></speech>

In the context of the professional services, particularly at the low-income end where the power relationship is very unequal, certainly we would have seen some trends in relation to non-Irish nationals being in a structure.  I need to be very careful here because there are a limited number of agencies involved.  There are a limited number of companies and I need to be aware of taxpayer confidentiality.  I would be concerned that there are abuses, not in all cases, but certainly if we go back long enough on the construction side there were fairly high-profile cases involving non-Irish workers but using some structures that I would be very uncomfortable with.  We would look at the risks in those areas and our evidence to date is that it is not widespread, but it does exist.</p></speech>

I think on 20 March 2020, we announced that we were going to suspend normal interest and enforcement.  The challenge then for us was that this was under our care and management rules and our care and management facility, but there is a limit to our care and management; we cannot just ignore the law as provided for.  That is why we were anxious that the warehousing system would be legislated for.  The warehousing system provides the legislation and the rules about who can avail of the warehousing system.  So, businesses - these are smaller businesses generally dealt with by our business division and our personal division - are eligible to warehouse debt.  For any other case - those are cases in our large cases division or medium enterprise division with a turnover probably in excess of, at the time, &euro;5 million - they have to show that they were adversely affected by Covid in not carrying out their trade to be eligible to get into the warehouse.  That sets the framework</p></speech>

What percentage of those companies that warehoused debt subsequently ceased trading?  Has a value yet been assigned to that debt?</p></speech>

That is a common feature.  Warehousing debt is only useful to a business when it is trading.  It has to have the liability to warehouse it in the first place.  An interesting feature about the warehousing is that the first debts went into warehousing in January or February 2020 before Covid restricted anything.  Those businesses would have had a normal January or February.  That forms the seed capital of the warehousing system.</p><p> One of the most interesting features of the system is the number of businesses that warehoused debt and that have subsequently paid it.  They have not put all of their liabilities into the warehouse.  This reflects how some of them are probably doing a little better than others.  Having debt on the balance sheet is not what businesses want if they can pay it off.</p><p> The advantage of the Revenue warehousing system is that there is zero interest.  Throughout 2020 and 2021, I read a great deal of commentary from business representative groups that there was a low uptake of some of the loan schemes and asking why any business would take up one of the loan schemes when it could warehouse its tax liability and use that as funding capital at a 0% interest rate during the period.</p></speech>

Not just in Ireland, but internationally, there has been a noticeable increase in seizures.  This is a reflection in some respects of the volume of illicit traffic.  It is also an indication of the successful work that is being done by law enforcement agencies nationally and internationally.  A third significant aspect is the investment that has been made by all agencies nationally and internationally in technology and equipment, including scanners and other detection equipment.  The increase in seizures is down to a combination of all of these factors.</p> <p>  It is useful to draw attention to another matter.  One of the large seizures this year that the Deputy will be aware of involved the seizure of cocaine that had been ingested in coke.  It shows the ingenuity and purposefulness of the organised crime gangs.  It is important to remember that these are multimillion or, in some instances, multibillion euro industries.  They have incredible resources available to them and are deploying them.  The challenge for State agencies, including the tax and customs administration, is to try to stay on top of the situation and make all of the investments that are necessary.</p></speech>

He might touch on significant seizures of other substances.  He mentioned cocaine.  The jump between the 2020 and 2021 figures is significant in light of the lockdown.  While the world was looking at lockdowns, smugglers clearly were not.  Instead, they were looking at opportunities.  I commend the work of the customs agents and their sister agencies around the world in respect of these seizures.</p> <p>  Are the majority of seizures at ports and airports or do they arise from follow-ups and raids?</p> <p>  Mr. Harrahill mentioned equipment.  The European Anti-Fraud Office of the European Commission gave a grant of &euro;1.4 million and an X-ray scanning van was purchased.  Was that in 2020 or 2019 and has that purchase resulted in a number of the seizures in question?</p></speech>

When it came to operations that tried to immerse themselves in legitimate trade flows in order to conceal their activities, the impact of Covid in dramatically reducing trade flows generally in 2020 and 2021 made the job on the customs and law enforcement side easier in terms of identifying patterns of activity that did not fit the norm.</p> <p>  Another element is the ongoing investment by all agencies in developing intelligence.  Intelligence has a long gestation.  Work that may start on a case or programme today may not come to fruition for two years.  We have experience of the result of investment in intelligence gathering being realised in another country.  These are cross-border organised crime gangs.</p> <p>  Regarding a detailed breakdown, we can provide a note.  We have to do that in the annual report.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about ports and airports.  We conduct inland seizures as well as seizures at ports.  The largest seizures tend to be at ports.  In conjunction with our colleagues in the Garda, we will always look for the best approach to a seizure.  Of their nature, some of these consignments come in in 40 ft containers.  We seize the containers as close as possible to the point of importation.</p></speech>

Further changes in that regard will follow on 1 January 2022.  What other engagement has Revenue had with SMEs?  The last time Mr. Harrahill appeared before the committee, I commended him on the engagement that Revenue had undertaken with SMEs.  Now that we are 12 months in, how are we engaging with SMEs and what are we doing in the context of the next tranche of proposed changes in January 2022?</p></speech>

We had two objectives in mind in doing so.  Notwithstanding all the work involved in getting ready for Brexit, once it happened we clearly needed to support businesses in that transition and we have done so.  Increasingly, our focus is on those changes that will kick in, as the Deputy said, on 1 January 2022.  The main change to come is that the authorities on the UK side will be seeking compliance with their import formalities.  The other element then is that over the course of 2022 the UK authorities will be ratcheting up controls on the sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, side of things.</p> <p>  We have therefore continued our engagement with trade and representative bodies, which has been very positive.  It has emphasised the importance of us being aware of what the issues are for businesses.  Sometimes it is about clarification, and sometimes there are issues that we can bring to the attention of the authorities in another member state.  That could involve an issue manifesting as a problem in France or the Netherlands, for example, and we have a great deal of engagement and co-operation with colleagues right across the EU.  </p> <p>  We are also engaging directly with Her Majesty's Revenue &amp;amp; Customs, HMRC, on the UK side to try to ensure that there is certainty and clarity for businesses regarding what is going to happen from 1 January 2022 and what is expected of businesses in that context.  I have probably said this before at other meetings, but the one thing that businesses hate is uncertainty.  Unfortunately, sometimes, the changes on the UK side are unclear and leave businesses here uncertain about what is meant and how they are going to handle those changes.  Again, we are trying to maximise clarity around that aspect.  </p></speech>

I am going to pass the Brexit ball to Mr. Harrahill again, but before I do I will give some idea of the scale.  Mr. Harrahill and I appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in the run-up to Brexit and we were talking then about the fact that we used to handle 1.8 million customs entries before Brexit.  We had anticipated that we would have to scale up to handle something like 20 million customs entries in the first year post-Brexit, which would have been a ten-fold increase, by and large.  The reality is that this year we are probably looking at a 30-fold increase in customs entries.</p> <p>  We examine aspects such as the local property tax and pay and file tax returns and scale.  Our chief information officer, CIO, rang me the other day in that context, just after the pay and file tax returns deadline. We spend our time in the context of that pay and file process looking at our systems and ensuring that they are robust and working.  Our CIO told me when he rang on that occasion that we had handled 350,000 customs entries, and that that was the highest level of entries we had on one day.  Mr. Harrahill and I were chatting about this subject yesterday, and since then we have handled something like 700,000 customs entries in one day.  This increase has been driven by several factors.  The impact of Covid-19 has been massive on e-commerce.  In addition, the EU rules concerning postal, VAT and customs' rates changed on 1 July, and that has presented significant challenges around low-value items.  Therefore, the scale of customs operations is massive.  I will pass over to Mr. Harrahill to add a bit of colour to this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120200002#J01200"><p>Mr. Harrahill may be able to answer a more specific question for me.  A 60-fold increase is an astonishing expansion in any walk of life, for the public sector or for private enterprise.  How is Revenue managing that as an organisation?  To get some more detail on what Mr. Cody outlined, are these customs entries the result of people ordering things online and having large numbers of small items?  Is that the scale of what is happening in this regard?  What is the efficiency in this context and is it possible to get any sense of what value is being captured for the State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Harrahill" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120200002#J01300"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  To expand on what Mr. Cody touched on, several things that came together have contributed to this explosion in customs entries.  A consequence of the Covid-19 restrictions is that more and more people have gone from shopping in retailers on the main streets of our cities and towns to doing much of that online.  That is undoubtedly one element of this increase, and we could see that facet of the change starting to kick in from last year.<br/><br/>The second significant element is that the rules concerning liability for VAT for small packages and parcels changed from 1 July 2021.  Formerly, there was an exemption from VAT when people were importing goods valued at less than &euro;22.  As part of the move at EU level on rules to try to ensure there was no distortion of competition and to tackle some issues with the valuation of goods, that <i>de minimis</i>rule was removed.  If people are now importing something worth &euro;5, that package will be subject to VAT charges but not to customs duties.  Those two things together have contributed enormously to causing this situation.  A huge number of these customs entries are parcels and packages, as distinct from big consignments.  I say that because in the early days of big consignments, and again as a consequence of the transition from the pre-Brexit situation to the post-Brexit changed reality, combined with the impact of Covid-19 and associated restrictions, trade flows slowed down.  They are now returning to something closer to normal.  <br/><br/>The explosion of activity in this area is not just an Irish phenomenon, however, but one that has been seen in all member states.  I attend a meeting every couple of weeks of people involved in this area from the member states.  We examine where things stand in this regard in the post-Brexit environment and everybody is sharing that experience.  People who never previously had engagement with customs, and never understood what we did, are now suddenly part of this new regime.  It is a new reality.  <br/><br/>This is also part of why we have done much work last year and this year, leading up to Black Friday, and all those times, for example, to try to focus people's attention on the issue that now arises when importing goods from outside the EU in respect of liability for customs charges and VAT.</p></speech>

It is sometimes a surprise and, if Mr. Harrahill does not mind me saying it, sometimes a nasty surprise, encountered when people have ordered gifts.

There has therefore been an 85% increase in the value of customs duties.  Obviously, many of the customs entries had no customs duties payable.</p></speech>

Work remains to be done but when the system is updated with new key words that are, potentially, linked to cryptocurrencies or other marks of the black economy but, particularly cryptocurrencies, will that automatically have an effect on ratings?  Once the work is done, will Revenue have an opportunity to review the period where the coding was not necessarily in place to see what, if any, effect that would have and whether reviews could be done respectively on some of the areas of greater concern?</p></speech>

They are some of the things that we constantly review.  As I said to Deputy Catherine Murphy earlier, the key issue around the whole area of cryptocurrencies is the developments that will take place internationally on the exchange of information rather than the STRs.  I think that anybody who is trading in cryptocurrencies has obligations under the self-assessment system.  It would be in everybody's interest to ensure that they comply with their tax requirements.  Significant levels of data will become available to us from our international partners over the next couple of years and that will be a bigger game changer than the STRs because the STRs will mostly not involve crypto because they are coming from financial institutions.  They could, potentially, come if somebody paid for something large with cryptocurrencies.  Generally, a lot of the risk on the cryptocurrencies may well link to some of the areas that Mr. Harrahill was talking to earlier around organised crime gangs and probably not within the STR space for their crytocurrencies.  The international dimension is the real issue around crypto.</p></speech>

The temporary wage subsidy scheme was an excellent scheme that helped many employers to keep on workers throughout the pandemic.  In an era when there is so much mobility within the workforce and when many employers are experiencing difficulty with trying to get staff, it was a prudent move overall.  Am I correct in stating the original qualifying mechanism was such that the firm had to have experienced a drop of 25% in overall turnover because of Covid-19?</p></speech>

There were supplementary ones if the turnover rule was not appropriate but the normal rule was that firms had to be experiencing significant negative economic disruption due to Covid-19.  To do this, they needed to indicate a minimum of a 25% reduction in turnover for quarter 2 of 2020 compared with that for 2019.</p></speech>

For instance, was there analysis of whether it would be better to direct the scheme towards small and medium businesses that would be under the most pressure from the pandemic, such as those in the hospitality sector?  I refer in particular to hotels and restaurants, many of which took up the scheme, versus major conglomerates.  It could be argued the latter took a hit but, in the context of having both cash on hand and the financial clout to get through the pandemic, was it worth the State subsidising those businesses?  Did it represent value for public money?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120200002#L00400"><p>At the time, in mid-March 2020, the genesis of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, as I outlined last year to the committee, was that the first thing to be announced was the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  That scheme was brought in and it was going to be made available for any employee who was let go.  When it was introduced, we ourselves looked at whether we could use our PAYE system to provide a mechanism to allow employers to support employees.  We contacted the Department of Finance to say we thought we could do something to enable employers to do that.  The Government then looked at it - it was the quickest response we have ever got to any proposal we have made - and said that if we could do that, that would be great.  It was then a policy decision around having a broad-based scheme to support employment and this was across the full sector of the economy.</p> <p>  As it turned out subsequently, most of the money has been funded by the EU as part of the support of the EU system in response to the Covid pandemic impact.  It was a broad-based scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme, which replaced it, is similarly broadly based across the economy.  That makes sure it does not fall foul of any state aid rules, as would be the case if we picked particular sectors.</p> <p>  Ultimately, it is a Government decision.  The wage subsidy schemes have been a phenomenal success in meeting the policy requirements of keeping people in employment.  Today's newspapers show unemployment is down to something like 6.9%, according to Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures published today.  We never had the wage subsidy schemes before and I do not know what will happen in future, but the payroll system and the PAYE modernisation have provided that platform to support businesses.</p></speech>

We have all dealt with businesses that have suffered a great deal because of the pandemic and that have suffered difficulties with Revenue, but I recognise the efforts of the witnesses and, more particularly, those of the workers within the organisation because it has been extraordinarily difficult for many people working for the State to have to divvy out these supports.  The focus of my question related to larger firms that employ, for example, more than 500 people, which may have had major cash reserves, versus smaller businesses that did need increased support.</p><p>Would we want to be careful to ensure that the money goes where it needs to go, rather than giving it out just based on a percentage at the time?</p><p> My next question is about the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme.  Mr. Cody is aware that these created difficulties for those who were seeking mortgage approval and seeking to purchase homes.  What steps has Revenue taken to bring further clarity to that area?  That could include providing transparency to employees that employers were using this scheme to pay their wages and providing clarifications that are needed for the purposes of lending.  It has, unfortunately, impacted thousands of people in the Republic of Ireland.  As a Member of the Oireachtas, I think the banks have behaved in a disgraceful fashion.  What steps is Revenue taking to clarify this area?</p></speech>

The employment wage subsidy scheme is different.  Employees are paid their wages and the employer gets a payment.  It is a subsidy but it is not a subsidy that is directly passed on to the employee.  The scheme provided that the TWSS payment had to be shown on the payslips of anyone receiving it.  Through the course of the year, certain financial institutions had concerns and brought in blanket rules which called into question mortgage applications if a person's employer was in receipt of the subsidy.  Representations were made to us about some of those cases.  We identified that we have no role in what the mortgage company does.  We passed on concerns in submissions made to us regarding banking oversight to the Department of Finance.  Transparency about being in receipt of the scheme was key because we wanted to ensure that employees knew exactly how much the employer was getting.  That became part of the reconciliation process and compliance programme we did to ensure that the subsidy in the TWSS was passed on to the employee.</p></speech>

It is a valid point, which needs to be raised, and I ask Revenue to mind it closely in the coming months.  It appears that we will be living with Covid for a significant period.  The interaction between employers and Revenue in any future scheme, and indeed in this scheme, has an impact which filters down to people who are applying for mortgages.  It is one of many unfortunate consequences of this pandemic.  We have to take measures as a Government.</p></speech>

Some of them will know me from the customs consultative committee in a previous life.  I have a specific question, which follows on from Deputy Colm Burke's question.  Deputy Burke was asking about second-hand vehicles which were brought in at the start of Brexit, to Southern ports.  Those vehicles had to be cleared.  Customs requested certain documents to facilitate the clearing without duty on those vehicles.  The paperwork was produced.  However, months later, these vehicles had been sold on, with the VRT paid, they were re-registered, and then Revenue decided that it was looking for other documentation to support the vehicles that were already cleared.  It moved the goalposts in the middle of the whole operation.  Even though the vehicles were cleared, with one set of documents having been produced, Revenue was not happy with that and asked for more documents, which cannot be produced for specific reasons.  Does Revenue have a second bite of the cherry here?  That is a binary answer.</p></speech>

In answering her question, it is important to say that the approach to customs and tax is the same.  It operates on a self-assessment basis.  I will not go into specific cases, for obvious reasons.  An importer brings in whatever goods are involved and presents documentation.  Revenue will process and deal with that on a presumption of honesty and at face value.  We always follow up on a certain percentage of transactions to satisfy ourselves that the initial documentation is valid and that the way in which a specific transaction was processed was in accordance with the requirements.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that, on occasions, it took days for cars in Dublin Port and in other ports to be cleared, while producing the documents required.  Revenue had days initially.  It gave the go-ahead.  What concerns me about regulatory agencies such as Revenue making mistakes is that there is now an outstanding amount of money that Revenue states is due, when the reality is that Revenue has certain amounts of money belonging to these people, which it is probably going to hang on to to put against this bill.  The only recourse open to the businesses is probably judicial review.  Ultimately, what generally seems to happen in this country is that the judicial review goes against the regulatory agency when it gets to the court and the taxpayer picks up the bill for a legal fee which should never have arisen in the first place.  We can carry on the conversation another time, but I am making the witnesses aware that I am hot on the case of State agencies that are spending taxpayers' money entering into legal cases when they should know better.  They should be aware where a mistake is made.  Ultimately, when the judicial review goes against them, it means they are wrong.</p> <p>  I have a question about Revenue's facilities in Rosslare and Dublin ports.  I note from what has been presented to us that Revenue's capital assets amount to approximately &euro;7.3 million for 2020.  Will the witnesses give me some detail of what that includes?  Does it include buildings?  Is it just offices?  Does it include grounds in Rosslare?  I am concentrating on the new facilities dealing with Brexit.  I do not know if that is a matter for Mr. Cody or Mr. Harrahill.</p></speech>

Does Revenue have any objection to sharing that under utilised and very spacious facility on the basis of road safety and, if needed, to erect a fence to provide for parking for the people who now must park on the side of the road thus causing a road safety issue?</p></speech>

I know it is an area in which the Deputy has a particular interest.  The challenge will be to try and do an assessment as to whether it is possible to put a parking facility in there at the same time as ensuring the primary purpose of the facility and the controls that need to operate around it.  In principle and on the face of it, based on the occupancy levels, there is certainly potential for a parking facility to be made available on that site.</p></speech>

I know it is causing problems and we have heard about it from hauliers.  Also, the matter is of particular interest to the Deputy.

The committee recognises the great work that has been undertaken by Revenue with 99.5% compliance checks in operation, as referenced in the opening statement.  How many cases has Revenue investigated for the misuse of schemes implemented to support businesses and individuals during the pandemic?</p></speech>

We only carry out investigations where there is evidence of serious tax evasion.</p> <p>  As I set out in my opening statement in relation to the temporary wage subsidy scheme, we did a compliance review of all recipients because this was an area that we are not normally involved in.  Paying out money is kind of outside our core business.  What we were doing is we were paying out, in the case of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, &euro;2.85 billion.  We did, essentially, a compliance review of all recipients.  It was a fairly light touch review in which people were required to show their reduction in turnover or the alternative method that was used.  They were all asked for sample payslips to show, as I chatted to Deputy O'Connor earlier, that the wage subsidy scheme was passed on to employees.  We had what I would see as an exceptional level of compliance.  For the relatively small number of cases that had issues, for some of them what was involved is that they would have anticipated that they would have had a reduction because nobody what was going to happen last March 12 months.  Nobody knew when we would open or whatever.</p></speech>

I am trying to figure out the amount of correspondence that Revenue has had with multiple employers, in the early exchanges, to make them aware of their eligibility, which we all understand was self-assessed and administered by Revenue.  How many cases have been escalated by Revenue to an investigation?  Is it anticipated that the number will continue to increase as we move out of restrictions?  Certainly the restrictions have been removed from a number of sectors.  However, we see currently on the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, that across various sectors there is still a really high number of employers and employees who are still claiming benefits.</p></speech>

Approximately 1,500 or 1,600 cases had compliance issues to sort out.  That is down to 300 still open.  We had the reconciliation process, which was essentially the balancing of the scheme, because for the first five weeks we paid everybody &euro;410 per week.  That was a policy decision and we knew we would have an overpayment there.</p> <p>  The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, structure is a bit different.  It is still linked to a reduction in turnover but we do a far more real-time compliance programme as businesses are claiming.  Members may be aware that in June last year we introduced the eligibility review form.  Every month, the business had to tell us its level of turnover so as to do a comparison with the 2019 base year.  There is an ongoing basis-----</p></speech>

The highest monthly figure for EWSS was July last.  The payment for July was &euro;452.6 million.  There could be a little bit of a lag but the payment for November, now finished, is &euro;321.4 million.  As I stated, the payment for July was approximately &euro;452 million.

Is an approach being taken to review this sector by sector?  We know, for example, the construction sector has no restrictions now but there is a very high number of employers and employees there in claims for EWSS.  What are the Revenue Commissioners doing in this respect?  How many staff are being deployed in order to review compliance checks in that sector, for example, and in many more?</p></speech>

Last week we were looking at elements of the construction sector that are still claiming.  By and large, those figures are going down significantly as things have opened.  The system was based on an annual turnover and the turnover rules still apply.  There may well be certain conditions.  By and large, accommodation, food services, arts, entertainment and recreation are the big elements of the EWSS overall and increasingly on the monthly system.  We can produce monthly analysis of the sector support if that is helpful to the Deputy.</p></speech>

Essentially, the wage subsidy scheme is run through the PAYE system.  When we are reviewing these cases, we are actually looking at the operation of PAYE incorporating EWSS.  On our compliance staff throughout the past nearly two years, a significant proportion of compliance staff have been involved in the subsidy schemes because we have been restricted in what we can do in our audit and debt collection.  Hundreds of our staff are looking at elements of the wage subsidy scheme.  It is a significant resource.</p> <p>  We used much real-time data analytics.  We get weekly payroll figures and so we have the analysis of pay levels.  The eligibility review form has been a really important factor in being able to look at real-time level of turnover and comparing that with 2019 and our other datasets.  Unfortunately, we have seen some examples of what I would call absolute fraudulent behaviour under the EWSS.</p></speech>

This is not like normal tax evasion.  Unfortunately, any repayment system will lead to unscrupulous activity.  The temporary wage subsidy scheme had a great basis in that a person had to be on the payroll before anybody dreamt of a subsidy scheme.  People had to be on the payroll on 28 February 2020.  EWSS allows new businesses and employees.  In the context of the money we have paid, it is a really small amount, but we are very concerned and have referred certain cases to the Garda.  We work closely with the Department of Social Protection.  I distinguish the fraudulent-type case completely from businesses that may have thought they would have been eligible and expected turnover to drop but the weather was better through September so outdoor dining and drinking might have been better than anticipated.</p> <p>  In a way, there was some drop off through the eligibility review form.  We have been very clear that where a business had good cause to enter the scheme but it became apparent that it no longer qualified, if the business ceased its participation immediately, we tend to take a reasonable approach to what may have been claimed earlier.  We do not always seek to recover it all, even if the business falls a little short of the eligibility criteria, once there is reasonableness in the case.  The fraudulent criminal cases, small in number though they are, amount to what is essentially robbery rather than the tax evasion we are used to.</p></speech>

Revenue was involved in classification on employment status in the courier sector.  It put forward four issues which would identify and separate out self-employment around owning a vehicle, among which were that the driver paid for outgoings on the vehicle, that they were doing piece work and that they had a self-employment contract.  However, the Denny Supreme Court case showed that was out of line with how it should be and with this year's code of practice.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We also had issues around takeaway food deliveries.  There was the Karshan (Midlands) Limited case in which we looked at the employment status of takeaway food delivery.  In that case we were satisfied the contractual arrangement was one of contract of services.  We took that to appeal and were successful in the High Court.  There is an impression that Revenue is sitting on its hands in this area.  Every year we engage with our colleagues in Social Protection and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, looking at classification and bogus self-employment where we have evidence to support an approach we do that.</p></speech>

Mr. Cody mentioned workers at the lowest end in this sector.  The Committee of Public Accounts is concerned about this because these are some of the most vulnerable workers in the State.</p> <p>  Was this discontinued because it could be seen as unlawful under Irish law because it takes a whole group of workers as self-employed and that cannot be done in Irish law, as confirmed in the Denny case and by Mr. Mark Connaughton in 2009?  He said there is no legislative provision for appeals officers to make decisions on groups or classes of workers.

I refer to withholding tax on couriers' expenses.  Some Revenue documents refer to withholding tax several times.  The deal included a flat-rate expenses allowance for couriers.  It was a system exclusively for employees.  It is itemised on Revenue's website.  Flat-rate expenses allow workers to claim back costs.  Nowhere in the 1997 tax deal with representatives of the courier sector is withholding tax mentioned.  That system is there to deal with PAYE workers.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The problem with the deal was that it de facto made all couriers self-employed.  If an employee wanted to try to change that, it would be very difficult.  The power relationship, as Mr. Cody acknowledged, is very limited insofar as the cards available for the employee to play are concerned.  They have to take an individual case to Scope in the Department of Social Protection and then possibly to the High Court.  It made it impossible.  This is one reason we are concerned about it because it made it impossible for an employee to change it.  No cycle or motorcycle courier would be in a position to jump easily through all those hoops.  Would Mr. Cody agree?</p></speech>

Our challenge is to deal with the contractual arrangement.  The flat-rate scheme is part of the withholding system that was used in 1997.  It was to give effect to the fact the self-assessed taxpayer would have expenses in the normal course and this was a simplified system to try to make sure they were in the tax system.  It was also in the background where the determination in the sector had been that these people were self-employed from a social protection perspective.  That was the environment.  I was looking at the papers on this going back to the 1980s.  It was a challenging sector at the time.  The system has moved on.  Secure email and so on has had an impact on the use of motorcycle and cycle couriers.</p><p>It is not all-pervasive.  Van couriers, in the context of e-commerce, are the growing thing.  I was looking at statistics yesterday in the context of using the NACE code couriers are in and the ratio is about 3:1 of employees to self-employed.</p></speech>

However, the employer's PRSI contribution is different for a self-employed worker than for a PAYE worker.   We all know that.  Has Revenue done a calculation of the differential?  It is a whole sector.  It is being wound down and I see in the papers the witnesses supplied for today that it is down to two firms.  That is welcome but there is a category of workers who were not getting their correct PRSI contributions and the State was not receiving employer's PRSI.  Has Revenue done a calculation of the loss of revenue to the State on that or put a figure on it?</p></speech>

The agreement we looked at was to apply the PAYE system to self-employed couriers.  That is what we were doing.  It is interesting to look at the figures in relation to the sector and to the economy.  From 2010 to 2019 there was not any significant change in the level of self-employed numbers in the economy or S class PRSI people.</p></speech>

If the workers in that sector were employees as opposed to being grouped together and counted as self-employed from 1997 up to the discontinuation of the scheme, there is a huge differential there in PRSI contributions to the State.  I ask for a "Yes" or "No" answer.  Has Revenue done a calculation of the loss to the State over that period?  If the workers were treated as employees, what would the PRSI gain from that at the beginning, as opposed to the PRSI gained because of the classification as self-employed?  That is the question.  It is a "Yes" or "No".  I am not locking into an argument over it.  I am asking the question.</p></speech>

That is an issue probably primarily for the Department of Social Protection and perhaps for the Department of Finance.  It is more of a policy question as to how certain activities are to be treated.  From Revenue's point of view, it is about applying the law as it exists, rather than as one might want it to be.</p></speech>

We have had Government approval for an additional 900 staff.  That was subsequently increased.  Even as far back as the 2017 budget, we had an additional &euro;2 million for ICT.  We built up that.  Mr. Harrahill may want to flesh it out a bit.</p></speech>

The other piece that involved the organisation involved all the engagement with business.  In 2019, the year before Brexit kicked in, we would have had seminars hosted right across the country that involved approximately 2,000 businesses.  We would have engaged directly with 100,000-plus businesses.  We would have been instrumental in getting businesses to register for customs.  The figure was about 25,000 businesses, so there was a very high level of interaction and engagement.</p></speech>

I have a table on Brexit-related expenditure from 2017 until October 2021, broken down by ICT developments, Brexit infrastructure and accommodation, and other Brexit expenses.  Taking 2020 as the year we are looking at, pay was &euro;26.8 million.  We are talking about ICT developments of just over &euro;700,000.  The previous year it was &euro;2.1 million.  The figure for infrastructure is &euro;9.6 million.  The previous year, it was &euro;3.4 million.  This year up to October, it is &euro;14.8 million.  Regarding other Brexit expenses, which will cover a lot of the engagement piece, the figure in 2020 was &euro;1.5 million.  So far this year, it has been &euro;1.5 million.  Overall, taking in the period from 2017 to October 2021, about &euro;120 million is relevant to the Brexit aspect.</p> <p>  On ICT developments and staffing, we are, as we like to say, an integrated tax and customs administration, so some of this leads to additional compliance across-----</p></speech>

We have had a lot of media talk about big concerts that will take place next year.  One particular gentleman, of whom I happen to be a fan, will do five nights in Croke Park.  As a Monaghan man, that makes me very envious, which is probably less the case for a Kilkenny man who would be more used to going to Croke Park.  Will that gentleman pay tax on the income he will earn as a result of ticket sales etc?</p></speech>

However, because foreign resident artistes merely have a transitory presence in the State, there are numerous practical difficulties associated with enforcing such a liability. </blockquote> <p>As I said, that dates to 2018.

The original figure was &euro;1.636 billion which, according to details in the correspondence, was the assessment set out by Revenue at the time.  It related to intellectual property.  As I understand it, there was a court judgment and the judge agreed with Revenue on the figure and the classification.  The court judgment looked at the debate regarding whether this figure was part of normal trading practices or a capital exchange, which was how Revenue treated it, that would have brought in a 33% tax rate.  Perrigo argued that this figure was part of its normal day-to-day business and it wanted it treated at the normal corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  I do not want to be unfair to Mr. Cody, but is it the case that it was subsequently treated at the normal corporation tax rate of 12.5%?  Or was it 33%?</p></speech>

I need to correct a comment the Chair made.  The judge did not find.  He dealt with a judicial review around our entitlement to raise the assessment.  That was the subject of the High Court case.  It was a judicial review that Revenue won, which Deputy Catherine Murphy referenced.  I will mention that when we are judicially reviewed, in general, our record is that our processes and procedures are found to be compliant.  The judicial review was about the processes, procedures and our entitlement to raise an assessment.  As the judge pointed out in his judgment, he did not give any decision or view on whether the tax liability, as per the assessment, was correct or not.</p><p>That was, as the judge said, a matter for the Tax Appeals Commission and, subsequently, for the courts, if that was the case.

We have given the information that is publicly available.  I can do that.  I have also set out how the settlement and assessment processes work.  Every few years, the Comptroller and Auditor General comes and reviews Revenue settlements and has full access to our data and files.  The most recent review of tax settlements took place in 2018.  This is probably not something an Accounting Officer normally says, but we find the reviews the Comptroller and Auditor General does of our settlement process very helpful.  We have developed and enhanced our Revenue case management system based on recommendations.  To go back to the question of who we are accountable to, we are accountable to the Oireachtas.  We also must operate within the legislative framework that sets out what I can do.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that at the end of the process, Perrigo finished up paying a figure of &euro;266 million.  I am trying to figure out whether the tax liability was calculated as 12.5% or 33%.  I know we are not going to settle this today but we do not have much of an explanation as to how that figure was reduced by so much.  Even if this was treated as attracting a tax liability of 12.5%, the figure would be double what was yielded at the end of the day.  It would be closer to &euro;600 million than &euro;266 million.   That is the only point I am trying to make.  Can the Revenue Commissioners give a further explanation in writing?  We do not have time to pursue it.</p></speech>

I assure the committee that we raised the assessment on the basis of the information we had at the time.  We had to raise the assessment when we raised it or we would have been out of time and been unable to raise any assessment.  We raised the assessment based on the best information we had at that time.  Subsequent to the raising of the assessment, as happens in most cases in which we raise an assessment, there was further engagement and further information was provided.  If we had the information available to us at the end of the process when we started, we would have raised an assessment for &euro;297 million, having regard to the piece that is carried forward into earlier years.</p></speech>

The committee will then go into private session before adjourning.  The first item is the minutes of our meeting on 25 November, which have been circulated to members.  Do members wish to raise any matters relating to the minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the web page of the committee.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 2, accounts and financial statements.

It is a clear audit opinion.  It is a very small account with a very low level of turnover.</p> <p>  The second is An Foras Teanga, the language body.  It is a body that I audit jointly with my colleague in Northern Ireland.  It is one of the cross-Border bodies.  These are its 2019 financial statements.  I draw the attention of the committee to the fact that they were signed on 29 April but are only now coming to the Oireachtas.  The committee may wish to follow up in line with its policy in that regard.  In any event, it was a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  No. 3 is Institute of Technology Carlow for 2019-20.  It is a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  No. 4 is the local loans fund for 2020.  It is a clear audit opinion.  It is a very small account with a turnover in the year of &euro;1,300.  In fact, the loans outstanding at 31 December 2020 are nil, so, effectively, there should be no further transactions on that account.</p><p>The final one is the Digital Hub Development Agency financial statements for 2020.  It is a clear audit opinion.  I have drawn attention, for the second time, to an annual expenditure of &euro;227,500 in respect of a vacant site levy charge levied by the local authority on the agency.</p></speech>

Do any other members wish to come in?  No.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, there was a delay with the An Foras Teanga statements.  As is the normal procedure, we will ask the committee secretariat to notify the Comptroller and Auditor General of our concerns regarding that.  Can we agree to note the accounts and statements?  Agreed.  As usual, the listing of the accounts and financial statements will be published as part of our minutes.</p> <p>  Moving to correspondence, as previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in the normal manner, in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated.  Decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee's meetings and published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  Four items of correspondence have been flagged today in the category of correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers as a follow-up to previous meetings of this committee.  The first is No. 900B from Mr. S&eacute;an &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education, dated 17 November 2021, providing information requested by the committee regarding the use of public funds by An Taisce.  On foot of a proposal by Deputy Sean Sherlock, this is one of 11 responses to our requests for information in relation to the use of public funds by An Taisce.  We have now received eight of the 11 responses.  The eight responses account for &euro;1.2 million, or 36% of the funding An Taisce received in 2019.  Responses from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are outstanding.  They account for &euro;2.18 million, or 64% of the funding.  This item has been flagged by Deputy Matt Carthy.  It is proposed that we note and publish the item and consider the responses together once we are in receipt of them all.  Is Deputy Carthy online?</p></speech>

No.  It is proposed that we note and publish the item and consider the responses.  The next item is No. 901B from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 18 November 2021, providing information requested by the committee regarding the disclosure of details of a settlement between Revenue and Perrigo.  At our meeting of 18 November, we considered a related response, R0873, from the Tax Appeals Commission.  We discussed this matter with Revenue during today's engagement and that debate is on the public record.  It is proposed that we note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The item has was flagged by me and Deputy Catherine Murphy.  I do not think Deputy Murphy is with us.  We dealt with No. 901B earlier and we are no clearer on it because of the issue regarding Revenue and confidentiality.  That is understandable.  Time did not allow us to go any further into the issue earlier.  The tax demand was for &euro;1.636 billion.  That was subsequently reduced following a number of interventions.  The case came before a court.  The final figure was that Perrigo is due to pay Revenue is &euro;266 million.  I propose to the committee that we write to Revenue Commissioners following today's meeting.  We must recognise the fact that there has to be client confidentiality, but in the general scheme of things, the issue at stake here would appear to be whether it was treated as a capital transfer incurring a rate of tax of 33%, or one of 12.5%, as part of its normal trading profits.  I suggest we write to Revenue and seek an answer to that question.  Surely, it is a matter of how a company, and particularly, a very large one, is treated for tax, and specifically, whether it is paying the 33% or the 12.5%.  If it is 12.5%, we should seek an explanation, because even at 12.5% the figure would be more than double what it came in, namely, &euro;266 million.  A tax rate of 12.5% would have given rise to a demand of possibly between &euro;600 million and &euro;700 million.  If it is agreed by the committee, I will ask the clerk to follow up with that information from Revenue.  While recognising the fact that it is bound by confidentiality around these matters, perhaps more light can be shed on that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The next item is No. 903B from Mr. Derek Tierney, head of health infrastructure, Department of Health, dated 18 November 2021, and is a response to our request for information in relation to the analysis undertaken by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on the progress on the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  The progress report has been with the Department of Health for some time, and we have made a number of requests for sight of the report and information on the projected costs and completion date for the hospital.  The Department's position remains that:</p> <blockquote> 	the Department and the Development Board have a responsibility to ensure the successful completion of this critical project and that any discussion of costs, however hypothetical or otherwise, at this time, would prejudice enforcement of the existing contract, and very likely negatively impact or jeopardise the Development Board in its ongoing engagement with the main contractor, and the Board's responsibilities for the timely completion of this critical project. </blockquote> <p>Our invitation to the Department of Health to our meeting on 16 December, which is two weeks from today, includes this matter as an agenda item.  Also on the agenda for that meeting is the value for money review of the nursing homes support scheme, or fair deal scheme.  As detailed in our January report on our examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the scheme, the review was initiated by the Department of Health in March 2018 and was due for publication in March 2019.  More than two and a half years later this item of correspondence states that a response on that matter will follow without specifying when.  I do not think committee members will be happy with that.  We recommended that the Department provide the committee with updates, but these have not been forthcoming.  That is most disappointing.  It is proposed that we note and publish the item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The item has been flagged by me and Deputy Catherine Murphy.  Do any members want to speak on the item?</p></speech>

There are reports of the spiralling costs of the national children's hospital.  Judging by this piece of correspondence, the Department is blatantly refusing to engage with the committee, citing commercial sensitivities and asserting that its focus is on completing the project.  Optimistically, this hospital will not open until at least 2024.</p><p>Come that time, I fully expect the Department will tell us that it cannot comment because a legal case or negotiations are ongoing.  This is a complete lack of engagement in a new development.  It seems to serve no other purpose, and the Department wants to kick the can down the road thus avoiding any responsibility for, what I believe to be, gross incompetency.  In the end, it will likely be measured in billions of taxpayers' money.  Will the committee write to the Department, ahead of the hearing on 16 December, specifically asking it to outline the distinction between negotiations and commercial sensitivities that exist today versus the updated costs it previously provided to the committee?</p></speech>

There is concern in relation to that issue.  This time last year, members will recall, we were trying to arrange for the Department and the hospital board to come in to discuss this.  We delayed it and put it back to 9 February to facilitate this report on the children's hospital.  I was actually at that site the other day.  I am at a loss at this point as to how we are in a situation whereby the project is this far advanced without being able to ascertain the final costs.  I do not expect them to pin that down to the nearest dollar because obviously there are tweaks taking place and different elements built in for construction inflation.  How come the taxpayers, the Oireachtas, this committee and indeed the health committee, which has pursued this vigorously as well, cannot be given a figure for the estimated cost of this project when it is completed?  We are left guessing.  The media are left speculating, as are we.  We are trying to pick up hints from what we are being told.  As Chairperson, I find it totally disrespectful to be honest.  I do not see why this figure is not available at this point.  There is something seriously wrong if the Department cannot state the final cost of this project or when it will be completed.  I support the Deputy's request that we send correspondence to the Secretary General of the Department prior to his appearance here in two weeks' time.  That is agreed.</p> <p>  We should also ask about the value for money review of the nursing homes support scheme.  It is incredible that a Department is in the situation whereby it does not have that report completed two and a half years later.  The world outside moves on apace, but somehow or another, this report cannot be done in a two-and-a-half-year timeframe.  We should ask, if the committee is agreeable, that the Department should complete that report and give us an update on it when it comes before the committee.  At this point, Oireachtas Members, who are elected on behalf of the citizenry who pay the taxes that facilitate these schemes and everything else, need to know the answer to this.  We will ask the secretariat to include in the correspondence that we are disappointed and that we feel it has dragged on unnecessarily for a long period of time.  In any circumstances, it should have been completed by now.  It should have been completed a long time ago.  When Department officials come before us in two weeks' time, they should have those reports with them.  That is agreed.  Do any other members wish to come in?</p></speech>

It is a big scheme that runs in the region of &euro;1 billion per annum.  It is important that we get that report.  If everyone is happy with that, we will ask the secretariat to follow up on that and we will have it flagged for when they come before us.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 910B from Mr. Bernard Gloster, chief executive, Tusla, dated 22 November.  It provides further information that was requested by the committee at our meeting with Tusla on 21 October.  This is a comprehensive response to 22 requests for information arising from that meeting, including a number of supporting documents.  As it was flagged by Deputy Catherine Murphy, who is not in attendance, I propose we hold it over until next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I wish to note, in contrast to the previous item, this is a comprehensive report on all the issues we asked Tusla to come back to us on.  We will move on now.  That completes correspondence received.</p> <p>  Next is No. 4, our work programme.  We have two public engagements remaining this year.  Next Thursday, 9 December, we will engage with the Department of Social Protection in relation to the 2020 appropriation account for Vote 37 - Social Protection.  Also on the agenda is the Social Insurance Fund and the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2020 report on the accounts of the public services, which covers chapter 9 - regularity of social welfare payments; chapter 10 - management of social welfare appeals; and chapter 11 - controls over the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.</p> <p>  On 16 December, we will engage with the Department of Health, as stated earlier, regarding its 2020 appropriation account for Vote 38 &ndash; Health.  The Department has been made aware that the committee wishes to discuss the two outstanding reports, namely the children&rsquo;s hospital report, which was submitted to the Department of Health at the start of this year, and the value for money review of the nursing homes support scheme, which is often referred to as the fair deal scheme.</p> <p>  Last week we agreed our work programme for early in the new year.  I thank the members for submitting their items on that.  Our first engagement will be with RT&Eacute; on 20 January, and the secretariat will work to schedule meetings with the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland thereafter.</p> <p>  We will continue to revisit the work programme each week.  Do members wish to raise any other matters on the work programme or are they happy that we have got it right this time?  If anybody wants to flag an issue regarding those invited bodies, I ask that they do so as early as possible with the clerk to the committee and that they want answers on a specific issue.  That concludes our consideration of the work programme.</p> <p>  The next item is any other business.  Do members wish to raise any other matters?  No.</p> <p>  We will now go into private session before adjourning until 9.30 a.m. on 9 December, when we will engage with the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

I remind members and officials to ensure their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of this meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment, even though members and officials are participating remotely.  The meeting has been convened to consider the Supplementary Estimates for Vote 26, education and skills, and Vote 45, further and higher education, research, innovation and science, which were referred to this committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, the Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for special education and inclusion, Deputy Madigan, and their officials.  I thank them for the briefing documents they have provided for the meeting.  We will spend approximately one hour and a half with the Minister and after that we will spend approximately 30 minutes with the Minister of State at the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Niall Collins.  I ask the Minister to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2021120200002#A00500"><p>I am pleased to be here this morning together with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan and officials from my Department.  I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to speak to members and for its consideration of my Department&rsquo;s Supplementary Estimate for 2021.  Following approval by the Government, my Department is seeking a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;267 million for 2021.  This is a significant supplementary requirement from my Department and represents a variation on the Department&rsquo;s overall net allocation for 2021 of some 3%.  One of the main drivers of this requirement is my Department&rsquo;s ongoing response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on our schools, for example, increased substitution, personal protective equipment, PPE, and additional staff.  We have continued our broader programme of investment in our schools, such as our significant investment in schools&rsquo; information and communications technology, ICT.  We have also continued to progress much-needed school building projects in light of the significant pressure on the schools building programme.</p> <p>  My Department has provided detailed briefing on this Supplementary Estimate for members but I will briefly outline the key elements for the information of the committee.  There is an additional pay requirement in the school sector of &euro;60 million under a number of subheads.  For context, the pay allocation for the schools sector is more than &euro;5.6 billion in 2021 and, therefore, this represents a variation of some 1%.  Payroll for school teaching and non-teaching staff spans four subheads in Vote 26, three of which require additional allocations with one showing a saving.  The overall excess is mainly due to the need to allocate funding for staffing resources in schools, in particular, for the new Covid learning and support scheme, CLASS.  This scheme is designed to mitigate learning loss and support pupil and student mental health and well-being in light of the impact of school closures in 2020 and 2021.  The scheme commenced in October of this year.</p> <p>  An allocation is also required to meet the 1% pay increases for staff in the sector from 1 October 2021, which were not provided for in the original Revised Estimates Volume, REV, and a range of other payroll subhead pressures that are being partly offset by a reduction in substitution costs arising from school closures in January to March 2021.  An additional &euro;8 million, which equates to a 0.6% increase, is required to meet the projected cost of superannuation for retiring school staff.  The latest projected number of teacher retirements and the individual cost of pension lump sum payments arising in 2021 are greater than originally forecast.  An additional allocation of &euro;58 million is required to cover the cost of a further round of Covid-related capitation grants paid to schools in September.  Members will recall that the REV included an allocation for such grants for terms 2 and 3 of the 2020-21 year.</p><p>Given the uncertainty surrounding Covid-19, it was previously flagged to the committee that an allocation in respect of term 1 would be made at a later point.  I am pleased that schools have now received funding to enable them to replenish stocks of PPE and hand sanitiser and to meet enhanced cleaning and supervision costs for the current term.  I can also confirm that it is my intention that a further such payment will be made to schools in early 2022 for the next term of the school year.</p><p> A significant additional capital allocation is also provided for in this Supplementary Estimate.  A sum of &euro;102 million of this allocation is by way of investment in ICT in our schools.  A sum of &euro;52 million is being provided under the national recovery and resilience programme for two projects in the education sector.  One is to support learners in schools who are most at risk of educational disadvantage because of lack of access to appropriate digital infrastructure.  The other strand, which has now commenced, aims to provide high-speed broadband to those primary schools where the national broadband plan, NBP, and commercial provision will not be in place to provide the required level of connectivity.  The funding for these projects is being front-loaded by the Exchequer but will be reimbursed from the EU's recovery and resilience fund.  Further ICT funding is included for schools.  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;98 million in capital funding is being sought for my Department's schools building programme.  The reason for the Supplementary Estimate requirement is significant budgetary pressure driven primarily by a strong spend and delivery in 2021 across the entire programme.  This strong delivery has been facilitated by the continued progression of schools building projects during the Covid period to support the operation of the school system.  This includes provision for an early payment of the minor works grants to all primary schools.  This is particularly important in supporting schools to manage any ventilation issues at school level.  A saving of &euro;20 million on school transport is also being taken into account in this Supplementary Estimate.  This projected saving is mainly due to the reduced costs arising during the school closures at the start of 2021.</p><p> An estimated additional &euro;53 million in appropriations-in-aid in excess of the amount provided for in the original REV allocations is included in this Supplementary Estimate and will partly offset the expenditure pressures I have outlined.  The bulk of this additional income is represented by increased pension contributions, with some additional funding having been received due to refunds by schools of unspent Covid grants.</p><p> I am happy to discuss these issues in more detail.  I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee.</p></speech>

The first questioner up is Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; but, before I call on him, I wish to ask a question.  The Minister is probably aware that the committee is doing a module of work on leaving certificate reform.  We have had a lot of round-table discussion with various groups and organisations.  It has been a very enlightening conversation for everybody involved, especially the members of the education committee.  We would like to bring in the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and the State Examinations Commission, SEC, but the NCCA report is with the Department at the moment.  When does the Minister envisage being able to publish that?  It will allow the committee to continue its work on reform of the leaving certificate.  We would like to publish our report by December but we will be unable to do that now because it looks as if neither the NCCA nor the SEC will be before use prior to Christmas.  When does she expect to be able to publish the NCCA report on leaving certificate reform?  When do her officials say it can be published?</p></speech>

As for senior cycle reform specifically, I acknowledge the enormous body of work the NCCA has undertaken, a body of work that took almost five years to complete and involved extraordinary engagement with a variety of stakeholders, including schools and students directly on the ground, and the widest remit of partners in education.  I have met with the NCCA and received its report.  There is a considerable body of work to be done in analysing the report, and clarifications might need to be sought.  It is my intention to expedite that as a matter of priority.  I will do that in the shortest timeframe possible.  I appreciate that this will facilitate the work the committee wishes to pursue.</p></speech>

I wish to deal with the issue of the guidance for mask wearing for children in third class and above.  It is fair to say that the guidance was released at the eleventh hour.  There was only 12 hours' notice.  Kids were expected to be in school the next morning.  I think there has been a difficulty with the language.  It can be seen as being framed almost in the context of confrontation and an assumption of non-co-operation from parents.  It puts schools in an invidious position.  Schools will step up to the mark, I have no doubt, and probably a great many people at school level, parents and even kids will show calm heads and sense.  As for the national public health emergency team, NPHET guidelines and the lack of clarity, it took an incredible amount of time before the narrative came directly from the Government.  We have to avoid that into the future.  Could I have initially a general commentary from the Minister on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2021120200002#B00600"><p>I appreciate the Deputy's question.  The education sector consistently and without fault has always followed the public health advice.  I have said regularly that I hope that it has come as an assurance to parents and guardians and our students and our staff in the entire school sector that when public health advice becomes available, we have always followed it.  The nature of Covid has meant that the public health advice changes at times.  When it does and when it asks us to pivot in a particular direction, we do that.  When we are asked to bring in additional measures, we do that.  We have done that throughout the management of Covid.  We received the strong recommendation and advice of public health that a short-term measure should be introduced.  It is important that we acknowledge that this is viewed as a short-term measure.  As a consequence of that, the Cabinet decided on Tuesday to accept the recommendations and advices of the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, and NPHET in this regard.  The Department had to wait for the advice and expertise from the health protection surveillance unit, as we have always done, in respect of implementation.  We received that late on Tuesday evening and, on receipt of that, the guidelines issued to schools.  The guidelines always issue following the recommendations of public health.</p> <p>  I wish to be clear on the guidelines.  This is not a position any one of us want to be in at this point.  None of us wants to have to deal with Covid on an ongoing basis.  We have an ever-changing situation that is in a constant state of flux.  Notwithstanding that, we have to act on the public health advice.  The advice was issued to the schools.  Flexibility and discretion have been given so as to bed that down over the coming days with students.  I wish to say-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2021120200002#B00700"><p>I thank the Minister for her answer, which I accept.  I welcome the talk of flexibility.  As I said, it is to be hoped we will meet with solution-oriented good sense on all sides.</p> <p>  I will move straight to my second question.  We all hope that this is short term.  There is an issue faced by hearing-impaired children who rely partly on lip reading.  If the pandemic is to go on for a considerable period, we will need to look into mitigations for that and extra supports into the future.</p><p>Schools will be relied on to supply masks.  There will be children from disadvantaged backgrounds, children from households without a great deal of money, and children from quite chaotic backgrounds where this will just not be on anybody's agenda.  We will, therefore, need to rely on the schools.  I have no doubt that they will step up, but they will need whatever supports are necessary.</p><p> With regard to required mitigation, we have had many conversations on ventilation and high-efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filters.  At this stage, people are asking why the work in this regard has not been done and when we will get to where we need to be.  Even where there are CO2 monitors, there are freezing conditions because windows are being opened and all the rest of it.  We just need to do the due diligence on ventilation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2021120200002#C00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  There is clear guidance to the effect that where it is not appropriate for a child to wear a mask, which can be for a variety of reasons, he or she will not be required to do so.  We are very clear about that.  If there is a specific issue regarding which wearing a mask would disadvantage a child in the way the Deputy has outlined, such as an issue concerning speech or hearing, a mask will not be required.  Principals have significant flexibility in determining what best suits the student.</p> <p>  Significant funding has been provided to schools.  In excess of &euro;57 million has been provided this term alone to meet PPE requirements and so on.  I can confirm that this funding will also be made available for this coming term.  There has never been a question of resourcing within the schools.</p> <p>  Specifically on ventilation, we have been told very clearly that natural ventilation is the best form of ventilation in schools.  I recognise that there are specific difficulties in different schools.  No two schools are the same but we have taken a very proactive approach . For example, an engineer&rsquo;s report or an architect's report may be taken into account.  We rely on the expertise of the Department.  A technical team is available and is working with schools individually on the ground.  If a vent or window must be replaced, that is done. If there is a different requirement, such as a requirement to install a filter, that will be acted upon.  I want to quote the advice of the expert group on ventilation.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for the opening statement.</p><p>The Chairman referred to the large body of work we are doing on leaving certificate reform.  That we are blind to the content of the NCCA report has made it more difficult to do the work in the comprehensive way that I think the Chairman wants it done.  It would be of great benefit and assistance to the committee if it could see the report as early as possible.  Similarly, in terms of the <font color="#2F2F2F">comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n</font>poibl&iacute; &oacute; thaobh an Ghaeilge and the work that has been ongoing in that regard, we have heard, at meetings of the education committee and Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta, agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge, the Irish language community speaking with one voice on the specifications for T1 and T2 schools.  I would like the Minister to be cognisant of the worries of the Irish language community in that regard.</p><p>To turn specifically to the Estimates, could the Minister quantify the level of disruption in special educational needs, SEN, provision?  A lot of it is due to the substitute shortage.  In many schools. SEN teachers are being asked to substitute in mainstream classroom environments to cover for teachers with Covid.  I am concerned about the scarring effect on children who require special educational intervention.  Related to that is the budget line around for CLASS.  It is listed as having commenced in October.  Have we really been able to make headway in introducing it given the level of disruption in respect of substitution?</p><p>I wish to follow on from Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s question on the air filtration systems.  I realise we should be thinking about ventilation rather than filtration necessarily, but has the Department costed in a meaningful way the introduction of filtration systems, with HEPA filters or otherwise?  Has it figures on that?</p><p>I have a question about the pensions jump.  It has come back as higher than anticipated.  Given the composition of our teaching workforce is known, what is taking the Department unaware?  Are teachers stepping out of the profession earlier than expected?  Is that why there is a jump in the pensions provision?  In a situation where we need all hands to the pump, is the Minister making sure she is doing all she can to guard against teacher burnout and teachers leaving?</p><p>My final question is on school transport.  I noticed that &euro;20 million in savings was realised.  I understand the reason for that under-expenditure but hate to see sustainable transport moneys handed back.  Could we not have found another way to use the money to drive the sustainable transport agenda at primary and secondary school levels, be it through the safe streets programme, the provision of a better bus fleet or otherwise?  I will leave it at that.  I thank Chairman for allowing me to contribute.</p></speech>

It can be assured that the work will be expedited as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  On T1 and T2, the consultation concluded only two days ago, on 30 November.  That will be part of the consideration.  It is important that there was an opportunity to have the widest possible consultation in advance of a decision.</p> <p>  On the CLASS support, it is too early at this point.  We will have a greater indication regarding the drawdown later because it kicked off only in the past few weeks.  We will see a greater drawdown as the year progresses.  The scheme is excellent because it provides additional support to schools for the teaching of students who have been disadvantaged due to school closures.  It provides for academic teaching and learning, but also for the creativity, socialisation and well-being aspects.  It is wide in what it encompasses.</p> <p>  On pensions, it is difficult to forecast on a year-to-year basis because there is an opportunity for people to make a decision at various times.</p> <p>  On transport, the issue was a consequence of school closures.  The figure in question refers specifically to the savings on Covid-related costs of cleaning, PPE and all that.  Moneys not spent in that regard must be returned.  Significant work is ongoing.  The Deputy will be aware of the review.  It relates to how we manage school transport, particularly in our environment.  There is an incredible body of work being done in that respect.  The first interim report was received by me, and the work continues.  I am very conscious of this.  We are certainly working on it.</p><p> On ventilation, I reiterate that we work on a case-by-case basis while recognising that different schools have different difficulties that need to be addressed.  We are following the guidance offered by the expert group, which has told us there may well be a place for these filter devices but that in the long term we need to look at making more adequate and more long-term provision within our schools.  We are doing that, whether it is vents or windows or whatever the case may be.  We are working individually with the schools.  That work has taken place already.  Specifically on the filters, the Department is-----</p></speech>

I support this and believe it is very worthwhile.  I am conscious a significant portion of these Supplementary Estimates is for the purposes of meeting the challenges faced by the Department of Education with the ongoing incidence of Covid-19 in our community.  I commend the Minister, the Minister of State, and the Department on keeping the schools open.  It is essential we continue to keep the schools open for our children.  I am aware public health advice is given very frequently to the Minister in the Department of Education, and I understand fully when the Minister, Deputy Foley, says that she is following public health advice.  I would, however, like to see more coming from the public health advisers with information and advice on the importance of keeping schools open for children and the importance of attending school for a child's educational development, social development and personal development.  I believe this type of development is an essential ingredient in public health and that children must attend school.</p> <p>  I was very pleased to hear the Minister's response to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; about children in schools who have special needs.  I received an email recently from a nine-year-old girl in my constituency who was very upset about the fact that masks were going to have to be worn in the classroom.  Her concern was not about wearing the mask herself, but because she is deaf she is concerned.  Because she cannot hear, she cannot understand others unless she can see their lips.  I am very pleased with the Minister's response to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; with regard to issues like that.</p> <p>  My only question to the Minister is about antigen testing in schools.  I am conscious it only started last Monday, and I welcome that.  How is that going to be assessed?  Will the Department of Education provide updates as to how the scheme is operating or will the information come from the Department of Health?  Although it is not a panacea to all of the issues that arise, like most other members of the committee, I believe antigen testing is a helpful tool for the Department of Education and the Minister to ensure schools continue to provide education to our children.  Will the Department of Education or the Department of Health be giving these updates?</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I are adamant that keeping our schools open is an absolute priority for us.  It is a priority for the Government, and the Deputy is correct that it is a priority also for wider society.  If we have learned anything through Covid, we have learned of the need to keep the schools open, and that children and young people are best served when they are actually in school and in the school setting.  Notwithstanding the situations where there had to be remote teaching and learning, and acknowledging the enormous body of work done by the school community to facilitate that, the entire school community is of the strong view that children are best served while in the school setting.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I are ensuring every possible support and every possible resource that is required is put in place in all aspects of education.</p> <p>  Specifically on the antigen testing, the Deputy will be aware it is a public health recommendation.  It was advised by the Chief Medical Officer to be implemented by the HSE.  It is a health implementation.  Obviously, my Department co-operates fully with the Department of Health in that regard, but the evaluation of it is very much for the Department of Health.  It began on Monday, and there has been extraordinary buy-in by parents and everyone concerned.  We have seen the applications for antigen tests.  There were significant applications on Monday, fewer on Tuesday and possibly fewer again as we go on.  The co-operation from families has been extraordinary.  Public Health has been very clear in saying antigen testing is just one tool along with all of the other infection prevention and control measures that exist within our schools such as hand cleaning, hand sanitising, personal protective equipment, additional supervision, reconfiguration of buildings and so on.  It is a necessary tool.  To answer the Deputy's question, it is a Department of Health and HSE initiative, and it is being managed by them, but obviously we will support that in any way we can.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister the Minister of State for the hard work they are doing.  The fact that schools have remained open is a massive plus.  It has been a major sigh of relief for parents that schools have remained open, especially for working parents.</p> <p>  I will start by mentioning substitution.  Over recent weeks there has been a lot of talk about substitution, and once again I thank the Minister for the steps that she has taken, most recently with the block release of student teachers and with allowing people to work over their 22-hour contracts at second level.  These are massive steps that will help to alleviate the concerns around substitution.</p> <p>  Some issues have been flagged to me by parents, especially in the area of buses and school transport.  Some emails are coming in to me from schools with parents expressing concern about the turnover of buses and the sanitisation of buses between drop-off and collection.  I want to flag with the Minister that this is a concern expressed to me by parents.  Perhaps it could be taken up with Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>  We are finding it quite difficult to get people as bus escorts for students with autism spectrum disorder, ASD.  There are also issues where a couple of schools had to fund people privately.  There is the case of Clogheen Kerry Pike National School in particular.  I will flag that separately with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, in an email with regard to the funding of that ASD bus escort.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for the work they are doing.  It is appreciated.  I can follow up with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, offline with regard to that ASD bus escort.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, might like to come in here also.  I acknowledge that significant funding is being made available for the hire of school transport and given the necessity for sanitisation and so on.  We are very cognisant of the need for all of that to be implemented and to be implemented well in our systems.  We have made the provision and it is up and running.  It is working well.  There has been extraordinary compliance and goodwill by all of our students and our operators.</p><p>Specifically on the work that has been done around substitution, I want to acknowledge the enormous co-operation from everyone to make that possible.  There has been an extraordinary generosity on behalf of our students, which we want to acknowledge, and by the higher education institutions, which have been facilitating them.  There has also been an extraordinary generosity on behalf of teachers who were on career breaks, teachers who were on job-share who can now work additional hours and can work them in a different school from their own school.  Reference was made earlier to retired teachers and they can now work unrestricted to the end of this school year.  There has been great generosity there.  I know the Deputy has an interest in the 22-hour provision for those who have availability after their commitments in schools at second level have been completed.  Those people are available as well.  The Minister of State might like to come in at this point.</p></speech>

I can follow that up with him if he has a specific issue around the recruitment of a bus escort.  We want to make sure we have transport for children with additional needs and if it means additional recruitment needs to be done then we need to facilitate that.  I can speak with the Deputy on that if he wants to email me about it.</p></speech>

They require additional support in school to make up for lost time.  However, due to the substitution crisis many schools have had to deploy their special education teachers away from their teaching to cover mainstream absences.  This is far from ideal but it is the reality.  Last year schools could bank those special education hours to use in other times so that children with additional needs did not lose out.  I do not understand why this banking option is not being reintroduced.  While the substitution announcement last week is positive, special education hours have been and will continue to be lost without the banking system being brought in.  Will the Department safeguard the educational hours while committing to bringing back the banked hours system?</p> <p>  I also have serious concerns with the levels of support that school leaders are receiving from the HSE.  It was said that school leaders can still contact the HSE for help but that is not the same as bringing back testing and tracing to their previous levels.  School leaders should not have to contact parents of close contacts and organise for antigen tests.  They have enough on their plates and many of them are teaching principals.  We need to bring back school-specific contact tracing teams but this has not happened.  Will this happen?  Leaving certificate students and their parents have been in contact with me and they are concerned about the loss of teaching hours due to teacher absences, which cannot be helped.  I welcome the initiatives to try to find substitutes but students are missing out for weeks at a time.  It varies from school to school and within schools from class to class.  How will this be addressed when it comes to setting leaving certificate exams this year?</p></speech>

There is no withdrawal of provisions; it just means that SETs will be used for the purpose they should be used.  SETs should not be used for substitution purposes.  As a last resort schools were allowed to use them where there were substitution issues and where there were teacher absences but hopefully with the success of the vaccine roll-out and the measures the Minister has put in place, that need should not be there in the same way it was in the past.  Schools have been asked not to bank those hours because children with additional needs require the support there and then.  Otherwise they are getting intensive teaching in a short space and time, when it should be done over a period of time.  We acknowledge that there was a substitution crisis and I hope that has been resolved in the main.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2021120200002#E00500"><p>I refer to some of the other issues the Deputy raised.  In relation to the HSE and contact tracing in Dublin, he will have seen that is a public health decision.  The public health authorities have made various decisions at various times on operational matters.  They made decisions in late September on the operation of full contact tracing within our schools.  At that point we had thousands of children who were excluded from school as close contacts because they did not have Covid symptoms and they did not develop Covid while they were stood down from school for ten days or more.  There was a view at that time that it was not sustainable going forward that we would have such a large cohort of students out of school.  Notwithstanding that, as I said that was a public health decision.</p> <p>  Another public health decision has been enacted as of Monday, which is on the roll-out of antigen testing.  I want to acknowledge, as I said earlier, that there has been extraordinary buy-in from parents and guardians in that.  We have seen that in the early days.  I want to acknowledge that principals and school leaders have been hugely co-operative and positive in relation to its development for the schools.  Many of them have been looking for antigen testing and the HSE has ensured that is in place.</p> <p>  Principals are being asked that when there is a positive case in a pod, that parent will inform the principal and the principal then informs the other five sets of parents within that pod.  After that it is entirely a matter for parents.  Parents apply to the call centre for the antigen tests, and as I said there has been an extraordinary buy-in to that in the last number of days.  Equally, that is a measure for primary schools within the specialist schools setting as the Minister of State will detail.  The contact tracing system remains in place.  These are public health decisions that are implemented by the public health bodies.  This includes contact tracing and antigen testing as we have pointed out earlier.</p></speech>

I want to follow up on what Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan said about antigen tests and the importance of them.  They might not be the silver bullet but I have no doubt that they would help the school community.  Maybe the Minister of State could expand on that a little bit.</p> <p>  The other issue is the vaccine for the under-12s.  I know this is not the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility but a recent report stated that the Covid numbers in primary schools have rocketed in recent weeks.  However, the numbers are not as high in secondary schools.  That is the case even though secondary school pupils would probably be mixing more outside of the school than primary school children would.  Has the Minister spoken to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, or the people within the Department of Health about this?  Has the Minister&rsquo;s had any conversation on vaccinating under-12s?  They are rolling out the vaccine for under-12s in other countries and I am surprised and disappointed with the delay in Ireland.  It should be more of a priority because we have all been saying that the vaccine is working and the proof speaks for itself.  I ask the Minister to comment on what conversations she has had on that with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, or that her officials have had with Department of Health officials or any other people within the area of health.</p></speech>

There has been terrific goodwill and co-operation within the school community to make it operational.  The call centre is running and it is my understanding from parents that they receive antigen tests very quickly after applying.  As I have said previously, it is an additional tool.  There are great learnings from Covid and one of the things we have learned is that a whole suite of measures are required at a variety of different times.  This is an additional measure to complement all the other measures that are in place in schools, such as: hand cleaning; additional supervision; PPE; and hand sanitiser  The co-operation of schools has also been crucial, including having staggered opening and closing hours and break times, etc.</p><p>It is an additional tool.</p><p> On the issue of the vaccination for the under-12s specifically, the Chairman will appreciate it has been approved by the European Medicines Agency, EMA.  We are currently awaiting the approval of the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, for that here.  In response to the Chairman's specific question, I have met with officials of the Department to discuss how they envisage that roll-out and how it will be managed, offered and communicated.  In the first instance, they were clear to say they await the confirmation from NIAC.  That is the first priority.  Equally, in my communication I was very clear we await the information and the roll-out.  I am conscious it is very much a public health matter.  Public health officials are proactively organising in anticipation of the announcement of NIAC in this regard.  They have a variety of different measures potentially to put in place to make it happen.  I confirm I have met with public health officials and discussed the matter with them.  As a Department, we will keep an ongoing communication with them, notwithstanding the fact it is obviously not within our remit as the Department of Education.  I acknowledge, from my meeting and discussions with them, that they have done a considerable body of work on the anticipated roll-out.  However, they are awaiting the decision of NIAC in that regard.</p></speech>

Therefore, I appreciate where the Department is coming from, but it is important that NIAC is comfortable with the decision and that it green lights it, as it were.  For our part in the Department of Education, we have always supported public health and its recommendations.  We have implemented its recommendations and that has served us well in the education sector.  It is important to say it has been a source of great assurance and reassurance to parents and the entire school community that we have consistently followed public health advice.  It has ensured our schools continue to operate and will operate going forward.</p></speech>

I have one further question before Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; comes back in.  On the leaving certificate and the arrangements for the sitting of the leaving certificate in 2022, what conversations has the Minister had with the Department, officials, the appropriate bodies and the school community?  I hope we see the leaving certificate going ahead as it did in previous years and that we will be back to some form of normality.  Does the Minister envisage students will have the choice of sitting the leaving certificate or getting an accredited grade, as in 2021?  What are the Minister's plans and those of her Department?</p></speech>

I appreciate having the opportunity to respond on the issue now.  On the leaving certificate arrangements for 2022, cognisant of many of the issues that have arisen previously for these students, significant accommodation has already been made in the examination papers.  Schools were notified of the accommodation at the start of this term in August and September so that staff and students would be familiar with the layout of the papers and the accommodation that is being made for them.  Equally, we have provided for a second running of the leaving certificate examination this year. That will be held as close as possible to the first and standard running of the leaving certificate.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of the advisory group on this issue. The advisory group consists of the Department of Education, the parents' representatives, the student voice - importantly, the teaching unions and the managerial bodies.  They have done a considerable body of work in this regard.  We have made an accommodation in the paper and we are providing for a second running of the leaving certificate in 2022.  Obviously, we keep everything under review as the year moves forward.  Schools have been advised of the accommodation.</p></speech>

I would like the language into the future to focus on flexibility and co-operation, as mentioned by the Minister.  I hope the slowness that existed in relation to antigen testing, ventilation and the use of HEPA filters will change.  That needs to happen.</p> <p>  I wish to follow on from the points made by Deputy O'Sullivan on school bus transport.  I accept the concerns that exist currently given the high numbers of cases.  I want talk about the issue more generally.  We have an issue every year where people who are concessionary do not necessarily have access to school transport.  There are anomalies related to where people live.  A student may live in the middle of County Louth, for example, and there is not a huge difference between them going to school in Dunleer, Ardee, Drogheda or Dundalk, but they may just miss out.  There are anomalies at the minute.  I have spoken to the Minister about particular cases recently.  We have heard the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, speak about the need for the system to be able to deliver on climate change, as opposed to putting kids into cars when buses go on the same route.  We need a sensible interim solution and a long-term solution.  The issue is a farce we all become involved in every year.</p></speech>

In terms of flexibility, I think if I have learned anything from my many years in the education sector, I have learned that enormous goodwill, flexibility and measured judgment is shown by schools on the ground in all respects.  They have shown that in abundance throughout the Covid experience.  I have every confidence they will do that going forward as well.  A great deal has been achieved in education throughout Covid because of the co-operation of everybody in the education sector.  I want to acknowledge that spirit of accommodation.</p> <p>  Specifically, in relation to school transport, as I advised earlier, a review of the entire school transport system is under way.  The interim report, which I received in June, facilitated a new departure in school transport.  For example, heretofore, students were entitled to transport to their nearest school, but now, as a consequence of the decision I made in June, the second nearest school is also included in it.  That was a considerable and necessary step forward.  As I articulated earlier, we are very conscious of the climate in which we live and the green agenda we need to have in protecting and nurturing the climate.  That is very much part of the ongoing review we have.  We are very proactively addressing issues in terms of school transport.  I want to be very clear that everyone who was eligible and fulfilled the criteria as outlined received a place on a bus.  Where there was capacity, concessionaries were also provided for.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding that, I did recognise, and it is for that reason the review is taking place, that there was a need for a review of the entire system.  I have received the first interim report, and I am cognisant of the fact there will be other reports before the entire report is completed.  We have taken very positive first steps on school transport.  I acknowledge the Deputy's role in engaging with me on issues concerning school transport.  I come from a rural constituency so I am very appreciative of the ongoing issues that have arisen for many years in the area of school transport.  I appreciate the Deputy's engagement with me on those issues.  Almost without exception, every Deputy and Senator within the Oireachtas is very invested in the matter.  It is for that reason we are undertaking the review.  I look forward to progressing it as a matter of priority</p></speech>

On the module work on Covid and school bullying, one of the key recommendations was the appointment of therapeutic emotional counsellors on site.  This could even be done on a pilot or trial basis.  I do not want to hear the Minister say it could be done in conjunction with guidance counsellors.  The guidance counsellors have enough to do and enough responsibility in their own right.</p><p>We have had this conversation with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors at some of our meetings.  Has the Minister or her Department considered this issue as I know that it has come to her attention outside of the work of the Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science?  Has any research work been done on such appointments within her own Department for schools, even if this was on a pilot or shared basis between schools, or whatever?  Definitely these people were required to be on site and it was a key recommendation for both modules of work.</p></speech>

I express my thanks for the work of the committee and specifically the issue the Chairman has highlighted there.  He is completely correct in that we have counsellors in our schools and I am very pleased to say that we have had an increase in the provision of counsellors within schools as a consequence of the budget and a commitment to deliver on that for our schools.  Therapeutic counselling, the committee will be aware, falls outside of the Department of Education and is a form of counselling within the the Department of Health.  I want to state clearly that I have had extensive and ongoing engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and this counselling falls within the remit of her portfolio.  I acknowledge the excellent departmental co-operation between Deputy Butler&rsquo;s Department and area of responsibility and the Department of Education.  We are certainly working together to seek the potential and possibility even if this, as referred to by the Chairman, is on a pilot basis towards making an initiative like that available that would be supported cross-departmentally.  I acknowledge that this falls within the portfolio of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler but she has an extraordinary willingness to work to see how we can advance that, going forward.</p></speech>

I am accompanied today by officials from my Department and am conscious that I have only five minutes to deliver my opening statement.  I will therefore just give a very brief overview of the 2021 Supplementary Estimate for my Department.</p> <p>  The allocation for this Department&rsquo;s 2021 Supplementary Estimate was drawn up in recent weeks as part of the normal budgetary process.  At a Cabinet meeting dated 15 November 2021, the Government agreed to a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science of &euro;230 million.  This increases the net voted allocation for this Department from &euro;2,681,500,000 to &euro;2,911,500,000, allowing for the funding of two items.</p> <p>  First, is a &euro;147 million once-off injection of funding for university superannuation costs.  There is a State obligation to fund university pension costs, arising from a legal undertaking by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Education when taking over university pension funds in 2009 under the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.  In recent years, the pension cost has increased in line with demographic demands.  To address a shortfall on university pension schemes, my Department successfully negotiated in the 2022 Estimates process a once-off injection of &euro;147 million in 2021 to decrease the pension funding shortfall.</p> <p>  Additionally, we successfully negotiated a &euro;20 million rise to the base funding of university pensions from 2022.  This will help to build a sustainable baseline for future pension costs, as well as helping to strengthen university balance sheets.</p> <p>  The second measure funded through this Department&rsquo;s Supplementary Estimate is a &euro;105 million package of support to prepare for a safe reopening of the third level sector in the 2021-2022 academic year.  We are all well aware of the profound impact that Covid-19 has had globally.  Due to the deteriorating public health situation in the 2020-2021 academic year, education provision in the third level sector remained online with very restricted on-site access to facilities and person-to-person contact.</p> <p>  This emergency online provision throughout the 2021 -2021 academic year has been recognised by Government and the sector as deeply disruptive for students and learners, staff and institutions in further and higher education and research.  This has been particularly the case for vulnerable learners.  Curtailment of pro-social outlets and developmental opportunities for young people is of potentially wider significance for communities and society at large with implications for wellbeing, social cohesion and solidarity.</p> <p>  Recognising that this situation cannot continue for another academic year, in July 2021, the Government approved a &euro;105 million package of financial supports for the safe reopening of the third level sector in the 2021-2022 academic year, in compliance with public health advice and with appropriate protective measures.  This funding will allow higher education institutions and education and training boards to safely and carefully maximise on-site provision of teaching, learning, research and other on-site activities.  With thanks to efforts in the sector so far, we have seen approximately 400,000 learners return to on-site activity.  There are currently no changes to arrangements for school attendance and on-site activities for further and higher education institutions.  We continue to monitor the situation and the latest public health advice.</p> <p>  It is fair to say that in respect of Covid-19, the next few weeks, and indeed months, are uncertain and will be challenging.  I wish to place on record my gratitude to all involved in ensuring the continued health and safety of our students, lecturers and researchers, and to those working on a plan to safely keep our institutions and establishments open.</p> <p>  As part of this Supplementary Estimate, this Department has also declared that appropriations-in-aid are forecast to be &euro;22 million higher at the end of 2021 than originally anticipated.  This income is largely in respect of rebates from the European Social Fund and from unitary cost contributions related to capital public-private partnership projects.  This increased income reduces the Department&rsquo;s overall requirement in the Supplementary Estimate, bringing the total Supplementary Estimate to &euro;230 million.</p> <p>  I trust that this overview is of assistance to the committee and I am happy to discuss these issues in more detail.  I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee.</p></speech>

Hopefully, that is being done in a safe manner and I know that both the colleges and institutions will do as much as they can to ensure that.  One of the issues that has been highlighted by Covid-19 is the shortage in certain professions.  I was talking to the Minister about the shortage in teachers.  This is an issue that predates Covid-19 because I was a teacher before I was elected in February 2020 and there was a shortage of substitute teachers in certain subjects, especially Irish and French, and after that maths and science, and so on.  What is being done to identify and increase the number of students participating in different courses?</p> <p>  I am also spokesperson for disability.  The children's disability network teams have been established.  There is a shortage of occupational and speech and language therapists and psychologists.  What is being done to encourage more people to take up and to qualify in these professions at third level and to go into the public sector given many speech and language therapists and psychologists go into the private sector?</p> <p>  Is there any plan to review apprenticeships?  Due to Covid-19, much of the learning was done online.  There is capacity to shorten the length of apprenticeships from four years to three, which might encourage more people to take them up.  There is a shortage in workers in many construction trades and we need more people to take up apprenticeships as quickly as possible.  I thank the Minister of State.</p></speech>

I will make a couple of comments on apprenticeships.  The committee will be well aware that we launched the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021 to 2025 earlier in the year and it has a number of high-level targets in it to increase the number of new apprenticeship registrations up to 10,000 per annum by the year 2025.  Within that also is a reorganisation of the apprenticeship space.  We are establishing, as the Deputy will be aware, the national apprenticeship office.  An interim director has been appointed in that position and that person will take up that role in the next number of weeks before Christmas.  That office will then be supported by what is called the national apprenticeship alliance, which will be a stakeholder forum to support the office in its work.  The national apprenticeship office will oversee the entire national apprenticeship landscape.  We have approximately 62 formalised apprenticeships on the books.  These are the traditional craft apprenticeships of approximately 25 in number.  In addition, the remaining apprenticeships are described or categorised as a consortium of post-2016 apprenticeships, many of which are in new areas such as financial services, insurance, accounting technicians, and other areas of industry and society.  There are approximately 20 more apprenticeships in development at the moment.  Further to all of that, there are approximately 18 or 19 expressions of interest of bubble groups, which are also seeking to advance apprenticeships.  These are not in development but are expressions of interest.</p> <p>  The national apprenticeship office will co-ordinate and oversee all aspects of apprenticeships, once it is established.  There is also money in next year&rsquo;s budget to support employers who take apprentices on.  Equally, at the moment, the funding goes primarily to the craft apprenticeships to support employers for the period that their apprentices are off the job and in training.  There is a great deal going on in that space.  </p> <p>  We also have Springboard courses right across the area of skills, with many courses going on in our further and higher education institutions through the provision of Springboard funding.  This is an advanced skill system to provide for lifelong learning and human capital developments. </p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned people with disabilities.  Within our action plan for apprenticeships, there are some key targets to promote more gender balance and diversification.  We also have equality measures through a bursary for disadvantaged people in the apprenticeship area.  There is much going on in that regard and we can certainly send some of that information on to her after the meeting.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

The Minister of State referred to that as a one-off amount.  If there is a legal requirement and why is that funding not coming then from central funds?  That being said, one-off suggests that there was an issue.  If there was an issue, was it a one-off?  Could there be a shortfall in the future that would require another one-off figure to balance that particular pension book?  On what basis is the pension fund held?  Is it held centrally or is it an investment fund of some kind and what led to the shortfall?</p></speech>

Similar to any other civil or public servants when they retire, the obligation falls to have their pensions paid to them.  Pensions are not funded, so there is not a pension fund <i>per se</i>.  They, therefore, come out of current spending.  The projected shortfall is approximately &euro;147 million euros, which is also projected to rise by approximately &euro;61 million in 2021 and &euro;60 million in 2022, and to continue to rise.  A deficit is building up if we do nothing.</p></speech>

We have also built an additional &euro;20 million into the base of that going forward.  There is a recognition and a commitment from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that this is a liability and responsibility that obviously has to be met and cannot be walked away from and not be paid.</p></speech>

I was not familiar with the 2009 legislation and it is before my time in the Oireachtas.  Perhaps we can come back to that point at a later stage.</p> <p>  I refer to the measures that the Department has introduced in getting our third-level institutions open again, including the &euro;100 million, the supports and the public health advice that has been given.  It is fantastic to see our third-level institutions back up and running with the vast majority of students back in the classroom or lecture theatre.  That is very welcome.  As the Minister of State said, it is a great challenge to keep it that way particularly with the unknowns before us.</p> <p>  I want to focus, however, on apprenticeships and their significant importance to us.  Deputy Tully also touched on this.</p><p>Flowing from the action plan for apprenticeship, as has been mentioned, the interim head of the national apprenticeship office is a massive ramp-up in a campaign to get this apprenticeship programme in the public domain more.  I appreciate that the CAO process will put the programme front and centre in the awareness of students.    I believe that in identifying any deficit in critical skills the apprenticeship schemes across the country will play an extraordinary role in plugging that gap.  Will the programme be marketed to increase the number of people involved in the apprenticeship programme that has been put in place by the Department?</p></speech>

The fora are populated by employers and business and industry leaders in these regions.  The fora are not sector-specific and cover all of the sectors.  There is also a regional skills manager in each of the areas who oversees and co-ordinates.  So that is part of the bottom-up collaboration and bottom-up information flow exercise that the Department operates to keep in touch with business and identify any needs or gaps.</p></speech>

Recently the Department has completely broadened the information and the provision of information and options on the CAO website in order that people can now access full information such as where and when to apply through the CAO options for further and higher education and apprenticeships.  Built into that is the availability of guidance counselling.  To give people information and direction, they can now explore course choices, career options and apprenticeship options.  That is primarily what is going on in that space in terms of broadening this out.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Tully, I said that there are 62 apprenticeships.   There are 20 more apprenticeships in the formalised  development process and a further 18 or 19 expressions of interest to advance those concepts through the process and, hopefully, categorise them formally as apprenticeships.</p></speech>

His remark highlights the important role played by guidance counsellors.  This committee has also highlighted the important role that they play and will play in the education system in the years to come as the action plan is implemented.  I cannot overemphasise the importance of that.</p> <p>  My final remark is on the public health guidance, particularly as it evolves over the coming months.  I am thinking of exam halls in large third-level institutions that traditionally carry out Christmas and-or new year exams.  How quickly can the public health advice provide third-level institutions with sufficient time to adapt such exams if we reach a point where the use of an exam hall might be something that NPHET would frown upon?</p></speech>

That provided a roadmap and a template to reopen in a structured manner given the public health climate and guidance.  Right now universities, technological colleges and further education institutions are managing their exams subject to the health guidance, which is available.  There is no barrier at the moment.  Pilot antigen testing is being rolled out across the sector.  At the moment the Department is thinking of going a little bit further on that but we are not in a position to say anything formally.  We are looking at that as an added enhancement.</p></speech>

I ask him to go into more detail about the regional skills fora.  Am I correct that a general review has been done on the skillsets that will be necessary in the future?</p> <p>  There has been some commentary on the climate change targets and all of the rest.  I mean that we have not reached the target that was set for hubs to provide training in retrofitting.  I suppose that it is just a matter of expediting it so we get to that place and I ask him to comment.</p></speech>

Housing for All is a massive house building programme that the State is undertaking.  For that programme to succeed we need a pipeline of skilled workers.</p> <p>  We are also conscious of the State&rsquo;s obligation in respect of climate change.  There is a focus on green skills and the nearly zero energy building, NZEB, centres.  I do not have the exact details here but we will let him know how many NZEB centres are being developed.  Moneys have been provided in next year&rsquo;s budget for courses on green technologies and retrofitting and we can supply him with information on where that money is being spent.</p> <p>  In terms of apprenticeships, we acknowledge that due to Covid and particularly due the lockdowns, a backlog built up in the off-the-job training in the craft apprenticeship sectors, which I think everybody accepts.  We have provided specific moneys to fund SOLAS to clear the backlog.</p> <p>  Let me outline the amounts because they are big numbers and it is important such information be in the public domain.  At the end of October, 10,333 craft apprentices were waiting for access to phases 2, 4 and 6 of their off-the-job training.  Almost 6,500 of these were waiting six months or more.  Actions taken by SOLAS, the HEA, and education and training providers, along with measures announced in the budget recently, will mean that 40% of those waiting will have access to off-the-job training in 2021 and the plan is to completely clear the backlog by the end of 2022.</p> <p>  We are very conscious of the backlog and it was outside our control due to the public health climate in which we had to operate.  We have made clearing the backlog a big priority.  SOLAS and the HEA, in particular, have put a lot of work into this matter.  In addition, we have put a lot of resources into helping them to clear the backlog.</p></speech>

Clearing the backlog will be worthwhile.  It must be ensured there is a consistent and constant review of the skillsets that are required.  It is not always possible to forecast that but we accept that retrofitting and house building need to be nailed on to the apprenticeship programme.</p><p>We must do whatever we can to ensure we have the supply chain of people to do the business.</p><p> There have been significant moves in latter years regarding lifelong learning and apprenticeships.  There have been significant moves in people's roadmap or pathways to education, whether by way of post-leaving certificate courses to progress to college or whatever else.  Will the Minister of State give some detail on the general strategy around that?  I accept what he said about equality and dealing with those who do not necessarily come from a place where they have a history of education and the supports that are required.  There is probably a wider element of societal work that is beyond the remit of his Department, involving family and community supports to put more people into the space where they can avail of opportunities.  I have dealt with the Minister, Deputy Harris, lately regarding the Redeemer centre in Dundalk, which is operating a project in this area at the moment and is concerned about continued funding.  It offers certain modules in a community setting, where people may be more comfortable, before they move on to a PLC and wherever else that brings them.  It is a vital piece of the jigsaw that we need to get right.  I realise my questions cover a huge area but I would appreciate any detail the Minister of State can give.</p></speech>

He asked about skills.  I have spoken to people in the regional skills fora, including regional skills managers.  There is also the National Skills Council, which is the umbrella group that sits above them.  All of that is guided by the national skills strategy that runs from 2016 to 2025.  As part of that, which is what we would describe as the broader skills ecosystem, we have the skills and labour market research unit, which is hosted within SOLAS.  We also have the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, which is hosted by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  In addition, my Department hosts the national training fund advisory group.  There are many moving parts in the skills area, which help to inform us as to the deficits and needs within the labour market.</p> <p>  Approximately 35,000 learners will be able to avail of green skills modules next year.  Throughout the country and the further and higher education providers, there will be provision for up to 35,000 places for people to access courses on green skills.  We have also provided 2,650 course places on retrofitting and the NZEB expansion.  I will get the Deputy further details on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2021120200002#K00700"><p>As the Minister of State said, there are many moving parts.  I assume he is the lead on co-ordination and the review of the skill sets that are needed.  Beyond that, it is about ensuring the pathways are there, which involves discussions with third level institutions, employers, etc.</p> <p>  My final question concerns an issue I have raised previously with the Minister of State and on which I have also had some interaction with the Minister.  I refer to technological university status for Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT, about which there are concerns at this point.  We know DkIT is late to the dance but there is the facility under section 38 of the Technological Universities Act 2018.  I am still hopeful in this regard but there is a need for reassurance.  The Minister has agreed to meet with Oireachtas Members from County Louth in the near future to discuss the matter.  We all must work together to deliver that because it is the only show in town.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.420" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1493" speakername="Niall Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2021120200002#K00800"><p>This issue was raised in the D&aacute;il this week on Question Time, during which the Minister told the Deputy and others that the institute itself must make an application, after which we will do everything humanly possible at our end to make it happen.  The Minister will, of course, meet with Oireachtas Members from County Louth, as he has indicated.  I am available to travel to DkIT in the new year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2021120200002#K00900"><p>I have a few questions for the Minister of State.  As I am sure he is aware, the committee did a field trip to the extended campuses of the institutes of technology in Limerick and Cork last week.  An issue that came up in both cases was the lack of resources and spaces in respect of apprenticeships.  Both colleges could take on significantly more students but do not have the space, teaching capacity or equipment to do so.  I very much welcome the announcements by the Minister of State and the Minister on apprenticeships.  I expect that many more people will be willing to take up apprenticeships into the future because they are now seen as something worthwhile.  I am not saying they were not worthwhile in the past but there is now more of an appetite for them and a clearer view of what can be achieved at the end of them.  That should have been done years ago.  Can the lack of capacity be rectified in the short term and funding made available to fast-track the process and enable institutions to double the number of places available?  The Minister of State knows there is a shortage of apprenticeships for electricians, plumbers, carpenters and blocklayers.  Across the board, there is a huge shortage of labour and apprenticeships and there is an appetite within the colleges to double their numbers.  Will the Minister of State outline the work that is being done by him and within the Department to ensure there are enough spaces available for whomever wants to take up an apprenticeship?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1493" speakername="Niall Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2021120200002#K01000"><p>I spoke earlier about the apprenticeship action plan, of which members are well aware, and the targets contained therein.  Our primary role is to support SOLAS, aided by the HEA and the ETBs in the role they play in the area of apprenticeships.  In the case of almost every apprenticeship programme, there is a basic requirement that there cannot be an apprentice without an employer, who is the sponsor.  That is integral to the whole process.  We have been supporting employers, particularly during the pandemic, by way of the apprentice incentivisation scheme, which has been extended to the end of the year.  The number of apprenticeship registrations has surpassed our expectations this year as we emerged from the pandemic.  That is good news.</p> <p>  In terms of creating the infrastructure and capacity at our TUs and ETBs, we have an extensive capital budget, which is voted through at budget time.  The flow of that money goes from our Department to the HEA, which then manages the applications from ETBs, TUs and universities for capital funding.</p><p>The Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, TUS, was used as an example from when the committee visited Limerick.  It has a project at a facility in Coonagh, where it has bought a property, that it has advanced quite significantly.  It is almost at a conclusion.  Some minor details have to be wrapped up between it and the Higher Education Authority.  It is a similar case with Munster Technological University, MTU.  We have a significant capital budget to support all of those organisations with the capacity to provide the increase in apprenticeships we want to see.</p></speech>

It is fantastic to see the work on the ground.  I speak on behalf of all the members of the committee when I say we were impressed by what we saw down there.</p> <p>  I am not sure whether the Minister of State has any information on the parochial end in terms of the technological university for the south east and the Wexford campus.  What is he able to tell us about the Wexford campus and what work is ongoing in his Department?  I know work is ongoing with Wexford County Council on this issue.  If the Minister of State does not have the information to hand, that is no problem.  Will he or his officials come back to me separately?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1493" speakername="Niall Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2021120200002#L00300"><p>We will do so, if the Chair does not mind.  Obviously, the TU project is a priority.  That has advanced, thankfully, and it is the first for the region.  The provision of a campus in Wexford is a priority for us all.  We will get back to the Chair with an information note on where exactly we are.</p></speech>

We had the opportunity to visit the Coonagh facility, which is under completion and funding is awaited from the Minister of State's Department.  Will he update us on the progress of the work ongoing at the TU in Limerick on that issue and the Coonagh facility?  I have no doubt the Minister of State is very much aware of it, being from that constituency.</p></speech>

I am well aware of it.  What I can say is TUS and the HEA have been engaged and we are pretty much near the end of the process.  The final funding of which TUS seeks to avail is there, but the details of the drawdown are being finalised between the college authorities and the authority.</p></speech>

It will be an attractive place for any student to attend.  I compliment all involved, including the Minister of State, because I know it is his constituency and he was complimented when we were down there on the work he was doing and his commitment to the campus.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the moneys provided last year, in particular, and this year to support students getting access to online lectures and such, including hardware and Wi-Fi.  I see an increase in the student assistance fund in this Estimate.  Does the Minister of State see additional supports for students, especially equipment grants and so on, being sustained on an ongoing basis?  Is the Minister of State aware of a proposal plan or any such measure in his Department to identify gaps in regional training facilities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1493" speakername="Niall Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2021120200002#L00800"><p>The short answer to the question on the student assistance fund is "Yes".  It has increased significantly.  It is our firm intention to keep it at least at the level to which we have got it, if not increase it.  The purpose or rationale behind it is to provide for exceptional circumstances.  If that is for the provision of hardware or IT support for individual students, that is fine.  How it works is that each college and student receives an allocation.  There is a process within each institution or college for the governance of the money in terms of how one applies and the assessment criteria, which are managed appropriately and locally.</p> <p>  We are reviewing Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, and we have made some changes to it.  There has been a small increase in the rates, a minor increase in the threshold and a significant change in the distance for the non-adjacent rate, which will help many people.  The review is ongoing.  These changes were made prior to the review.  I am not pre-empting the review, which I have not seen, but I am sure it will bring forward other recommendations.  We have provided for an underspend in SUSI this year, which shows there is not a shortage of funding for eligible students.  Considerable work is going on in that space.</p> <p>  We have ramped up the student assistance fund and we intend to keep it there.  Will the Deputy repeat his final question?</p></speech>

It is the fastest-growing community in Ireland and Europe.  There is an obvious need, especially outside Swords and Tallaght, which is the biggest community with more than 50,000 people.  The census will probably show it has grown even further.  I would love to identify, through the Minister of State's Department, SOLAS and others, whether there is a need and try to implement and deliver on that for the community, because it is clear that north County Dublin, outside of TU Dublin in Blanchardstown or DCU, needs to have its higher and further education options enhanced.  A training facility would bridge that gap.  I am sure there are similarities in other communities throughout the country.  I would love to see the level of training facilities provided through the Department and State agencies determined to identify whether it is needed.</p></speech>

Everybody is familiar with it now so I will not go through it again and just remind people.  If people are not seated in front of a microphone then any contribution will not be recorded.  For the meeting I will indicate the speakers for broadcasting purposes and relay.  I welcome members and the viewers who may be listening or watching proceedings on Oireachtas TV to the public session of the select committee.</p> <p>   Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  For this purpose, the parliamentary precincts are considered to be the accommodation assigned to the member in the Leinster House complex or its vicinity, or another location in Leinster House or Leinster House 2000.  I ask members to note that they may participate remotely in proceedings held in public only from the locations listed earlier as privilege to their utterances only applies when participating from these locations.</p> <p>  The D&aacute;il has decided that the Supplementary Estimate for Public Services in respect of Vote 6 be referred to this committee for consideration.  On behalf of the select committee, I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Chambers, and his officials.  Briefing documents have been provided by the Department for circulation in advance.  The meeting format is that the Minister of State will given an overview of the Supplementary Estimate and then the floor will then be open to questions from members.</p> <p>  I now invite him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021120200002#A00400"><p>I am joined by my officials.  I thank the committee for making time available today to consider my request for a Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</p> <p>  As members are no doubt aware, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is a constituent part of the Office of the Attorney General.  It provides solicitor services within the Office of the Attorney General and to Departments and offices.</p> <p>  While the Taoiseach has certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas for administrative matters in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the office operates independently of the Department.  The office has a wide remit, including the area of civil litigation in all courts, including attending at the Court of Justice of the European Union, ECJ, in Luxembourg, and the provision of conveyancing, property law, commercial contract and other solicitor services for the line Departments and other Civil Service clients.  Many matters are high profile, sensitive, capable of attracting publicity, and sometimes involve emergency applications to court, strict time limits and complex issues of law.</p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;3 million is sought to cover the extra expenditure of three subheads within the Vote in 2021.  These subheads are: A1(i) salaries, wages and allowances; A2(v) office equipment and external IT services; and A4 - fees to counsel.   While the office has managed to achieve savings of more than &euro;500,000 elsewhere in the Vote it finds itself with a shortfall of &euro;3 million.</p> <p>  I might start with the fees to counsel subhead.  The management of expenditure on counsels&rsquo; fees is a key activity for the office.  These are primarily fees payable to counsel representing Departments and offices in litigation before the courts and other tribunals, and the ECJ  They also include fees payable for the provision by external counsel of legal advice for the State, whether sought for the Office of the Attorney General or for Departments and offices.</p> <p>  Expenditure on counsel fees is, to a large extent, dependent on the level of activity in the courts at any time.  It is often difficult for the office to specifically forecast this.  In addition, recent years have seen a marked increase in the complexity of work being handled by the office in areas such as commercial litigation and transactional work, procurement work, and advisory and litigation work that results from our membership of the EU, and the implementation of directives in areas such as environmental law, planning, employment law and social welfare law.  The past two years have brought new challenges with Brexit and the emergency legislation enacted to deal with the pandemic.  The office has observed that the issues raised in cases taken against the State are becoming increasingly complex, which leads to greater use of counsel.</p> <p>  An allocation of &euro;15 million was made for expenditure on fees for counsel in 2021, which was the same as 2020.  However, the current position shows that after the fees requested by counsel undergo a value-for-money assessment, this will leave a shortfall of &euro;2.6 million over the allocated amount.</p> <p>  With regard to the office equipment and external IT services subhead, the office has incurred increased costs in the provision and support of secure remote access facilities.  It has also had to upgrade video conference facilities to satisfy the requirements of the ECJ for remote hearings.  The shortfall for this subhead is &euro;213,000.</p> <p>  Finally, I will refer to subhead A1(i).  Due to a combination of circumstances relating to the need to provide cover for staff on maternity leave, and the impact of changes to pay arrangements, the office sees a shortfall in the allocation of &euro;772,000.</p> <p>  I am pleased to recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee and welcome the opportunity to discuss it with the Deputies.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; iontach pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar na ruda&iacute; seo.</p><p>I apologise to the Minister of State and committee members for having to leave early as I am due to speak in the D&aacute;il shortly.  I thank him for his opening statement, which was quite interesting.</p><p> I am interested in the issue of protected disclosures or whistleblowers.  I introduced my Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill today.  Does the Minister of State have figures for the total costs the Chief State Solicitor's office has incurred from defending the State in cases arising from protected disclosures?  I will put three questions to the Minister of State now.  They are quite specific and he may not have the information to hand to answer them but he can come back to me on them.</p><p> I am also interested in the total expenditure on external legal fees.  We had a conversation on that on the previous occasion the Minister of State appeared before this committee.  I am quite shocked at how much it costs.  From the perspective of fiscal prudence, would it not be more cost-effective for this work to be done in-house through the Chief State Solicitor's office?  That could be a better approach.  I would be interested in his thoughts on that.  When other jurisdictions contract for external legal fees, a discount often appears to be offered for services.  I guess that is because it is often repeat business and states are reliable suppliers, they pay on time and do not go bust.  When the Irish State contracts for external legal fees, a premium appears to be charged, rather than a discount applied, for the services.  I would also be interested in the Minister of State's view on that matter. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.448" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021120200002#B00200"><p>On the Deputy's first question regarding the cost of protected disclosures, I do not have that specific figure in front of me.  I can ask the office whether it is even possible to obtain that figure and the specifics around it.  If it is, we can send it on to the committee but I will have to engage with the officials to find out if there is a breakdown of that.  Different agencies of the State are responsible for protected disclosures and, therefore, they might not all be necessarily channelled through the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's point on securing value for money with respect to fees and doing that work in-house, there is significant legal expertise in the office and those staff do a great deal of case management and progress many cases.  That is distinct from how it works around counsel.  To give some information on that, the majority of cases the office handles are taken against the State and it is necessary for the State to defend itself against any of these cases.  That can require specialist advocacy services offered by specific counsel.  In some instances, they are specific counsel who are very much specialists in their area in Ireland and if Ireland is representing itself in a European context, it is important we have such specialist expertise.  It can also vary.  There is uncertainty with respect to demand, therefore, it can be difficult to predict the work and cases can often take years to conclude.  Another aspect is the increasingly challenging and complex nature of case management and the nature of discovery, and the cost involved in that.  </p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about fees.  In terms of fee note processing, there is an evaluation process that involves a minimum of two and a maximum of seven legal officers, including legal officers in the Office of the Attorney General.  They are processed through use of guidelines and oversight.  There is a professional fees control group within the Chief State Solicitor's office that ensures value for money and fairness in the service provided, ensuring there is consistency across all work and managing the spend in the context of the budget.  There is a marked-down rate, which is approximately 33%.  Obviously, that is an estimate but there is a marked-down rate when it comes to counsel.  If the Deputy were to compare what we are allocating under the subhead covering fees to counsel this year versus, say, 2019, it is less.  It is subject to fluctuation.  It can depend on the nature of the case that is taken.  There is a Supplementary Estimate and this is one of the subheads involved.  If the Deputy notes the trend over a period of years, a greater amount was allocated under that in 2019.</p></speech>

I recognise the additional responsibilities cast upon the Chief State Solicitor's office arising from Brexit.  To what extent has that office been adequately staffed to meet the challenges of issues associated with Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.451" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021120200002#B00500"><p>I ask the Deputy to bear with me while I get the detail on that.  With regard to the staffing of the office generally, we can get a specific note on staffing as it relates to Brexit.  One of the predominant issues, as I referenced in reply to Deputy Farrell, when it comes to cost implications for the Chief State Solicitor's office is the multi-annual nature of the work, the interface with the European legal system and how case management can take many years.  From a commercial case management perspective, it can involve complex work over a number of years.  There is ongoing engagement between the office and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and a substantial increase was secured for 2022.  Two elements occurred this year that were a positive for capturing staff recruitment and retention.  One relates to maternity leave cover where staff going on maternity leave can be replaced immediately or within a reasonable timeframe.  There has been budgetary allocation for that and all of that has allowed for good continuity of work.  There has also been an incremental credit and that has also had an important impact on the continuity of work.</p> <p>  On managing Brexit more generally, the feedback we have received is that it is part of the regular work.  The Chief State Solicitor's office's work cuts across Departments and all issues.  The office has in excess of 300 staff.  As I said, there is a significant increase there for next year.  That is the feedback on it.</p></speech>

If the Vice Chairman notes the new projects in 2021, he will see a large of portion of the ICT budget has been to facilitate and implement secure remote working access for all staff.  That has allowed for a significant level of remote working but also ensured that it is secure.  Having additional licensing and support to promote access and videoconference solutions has also been added to the IT cost.  I am informed by officials that the security is up to date and it was also enhanced fully this year.  That is the feedback from a security perspective.</p></speech>

This was something that was progressed in the Revised Estimates which will be published in December.  As I said, there is a staff count of over 300.  The increase for next year will have a positive impact on the work and capacity of the Department to manage the caseload.

For example, facilities have been set up to allow legal staff access to virtual court hearings in Ireland and the Court of Justice of the European Union.  In the initial phase of the pandemic, a lot of public services and people across the private sector had to transition quickly to meet the challenge brought about by Covid.  There is ongoing additional licensing and support for remote access.  Video conference solutions have supported the IT investment in 2021.  A lot of the additional allocation for this year has sought to facilitate secure remote access to allow continuity of work.  There has been a proactive management of that in order to manage the transition while also mitigating the costs so that this is balanced properly.  I am informed that it has worked well since remote working commenced.</p></speech>

The D&aacute;il has ordered that a Supplementary Estimate for Public Services in respect of Vote 34 - Housing, Local Government and Heritage - for a sum not exceeding &euro;198,915,000 be referred to this committee for consideration.</p><p>The purpose of this morning's meeting is to consider that Supplementary Estimate.  On behalf of the select committee I welcome the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  Briefing documents provided by the Department were circulated in advance of the meeting.</p><p> Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within parliamentary precincts.  For this purpose, parliamentary precincts are considered to be the accommodation assigned to the Member in the Leinster House complex or its vicinity, another location in Leinster House or Leinster House 2000.  Members may participate remotely in proceedings held in public only from the locations listed above as privilege for their utterances only applies when participating from those locations.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> The format of today's meeting is that the Minister will give an overview of the Supplementary Estimate and I will then open the floor the questions from members of the committee.  I invite the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120200002#B00200"><p>I am joined this morning by the following officials from my Department: Marguerite Ryan, finance officer; Lorraine O&rsquo;Donoghue, local government finance; David Kelly; and Mary Hurley.</p> <p>  In late April, I met the committee to discuss the 2021 Estimate for my Department at an overall level.  I thank members for the engagement at that stage and also for facilitating this meeting at relatively short notice.  I will keep my remarks brief.  Obviously, I will be happy to take any questions members may have.</p> <p>  The subject matter we are discussing here is specifically the &euro;198.9 million additional funding to be added to the overall provision for my Department.  The Estimate, which I set before the committee in October, detailed my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2020.  This totalled &euro;5.118 billion gross for the year with a further &euro;214 million of deferred surrender.  The Supplementary Estimate before the committee today includes the following changes: the Local Government Fund - an additional &euro;197.3 million in current spend; on heritage - an additional &euro;1.615 million, comprised of &euro;1.473 million current spend and &euro;142,000 capital spend.  The total provision of &euro;198.9 million will bring the gross expenditure ceiling for my Department to &euro;5.531 billion and will be comprised of &euro;2.555 billion in current spending and &euro;2.976 billion on the capital side, excluding a further &euro;91.5 million self-funding by local authorities under local property tax for housing.</p> <p>  I will start with the heritage element of this Supplementary Estimate.  These are not additional costs to the Exchequer.  They are the final elements of the transfer of functions and bring these existing provisions into Vote 34.  They mainly relate to pay - &euro;880,275 which deals with salaries and PSRI; and for administration - &euro;735,000 for office equipment.  This effectively follows the restructuring of the Department following the Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision in 2020.  It is a technical issue and arose from the transfer of certain heritage functions into my Department.</p> <p>  The local government element of this Supplementary Estimate is exclusively focused on issues relating to Covid-19.  The amount to be provided under this Supplementary Estimate is &euro;197.3 million and, when taken in conjunction with other measures taken by the Department, will bring the total Exchequer support to the local government sector for pandemic-related expenditure to an unprecedented &euro;558.9 million.  I have consistently said at committee meetings and in the D&aacute;il and Seanad that we are firm believers in and supporters of local government.  I take the opportunity to thank all workers in the local government sector for the incredible work they have done throughout the pandemic.  They have led from the front and have been the tip of the spear in the Government's response in every community throughout the country.  It was incumbent on me and my Department to support them through this Supplementary Estimate to ensure that with the additional works they had and the loss of income they have experienced through rates abatement, which I will turn to shortly, they were fully supported by way of 100% provision.  That is being done in an unprecedented way.</p> <p>  This includes a provision for the commercial rates waiver scheme that applied from January to September.  We now have a more targeted waiver scheme, focused on the hospitality sector and those still affected by certain Covid-related restrictions.</p> <p>  It also includes provision for the allocation of additional funds to local authorities to help limit the financial impact of the pandemic.  I will take the example of Deputy Gould's city of Cork which he understandably loves so much.  That city has undergone a very successful pedestrianisation programme and many those streets continue to be for pedestrians only.  There has been a loss of parking charges as has happened in many local authorities.  We have plugged that gap.  I met the chief executive in Cork who was able to define exactly what the local authority lost due to this.  Should the committee pass this Supplementary Estimate today, it will leave me in a position to allocate additional funds to those local authorities to support them in the changes they have made and in the work they have done.</p> <p>  In total, &euro;497 million will be provided to fund the 2021 waiver scheme.  There are two parts to this waiver.  The main part covered the first nine months of the year.  While originally expected to cost &euro;480 million between quarter 1 and quarter 3, it is now &euro;435 million.  The scheme applied automatically to various types of businesses.  As members know which businesses are covered, I will not go into that detail.  The second part of the 2021 waiver is more targeted and we estimate it will cost &euro;62.3 million.  It is for those businesses in the hospitality sector along with gyms etc. which have been affected by the remaining restrictions.</p> <p>  I used the example of Cork city where local authorities lost income as well as the loss of funding from commercial rates.  The total package of this funding is &euro;61.6 million across those local authorities.  Some of the changes are for the better.  I encourage local authorities to retain as best as possible those areas they have given back to the public through pedestrianisation, allowing people to use streets that had been choked with cars for decades.  What they have done has been very progressive.  We will continue to support local government in those moves, giving back the public realms and streets to people.</p> <p>  Funding will be allocated in an equitable way.  The proposed approach is to cover income losses of about &euro;51 million as quantified by the local government sector and to allocate the remaining &euro;10 million to help with the costs of Covid-related expenses that arose.  The nature of these costs varies across the sector.  They include the loss of parking charges along with the cost of personal protective equipment, PPE, signage, crowd management, haulier testing and additional staffing.  There was also significant expenditure on ICT etc. to cover remote working.  I am confident that this funding will provide sufficient support to local authorities.  The support has been very well received by local authorities throughout the country.</p> <p>  I will now run through some of the measures my Department has taken.  The substantive Supplementary Estimate I have outlined will result in an increase of &euro;198.915 million.  This will be complemented by the application of &euro;38.4 million from savings arising from the local government rates waiver; an allocation of &euro;13.2 from the Local Government Fund Reserve and &euro;310 million from savings and underspend across the Vote primarily due to the significant impact of Covid-19 on construction during 2021.</p> <p>  As members will be aware construction and, consequently, expenditure have been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  On 6 January 2021, the Government announced that additional public health restrictions would apply under level 5 of the plan for living with Covid-19.  That shut down the sector and restrictions continued until 12 April 2021.  Obviously, the lag-time in building capacity back up and supply chain issues have had an impact.</p> <p>  My Department continues to work intensively with all stakeholders to maximise delivery for 2021.  However, expenditure will be lower than anticipated, particularly on programmes which are construction focused - in housing and water infrastructure.</p><p>I have applied for the maximum permissible carryover of funds into 2021 for capital programmes.  I am conscious of likely additional underspends, but I have also signalled to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that I will be reducing the net income of the additional costs of the local government rates waiver and other Covid-19-related costs by transferring funds from those underspends into the local government fund.  Instead of seeking additional funds from the Exchequer, we are using funds that were voted for other measures within our Department.  That is the prudent, appropriate and responsible thing to do.</p><p> It is too early to quantify the exact out-turn for affected programmes.  My Department continues to work closely with the Minister, Deputy McGrath, and his team in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Programmes A on housing and D on planning are most affected.  That will not come as a surprise to anyone.  My Department will continue to work hard with all key stakeholders and delivery partners to ensure accelerated activity on areas that have been affected.</p><p> I have kept my remarks as brief as possible.  I wanted to give members an overview.  I have focused on the purpose of today's meeting, which is the Supplementary Estimate for local government and that small technical piece relating to heritage on the transfer of functions.  I am more than happy to take any questions.  I have certainly seen 2020 and 2021 as the two years of Covid.  We expect, based on projections for next year and the evidence we have, that 2022 will be a year of delivery in these streams.  The projections are positive, which I am sure the members will be glad to know.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.473" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120200002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister for the explanation.  There has been a significant carryover of more than &euro;200 million into the local authority social housing investment programme.  Can the Minister give an indication of how the underspend this year has impacted on the projected targets for social housing output?  That would be helpful for us to understand.</p> <p>  It is important we support local government.  There are approximately 48 outstanding staff requests from housing departments throughout the State.  The Minister replied to a parliamentary question from me on this recently.  Is there provision within the existing Estimates to get those staff up and working in the relevant sections of the housing departments this year?  They are key for housing delivery in many local authority areas.</p> <p>  There is an increase in the Estimates for the housing assistance payment, HAP, of approximately &euro;26 million, which is approximately half the increase on the previous year.  However, a target is set out in the Budget Statement of 14,800 new HAP tenancies.  Obviously, the Minister will not cover 14,800 new HAP tenancies from &euro;26 million additional spending.  Does the Minister expect there will be a reduction of current HAP tenancies and that is where he will make up the shortfall?  He has roughly the same number of new HAP tenancies in the targets as previous Governments, but half the increase.</p> <p>  Given the announcement this week on the changes to the defective block scheme affecting western seaboard counties, are there any proposals to increase the budget allocation for that scheme?  Will the Minister come back with a further Supplementary Estimate in parallel with the legislation next year?  Notwithstanding the controversy around the sliding scale, more money will be needed next year.  Can the Minister give us an update on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.474" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120200002#C00400"><p>With regard to the defective block scheme, we have, as the Deputy knows, published significant changes that will increase the commitment by Government from &euro;1.4 billion, by adding &euro;800 million to that scheme, on which we have worked hard with residents to put together.  I do not expect to and will not be coming back to the committee for any Supplementary Estimate in that regard in 2022.  We have made provision for 2022.  Provision is also made in the national development plan, NDP.  Additional funds will be required as the scheme ratchets up.  We need legislation on this.  Obviously, I will be seeking the co-operation of the committee to make sure we get the legislation to underpin the defective block scheme set up on a sound legislative footing, but we need to get it through quickly.  I need to publish that legislation, on which we are already working, in February.  The scheme needs to be set up for Exchequer intervention such as this, which is unprecedented.  We cannot keep running it on regulations, as the existing scheme was set up, under the 1979 Act.</p> <p>  I have flagged we were also bringing in an industry levy.  That will be from the finance Bill 2022, which will take effect from 2023.  It will also be paying into this fund, which I do not see dealing with just mica and defective blocks.  Work is also being done on the working group on fire defects I have set up and on which the committee has been involved.  This country needs to grasp the nettle of this issue and help those homeowners, too.  However, I am sure we will have another session and I will not delay.  We have to be forward looking to ensure these things do not happen again.</p> <p>  Significant exits are projected for HAP.  The Deputy will know in the past two budgets, I have reduced the level of increase in HAP by 1,000 each year.  I want us to reduce our dependency on HAP and I know all members do, as we increase our new housing builds.  For a number of years, this tipping point has been talked about, when housing construction would overtake HAP increases.  Next year, we are targeting 9,000 brand new builds in social housing.  That does not include other measures that will deliver more than 12,000 homes.</p> <p>  We are seeing the increase in HAP reducing any significant exits, but not significant increases in the overall tenancies.  They do not cancel each other out.  HAP is necessary.  I am acutely aware HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and other measures such as this are of significant cost to the Exchequer.  In many instances, they are done out of absolute necessity, because there is no other option.  This has not be called for today, but there have been calls saying this is a supplementary to the private rental sector.  This is actually about supporting families in homes.  We cannot just turn the tap off on it overnight and the committee, in fairness, understands that, but I want to continue to reduce our dependency on it.</p> <p>  The Deputy received a reply to a parliamentary question on staffing from me recently.  Some 49 staffing requests are being dealt with at present.  Well over 1,000 housing posts have been approved in the past number of years.  The 49 staffing requests have details outstanding on which we are following up.  A review is happening between my Department and local government.  We would approve posts and sometimes one would go to a local authority which would say it was waiting for the Department to sanction it.  When one looked behind it, that may not have been the case.  That process needs to improve.</p> <p>  I mentioned in committee last night the legislation we were passing on moving the planning function for large residential developments back to local authorities, which we all supported.  I will also be making a significant announcement in the coming days on further additional resources under housing for all for all local authorities.  We are finalising that, but that will be in a matter of days.  Certainly, I will be sharing the detail of that with the committee, because we need to continue to resource local government.</p><p>The carryover of &euro;58 million was brought into the social housing capital investment, SHIP, in 2021 and this is being drawn down in the first call of expenditure in 2022.</p><p> There was an underspend because of the construction shutdown and the lag time in getting back to the capacity we needed on-site.  That will lead to a significant reduction in what the projected output at the start of the year was before that wave of Covid hit.  We are making up for some lost ground.  I do not have the final figures for quarter three yet but when I do we will share them.  We are pushing to deliver more new homes this year than we did last year.  The projection into next year is positive and we have over 8,000 social houses on-site and under construction as we speak.  There is a good pipeline on the social housing and cost rental sides and we are pushing forward in the affordable housing as well.  As soon as I have quarter three figures and we have checked them and gone through them we will share that with the committee.  I thank the Deputy for his questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.476" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120200002#D00200"><p>I have four follow-up questions.  First, the Minister commented on mica, the industry levy and the measures there.  It is important that the Minister has announced that a national building control regulator will be brought in.  It is long overdue, it is important and it is needed to supplement the work of local authorities in enforcement.  I ask the Minister to give us a timeline on that.  Is it intended to bring forward legislation?</p> <p>  Second, I refer to the Estimates and the maximum permissible carryover of funds into 2021 for capital programmes that the Minister has sought.  Does that mean there is a level of carryover that is not permissible and that is not coming into next year?  If so, how much is that?</p> <p>  Third, the Minister said it is too early to quantify the outturn for the effective capital programme.  When does he think he will be able to quantify the effect it has had this year?  When can we expect figures on that?</p> <p>  Fourth, I refer to Supplementary Estimates and Housing First tenancies, which I have raised with the Minister before.  Did the Minister consider that area for additional spending?  As he knows, there is an estimation that about 2,000 Housing First tenancies are needed for people who are homeless and who have additional support needs.  The plan is to provide those tenancies by 2026.  Has the Minister considered accelerating that delivery?  That would have a substantial impact, not just on those individuals but also on the overall homelessness situation.  Could a tender be done on that to get more delivery?  Can the Minister consider an additional spend on that or what are his thoughts on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.477" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120200002#D00300"><p>This is important and I am glad the Deputy has raised the serious issue of homelessness and what we can do to support those people who need our help.  At an acute level, particularly in Housing First, wraparound supports are needed.  This month we will be announcing details of over 1,200 new tenancies, which is more than we have promised in Housing for All for long-term homeless individuals.  It does this by providing a permanent home as well as providing supports for physical health, mental health and addiction issues, or all three.  I will be launching that this month and we are expanding that across the country.  We have new posts in place for the regional delivery of Housing First.  Homelessness is an area we will continue to focus on, particularly in the provision of one-bedroom properties and conversions.  While we have done a lot of work on voids this year, a lot of them are complex as the properties have been empty for significant lengths of time.  They are not just what some would call re-lets but we have done deep work on voids.  We will bring back more than 3,000 such units into use this year and I have asked the local authorities to focus them on the homeless sector.  We are seeing an increase in homelessness in recent months and I have flagged that with the committee and with Cabinet.  That will continue in the coming months and we will have to watch that.  We are putting in place our national homelessness oversight committee that I will chair.  It will bring the Departments together as well as the NGOs that are part of my task force.  We need a real focus on delivery in this area.  It will help to provide an increase in housing and social housing output next year.  We must use our vacant stock in a much better way and reduce the number of vacancies we have.  I will be focusing on that area and we have had support across the committee on this.</p> <p>  Any additional expenditure we had this year went towards continuing the winter plan for homelessness the whole way through and towards the real progress that has been made on rough sleepers.  We have had a significant reduction of over 35% of rough sleepers year on year.  Interestingly in the recent rough sleepers count we can see that there are still too many but only 11 people in Dublin were on the street sleeping rough compared with how it was this time last year.  We are seeing a lot of people moving out of that rough sleeper category.  There is more than enough emergency accommodation for everyone who needs it.  I know there are other reasons people will suffer but people need to know that safe and secure emergency accommodation is available for them.  If we look at October 2021 we had 94 people sleeping rough, which was down 31 from the spring and down 45 from last winter.  That is a significant reduction.  We had 316 new beds in place and 198 of them are permanent so that is an area I will focus on.</p> <p>  The national building control regulator and national standards got approval at Cabinet as part of our response to mica, defective block and other issues.  We need to have this in place and it will require a separate memo to Cabinet by way of the draft general scheme.  It will also require prelegislative scrutiny and I will have the committee involved in that.  It is important and we have to show people where the State is making an extraordinary intervention to help homeowners, and rightly so.  We have to ensure these things do not happen again.  There will be a review of what has happened, undertaken by a senior counsel, and that is also in measures I brought forward on defective block and mica.  I will be seeking the co-operation and input of the committee into moving forward with that legislation.  It is in preparation and at an early stage.  To be honest a Bill will not be published during this side of the year but it is a priority Bill and I will be seeking the Deputy&rsquo;s assistance on it.</p> <p>  The maximum permissible carryover capital was 10%.  There will be no surrender and we are reallocating our moneys into areas I have mentioned, such as supporting local government.  We are working on some other things that we have not gotten full approval for yet.  We are focusing a lot of that on local government and on housing areas such as voids, buy-to-lets and the likes of regenerated properties that have been stuck for a long time.  I am taking them out of that category and Deputy McAuliffe has been strong on the issue of properties in Dublin that have been empty for a long time and getting them back and re-tenanted.  Detailed work is needed on those properties.  We are looking at a capital spend of about &euro;3.7 billion next year.  We will have more than enough.  I should not say that in case the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is listening.  We will have sufficient funds to deliver an extensive housing programme and to deliver more homes at a social housing level than has ever been seen before in any given year.  We will get permission for that carryover into next year but it will be used.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned 1,200 Housing First tenancies.  Is that 1,200 new and additional Housing First tenancies over and above the almost 700 in place now?  Is the Minister talking about accelerated delivery so that we will get them between now and 2026?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120200002#D00500"><p>We have to roll out the plan, which we will do this month.  It is new, they are new tenancies and it will be a little bit more than 1,200.  We have exceeded our target in the first round, which was just short of 700 as the Deputy said.</p><p>The original target was 663, which increased from 693 to 697 in those supports.  While I mentioned an approximate figure of 1,200, it will be more than that or brand new.  I will publish the delivery timeline when we publish the implementation plan this December.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.481" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120200002#E00200"><p>Deputy O'Callaghan has asked many of my questions with regard to those experiencing homelessness.  I know we have made significant progress.  There has been a more than 30% reduction in homelessness, but as we head into winter we are starting to see the number rising again.  We need to ensure we keep on top of it.  The Minister is doing that, but it would be interesting to hear a little more about how we will deal with things as we go forward.  Housing First is key to that.</p> <p>  I would like to expand on an area that has been touched on, which is the provision of social and affordable housing and the ability of local authorities to supply it.  I thank the Minister for intervening in the matter of the Oscar Traynor Road site, which involved a tender process that had its roots in a previous Government's policy.  We are subsidising the purchase price of more than 170 homes on that site to the tune of &euro;100,000 per unit.  This site comprises 340 local authority homes, which will clearly take people off the housing assistance payment, HAP, list, and 340 homes for those who do not qualify for social housing but are in the private market.  I predict the absolute hypocrisy of people who will be first in the queue to try to get places for people in a housing development they voted against.</p> <p>  That being said, the delivery of those 950 units is key.  The council vote was just one step.  The support in Housing for All, all the housing models and the legislation all represent great work that has enabled the council to finally build mixed communities, but housing has to be delivered by the local authorities.  The Department needs to put maximum pressure on local authorities to deliver but, equally, it has to provide the resources for them to do so.  I do not expect the Minister to give me the details of the announcement he wishes to make on it, but we cannot throw enough resources at our local authorities to try to deliver on this.</p> <p>  This morning, local councillors in Ballymun are receiving an update on how housing that will be delivered on the nearly 20 sites there.  A site manager has been appointed by Dublin City Council for the Finglas sites of Kildonan and Finglas West.  There are also other sites in the constituency.  We will need resources to deliver those homes.  The Minister has provided the funding and the legislative base.  The last step is making sure the local authorities deliver by putting pressure on them but, equally, by supporting them.  I ask that staffing resources be provided for in the Estimates for this year and next year in order that local authorities will have no excuse.  There can be no excuse for not delivering local housing.  We have now done everything we need to do.  It is all about delivery, as far as I am concerned.  I would very much appreciate whatever the Minister can do in that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.482" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120200002#E00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  I will also use the opportunity to commend those councillors who supported the Oscar Traynor Road development.  That site has lain idle for 41 years.  Many excuses were used by people as to why they would not, could not or should not support the provision of just short of 1,000 homes, when it is looked at overall.  It is one of the biggest housing developments in Dublin.  It has 40% social housing, 40% cost rental and 20% affordable purchase.  I am also glad those councillors took the decision not to take what was seen as a short-term populist view to go back to the drawing board to find other mechanisms and other ways of doing it.  We need to deliver homes.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis.  People want to see that delivery.  I commend the councillors, Deputy McAuliffe, his colleagues and those across parties on their support for the Oscar Traynor Road development.  Those who did not support it will have to answer for that.  I want to see progress.  We are moving things on now.</p> <p>  To be fair, the majority, though not all, of the committee supported the Affordable Housing Act.  It is important Members know that, very significantly, the Act gives us the ability to be able to vary the affordable subvention, especially in areas where affordability is acute, such as Dublin, Cork and other regional cities.  Without going into the financial details of the Oscar Traynor Road site, one thing that was asked of me by Deputy McAuliffe when he was Lord Mayor, before his election to the D&aacute;il, by the previous Lord Mayor Hazel Chu and by the current Lord Mayor Alison Gilliland was to ensure we would have flexibility to be able to help on affordability.  I am using that development as an example.  I do not want to dwell on one particular site, but we have been able to do that now.  That flexibility has been allowed because of the legislation we have passed and because we have cost rental in place.</p> <p>  In thinking about what this Government has done, with very significant input from Deputy Duffy and the Chairman around the whole cost rental piece, we already have people in cost rental tenancies and a pipeline for hundreds more next year.  That is actual delivery and getting stuff done.  It is not just talking about it, debating it or going back around to see what is perfect for people.  We need homes for people.  It has been good and positive so let us be positive about that.</p> <p>  Everything next year has got to be about delivery.  We have now provided the tools for local authorities to deliver on affordable and social housing.  We will get their housing delivery action plans, which are on their way to me.  They are being concluded.  I am working with my team in the Department with the intention of publishing those plans on or about 17 December when we have collated the details.  We will certainly publish them by December or early January in order that it will be very clear what each local authority is responsible for delivering.  To be fair, the local authorities have worked very well with us as partners.  We spent a lot of time working with them on the new affordable measures.  This is new.  Let us remember most local authorities have not delivered an affordable house in 15 years.  We have new schemes in place now.  Our shared equity scheme is in place, which will deliver next year, separate to local authorities, and will help those who are renting right now or living with their folks, who feel they will never be able to own a home, to be able to get homes.</p> <p>  Next year will be a good year for delivery, but we need all our councillors to understand they are also responsible for delivering homes.  That is why I continue to encourage councillors not to oppose Part 8 planning applications or to find reasons to oppose provision of social, affordable and cost rental housing.  I ask them to find reasons to support it, not to delay things and to recognise the fact that people want and need homes.  It is not just a want but a right.  If we are going to do that, we all have to work together.  We now have Housing for All, which has more than &euro;20 billion in funding, our affordable housing fund in place and set up, and a social housing programme that is bigger than has ever been previously delivered multi-annually.  That is what will make a big difference to our local authorities.  They now have line of sight on their capital provision multi-annually.  That is important because we can plan and work with them.  I am very confident about how we will move on into the future.  We will be working with the committee and the local government sector to ensure we deliver on our targets next year.</p></speech>

I am hoping the Minister will keep things tight with his answers.  As was the case last year, the Estimates come in after local authorities draw up their budgets.  In Cork City Council, which the Minister referenced earlier, the loss of income and expenditure due to Covid-19 came in at approximately &euro;4 million.  This resulted in a shortfall of &euro;1.5 million in that council's budget, which meant it had to cut services to deliver a balanced budget.  Is the Minister saying the funding he has in place in the Supplementary Estimates means Cork City Council will recover the &euro;4 million?  Is the &euro;1.5 million shortfall that resulted in cuts to services also included in the Supplementary Estimates?  If it is, I welcome it.  I just have those two points.  I will have more questions after that.</p></speech>

The 2022 budget for Cork City Council is up &euro;14 million on 2022.  We will ensure that, with the passing of this budget and the Supplementary Estimates, there will be no loss.  We are plugging the hole for Cork city.  I met Ann Doherty and Brian Geaney in Cork on a number of occasions and have used them as exemplars.</p><p>It is a superb and progressive local authority.  No services are being cut, and none will be cut because of this Government.  We are putting the funding in place, as we have done right the way through, with a 100% rates rebate waiver all of the way through for local authorities.  On top of that, we will fill the hole left by the loss of income, which is significant enough for Cork city, with the passing of these Estimates today.</p><p> On the timing of the process and Estimates versus local authorities, there is an argument to be made for streamlining those timelines across the board.  That can pose some difficulties.  Local authorities explain the situation to members during budget negotiations or the budget process.  I know for a fact that Cork City Council would have advised, through its mayor and councillors, that our Department had been in touch with it on a weekly basis about financial supports.  </p><p>No services have been cut and no income has been lost.  There is &euro;14 million extra for Cork city for next year.  When the Deputy passes the Estimate today-----</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, the problem for local authorities is that they have to deliver a balanced budget.  They expect the money to come in afterwards.  When they pass a budget, it must be balanced.  I look forward to going back to Sinn F&eacute;in councillors in Cork City Council to tell them that there will be no cuts for the council next year and the money will be received.</p></speech>

I do not want people to go away with an incorrect perception of what is happening.  In 2022, &euro;14 million more has been allocated for Cork city.  There will be no loss in income this year because we are plugging the gap.  If councillors, through a budget, decide to cut one service or another or move money from one area to another, I do not micromanage the budget-----</p></speech>

This came from the finance department in Cork City Council.  I will make sure our councillors raise the matter and that the finance department contacts the Minister's Department.  If he has said everything is fine, I will trust him on that.</p> <p>  The derelict sites levy is not being collected.  A total of &euro;12.4 million should have been collected in levies over the years, but only &euro;375,000 has been collected nationally.  There are 13 local authorities not imposing any levies and 21 local authorities have not collected a single euro.  We are talking about housing.  I listened to the Minister and Deputy McAuliffe.  We could deliver houses within months.  We could solve the housing crisis.  It would be better for the climate crisis if we retrofitted existing buildings and turned them into housing.  It would deliver housing more quickly.  Why are only 3% of derelict sites levies being collected?  </p> <p>  The Minister is the 17th Minister with responsibility for housing since the derelict sites levy was introduced, but nothing has been done.  There have been Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Ministers.  Deputy Alan Kelly was also a Minister.  There may have been a Green Party Minister.  What is the Minister going to do about derelict sites?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120200002#F00500"><p>I will try to be brief, which the Deputy has asked me to be.  He asked a good long question.  I have no difficulty in saying that the derelict sites levy has not been collected properly.  I have said that and have issued the figures on that.  It does not work as it should do.  There are other things we can do.  We will bring forward the zoned land tax.  I look forward to Sinn F&eacute;in's support for that because the party has never proposed any other measures.  It has not brought forward any zoned land tax or activation measures in the 12-page alternative budget, which had no costings, it brought forward.  We are doing things.  This is being put together by the Department of Finance.  It will help to activate land and impose penalties when sites are not used, and rightly so.</p> <p>  Vacant property is an issue.  I am sure Deputy Gould has studied Housing for All.  One of the pathways involves tackling vacancies because it is a real issue.  To be fair to the Deputy, he highlights the issue on a regular basis.  We need to make sure that vacant properties in our town and cities are made viable and used.  That is why in Housing for All we published our plans for the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities fund which will help with viability and tackling vacancies in new development in our cities.  </p> <p>  We will come forward with new regulations and applications for above the shop living.  We will have to make some very tough decisions about what we are going to do.  Any measures taken heretofore with regard to above the shop living have, in my view, not worked as effectively as they should have.  I will seek, and look forward to, the support of all members who really want to tackle this.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the LDA and using State-owned land for developing social and affordable housing.  In Cork city and county we have said that any State land developed by the LDA must be 100% social and affordable.  When that legislation was voted on in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Gould voted against it.</p></speech>

In Cork city this year alone, with funding the Government has provided, 241 void units were brought back into use and have been allocated or occupied by social housing tenants.  In Cork county this year alone, 186 units have been allocated.  That is a significant figure.  Even the Deputy would recognise that might be positive news.</p></speech>

The 241 voids to which the Minister referred are simply units that were returned during the year.  I raised this matter when I was a councillor six or seven years ago.  There is no budget in housing for returning voids that come up every month.  This is something that we should consider.</p></speech>

In fairness, the Deputy always references the city council, and rightly so.  Voids are part of a separate programme.  When something is positive, I ask the Deputy to take a deep breath and acknowledge that fact.  Progress is being made.  He does not have to be negative about everything.</p></speech>

They have had a good long time.</p> <p>  The local government funding is extremely positive.  I am intrigued.  Like Deputy McAuliffe, I will not push the Minister on the additional resources for local authorities shortly to be announced under Housing for All, but it is extremely important.  Deputy Gould raised the issues of dereliction and vacancy.  We can do a lot more throughout our towns and villages.  Housing for All puts some very positive policy measures in place to help us to do that in terms of Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe and the local authority CPO functions we will introduce.  </p> <p>  Staff will be required to do that.  I know the Minister is aware of that, and has travelled extensively to meet chief executives.  He knows about the staff pressures in local authorities, especially in areas involving CPOs for vacant and derelict properties and the extra planning functions that will be required.  He understands the importance of the planning function and the interaction with the public realm that we need to offer.  As we regenerate and improve town centres, villages and city centres, and bring vacant commercial properties, including those with units over shops, into residential use, mixed use or whatever, there will have to be investment in the public realm.</p><p>We often look to a European model that involves a lot of urban and town centre living but, in many of those places, they have good, open public spaces and parks.  It is important that we have the staff in place to design, create and maintain those spaces, right down to the staffing levels in local authorities for outdoor and parks maintenance.  It requires a complex combination of staff working hard at local authority level to create those nice public spaces near which people want to live.  I attended the Irish Planning Institute conference recently, where I heard a presentation by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The point was made that if we plan towns and villages in which people want to live, tourists will want to visit them.  We all see the evidence of that and I know the Minister is aware of it and will take the measures required to deliver on the Housing for All objectives.  That plan includes the largest-ever budget of &euro;20 billion over the next five years for the provision of social and affordable housing.</p><p> I recently raised with the Minister in the D&aacute;il the issue of the provision of biodiversity officers at local authority level, which is crucial.  We had representatives of the Heritage Council before the committee some time ago for what was a very positive session.  All members are supportive of the work the council is trying to do across the country, as well as the incredibly important work of the heritage officers at local authority level.  The heritage officer in my local authority in Wicklow has a tremendous work output, which is appreciated by all council members and residents who interact with the work being done.  Just like we have heritage officers across our local authorities, I would really like to see the day when we have biodiversity officers throughout the State to support the good work of the planners.</p><p> My ultimate wish in terms of local authority staffing is to see county architects, who have a critical role in the planning process, in place throughout the State.  Planners look at individual planning applications and we have local area plans, county development plans and action areas.  A county architect can look at everything with a different set of eyes and bring all the elements together in a cohesive development approach across counties and towns.  I welcome the Supplementary Estimate and invite the Minister to respond if he so wishes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.504" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120200002#G00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for his remarks.  As he said, he and I had a discussion in the D&aacute;il on the role of biodiversity officers.  Four or five local authorities currently have biodiversity officers, which is not nearly enough.  Due to the Chairman's intervention and the work of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who has been exceptional in this area, we have provided sanction for the appointment of at least one biodiversity officer in each local authority area.  We have seen throughout the pandemic that people have become far more in tune with where they live and their natural and built environment.  That is why we have seen such an incredibly positive interest in our natural biodiversity and our heritage.  On the heritage side, we are putting in place another 125 posts or so for heritage officers.  Again, I commend the Minister of State on his enthusiastic work in this area.  We work very closely together on it.  Both of these areas of work are very good initiatives.</p> <p>  In my opening statement, I thanked local authority staff for the work they do, on which they lead from the front.  I have had the pleasure of travelling to all counties in the Republic.  I  met with the Chairman a number of times in his home county of Wicklow and we saw the work being done there and the new initiatives taken.  In Wicklow town, for example, I was blown away by the work done by the archivists in the county council on local government archives and archives of local history that would otherwise have been lost.  The local authority is now the curator of that history, thanks to the work of the two exceptional archivists the Chairman and I met.</p> <p>  That leads to my next point, which relates to the public realm and the moneys that have been provided for the pedestrianisation and improvement of the high street area in Wicklow town.  All of that funding was provided by the Government through the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, and the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF.  The work being done on Wicklow Gaol is another instance of that and we could choose similar examples in every county across the country.  The URDF funding, in particular, which is just short of &euro;2 billion, is important and much of it remains to be spent.  I was in Tralee during the summer, where incredible work is being done.  In Balbriggan, in my own area, the RRDF work is starting, which involves converting derelict buildings, opening up spaces and giving opportunities for businesses to come in.  It is a really exciting time and all of it is being driven by local government, supported by the Government, which is working with local authorities on a regular basis.</p> <p>  As I said, action is happening on the appointment of biodiversity and heritage officers.  In addition, more posts in planning will be sanctioned, as I referenced last night, as well as additional staff in all local authorities for the delivery of Housing for All.  We will make a significant announcement in this regard in the coming days, the details of which will be shared with the committee.  Following the passing of the Supplementary Estimate, we will be able to provide further additional funding to local authorities.</p> <p>  I take this opportunity to refer to CPOs, on which we need to do better.  Some local authorities do well in this regard and others must be supported to improve.  As members will be aware, under Housing for All, we will be getting the Housing Agency involved in another targeted round of CPOs in respect of derelict properties to put them back onto the market.  We will also issue CPOs for other properties to bring them into the social housing supply.  When we launch the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme, we will be able to provide grant assistance for people who want to buy a home that has been vacant for a certain period.  That will help owner-occupiers to make such properties into homes.  There are many good things happening in that delivery space.  I think I have covered most of the points raised by the Chairman.</p></speech>

I welcome the Supplementary Estimate and congratulate the Minister on all the work he is doing.  He has hit the ground running and everybody on the committee agrees that he is the man with all the solutions.  We are invigorated by his efforts to date, as I am sure everyone here agrees.</p> <p>  I want to follow up on the points raised by the Chairman regarding heritage officers and county architects.  In Longford County Council, both of those roles are in place and they are transformative.  The additional appointment of biodiversity officers would be a very welcome step.  I am delighted to hear that more staff are coming.  One of the major challenges we have in following through on the very ambitious plans to reform housing provision is the need for additional staff.</p> <p>  I want to flag a number of issues with the Minister, most of which I have already raised with him.  Ballymahon in County Longford needs a fire station.  Center Parcs is doing a major new development there, involving an additional 500 units and several hundred more staff.  The company has flagged the need for a new fire station, which I will follow up on with the Minister.</p> <p>  I previously raised with him issues to do with the old shared ownership scheme.  It is punitive for people to try to buy themselves out of that scheme.  I understand his officials are having a look at the issue and doing a scoping exercise to see what can be done to resolve it.  Is there any progress on that to date?</p> <p>  Regarding the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme and the commitment to a fresh start for people in second relationships, I would like to see something definite on that in the next couple of months.  Many people are in limbo as a result of the current uncertainty.</p> <p>  Affordable housing provision needs to be rolled out throughout the State, an ambition I know the Minister shares.  We really need to see it being done.</p> <p>  As we become more carbon and environmentally aware, an issue I am increasingly finding is that many elderly people in rural areas are living in inadequate houses.  For instance, I know of a lady in a rural location who owns her own home and is in receipt of a payment from the Department of Social Protection.  Her house is only valued at &euro;60,000 and, if she sells it, she will not be able to buy an adequate replacement.  There are schemes operating in Dublin whereby people can hand over properties to the local authorities and swap them for a new one.</p><p>I would like to see the Minister's officials look at something similar for rural Ireland to help those, increasingly older people, caught in such inadequate housing.</p><p> I hope I have left enough time for my colleague, Deputy Higgins.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120200002#H00200"><p>There is no way we can leave Deputy Higgins out.</p> <p>  Deputy Flaherty and the Chairman mentioned county architects.  There is a commitment in that regard in Housing for All.  Not all our counties have county architects.  They have been extremely valuable, particularly in making sure that the character of particular areas is maintained.  In Cork, Clonakilty and such places they have been really successful.  That is an action point and we will do it.  We will continue to roll out additional technical posts.  These are good jobs in which people can see they have really good opportunities to build real and lasting careers in our local government sector.  That is what I want.  I want our graduates coming into local government, I want apprenticeships in local government and I want people back out building, using their trades and so on.  We are working on the county architects element and will work on it further.</p> <p>  As for fire stations, Deputy Flaherty has mentioned Ballymahon to me before.  We are looking at it as part of the review.  Just so members know, we have a five-year capital plan worth &euro;61 million for fire services.  It is a very significant plan.  I have kept fire services directly under my remit.  I have immense regard for the women and men of our fire services all across the country.  I have had the pleasure of visiting many of the fire stations across the country.  We have seen great improvements to their facilities and equipment.  That capital plan is really significant and we will drive it on.  There will be a review of it early in the new year, so any Deputies who have matters they wish to raise, as Deputy Flaherty has done with Ballymahon, may do so and we will revert to them on those matters.</p> <p>  The Fresh Start principle permeates all the affordable housing mechanisms and schemes we have in place.  It is really important to people who may have gone through a marriage break-up, personal insolvency, etc.  Fresh Start will apply also to the revised Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which is the local authority affordable home loan.  We have already reduced the rating on it.  We are making some further changes to it.  I have issued letters and circulars on affordable housing to all local authorities.  All directors of housing services and chief executives have also had full briefings on affordable housing with my housing team.  We are helping them and working together to do this.</p> <p>  I wish to leave time for Deputy Higgins to come in.</p></speech>

I call on Deputy Higgins.  Minister, if you could respond and make your closing statement in the next three minutes, that would be helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-02a.510" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1566" speakername="Emer Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120200002#H00400"><p>I will talk fast.  I welcome the historic investment in the housing budget, which, of course, is the number one priority for all of us on the committee.  I know that that funding will be used to help people to own their own home or to get into long-term affordable leases.  That is very welcome.  I also welcome the &euro;2 billion URDF funding.  We see the benefits of that funding in Lucan every day.  The Minister was there for the opening of Tandy's Park and saw the huge impact the funding has had.  Airlie Park is under construction.  It is good to hear that the Minister is preparing to make announcements on additional planning and housing staff for local authorities.  They are badly needed.  We need more people not only in housing to make sure that the budget is being exhausted and spent in the right place but also in planning when it comes to everything from enforcement right through to decision-making.</p> <p>  As for resourcing, I have two quick suggestions for the Minister.  First, I ask that he look at costing a clerk of works role across local authorities and decide whether that could be incorporated long-term into planning policy and legislation to ensure that planning is appropriately regulated.  Second is the creation of an animal welfare officer in each local authority.  The Minister might think that that might impact only rural councils, but urban ones such as mine in south Dublin have an awful lot of dealings with horses in particular.  My Lovely Horse Rescue has been calling for this measure.</p> <p>  I have a further brief question that the Minister might answer if there is time.  It is about the key performance indicators, KPIs, or goals for chief executives.  The Department has a stringent rhythm and cadence in respect of its reporting on housing, social housing in particular.  The Department captures the affordable housing metrics as well.  I would like to know if it measures other things.  When it allocates money for vacant or void units, for example, does the Minister get a reassurance that those resources are ring-fenced by each local authority and spent for that specific use?  When the Minister makes announcements in this regard, he usually says the funding is enough to cover 150 units or whatever per local authority.  Is the Minister made aware when that housing comes back into stock?  Does he get that reported on?</p></speech>

I am afraid I have to end the meeting in the next minute.</p></speech>

I mean that genuinely.  She has been very progressive and positive about things.</p> <p>  Yes, we track allocation of moneys and outputs.  We give funding only on a recoupment basis.  The work has to be done before we give it, so we know what the funding is given for.</p> <p>  As for a clerk of works post, those types of posts and project manager posts will be announced in the coming days.  We are considering that.</p> <p>  Deputy Higgins is right that animal welfare is really important.  It generally falls under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine but I can raise the matter with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, because there is interaction between his Department and local authorities.  The matter is mainly a function of his Department, but the Deputy makes a very good point and I understand completely why she has raised it.  I will raise it with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue.</p> <p>  Deputy Higgins's council is South Dublin County Council, and I have been out there with her a number of times.  Tandy's Park is magnificent.  That whole area is seeing new homes built for families with brilliant new facilities being delivered in partnership between the local authority and the private sector.  The local authority is doing it with State money; private builders are doing it as well.  Everyone, public and private, has to work together to deliver the facilities we need.  There is no utopia where the State will do everything for everyone.  It does not work that way.  It is good that we are delivering good, affordable homes and facilities for people.</p> <p>  I ask Deputy Higgins to come directly to me on any other matters she wishes to raise.  I thank her for her support.</p></speech>
