The weeks leading up to the summer recess are particularly busy and other Deputies may also be otherwise engaged this morning.  There are several other committees sitting at present.</p> <p>  Please note that to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, to be respectful of other people&rsquo;s physical space, and to adhere to any other public health advice.</p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Ms Paula O'Connor, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to examine arrangements in place for accountability and oversight of the expenditure of central government funds in the local government sector.  The examination is in the context of chapter 3, central government funding of local authorities, from the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2020.  As per the request of the committee, the Department has provided a response to a series of questions regarding its oversight of expenditure of central government funds in the local government sector.  Briefing documents have also been received from the Local Government Audit Service, the National Oversight and Audit Commission, and the Association of Irish Local Government.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the Department: Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General; Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue, principal officer; Mr. David Kelly, principal officer; Ms Sin&eacute;ad Kehoe, finance officer; and Mr. Diarmuid O&rsquo;Leary, principal officer.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department: Ms Fiona Quinn, assistant secretary, and Ms Sinead O&rsquo;Gorman, principal officer.</p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, two of our witnesses today are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  These witnesses have already been advised of this and may think it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022062300002#A00600"><p>Local authorities receive a substantial part of their annual funding from a wide range of central government Departments and agencies.  As the stream of funds to local authorities is so complex, I report annually on the funds flow, drawing attention to the broad purposes for which the funding is provided.</p> <p>  Figure 3.1 in the chapter outlines the funding flows for 2020, indicating that the total funding provided amounted to around &euro;6.1 billion.  Almost two thirds of the transfer was issued from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, either from its Vote or from the Local Government Fund.  Just under 18% of the funding issued directly or indirectly from the Vote for Transport, while a further 12% issued from the Vote for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, via Enterprise Ireland.  The remaining 5% of the funding issued from a wide variety of sources.</p> <p>  Members should note that the relative percentages for 2020 reflected the significant impacts of special Covid-19 related funding.  Stripping out that exceptional funding, the two main funders of the local authorities are the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Transport.  In 2020, central government funding represented about two thirds of the total expenditure incurred by local authorities.  This was significantly up on the situation in 2019, when about half of local authority expenditure was covered by transfers from central government.</p> <p>  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage oversees the operation of the local government system, providing the policy framework within which local authorities work and deliver services to communities.  It also sets the governance and assurance framework within which financial reporting by local authorities is undertaken and performance by local authorities is assessed and reported on.</p> <p>  The financial statements of each local authority are audited by the Local Government Audit Service, which is part of the Department but operates independently.  Following each audit, the audit opinion and any matters arising from the audit are reported to the relevant local authority.  A copy of each audit report is sent to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The audit service also carries out value for money audits of local authority operations, the results of which are reported to the Minister, and produces an activity report each year, highlighting both sectoral and authority-specific issues.  All of the audit service's reports are published on the Department's website.  The submission of the service&rsquo;s reports to the Minister provides an opportunity for the Department to identify any emerging concerns across the sector or any outstanding concerns in individual local authorities that warrant follow-up.</p> <p>  The National Oversight and Audit Commission is a statutory body established in July 2014 to strengthen the oversight and scrutiny of the local government sector.  It exercises this scrutiny by means of both overview and thematic reviews and, where warranted, may hold oral hearings on matters within its remit.  It publishes an annual performance indicator report, providing comparative information in respect of local authorities across a broad range of services.  Since 2017, it has been engaged in a programme of review of the performance of individual local authorities and has published reports arising from that process in respect of 17 local authorities.  The commission publishes its reports on its website.  Expenditure in respect of the activities of the commission activities is borne on the Local Government Fund.  Although the Department provides accommodation and secretarial support, the operations of the commission are independent of the Department, as provided for by law.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Doyle" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022062300002#A00800"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I am pleased to be here to assist the committee in its examination of chapter 3, central government funding of local authorities.  The Chairman has introduced my colleagues in attendance, who are mainly from the local government side of the Department.  We look forward to discussing the arrangements for accountability and oversight of the local government sector in the context of the report.  I have provided advance briefing material for the meeting, including my opening statement and responses to the questions we received with the letter of invitation.</p><p> I acknowledge the vital role local government plays in our society as the arm of government closest to the homes and businesses of our citizens.  The role local authorities play and the services they provide are key to the good functioning, place-making, development and economic well-being of our communities.  Never was that more obvious than during the pandemic, when local authorities were central to the community-led response that helped to protect people throughout our society, particularly the most vulnerable.  They were also central to the sustainable reopening of our local economies when restrictions were lifted.  The local government sector has again been asked to take on a key role, in co-operation with a number of Departments, in the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis.  Local government has shown time and again it is willing and able to step up in these situations.</p><p> When we explore issues of governance, accountability and oversight arrangements in the local government sector, it is important we begin by acknowledging the constitutional status of local government.   The twentieth amendment to the Constitution provided a constitutional basis for local government in Ireland as a forum for democratic representation and for the exercising of statutory functions at local level that are separate from the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Local authorities, therefore, are independent statutory bodies with their own democratically elected councils and management structures.  We would compare them with a board of directors of a corporate entity which is supported in the performance of its reserved functions by a full-time chief executive.  The council, acting by resolution, decides on the policy of the local authority, and the chief executive operates within that framework of policy.  The council enjoys powers to request information, issue directions, oversee the work of the chief executive and hold him or her to account.  The council performs the primary oversight role in the local authority.  The members of the council ultimately put themselves before the electorate every five years.</p><p> An internal audit function is in place in every local authority.  It provides independent opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls across the organisation and it provides assurance the significant operating risks are identified, managed and controlled.  That function is independent in the performance of its duties and reporting.  The chief executive is required to ensure the internal audit function is adequately resourced.  The role of the audit committee was strengthened in the Local Government Reform Act 2014, making the committee a key component of local authority governance arrangements.  The audit committee&rsquo;s independent role is to support the elected council by providing an independent assessment of the activities of management in controlling the local authority and the quality of the risk management, financial reporting, financial management and internal audit.  The results of that are reported to and considered by the council.  Within the organisational structure, the audit committee's position is to report directly to the council, and that maintains its independence from the executive.</p><p> The local government audit service, LGAS, performs the independent, external audit of local government, providing independent scrutiny of local authority finances.  The local government auditor sets out, in the form of a management letter to the chief executive, any issues raised as part of the audit.  That report, including the chief executive&rsquo;s response, is published on both the local authority and the Department's websites.  The audit committee considers that report and prepares a report to the elected council for its consideration.  The council considers the financial statements, the audit report and the report of the audit committee.</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General has mentioned the establishment of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC.  The governance and accountability arrangements that the Comptroller and Auditor General and I have outlined are multilayered and robust.  They have been set down in legislation made by the Oireachtas, most notably in the Local Government Act 2001, and the Local Government Reform Act 2014 strengthened them.  The role of the Minister and the Department is to ensure an appropriate framework of policy and legislation is in place in relation to local government systems, including its structures, human resources, financing and broad oversight as set out in the Local Government Act 2001.  The Minister does not have a role in individual decisions made by local authorities, except in a limited number of circumstances where there may be a specific statutory provision for ministerial approval.</p><p> In the context of this session to discuss chapter 3, it is important to note there are robust arrangements in place for ensuring appropriate oversight governing the flow of funds through Government sources to local authorities.  Local authorities receive a substantial part of their annual funding from a range of central Departments and agencies, which the Comptroller and Auditor General has outlined.  A significant element of funding comes from the Local Government Fund, and one of my colleagues runs the administration of that fund.</p><p> The Department has the necessary mechanisms in place to provide appropriate assurance about the regularity, propriety and efficiency of the Department&rsquo;s operations in the disbursement of public moneys, including the substantial funding going to local authorities.  These mechanisms include the principles of public financial procedures and the public spending code as outlined in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's circular 13/2014, and they are underpinned by strong internal control systems, sound internal audit, audit committee arrangements and effective risk management.  Funding from other Departments is subject to a similar control environment.</p><p> For funding provided to local authorities from this Department, the Department, as sanctioning authority, assesses each project and proposal for suitability, value for money, and compliance, including with the public spending code and statutory building regulations etc.  Detailed grant approval, payment and performance monitoring arrangements are in place across all Department funding arrangements.  Overall, policy is set by Government but most often implementation is guided by a framework which is set at programme level.  The Department rigorously analyses and evaluates that and it does so with the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Local authorities operating projects under a particular programme do so under clear procedures and guidance set out in circulars and framework agreements.</p><p> The Department has continued to work closely with local government and will continue to do so, in recognition of the critical nature of the services local authorities provide to the public, which number in excess of 1,000 services.  The highest standards in governance and oversight are also being applied to the disbursement and use of public funds, and this will not be compromised.  My colleagues and I will be happy to respond to questions or issues that emerge in the course of the committee&rsquo;s work today.</p></speech>

It is true that local government in Ireland does not get the level of scrutiny at an Oireachtas level that perhaps it should.  I have been a member of a local authority, like many other members of this committee, and I want to ask Mr. Doyle if he thinks the current system is fit for purpose.  The role of local authority members is not really defined as to whether it is full-time or part-time.  For the sake of comparison, what a chief executive is on is many multiples the wage of a county councillor.  Is that a sustainable model that is fit for purpose in a 21st century democracy where significant policy has to be analysed, zoning has to be looked at and many other key decisions have to be looked at?  Let there be no doubt about the enormous power chief executives in particular have in this country when it comes to decision-making within their local authorities, which can cause substantial problems.  Is that a model that will be sustainable going into the next decade?  I do not think it is but I would like to get Mr. Doyle's opinion on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Doyle" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022062300002#B00400"><p>Local government has generally performed well, especially in recent times with some of the circumstances I have mentioned.  People at local government level show great commitment and we see that from councillors.  There have been a number of efforts to improve the situation the Deputy referred to and to support councillors over time.  There have been developments such as the Moorhead report, there has been training, and efforts have been made to try to recognise some of the issues for people operating at local government level.  In some cases people do it full time and in some cases they operate differently.  It is clearly a challenging and onerous position for somebody to have and no doubt it requires a significant time commitment.  Some of the efforts and reforms in recent years have been undertaken with that in mind.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022062300002#B00500"><p>I have to interrupt Mr. Doyle because I am against the clock.  The Department sat on the Moorhead report for a long time.  I know it required a decision to be taken, which was done.  I am in no doubt about the enormous workload that is on county councils.  I am concerned about the model we have, where people are essentially in a full-time job where they have that full-time responsibility of analysing and scrutinising all of the work that has to be done within a local authority, which is enormous in some areas.  I was a member of Cork County Council, which is one of the largest in the country in terms of its budget.  I have a concern about the fact there are 54 members on that local authority and that the time commitments different individuals can give differ.</p><p>It would be healthier for local governments in Ireland if we had a full-time set position and policy was laid down by the Department or some analysis was done in that regard.  The Moorhead report clearly showed the enormous work burden on members of local authorities in this country.  I am not questioning that for one moment.  I am questioning the model we have in this country, which we practically inherited from the United Kingdom after independence.  It is not fit for purpose anymore.  It is not the best way to go in order to ensure proper oversight of local governments in this country.  Members of this committee will know how challenging it is for us to ask questions of local authorities because they are not very co-operative in many cases.  I will not speak about any individual case.</p><p> I wish to move forward and ask about the requirement for local authorities to provide financial statements.  There are many differences when it comes to auditing.  Why is there not a requirement for local authorities' financial statements to be accompanied by a statement of internal control such as is required by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's 2016 code of practice for the governance of State bodies?</p></speech>

That forms the bulk of the work carried out by the local government audit service.  It audits that system of internal controls and reports to the council.</p></speech>

I am a chartered accountant by profession although it is a long time since I have engaged in audit work.  It is a little more significant in the sense that there are three reports from the local government audit service.  One is the audit report itself, which essentially sets out the opinion of the local government auditor.  The second is a report to members raising issues that in the view of the local government auditor the members should see.  The third is a management letter, which is a standard feature of auditing and which seeks improvements, makes suggestions to management or points out issues they should address.</p></speech>

Has the Department of Transport, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or any other Government Department consulted the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage about the oversight mechanisms in place within the local government sector?</p></speech>

We obviously talk with other Government Departments at times where it is required in respect of work that is going on with local authorities.  Each Accounting Officer in every Government Department has a set of procedures.  They are similar in many cases because they emanate from the same structures.  Those procedures govern the programmes and the money that is dispersed to local authorities.  The public spending code applies to local authorities in the same way it applies to Government Departments.

Is that not a bit odd?  The requirement is obviously there because it is considered best practice to meet the highest standards when auditing public expenditure.  Is there a particular reason for the exclusion of the requirement for a statement of internal control?  Is it not strange that local authorities are exempt from that code of practice?</p></speech>

It is the basis on which whoever is carrying out the audit, in this case the local government audit service, carries out the majority of its audit tasks, as I understand it.  Internal controls will be fully documented.  They must be, in the context of allowing the local government audit service, or any auditor, to carry out its work.  As the committee will be aware given its experience in these issues, audits have over time become focused on the system of internal control.  In the past, they would have focused on substantive audit sampling and testing, and trying to draw assurances from that.  It is generally regarded as much more important to look at the system of control itself and the controls and assurances it provides.</p></speech>

Does he think that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's code of practice represents best practice if one is to meet the highest standards?  I am sure that is how Mr. McCarthy would do it, for reasons of transparency, etc.  Does Mr. McCarthy not find it a bit odd that local authorities do not have to do that?</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is the standard setter in respect of the accountability of public bodies in Ireland generally.  It is, at the end of the day, a matter for the Accounting Officer to explain why there might be different treatment for local authorities.</p><p>As the committee knows, I do not audit the local authorities.  However, it is something that stands out as being a non-standard presentation of financial statements that there would not be a declaration by the responsible people in relation to the controls they operate.  Particularly what would be missing would be an explanation, if there any weaknesses in control or any losses as a result of control lapses, that those would not be disclosed by the entity itself rather than leaving it to the auditor to identify them and report on them individually.  That would be my view.</p></speech>

That is fair enough.  We constantly hear references - I was a member of a local authority - to the independence and constitutional role of local government when, in reality, that is not the case.  As long as local authorities are depending on Exchequer funding, there is very little independence.

The Department stated in March last that the implementation of the recommendations made is a matter for the management of the local authority.  In the scheme of things, what the Deputy is trying to convey to Mr. Doyle is that councillors would be reluctant to take on the county management and whether it is implemented or not is a matter for the manager and the management structure within the local authority.  The councillors have very little hope of being able to force that.  In view of the discussion here this morning, what is clear so far is that the committee - it is not for me to decide - will discuss recommendations in relation to any report we issue on this, that there should be a statement of internal control for local authorities.  Given the amount of money, they do very good work but it is clear that there is a weakness in that regard.</p></speech>

My first question relates to the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme on 23 March 2022.  I will quote two examples they gave about the lack of accountability.  The first example was Cavan County Council in 2017 and an allegation of fake invoices.  An investigation was initiated but there has been no publication of the results of that investigation.  The second example goes back further.  It goes back to 2009 with Cork County Council.  It was to do with land where the council had agreed to pay &euro;11 million for lands in Charleville, which a number of months earlier had been sold for only &euro;8 million.  Again, an investigation was carried out but results were never published.  It went back to 2009.  This all raises the question about accountability.  This is public money.  It is taxpayers' money and it is ratepayers' money.  How does the Department deal with a situation where there are investigations and still no reports have been published or made available to the public?</p></speech>

In a number of cases, some of the situations that were noted in the programme were subject to Garda and other investigations.</p></speech>

We have obligations under the Act to protect the identity of the discloser, and there are also rights given to people named in disclosures such as that, whether there are allegations against them or they are generally named.  This is the first thing we must be careful about in the context of what is said in these instances.</p> <p>  The second point is that while the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" report said there was no Garda investigation, in fact the information we have from Cavan County Council is that it was informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the file is not closed.  It is not that there is no investigation, the open file remains open.</p></speech>

I do not see in any of the reports an acknowledgement of the contribution of commercial ratepayers to local authorities.  It must be remembered that they pay a substantial sum of money to local authorities.

It is a very welcome development in that there are now two local authorities dealing with planning and all of the other issues in relation to their areas.  There is a situation, however, where there are 50 court orders and a dispute with the local authorities as to who has responsibility.  Together with my three colleagues in Cork North Central, we wrote on 22 of June 2021 to both of the chief executives and to the Department looking for clarification.  Four Deputies signed that letter.  Here we are, 12 months later, and nothing has happened.  These are 50 court orders relating to breach of planning.  Nothing has happened on this.  It is not acceptable that nothing has happened on this over the 12 months to date.  There seems to be an internal dispute over whether the county council should pursue it or the city council should pursue it.  Again, this is about public accountability.  There are 50 court orders for breach of planning that were secured by the county council but the properties are now in the jurisdiction of the city council.  There is a dispute now over who should take the next step.</p></speech>

This is an area where sharing best practice and learning from each other through the work of the Local Government Management Agency, the National Oversight and Audit Commission and the audit reports may bring a little bit more consistency to some of these issues.  Perhaps Ms Quinn or Ms O'Gorman would like to come in here.  This is an issue on which they may have little bit more knowledge.</p></speech>

That had increased from &euro;88.2 million in the previous year.  The rents are calculated in accordance with each council's differential rent scheme and are collected from local authority tenants.  As the Deputy has said, the rents collection performance of each local authority varies.  It is shown in appendix No. 7 of the latest local authority financial statements.  Practices vary.</p><p>Where large differences like that appear, although we have no role to compel any action with the local authority, we would advise the finance team in the local authority to engage with other local authorities where best practices have emerged and collection rates would be higher.  There are different circumstances prevailing in the different environments of local authorities, including the range of urban and city-based authorities and more rural-based authorities.  When it comes to collection of rents or rates, where there are highly performing local authorities, we ask the other local authorities to perhaps engage with them and try to apply best practice themselves.  We have seen over the years that collection level of rates have improved massively.</p></speech>

To pick up on Deputy Burke's point, there is a sense of relying on going back to best practice where there are variations between councils, as Ms O'Gorman mentioned, and coming together in the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and other places.  There was mention of having one council speak to another about applying best practice.  This highlights an ongoing concern for the committee about a failure of centralised control over these matters.  We are talking about &euro;94 million this year and &euro;88 million last year.  Those are large sums and just one element of local government performance and delivery of services.</p> <p>  My concern, as the committee notes, is there may be insufficient controls centrally in this regard.  What is Mr. Doyle's role as Secretary General of the Department with the councils, for example?  How does he follow up exactly that point where there is a different treatment in collecting rent?  What is his follow-up with councils about that?</p></speech>

We will find out what the issues are and try to find ways to suggest improvement.  As Ms O'Gorman suggests, one of the ways to do this is trying to see what is working well elsewhere and replicate it.  We may also work with the LGMA on such matters.  If the income stream comes directly back to the council and into the council's own funds, we are always interested in seeing best practice applied in such circumstances.</p></speech>

It is similar to what Mr. Doyle said earlier, but, again, it goes back to my concern about asking the councils to speak to each other, pick up the phone and hand-hold our way through the process.  What happens after that.  What is the next step?  This is where there a concern about auditing, so what is next?</p> <p>  When we look at the Department accounts versus local authority accounts, for example, we can see clearly on the Department side the streams of social housing delivery, for instance, and where it is intended.  We cannot see that on the local authority side.  There is an inconsistent standard applied between them.  For example, I have a concern about social housing delivery.  We have been relying on the construction status report, where we might get detailed information, and we have not seen it for the first quarter of this year.  It is now the end of June.  Where are we on that?  These are the mechanisms the Department has put in place in order to co-ordinate delivery from local authorities in the absence of being able to do anything else to effect consistent local authority delivery.</p></speech>

It is exactly what I mean.  We have a housing crisis and we are trying to effect delivery.  There is a substantial body being given both to the Department and local authorities to do that.  These numbers are extremely important to us.  The inconsistency between local authorities and approved housing bodies and deliveries from those is one of the reasons this was centralised.  When Mr. Doyle was here before, we spoke about changing the four-stage process into a one-stage process and that was for departmental oversight and control in order to effect better or speedier delivery with local authorities.  How has that been going?  What is the pipeline in respect of that?  How many have been delivered through that changed process?</p></speech>

Mr. Kelly has figures for how many have used the single-stage process; I believe it is of the order of 90.</p></speech>

There are 90 separate projects and approximately 600 units.  On the process itself, the aim is to balance an efficient approvals process with public value for money.  There is an action in Housing for All for us to review those approval processes and make them as streamlined as possible.  A working group was set up late last year with Mr. John O'Connor, a former chief executive of the Housing Agency, as chair.  We were looking at de-risking potential delays and looking at providing funding for pre-application site assessment by local authorities to speed up that aspect.  We were looking to support local authorities with the use of single-stage processes where possible.</p> <p>  There have been cases, I suppose, where local authorities have enjoyed the comfort of working through the four-stage process and the support provided by the Department and the technical team.  Some local authorities have chosen to go through that four-stage process because it is a well understood system that is robust and provides a very thorough evaluation of the project.  There is robust oversight of procurement and design.  Some local authorities have chosen to continue using that.</p></speech>

It is interesting because when this was introduced, it was set out - perhaps it was just a perception - as a panacea for social housing delivery.  The idea was that the block arose from the big, bad Department causing too much of an obstruction for local authorities.  A number of 600 units nationally coming through the one-stage pipeline seems very low.  Is it lower than expectations?</p></speech>

Under Housing for All, one of the key issues is building the capacity of local authorities and teams.  Last year, the Minister approved an additional 250 staff for the local authority sector specifically for social housing delivery teams.  The majority of those are technical resources so we are building the capacity of local authorities to design and deliver housing schemes.  Most of those posts are engineers, architects and technicians.  We are really working to build the capacity of local authority to develop schemes.</p> <p>  We are also enhancing the role of the Housing Agency to support both local authorities and approved housing bodies to develop and deliver schemes.  That capacity building will support local authorities.</p></speech>

As Secretary General, Mr. Doyle has the largest housing budget there has ever been.  That is in addition to the broad stream of local authority funding.  Is Mr. Doyle satisfied the departmental controls are sufficient in chasing up local authority delivery?  Is he satisfied that the mechanisms are there to do it?</p> <p>  Forgive me if I am wrong, but I believe the Departmental does not provide a quarterly update to the relevant joint committee as it did previously.  I do not see the construction status report, although I appreciate that it will be out next week.  Nonetheless, Mr. Doyle cannot provide me with any details in respect of it.  Is he satisfied that there is sufficient departmental oversight over and accountability in respect of local authorities on this matter?</p></speech>

There is a huge amount of oversight and accountability.  What I am very anxious to do might be slightly dangerous to say it before the Committee of Public Accounts.  On one level, we must control and be careful around the use of State money in the context of all the processes and procedures we have in place.  At another level, we must ensure the projects are delivered and houses get through.  We must balance the scrutiny with delivery.  It is very important we work with the local authorities in that respect.</p></speech>

I want to take up on the point that the committee identified earlier about having more assurances for control, weaknesses being identified, and putting appropriate controls in place to manage those risks.

Obviously, the standards in terms of the protection of assets and compliance with procurement and so on are there as obligations.  Going back to what we were discussing earlier about the SIC, an auditor typically audits something that exists.  If the declarations do not exist, it is much more difficult for the auditor to carry out a programme of work that would address whether it is compliant, complete and accurate.</p></speech>

It is an open competition process.  Anybody can apply for it, obviously, if they meet the criteria for it.  The PAS board will have two external members on it and two members nominated by the Department, one of whom would normally be me or the assistant secretary who holds the role in the local government division.  They then go through an open process.  There are a number of stages to it.  There could be shortlisting and a preliminary interview, and then there will be a final interview which might include presentations.  A whole process of assessment is done by the PAS, including all the normal vetting you would expect any public servant to go through, including Garda vetting.  Indeed, a significant psychometric analysis test is done as well.  It is a very extensive process and takes quite a bit of time.  The PAS will then make a recommendation to the council, and the council will decide whether to appoint the chief executive designate.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Doyle and his colleagues.  It is good to have them before the committee.  I will begin by referring to the issue around NOAC, as well as the local authority audit committees and the LGAS.  Specifically, what is the difference between the LGAS and NOAC?  Do their processes run in parallel to each other?  How do they interact with the Department, for example?</p></speech>

The LGAS is part of the Department but operates independently, so the funding etc. comes through the Department.  The LGAS is purely an audit service.  It carries out standard financial audits and value-for-money audits.  It does so across the local government system and also in respect of one or two other bodies that have been assigned to it.  NOAC has a different role, which is really about monitoring overall performance, outputs and standards within the local government sector.  It looks at financial performance but it also looks at overall performance.  It looks at a range of things like compliance with the spending code, for example.  It looks at best practice across the local government system.  One particular tool it uses now, which was referred to earlier, is the scrutiny report process.</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned that there were 17 of those.  Each local authority goes through a two-stage process for going about that work and reporting on it.  My colleague Ms Quinn has very strong knowledge of NOAC and-----</p></speech>

It was said that the National Oversight and Audit Commission hosts oral hearings from time to time.  I appreciate that is an outside body but could the witnesses furnish the committee with information on that?  If not today they might be able to send a note afterwards.  How many oral hearings did the commission hold in 2021?</p></speech>

Some of the issues, as Mr. Doyle has said, highlight governance or compliance issues.  Looking at some of the council reports and the audits of the Local Government Audit Service, some of the issues in local authorities are recurring year on year.  Some relate to compliance in tendering and so on and some are internal issues.  How does the Department interact and engage with those local authorities on those specific issues?  Am I right in saying there is a specific section within the Department that liaises with the local authorities on audits?</p></speech>

My strong impression from that conversation was that she is seeing a lot of improvement in the quality of the internal audit functions within local government.  She is also seeing much better representation at audit committee level.  A lot of people with very strong professional skills and relevant skills have come onto audit committees over the last number of years, for whatever reason.  Regarding the trends and some of the same issues occurring, she said it is not that improvement is not happening in those situations.  She is seeing improvement but quite a number of issues are raised year after year because they are being unwound over a number of years.</p></speech>

With a number of those reports, particularly around tendering, nothing needs to be unwound; it needs to be implemented.  We are talking about a sizeable amount of public money.  What is being done, either by the Department or by the audit section, as part of a carrot-and-stick approach to ensure local authorities comply on issues that are clearly being repeated year after year?  The problems my not specifically relate to the same contracts but there is a lack of compliance in the organisation.  What can be done about that?</p></speech>

Considering Mr. Doyle's recent conversation with the local government auditor and audit section of his Department, he might look at that for the next time we discuss this issue.</p> <p>  I would like to ask Ms Quinn about the Public Appointments Service process.  There are a lot of vacant positions, as the witnesses will be more than aware, across the local government sector.  I have heard reports that it is taking months to fill those positions but that is not because of a lack of applicants.  The applicants and panels are there.  It is all taking too long to deliver.  What can be done in that regard?</p> <p>  On the local property tax, do the witnesses have figures for the number of deferrals being availed of across the country?  If not, I ask them to send them on.  I would like to know the percentages and numbers of people availing of a deferral of the payment of their property tax.  Since new homes from 2013 to today are now liable, maybe they could include those figures as well.</p></speech>

In both cases there are challenges.  We are experiencing this right across the State in the public and private sectors when recruiting and trying to ensure a sufficient pipeline of experienced and appropriately qualified staff coming on board.  That is reflective of the economy in general.  We will work with the Public Appointments Service, as the local government sector does.  The CCMA and LGMA have regular meetings with the Public Appointments Service to ensure that recruitment process keeps moving.  It is a challenge right across the economy, as we know, and particularly for skilled staff like senior executive engineers.  We are seeing it in the Civil Service with planners and IT staff.  All we can do is keep working on that and try to work with the Public Appointments Service to ensure we get staff on board as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

My colleague, Ms O'Donoghue, does all the work on that.  Regarding our own funding into the local government sector, which as the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, is a reasonable proportion of it, along with transport, a range of Departments provide funding to the local government sector and that sector operates on their behalf and in accordance with their procedures around that funding.  Each Accounting Officer will separately deal with his or her Department's element of funding disbursed through the local authority system.</p></speech>

I find it strange Mr. Doyle, as the Secretary General for the Department with responsibility for local government, was not aware of an issue of this significance.

Essentially, there are three elements to the report it does on a local authority.</p><p>The first element is the audit report itself.  The second comprises issues that should be raised for the attention of members of the local authority.  The third is the management letter, which highlights areas for improvement or areas on which it would like to see better controls or whatever the case may be.  It also carries out value-for-money audit reports.</p></speech>

It is concerning that it is not picked up by the local government audit team but by another Department that does different types of audits but also carries out spot checks on the use of money.  This was picked up in a random check.  It was not done on an annual basis by the local government audit team.</p></speech>

Basically, local government is being presented with what it needs to know, rather than the specifics of a certain programme that is delivered by other Departments.  That is the challenge that faces the Department's local government audit team in terms of findings.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to come in on that.</p></speech>

If the county council became aware of a breach of controls, I would expect it to go to the local government auditor, tell the auditor there has been a problem which it is looking into and about which the auditor needed to be aware.  The auditor should not be expected to find everything.  This is why it goes back to the declarations being made by the county manager or whoever with regard to the code of practice.  It is important that there is openness and a willingness to confront lapses in control that occur and to get to them quickly and to solve them.  In fact, in a situation such as that, local management has to make sure that this does not happen again.  It is not for the auditor to chase it, make recommendations and wait years for it to be solved.  That is a general principle that should be emphasised.</p></speech>

I am not arguing against what happens now but funding comes from a number of Departments.  One of our recommendations, when we come to putting a report together, might be that the Secretary General be notified of issues such as that and there be crossover.  Would that be helpful to the Deputy?</p></speech>

The Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, is not here today.  I want to acknowledge the work that it does.  The AILG came out with the old Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and the General Council of County Councils.  In the past decade, since I left my local authority, it has professionalised the training for councillors.  I acknowledge that because it is one of the good things that has happened.</p> <p>  One area has become obvious to me from listening to the exchanges here this morning.  Mr. Doyle mentioned the board of directors.  I heard that when I was first elected to a local authority.  I have been on a board of directors and have chaired a board of directors.  It is very different.  My relationship with the manager, as chairperson of a board of directors, is very different to that with a cathaoirleach of a local authority or that of the members of a local authority, in terms of the power balance.</p> <p>  One of the areas in which training is needed, through working with the Department, is when councillors are elected.  I think the Institute of Public Administration, IPA, also has an involvement in this regard.  The budget comes in October and councillors are elected, some of whom are coming in for the first time.  I also bear in mind that there has been a gap over the past two years because of Covid when training could not have happened.  It is important that training happens immediately on the budget process.  Is there anything the Department can do to help the AILG with that?</p> <p>  We need to give councillors the confidence because of the power balance.  I am not having a go at anybody.  During my time in a local authority, I was very lucky.  We had an excellent chief executive, Mr. Peter Carey, at the time.  However, councillors are reluctant to question a county manager or a director of service because, sometimes, it can make life hard for a councillor on some of the councils.  That is just a matter of a fact.</p> <p>  Councillors do not always realise that they have the power.  I constantly say to councillors that they are the corporate structure.  The legal entity of the local authority is the people in the chamber.  It is not the officials, who are employees.  That is always forgotten.  Training needs to be done the minute councillors are elected.  It needs to be inducted into councillors that they have that power within the first month.  As for a lot of stuff raised this morning, I saw myself that when an audit report came before a meeting of the council, two members of the council would have been on the audit committee and it was noted and approved and went through.  A councillor should have the confidence to pause and say there is a problem.  That has come up here many times this morning.</p> <p>  In terms of the accountability mechanism, they are separate entities and rightly so.  I am an ardent defender of local democracy.  They are separate units of government.  I argue they should have more powers but the chamber needs to have the power, confidence and the ability to hold local authority officials to account.  That is very important.  I highlight those issues for all the senior officials here.  The officials present have considerable interaction with the county managers but do not have such interaction with the councillors and I understand why.  Structurally, why would they?</p> <p>  What is the role of the councillor?  What powers do they have?  These questions are very important.  They have some more powers in the most recent local government legislation, about which I think many councillors are not even aware.  Training on powers and the budget should happen within the first five or six weeks.  I have gone off subject.</p></speech>

They are set out in legislation and in the constitutional arrangements.  The Chairman's point on the softer elements, in terms of how a councillor feels or engages with those, is where that training becomes tremendously important.  I know the AILG does strong work on that.  My colleague, Ms Fiona Quinn, has considerable interest in training, if the Chairman would like to bring her in.</p></speech>

There is a big budget, and rightly so.  The more the merrier.  The Committee of Public Accounts wants to see what returns we are getting.  I am not clear and would like to have a clearer picture of it.</p> <p>  I have complained to Ministers about the all the different stages that must be gone through and all the rigmarole that local authorities have to go through to get approval and all the delays.  In the popular mind, and sometimes in the media, it is put forward as being because of planning permission but Mr. Kelly and I both know, as will most people here who have been on a local authority, that Part 8 planning permission passed by councillors will go through in two months.  It may be that it is held up for four weeks.  Sometimes a Part 8 will come in and councillors will say, "Hang on, there is a problem with the design" because of road safety or something.  There might be a need to come back with different boundary types or something or another issue in the area might need to be sorted.  Officials will take those observations on board, work with the local councillors and come back and get it through.  It might take 12 weeks.  I have always seen them go through very quickly and that is still the case, that is my observation, so it is not being held up at that level.  There is also a single-stage process now.  I do not want to go back over it but some local authorities were looking to use that.  </p> <p>  In 2002 or 2003 the Department made a decision that all houses would be architecturally designed.  I could take the officials to the last houses designed by Laois County Council.  They are easy to maintain, very practical and look very good and I could take them to the first ones that are designed by an architect.  I can outline the problems created in private - I will not take up the meeting with it - not least the sewage pipe running down beside a chimney stack.  There is methane gas in the sewage pipe.  What happens when someone lights a sitting room fire.  Gas rises and you have gas upstairs in the house and it has to be evacuated.  There are situations in a number of local authorities where designs go back and forward between the council and the Department.  In one case there a question over the canopy over the front door.  We cannot mass produce houses like this.  It is too cumbersome.  I am saying this in a helpful way.  I drive here via the Naas Road in the morning.  I am not saying that we should recreate 1938 or anything but look at the design that was used.  Thousands of houses were built using it.  It was a great design at the time.  You would not use it now but in the last local authority scheme that opened the footprint was very like them.  The front and back gardens were similar.  The footprint is the same and the things that have changed are the energy ratings and so on but they have a small sitting room, kitchen, bathroom, two down and three up in a larger house.  Sometimes we need bungalows because people have different needs.  They might have to be on a flat level because of disabilities.  We need different types of houses, one-, two-, three- and four-beds.  We know all that.  Why in the name of God with every housing development do we have to start with a blank canvass?  I am not only thinking of people on the housing waiting list.  I know that people who want to buy an affordable house or a private house have said to me that they do not care what the design looks like if the house is functional and comfortable.  That is what they want.  I am not advocating that we do what Russia did in the 1920s, 1930s or 1940s by putting up tower blocks or that we do another Ballymun.  I am not arguing for anything like that but I am asking why we cannot have half a dozen types of houses.  We do not need an architect to design every bloody house or new estate that has to be done.  What we need to deal with is infrastructure and the layout of the estate.  If documents have to keep going back and forward between the local authorities and the Department we cannot produce the housing.  I welcome that the Minister granted the money for more staff.  That is helpful and it will speed up things but we have to take our foot off the necks of those who are charged with delivery at local level.  If it is two-bedroom terraced houses that are wanted we can say "there is the design", and similarly if it is a three-bedroom bungalow or one-bedroom maisonette or little bungalow for pensioners, or a four-bed.  Why can we not do that?    </p></speech>

I am not advocating that we throw up slums.  I am advocating that we put up good-quality, compact, energy-rated houses, or apartments if they are appropriate.  We need between six and eight simple designs.  I saw houses like the one I lived in as a child in Donegal and other parts of the country.  There are houses like the ones in Crumlin and Drimnagh I drive past in Sligo and Portlaoise.  I have seen them.  They look the same.  They have the same design.  There are some in Wexford and Tullamore.  They are all over the place.  My point is that we cannot have a rigmarole where designs have to be approved.  I think 7% of the cost of a house is architectural design.  If it is 2%, it is crazy.  Why are we spending on individualising it?  We must change our thinking on this.</p></speech>

We mentioned earlier some of the things we are doing to build capacity such as enhancing the resources of local authorities.  A housing delivery co-ordination officer is in place in the LGMA, which supports local authorities.  One of the things we are doing through that process is promote use of design and build, which allows the developer to bring forward designs, and the use of modern methods of construction such as modular build where a lot of the work can be done off site.  One of the things is that the design must facilitate those modern methods of construction.  We are moving in that direction promoting-----</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that there is standardisation.  That makes sense.  I get that.  The Department is talking about design and build to councillors, developers and builders.  I say we hand it to them and say, "There's the drawing.  We want 50 of those."  Until we get to that point, we are wasting money on architectural fees and time and are tying up people in the Department and local authorities.  We dealt with this at times when this country had damn all resources, including the 1950s.  They built houses that were good quality for the time.  People were over the moon about these houses, which now make a lot of money on the open market, although this was not what they were built for.  My point is that these were good functional houses.  Standardisation is not enough.  We have not gone far enough.  There is a bigger leap to be made.  I am asking the Department to go away and consider this.</p></speech>

Under the national planning framework, we are seeing more in-fill and brownfield development so a lot of design is going to be site-specific.  We will see more duplexes and apartments.  We are probably not quite in the same position as we were with some of the housing developments.  On the other side of it, local authorities are using standard designs and layouts so a lot of that is pre-set.  It is a case of "here's what we need".  We are seeing a reduction in house types facilitating design support.  A recent development in Limerick involved a small number of similar designs and very fast construction using modular techniques.  We are looking to do more of that with-----</p></speech>

It should be a case of "We have them, that's it".  We should save money and time and get them built.  I have said this to Ministers over the past decade or so.  I find it very frustrating.  Unless officials take this on board, it will not happen.  We should make the case to Ministers that if we want to mass produce and deliver those 9,000 homes, this is the only way it can be done.  It would reduce the amount of money that is being spent.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the Chairman has seen some of these factories.  What they do is quite amazing.  The reason this has not scaled up in Ireland over time is because there has not been the critical mass - the volume - but there is now.  We are committing really substantial amounts of State money to a social housing programme and housing generally.  We are engaging with that industry a lot and are seeing some of the benefits of what the Chairman is talking about - more standardisation and more standard layouts - and the potential for that side of the industry to deliver much more capacity into the market.</p></speech>

One of the problems I am coming across, and the Department must have an input in this, is local authorities not implementing the conditions in planning.  You come across estates built over 15 or 20 years ago that have still not been taken in charge.  I am talking about estates in cities and county areas.  What is the Department doing about this?  We have collected planning charges from developers and we have bonds in place that are not being drawn down.  In Cork county alone, there are 50 sewage treatment plants that have not been taken in charge by Irish Water, the local authority is not prepared to take affected estates in charge until such time as the sewage treatment plants are taken over by Irish Water and there is a standstill.  What is the Department doing to ensure local authorities have a policy regarding full compliance with planning and following up regarding taking estates in charge in a timely manner and not 15 or 20 years later?</p></speech>

I have seen some estates where, for instance, up to &euro;1 million is being paid in planning charges but the local authority does not then respond by providing services to that area.  That money is not ring-fenced to the area in question, so one could come back five, ten or 15 years later and none of the services will have been improved, even though a huge amount in planning charges was collected.</p></speech>

I am trying to cover a number of committee meetings this morning.</p> <p>  I want to turn to the issue of funding of homelessness services.  It is an area I know we have touched on in the past, and I know that quite an amount of work has been done between the Department and the housing committee on the issue of the provision of services, in particular consideration of NGOs versus private emergency accommodation, PEA.  I went back and read the original report from last year, and I believe that the Department had a session in February on the issue with the housing committee.  Obviously, the Committee of Public Accounts is particularly interested in the funding, the tender process and those kinds of issues.  In general, however, there was a recommendation from last year that it would be advisable to phase out PEA in favour of NGOs.  That was a goal outlined by the committee.  Where are we with that goal?  Is there an update on it?</p></speech>

I know that the Deputy asked a number of questions about that when I was last here a couple of months ago.  We have engaged.  That engagement took place at the relevant joint committee.  Mr. Kelly has done a lot of work on the development of that system in the past, so I will ask him to respond.</p></speech>

The Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, would always prefer to set up services led by NGOs.  The issue arises when the numbers rise and the NGO services or the properties are not available.  In that case, PEA is frequently used.  The DRHE has been looking to apply the same sets of standards in PEA.  The national quality standards framework that was in place for local authorities and NGOs for quite a while has been implemented in PEA.  This is really about ensuring that an equivalent level of service is provided in an NGO-led service.  Work in that regard has been under way.  The DRHE had appointed a development officer to ensure that those same applicable standards were being introduced into PEA in order that people experiencing homelessness were getting the same level of service and treatment, whether from an NGO-led service or from private emergency accommodation.</p></speech>

On getting NGOs into this sector, there was a discussion about the tender process and revisiting it and making it easier for NGOs to tender.  Obviously, the reason we have more PEA is that the facilities are cheaper to run.  They do not necessarily have the kind of trauma-aligned care we would like to see for homelessness accommodation.  We discussed in 2020 the issue of Garda vetting, which I would like to revisit, but is there any information about developing the tender process for NGOs in providing emergency care?</p></speech>

I do know that there has been a drive to try to do that but, again, I can get the Deputy some data on that.</p></speech>

From the transcript of the meeting we had in February, I note that the DHRE had four people working on a team to look at modified standards for those PEA facilities.  I would appreciate more information as to whether we are still dealing with four people.  We have all been talking about the homelessness crisis and the provision of private emergency accommodation since 2017 or 2018, when there was a real move to do this.  It seems worrying that now, in 2022, we are talking about applying the same standard to PEA as we are already applying to NGOs.  That seems like a policy lacuna.</p></speech>

It would seem to me that trauma-supported or trauma-led care of people in homelessness is quite a complex issue.  A bare minimum would be to include Garda vetting as part of a service level agreement when entering into a contract with a private provider.  We are now two years into that discussion.</p> <p>  Mr. Doyle has said he does not have his homelessness person here, so perhaps he will not know the answer to this, but in the documentation from the discussion with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage there were 133 complaints about private providers in 2020.  Is it known whether that number of complaints has gone up or down?</p></speech>

There has been a project in Dublin City Council since 2019, when the new crop of councillors came in, to look at the remunicipalisation of waste.  It is driven particularly by the difficulty with inner-city provision of waste services.  It is difficult to get brown bins in inner-city areas.  Many people live in terraced houses.  We see a good model in Europe whereby there are group schemes for brown bins and for recycling and people's bags are not torn open where they do not have the space for large bins.  Does the Department take any particular position on an authority that might come to it with a proposal for the remunicipalisation of waste?</p></speech>

Mr. Doyle&rsquo;s Department has oversight over a great deal of that funding, which is why I ask this question.</p></speech>

It can use its own-sourced funding and if that is not sufficient or if that is not what it wants to do, it can seek funding from the relevant Department.  In this case, that would be the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p></speech>

I have a general question around not so much that aspect of it but around the calculation of funding towards local authorities, more broadly.  Does the Department feel that it serves every county and local authority well?  I am particularly interested in how it serves counties that are just outside Dublin which have experienced very significant levels of population growth and pressure on services.  Could we be doing more in calibrating that funding model to recognise the rate of change there?</p></speech>

The alignment of those two matters later in the year should lead to additional resources, to a recalculation and to a change to the allocation model for the local property tax.</p></speech>

Outside of the property tax, does that calculation serve those types of counties well?</p></speech>

Those are calculated depending on the particular local authority.  They are often on a drawdown basis and depending on delivery.  Outside of the local property tax, which I will not repeat in the interests of time, local authorities then fall back on their own income sources.  That is a matter for themselves and would count as local government discretionary income and it would be entirely up to the elected members as part of the budgetary process to decide the local spend.</p></speech>

In that, the finding was an adverse one against a person as a public official.  Can I ask Mr. Doyle to look at this in this context, bearing in mind that the public is watching, and that we have a situation in the Department of Health where an official released information to this committee and into the public domain which was in the public interest, which safeguarded our interests in public spending and in different movements within the Department of Health, but the official did this in the public interest.  This person was suspended for acting in the public interest.  This person is not at local level but is at Department level.  There was no complaint to SIPOC that I am aware of but I may stand corrected on that point.  This person has been suspended from his job.</p> <p>  On the other hand, we have a very prominent position of a chief executive over accounting, who has been investigated while in his position, resulting in a very damning finding and has faced no repercussion.  The Minister of the Department has appointed him to a board that oversees a budget of &euro;5 billion.  What does Mr. Doyle think that says to the public?  What kind of message are we trying to give out here?  Do your worst and we will give you our best position, do your best and we will sack you?  Does that resonate with Mr. Doyle?</p></speech>

Every Secretary General who has appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts is, in some shape or form, responsible.  I am not asking if the Minister has accepted his view but I am asking is if he has a view as the person in the position which he holds?  Mr. Doyle said he had regard, a high regard I would imagine, for standards in public office and yet we see this being totally disregarded by the Minister.  I believe that this affects Mr. Doyle's integrity, to be honest.  If Mr. Doyle comes in here, I cannot take him seriously.  I cannot take him seriously if he is not prepared to give me an answer to the question.  Mr. Doyle is the Secretary General.</p></speech>

We are now here in a position of transparency, or at least we should be, and are here in the public interest dealing with the public purse.  That is what we are here for.  I asked the Secretary General if he had regard for SIPOC, and for standards in public office and he said "Yes".  I asked him earlier if he felt that we had a proper vetting process for our public officials, to which he said "Yes".  I then asked him if he believes that all officials should be of the utmost integrity, trustworthy and honest, to which he also said "Yes" but he cannot offer a view on the appointment of someone who was found to be none of those things.  All of those things were called into question and yet this person has been appointed and has, in effect, been rewarded with a position on a board which deals with &euro;5 billion, and Mr. Doyle does not have an opinion on that.  I have to ask the same question which I asked the previous Secretary General which is whether he believes he has the skill set to hold his position as Secretary General.</p></speech>

I mentioned in my opening remarks that the lack of accountability when it comes to senior positions within local authorities across the country is shocking.  The dynamic of the relationship between county councillors and chief executives of local authorities is not one that allows there to be open transparency and questioning.  They rely on each other, essentially, to go about their daily business.  Causing conflict between a chief executive and a councillor on the same local authority is going to make that councillor's job incredibly difficult.  The majority of honest Members of the Oireachtas who have been in that position will tell Mr. Doyle that.  It is not a nice place to be.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Doyle do an analysis under the 2004 Act around the reforms of local government and the ending of dual mandate in this country to find out from chief executives how many of them have been living up to those obligations by providing Oireachtas Members with the notes we require on what is going on within our local authorities and by having meetings, which I believe are supposed to be on a quarterly basis?  Will he come back to me with those figures?  That is one job I would ask Mr. Graham to do.</p> <p>  What Deputy Verona Murphy said is not without precedent.  It is an issue.  My interpretation of it is that once a person gets into the role of chief executive of a county council, he or she is almost politically infallible.  That person is unquestionable.  As I said, nobody is in a position to properly question those individuals without consequences.  That is just something Mr. Doyle needs to take on board.  I will put that point to him as well.</p> <p>  My time here is very limited and Mr. Doyle can see the clock as well as I can.  I have one final question to ask.  We are all watching this with huge interest.  The issue was brought up by the Deputy from D&uacute;n Laoghaire earlier around ongoing house building and getting those analyses and figures.  I will ask Mr. Doyle one question and I would appreciate if he could come back to me.  Has the Department carried out analysis on who is purchasing newly-built private houses in the State?  I want to see those figures and get an analysis.  How much of that is coming from external institutional purchasers coming into the State versus ordinary residential buyers who are living in the Republic of Ireland.  That is another question I would like Mr. Doyle to answer.  If he wants a chance to respond to my points, he should please do so.</p></speech>

In relation to the first point, the Oireachtas has set down the powers of local authorities <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the executive.  There are a number of powers if the local authority gets to a point where it must remove a chief executive.  There is a sort of list of powers with which my colleague is much more familiar.</p></speech>

The council sets the budget.  There are a range of powers whereby the council can require a chief executive to desist from a particular action or carry out a lawful action, obviously.  There are a whole range of powers that are set down by the Oireachtas.  That is what is there.  If there is a sense then that there is an issue, and we talked about this a little earlier with the Chair, I suppose it is around the training issues.  Certainly, the powers are set out in legislation.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Doyle commit to doing some analysis on the obligations around the Oireachtas meetings with chief executives?  Can he analyse all 31 local authorities in this country and come back to me and this committee with a comprehensive report on how many local authorities are living up to that?  I want to hear about that.  That was one of the issues that was raised around 2004 at the end-of-June mandate.</p> <p>  This is my final point and I promise I will conclude on this.  It all comes back to this.  Until recently, we were paying county councillors in this country approximately &euro;17,500 per annum to do all of the research and oversight that is required.  My point is that the current set-up we have in this country is wholly unfit for purpose.  It is just not working.  The Department is not getting the level of oversight we need.  There are not disciplinary procedures in place when failures happen.  That is a huge problem in this country.  We have to be honest about it and try to come up with solutions.</p></speech>

The figure is 7% of the value per annum.  There is a funding stream in that regard which is overseen by the Department.  What is being collected would appear to be feeble.  Out of the 31 local authorities, more than half have not collected anything.  Only 8% of the money due under the levy has been collected.  Nine counties still have not a single property listed on the vacant site register - Cavan, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan and Offaly.  We take that to mean that there are no vacant sites there for a substantial period.  Only five local authorities out of 30 have collected anything.  That is Dublin City Council, Kilkenny, Roscommon, Waterford and Wicklow.  That means 26 have not.  Four other counties have identified sites but not collected anything.  They are Carlow, Donegal, Laois and Westmeath.  There is a role for the councillors in those counties to ask why that is the case, but it is not for me to tell them what to do.</p> <p>  The vacant site tax, which was introduced by the Houses of the Oireachtas, does not appear to be working.  What is the biggest issue in that regard?  I understand that there may be issues in some areas with probate or a tragedy in a family that owns the site and a couple of people are perhaps deceased.  There could be issues of sensitivity.  A local authority may not want to go after people because it has information the Department may not have.  Why is it that only five local authorities have collected anything under the vacant site levy?  Has there been any questioning of that yet?</p></speech>

What is happening is that data relating to vacant sites are being compiled in order that the new tax can be imposed with the objective of bringing these sites back into use.  That tax that will be applied to people will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  As I understand it from the Minister for Finance - although I do not speak for the Department of Finance - the real policy objective is to bring properties back into use.</p></speech>

That is why we have local authorities.  They have local knowledge and that works.  Sometimes, we do not have to use a big stick.  The owner of the site may have plans in place to bring the site into use, and there is no need to use the big stick.  However, it is clear that the big stick will need to be used in many places.  What Mr. Doyle has said is that the collection of the tax is being transferred to Revenue.</p></speech>

I have been raising this with the Department.  People are leaving the service and younger people are not coming into it.  There is a real problem.  It is one of the services provided by local authorities that people forget about.  The public do not realise the number of services provided by local authorities.  One of the essential services is the fire service.  In general, local authorities do it very well.  There is a real issue with retained firefighters.  I cannot quote directly from the previous correspondence I received.  From memory, however, I believe it stated that there is a review going on and that there will hopefully be a report by the end of the year.  I got that letter three months ago.  That is a slow pace.  I cannot remember the name of it, but whatever body is charged with this is carrying out a survey.  To be blunt, we could find out the views of people who have left the service and those who are still in it as to what the problems are and talk to the fire chiefs.  It could be done in a month.  We have to try to get things moving more quickly in this country.  The review will be ready by the end of the year at the pace it is going, and that is only to find out what is wrong.  Are we looking at another year or two years to change the situation, get agreement on it and to implement a new system?  Where will the fire service be?  This is important to local authority members and staff but even more important to the public in terms of saving lives and preventing damage to property.  We do not have time.  It is the fire service we are talking about here - an emergency service.</p> <p>  I am not knocking the people who wrote the letter.  They are telling me factually what has happened, but I say to Mr. Doyle that as public servants we must move things on more quickly.  This exercise should take a month.  If this was anywhere else people would be asked to go out and get answers, for example, to 30 questions in the next month.  They would be asked to make recommendations and get on with the process.</p></speech>

This is definitely a matter of concern.  The national director for fire and emergency management has a management board which oversees the approach to fire services in the State.  There is an ongoing review and it is important that all stakeholders get the opportunity to feed into that, including the firefighters, the councillors, the executive and, at national level, ourselves.  That work is important; it is important that we hear stakeholders' voices and that when there are recommendations they take on board the complexities across the country.  There are different situations and different circumstances in different parts of the country, as you are well aware.</p></speech>

I ask you to accelerate that process.  We do not have time.  There are already stations that do not have the required number of staff.  It is a good service and it has withstood the test of time.  From my observations in the county where I live, it is an absolutely fantastic service.  I acknowledge that there has been substantial investment from the Department in equipment such as fire tenders, training towers and new fire stations.  That is all to the good, although there are still a couple outstanding such as Rathdowney and Stradbally.  You might take note that they are badly in need of a new station.  However, there has been great investment.  The problem is that we will not have the staff if we do not move quickly on this.  Perhaps you will take that point away and refer back to the committee with a response on what can be done to accelerate that process.</p> <p>  Deputy Verona Murphy has a brief question.</p></speech>

There is now a hugely increased budget in the Department.  For the past three years, 50% of that budget, which is now in excess of &euro;6 billion, is coming through the Exchequer.  There is provision for the Comptroller and Auditor General to take over the auditing function of the local authorities and I expect the Secretary General will have no objection to making a recommendation to the Minister that section 8 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 be invoked at this stage so the Comptroller and Auditor General can take over that function.  To be fair to the Secretary General, there is far too much in this for him to be answerable, and he is reticent on those things for which he is answerable.</p></speech>

That is not in the legislation.  It is specifically provided that I cannot do the audit of local authorities.</p></speech>

One is with regard to the statement of internal control.  The other is regarding the issue that there is funding coming from a range of Departments now.  In fairness to the Secretary General, how would he keep an eye on everything?  There has to be some mechanism there, and I have not thought this through, to oversee the funding streams that come from three to seven other Departments.</p></speech>

Sometimes the public miss that.  It is there all the time and it is one of those things that are taken for granted.  If it was taken away, we would be in an awful position.  The more we can improve it, the better, and we should work on that.  I acknowledge as well the work of local authorities and of people in the Department over the last two years.  The local authorities played a vital role in helping us to get through the pandemic and the difficulties it caused across society.  We are in a better place because we have local authorities.  Yes, improvements have to be made and it is hoped we can do that.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for joining us for the meeting and the staff of the Department for the work involved in preparing for the meeting.  I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, and his staff for attending the meeting.</p> <p>  Is it agreed to request the clerk to seek any follow-up information and carry out any agreed actions arising from the meeting?  Agreed.  Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statements and briefing provided for today's meeting?

One set of financial statements was laid before the Houses between 13 June and 30 June 2022.  I will ask Mr. Seamus McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, to address these before we open up to members.</p></speech>

The accounts and statements that are with the committee this week are the Health Service Executive financial statements for 2021.  There was a turnover of &euro;21.6 billion on those accounts.  I gave it a clear audit opinion but I drew attention to a number of matters.  I will briefly refer to those.  The HSE incurred losses in 2021 totalling &euro;109 million and this was related to the procurement of personal protective equipment, PPE.  There were two elements to that.  First, the value of PPE stock held at the year end was impaired at a cost of &euro;71 million due to falling market prices for the PPE.  At the end of the year, the HSE was required effectively to write off &euro;71 million of what had been spent during the year.  The second element is that the HSE wrote off excess stocks of hand gel and some items of PPE at a cost of &euro;38 million.  This was material bought either in 2020 or 2021 in the context of Covid-19 but which was estimated at the year end that it would not be used before it reached its expiry date.  Therefore, the HSE has taken the hit by writing off those excess stocks in 2021.</p> <p>  Another much smaller item are the costs incurred in 2021 of an estimated &euro;1.25 million in storing a large quantity of protective suits which were written off at a cost of &euro;64 million at the end of 2020.  The HSE has not disposed of the protective suits and it is costing a significant amount to keep that material in storage.</p> <p>  As in previous years, in the statement on internal control the HSE acknowledges it has ongoing significant non-compliant procurement of goods and services and there is a good bit of detail in relation to that in the financial statements in the SIC. </p> <p>  Finally, the HSE outlines the actions taken following the cyberattack in May 2021 and how it is addressing recommendations to prevent similar attacks in the future.  As members will remember, this resulted in significant impacts on the service the HSE was able to provide during the year and there were significant costs associated with it as well.  Those are the items I drew attention to.</p></speech>

I would like to ask about the first three items around PPE, hand gel, etc.  We are looking at &euro;282 million.  I have a question around the &euro;38 million and the write off of excess stocks of hand gel and PPE.  I am not well up on these matters but surely hand gel would not go off.  Surely it is of use to hospitals, health centres and various other settings.</p></speech>

It may still have some use but that is a scientific and a product standard issue.  The same applies to things like masks, gowns and so on.  They have expiry dates, which was a surprise to me as well.  One would question how they can have an expiry date but they do and, therefore, projecting forward, the HSE does not envisage it can use the quantities it bought and still in stock at the year end, within the expiry time.</p></speech>

No.</p> <p>  We will move on to correspondence.  As previously agreed, items not flagged for discussion at this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee meetings and are published on the committee webpage.</p> <p>  The first category of correspondence in which members have flagged items for discussion is item B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and the follow up to the Committee of Public Accounts meetings.  A number of items for today's meeting were held over for further consideration.  Deputy Carthy is absent and his is the first one.  The next one is Deputy Catherine Murphy's and Deputy Carthy's and the following one is Deputy Catherine Murphy's.  If the Deputies want to flag something for discussion at a meeting, the clerk can notify them and they can do it at a subsequent meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We will move on to correspondence No. 1279B from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, dated 31 May, in relation to our report on the examination of the 2019 and 2020 appropriation accounts for Vote 29 &ndash; Environment, Climate and Communications, and expenditure on the national broadband plan.  It is welcome that all five of the committee's recommendations were accepted.  The recommendations relate to the failure of the State to meet the greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy targets; the sustainable energy programmes expenditure; the total cost of landfill remediation; and in relation to broadband, the failure of Broadband Ireland to meet its target for the roll-out of the national broadband plan and the need for the Department to develop in-house expertise to reduce the reliance on external consultants and expertise for advice relating to the national broadband plan.  At the meeting last week, we agreed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  I flagged it for discussion.  On the failure to meet greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy targets, with the agreement of the committee, I ask that we write to the Department to ask what the situation is regarding the shortfall in our energy needs.  What measures are being taken?  We understand, and we read these things in the media, that generators are going to be imported.  Are generators going to be imported?  How many are going to be brought in?  What are they fuelled by?  Is it diesel or gas?  We do not know.  What will the estimated cost of this be to get us through the winter?  We know the grid went on orange alert last winter on eight occasions.  We also know we had a very mild winter.  There is a real concern out there regarding what could happen here and our energy needs during the coming winter.  Are we going to wind up running expensive generators?  I ask that we correspond with the Department and ask those questions.  What is the shortfall?  What is the risk?  How many generators will there be?  What will they cost and what will they be fuelled by?  This in the context of greenhouse gas emissions.  We have closed down a lot of turf burning stations.</p> <p>  The other issue I want to raise relates to the failure of Broadband Ireland to meet its target for the roll out.  It was supposed to be 115,000 premises by 31 January of this year.</p><p>There was then a revised target of 60,000 to be passed but the actual number passed was 34,454.  I note that only 7,000 premises had been passed at that stage.  There is now a new remedial plan.  We are going way off the target in what we are doing regarding broadband.  We recommended quarterly reports, but I suggest we ask for a report from National Broadband Ireland, NBI, on the number of premises passed by the end of June 2022 and on the number of homes actually connected because there is an issue around the percentage take-up, which is quite low, as well as on the projections and targets for the remaining part of the year, if that is agreeable.  Does any member wish to come in on that?  If that is agreed, we will move on.</p><p> No. 1281B is correspondence from Ms Vivienne Flood, head of public affairs at RT&Eacute;, dated 31 May, providing information requested by the committee regarding revenue generated by advertising on the RT&Eacute; Player.  We agreed to note and publish this correspondence at our meeting last week.  It is related to the following item, so I will set that out as well before opening the floor.</p><p> No. 1290B is correspondence from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General, Department of Social Protection, providing further information requested by the committee regarding the investigation of contractors engaged by RT&Eacute;.  We agreed to note and publish this correspondence at our meeting last week.  We also agreed to request details of any litigation fees incurred in respect of the reference in the correspondence to appeal notifications for approximately 29% of all cases, and an information note regarding the number of former contractors who are no longer on contract or employed by RT&Eacute;, including whether they are within the scope of the investigation.  Deputy Catherine Murphy contributed on these items last week, as did Deputy Munster who also flagged them.</p></speech>

I ask that we request further information, particularly on how many people in total are being reviewed.  How many of them have a determination being made with regard to that review?  What is the liability accrued on the basis of those cases that have been determined in the workers' favour?  I also ask the Department to provide an update to us on a similar basis in early September.</p></speech>

Does any other Member wish to come in on this?  I note from the figures we have been given so far that 60% of the workers whose cases have been examined and investigated have been found to be wrongly classified as self-employed.  At this point, it would be useful to know how many workers in total have had their cases examined so far.  In addition, since this has come up in our examination of this matter, what is the situation regarding compensation and recompense for lost holiday pay and PRSI contributions for workers classified as employees as opposed to being self-employed?  It would be useful if we got that information from RT&Eacute;.</p> <p>  In fairness to the Department, we cannot go back to it every week or anything like that.  The Deputy suggested it would be useful to have that information by September.  The information supplied by Mr. McKeon is helpful in that regard. </p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for that.</p><p>The following correspondence was received last week and while it is not flagged for discussion, clarifications were provided regarding evidence presented to the committee.  It is No. 1306B, correspondence from Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, dated 15 June 2022, providing information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 March 2022.  As well as providing the follow-up information requested by the committee, the correspondence includes a request that the record be corrected in respect of information provided to the committee by the Commissioner in his opening statement.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  </font>The Commissioner stated 2020 gross expenditure was &euro;1.94 billion and the figure for appropriations-in-aid was &euro;115 million.  This correspondence clarifies that the correct figure for gross expenditure is &euro;1.93 billion - &euro;0.01 billion less - and that the correct figure for appropriations-in-aid is &euro;117 million.  There is a difference in that the expenditure was not &euro;1.94 billion but &euro;1.93 billion.  It was a genuine mistake by the Accounting Officer.  The appropriations-in-aid was not &euro;115 million but was &euro;2 million higher than that.  That is useful.  In respect of the implementation of technology across the organisation, the Commissioner stated that 3,000 mobile data stations were provided to front-line garda&iacute;.  This correspondence clarifies that the number of mobile data stations is 2,500.</p><p>On the responses to the questions posed by the committee, we might follow up on the following.  In relation to question 4, I propose that we request clarity as to how much of the overpayments in 2019 and 2020 have been recouped for each year and, in light of the &euro;4.201 million in recoupments since 2017, details of the total amount of overpayments in each of the years from 2017 to 2020.  On question 7, as the response states that expenditure on taking blood samples forms part of a number of services provided for under medical services and cannot be separated out, I propose we request a breakdown of medical services to the greatest level of detail possible.  As regards question 8, the correspondence states that &euro;15.5 million was spent on 9,000 mobile devices and apps.  This works out at approximately &euro;1,722 per device with apps.  We will request further detail regarding that because it seems quite high, although these may be fairly elaborate devices.  On question 12, as highlighted in an internal review of youth referral incidents, the correspondence states there were 16,877 cases in which no prosecution resulted between January 2010 and July 2017.  Further detail on the types of reasons for the lack of prosecutions would be helpful.</p><p>Is it agreed to request the information as outlined?  Agreed.</p><p>We accept the clarification or correction of the record from the Accounting Officer.  That will be done.  We will move on to category C, correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.  The first item is No. 1268 C, which comes from an individual on behalf of Louth Environmental Group.  It is dated 25 May 2022 and encloses correspondence regarding funding for a coastal greenway in Dundalk, County Louth.  At our meeting last week, we agreed to note this item, which is addressed to the clerk of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  Deputy Munster has flagged this item.  I am sure she will have an interest in it.</p></speech>

Could we seek clarity from the council as to why the proposal from the group was not successful or why the council did not deliver on the revenue scheme more generally and sent that amount of money back?</p> <p>  In its correspondence, the Louth Environmental Group states that it acquired the agreement and permission of the landowners some time ago but the county manager's response is that the issue was the failure of the community groups to secure the land required.  The project had been ongoing for a good many years and had been included in the development plan since 1996.  The council was therefore well aware that there was an eagerness to undertake the project.</p> <p>  In light of the return of that vast amount of money, we should seek clarity from the council and the county manager with particular regard to the points raised in the correspondence we received.  It is not acceptable for the county manager to just say there was a failure to secure the land when the group has argued that it had been secured and that it was included in the development plan since 1996.  One would imagine that, when the council got the funding, it would have jumped on it and proceeded with the project.  Having been a councillor on Louth County Council, I would say there are questions to answer.  If we could do that, it would be much appreciated.</p></speech>

Why was funding of that scale returned when the council knew this was in the development plan?  You would imagine the council would have been rubbing its hands together when it got that funding and that it would have been enthusiastic about getting the project done.</p> <p>  I propose we ask for a detailed response.  I do not know if it is possible but we should ask whether that funding could be recouped seeing as it appears to have been sent back prematurely.</p></speech>

We may add some other questions.  We might raise the question of active travel.  The council should be promoting it because it is where things are going.  I notice that the proposed walk goes from the railway station in Dundalk to Blackrock village.  There may be a benefit in that regard.  With the agreement of the committee, we could raise that in the letter to the chief executive.  Is the Deputy okay with that?</p></speech>

Blackrock village has grown in population and size so this project could be useful from an environmental point of view.</p> <p>  Before we move on, the clerk has provided me with a further note in respect of No. 1306 B.  On question 16, I propose that we accept the offer of the final version of the implementation plan relating to the recommendations made by the Policing Authority arising from its review of the closures, including calculations of computer assisted dispatch incidents.  On question 18, I propose we reiterate our request for clarity as to how many GSOC recommendations that disciplinary action be taken against a member of the force had been set aside by the Commissioner.  Are members okay with that?  I will take those proposals as being agreed.</p> <p>  We will move on to the work programme.  Next week, on 30 June, we will engage with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We are a week out from the meeting so it is somewhat late but if members think of anything specific they wish to raise with the Department in the next day or two, I ask them to notify the clerk.  The issue of the passports will obviously be a big part of the meeting.  We will also discuss other matters.</p> <p>  A meeting with the Department of Education is confirmed for 7 July.  That invitation included: the 2020 appropriation accounts for Vote 26 &ndash; Education; the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report 112, which is on financial governance and reporting in education and training boards; chapter 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2018 report on the accounts of the public services, which is on the purchase of sites for school provision; and chapter 8 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2018 report on the accounts of the public services, which is on the management of the schools estate.  Members might have a think about that.  There is a lot in it.  I do not want to narrow it down but, if there are specific issues members want to raise within those four headings, I ask them to please do so.  There might be an awful lot in two chapters, a special report and the accounts.</p> <p>  A meeting with An Bord Plean&aacute;la is scheduled for 14 July.  This is the last meeting scheduled in this sitting.  A representative from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will also be in attendance.  Are there any other matters members wish to raise with regard to the work programme because there will not be another chance until November?  If that is agreed, our consideration of the work programme is concluded for today.</p> <p>  Under any other business, does any member wish to raise any other matter?  We will briefly go into private session before adjourning until 30 June, when we will engage with the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p></speech>

Before we begin, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  The witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, the witnesses will be directed to discontinue the remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.  Before we hear from witnesses, I propose we publish the opening statement on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to Ms Mary Cahill, climate action officer, and Mr. James Callery, environmental awareness officer, from Wicklow County Council.  I invite Ms Cahill to make her opening statement and we will then take questions and comments from members.  Members will have around ten minutes and may come back in later if we have time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.624" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022062300002#A00500"><p>I am a senior executive engineer and currently hold the role of climate action officer for Wicklow County Council.  I am accompanied here today by Mr. Jim Callery, environmental awareness officer in Wicklow County Council.  We work together as part of the climate action team in Wicklow to work towards the targets set out in the climate action plan 2021 and bring awareness to all staff, the public via community groups, schools and so on, of the actions that can be taken to meet those targets.  Following the formation of the climate and biodiversity action strategic policy committee, SPC, in Wicklow in June 2019, one of the issues raised by the members was the use of glyphosate, or weedkiller, by Wicklow County Council staff in public areas.  The members asked the climate action team to look at the current practices and develop a policy that would lead to the reduction and possible elimination of the application of glyphosate by council staff.  It was discovered that while staff were trained and certified in its application, there was little to no control of where or why the glyphosate was applied and no records were maintained of where or how much was being applied.  In developing the policy we looked at our commitments at an operational level as a partner of the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan 2021-2025, or AIPP, and, in particular, our specific obligations under objective 2 of that plan.  That objective reads:</p> <blockquote> 	Making public land pollinator friendly<br /><br />By working together with Councils, Transport Authorities, Local Communities and others, we want to better coexist with biodiversity and help return food and shelter for pollinators to our island. </blockquote><p>There are two targets in that objective that we want to work towards.  The first one is to increase the area of council land managed in a pollinator-friendly way and the second is to make transport corridors more pollinator friendly.</p><p> To meet these two targets of the all-Ireland pollinator plan, we needed to reduce the application of glyphosate.  How did we go about trying to do that?  We set out a hierarchy of decisions in the policy, favouring the elimination or the avoidance of the use of glyphosate.  The first option at the top of the decision tree is to do nothing, to retain what we have and leave it as is, and to identify and protect existing semi natural areas which provide food and shelter for pollinators and ensure these areas are retained and enhanced through appropriate management wherever possible.  An example of this is working with the municipal districts to expand the selected areas that are pollinator-friendly and to manage the six-weekly rotation of mow and lift.  The second option on the decision tree is to manage weeds through mechanical methods, including the use of hand tools or strimming equipment, having regard with due care to the timing of works being carried out to benefit pollinators and wildlife.  As an example,  in the summer of 2021, the Wicklow municipal district hired a contractor with a sweeper with a front-loaded wire brush on the tractor and this managed to remove all the weeds along the curbside of the Wicklow town relief road in two days.  The next option on the decision tree is to use alternatives such as chemical and glyphosate-free products to control the weeds and clean hard surfaces.  Wicklow County Council purchased a Foamstream machine for plant control.  This machine mixes natural oils with hot water, and when it is sprayed, it provides an environmentally friendly alternative to glyphosate.  The final option is to use glyphosate or similar products to control, in one case,  invasive species where other techniques are not an option and where the threat of invasive species to biodiversity or critical infrastructure warrants their use.</p><p> The policy has introduced the requirement for a business case to be completed by a municipal district or indeed anyone in the council, in advance of the application of glyphosate.  I have included that business case in appendix A of my statement.  This documents why options one to three on our hierarchy of decisions cannot be implemented and why glyphosate must be applied.  If there is no suitable alternative and glyphosate is applied, then the application record form shown in appendix B, must be completed and this information will be stored in a central location.  We are working with our IT section to develop an app to capture these data and allow for the locations to be mapped and to be available to the public.</p><p> Other actions in the policy are to provide training to all staff involved in the application of glyphosate to raise awareness of its effects on pollinator-friendly plants and watercourses, to register staff involved in the application of glyphosate with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and obtain a professional user number, ensure widespread compliance among staff in the completion of the business case for the application of glyphosate and the glyphosate application record form, investigate further alternatives to the application of glyphosate for weed control and ensure lessons learned are shared between all municipal districts and other local authorities, and to raise awareness among community groups, schools and businesses on the effects of the application of glyphosate and available alternatives.</p><p> I want to give a list of issues that have arisen while we were developing the protocol or the policy and that we are still dealing with.  There is no suitable training available on the market that encompasses all of the needs within the policy.  There is a three-day course for professional users on the application of glyphosate.  However, a course is required that includes awareness of the implications of applying glyphosate, the alternatives available, and the health and safety surrounding storage and application.  We are looking at developing an awareness course for all outdoor staff and providing the training for certification to a small number of staff.</p><p> The appointment of an external contractor to carry out mechanical weed removal raised some industrial relations issues within the municipal district.  Equipment like the Foamstream is very expensive, and while Wicklow County Council could afford one machine, this is not sufficient to cover the whole county, and the municipal districts are using it on rotation.  While alternatives to glyphosate curb the growth of weeds, they do not kill the weeds to the extent that glyphosate does.  This results in municipal district staff having to retreat more often during the growing season, leading to additional resources being required.  Finally, an awareness campaign is required to educate the public on the need to leave areas looking unkempt.</p><p> Wicklow County Council has received great support for and interest in this policy and it is on the agenda of the plenary for 4 July 2022 when it will be expected to be adopted.  I thank the Cathaoirleach.</p></speech>

We have had a good discussion with a Mr. James Walsh about pesticides and that is why the invitation went out to the council councils for feedback and information.  First, it is good to see the work that is being done by Wicklow County Council and indeed other county councils.  We have information back from 21 at this stage.  We are talking about reducing the use of the substances.  I have a couple of questions before I let other members in.  One thing that struck me in your opening statement, Ms Cahill, was that it was discovered that while staff were trained and certified in its application, there was little or no control on where or why the glyphosate was applied.  There were no records maintained of where or how much was applied.  Are you referring to the guidance for local authorities to ensure compliance with the sustainable use of pesticides directive?  I am asking because, to begin with, I want to explore the effectiveness of the Department's monitoring of the use of the pesticides by local authorities.</p></speech>

I do not think it was actually available at the time.  I am referring to that.  There was guidance for professional users from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but that was more on a larger scale, whereas we were looking at a smaller scale of application.  There was no control or records being kept at the time.</p></speech>

To the best of your knowledge, are any local authorities communicating with each other on this?  If the initiatives are to be taken and are to become the norm rather than the exception, there needs to be a more comprehensive approach to it overall.</p></speech>

We have the core group which consists of Mr. Callery, as the environmental awareness officer, and me, the heritage officer, and then administration support.  At the moment we do not have a biodiversity officer or an energy staff member at the moment.  Then we have green team, which involves a representative from each section within the council.  They do this in addition to their day job.  We feed small actions into that team that they roll out within their section.  The SPC is separate again.  It was formed in June 2019 as the first climate action SPC in the country.  Again, we work closely with it.</p></speech>

I will focus first on their opening statement, which is welcome and represents great progress.  I am from the neighbouring county council area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Since 2016 onwards, there have been many similarities between what my council and Wicklow County Council have been doing.  I am familiar with the work of my council.  It is great to read about the work of Wicklow County Council.  I commend it on the work it has done.</p> <p>  On the AIPP, which is of interest to me, the witnesses highlighted two of the objectives it contains.  In particular, they referred to making public land pollinator friendly.  Can they elaborate on how that is being done?  Mr. Callery mentioned the Let&rsquo;s Get Buzzing event and a few other initiatives.  He specifically mentioned pollinator-friendly corridors, the use of which we need to encourage.  One can work in that regard with communities and Tidy Towns groups, both of which are very in tune with this and want to see this progress.  On the other side of the equation, and this is something the committee has discussed, are the complaints that the council also probably receives because a pollinator-friendly corridor may look a little bit more untidy to what people may have become used to.  Where signage is put up, people understand what is being done and may be encouraged to participate as a result.  Can I ask the witnesses comment on that matter?</p> <p>  On the use of chemicals and glyphosate, when mentioning the products and equipment to control weeds and clean hard surfaces, our guests specifically referred to the hiring of contractors.  Let us be honest.  There is a cost associated with this.  It is cheaper and possibly quicker to use a chemical-based approach, but there are obviously long-term effects, whereas the cost of hiring a contractor for two days may have an immediate effect but does not have the same long-lasting effect of the weeds growing back in the next growth season.  Can the witnesses comment on the costs in that regard?  We need that information because we want to see this kind of initiative rolled out across the country.  As the Chairman stated, this has come to us through Mr. Walsh and the work he has undertaken.  Thankfully, our engagement with local authorities seems to be that they are all on the same page here.  That is good news.  We have to talk about the cost and the circumstances in which it is prohibitive.  I understand what our witnesses are saying about circumstances where a chemical-based solution has to be used because I can see the relevant information on the application form they sent to us in advance.  How many applications to use chemicals have been submitted and what level of chemicals are being used in spite of all of the good efforts that have been made?</p> <p>  I have many other questions on these issues, but I will leave it at those for moment.  I will come back in later.</p></speech>

Most councils now have their own sweepers.  Is it an easy job to put a wire brush on the sweeper on the council&rsquo;s own machines in order to cut down on costs.  The sweepers in my area - I imagine this is the case everywhere - are out every day of the week.  If it was possible to put wire brushes on the sweepers on two days of the week, would that help with the cost instead of hiring in contractors?  I agree with Deputy Devlin that the biggest issue is going to be the cost to the councils, particularly when one considers what they are doing on a daily basis.  The councils will say that it is not possible to fund everything across the board.  Instead of hiring in contractors, would it be possible to fit wire brushes to the sweepers that councils already own?</p></speech>

I will deal with the cost issue first.  We are still at the lessons learned stage.  An increased budget will definitely be required.  We have been in discussions with municipal districts.  The environment section and our climate action budget within Wicklow County Council will cover the additional cost this year, but we have said to the section that it needs to look for an increased budget next year in order to deal with this.  A contractor was brought in because we were trialling it.  As stated, we were still at the stage of learning lessons and were trialling it.  There would be no reason that the own machine could not be retrofitted with the wire brushes.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr Callery would like to speak about the AIPP.</p></speech>

On the site selection, we have taken a two-pronged approach.  First, we are working through our municipal districts to identify sites under our own management that we can leave and unmown develop as pollinator-friendly sites and get the signage out on them.  We will then look to have the municipal districts map these to show that we are committed to the AIPP and are taking action.</p> <p>  At the same time, we are also working with our community groups, residents&rsquo; associations, the Tidy Towns groups and the schools in order that they can identify sites and carry out the same process.  We have been providing signage to many residents' associations or group that wants to develop an area as no-mower/no-mow area for pollinators.</p></speech>

At home, I reckon that 50% of people will understand what is going on and the others will ask why grass and weeds are growing all over the place.</p></speech>

One thing we are encouraging groups to do when they are creating a meadow area or one that is left for pollinators is that they mow the edge or a path through it, just to show that the site is being managed, and is not just being left unmanaged.  When people see that level of management in it and the signage, they understand what is being done.  Once the management happens later in the season to cut the long grass and remove it, we have not had many complaints as to how we are managing sites.</p></speech>

At the SPC, we have discussed and have agreed that it will write to the national Tidy Towns organisation to ensure that the judging and marking system takes this into account.  It already does, as Mr. Callery has confirmed, but just to reiterate that point to that body.</p></speech>

People think that areas are now being left overgrown.  When it is explained to them, however, they understand.  Is there a message that municipal councils and county councils need to get out a great deal more in a bigger campaign to make people aware of what is actually going on in these areas?</p></speech>

It is one of the issues I raised in my statement that in the growing season, particularly in April and May when one did not want to be cutting any grass because of the pollinators at the time and to delay the cutting of grass; we ran a social media campaign.  It is something we recognised needs further work.</p></speech>

I raise the issue of the use of glyphosate where there are large weeds growing on the kerb sides, footpaths or whatever.</p><p>Over time, they can do damage.  Ms Cahill mentioned invasive species doing damage to infrastructure, etc.  She mentioned colleagues in departments like roads who may want these weeds removed sooner than other people would want.  She also mentioned Tidy Towns and residents groups requesting the same.  Where that situation arises, what is the best practice learned so far?  I accept these things will change.  When pesticides or herbicides need to be used, how much have been used so far, by way of granting? </p></speech>

It is trial and error.  Ms Cahill highlighted in her statement the sharing of information both between Departments and between local authorities.  She mentioned Louth, Kildare and a few others.  How frequent is that sharing of information?  I have personal experience of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown but others are further along the road - excuse the pun - and more aware of what things worked.</p> <p>  Ms Cahill mentioned hot foam.  When I was on the council I raised it.  The cost of glyphosate versus the cost of a machine means it is a good few years of expenditure before it washes its face.

The reason I asked that has nothing to do with Wicklow specifically.  It is to get our heads around the way in which we can get local authorities to explore non-chemically-based products.  While there is big investment of &euro;30,000 in Foamstream and other materials that the council has to acquire, there are products which could do what we want that are non-invasive and non-chemically based, and we should be looking at them.  They may ultimately be cheaper than the products or materials the witnesses are talking about.  We are going to return to that and it might be something we specifically examine in our report.</p> <p>  I greatly appreciate the engagement of the witnesses, not only with the committee in written format, but also the oral presentation today and the engagement on this very important topic.  I do not think it gets enough discussion on a national basis.  With specific regard to the remits of the two witnesses, graffiti removal is costly yet there are alternative ways of getting rid of it.  Does the Wicklow local authority still provide kits for graffiti removal?  I know some had done so in the past but do they still do that?  I know I am somewhat off-topic.</p></speech>

In tandem with what we are talking about today, and in tandem with the council&rsquo;s pollinator targets as a county, how is the council monitoring the progress of that?  From 2016, there has been a six-year window for monitoring the impact that the pollinator plan, &ldquo;slow to mow&rdquo; and all of these other initiatives are having.  How are they being monitored year on year?</p></speech>

I know the heritage officer has been working to try to get staff to map the actions that they are doing.  We are aware there are more actions happening than are actually mapped, and the feedback we were getting from staff involved is that they just did not get time to get around to mapping their actions.  It is not a long process and it would take about ten minutes maximum to upload an action onto the map, but they are not finding the time to do it.  Our heritage officer is herself trying to record some of the bigger actions that are happening in the county but we are conscious we do not have full records of every area.</p></speech>

We have to monitor where we are going with this to ensure what we are doing and the learnings Ms Cahill is talking about are monitored so we know how we are progressing.</p> <p>  I will move to my final questions.  I again thank both witnesses for their attendance today.  In terms of the pesticide course they spoke of, how many of the staff in Wicklow County Council have attended that course?  One of the documents mentioned that staff have to register with the Department once the course is done.  Of the members of staff who have attended the course, have they all registered?  Is the council going to explore amending by-laws in this regard, or has it already done so, to try to discourage or persuade people not to use these products?</p></speech>

At the moment, this is just the policy for Wicklow County Council on public lands, so we have not gone down that road yet.</p> <p>  I do not have numbers for those who have attended the course.  Anyone who would be applying it in municipal districts attended a three-day course, as I said in my statement.  It has not been run since 2016.  When I started asking questions about it, everybody said &ldquo;Yes, I need to do that&rdquo;, but I do not want to send all of the outdoor staff on a three-day course to be certified to apply glyphosate when we are trying to reduce the application of it.  There is a bit of a Catch-22 there.  I have agreed with the municipal district engineers that each district would send two people on that three-day certification course so they have someone who can apply it where it is needed for invasive species and so on.  This is where we need another course for the rest of the staff for awareness and so we do not have any rogue staff.</p></speech>

In the national Tidy Towns competition, we had one town that was very disappointed that an adjudicator commented on the use of herbicides in the town and said that would cost them marks.  That is going to be a more effective tool, where we can use the carrot rather than enforcement.</p></speech>

I am very interested in this area and, like others, I commend the witnesses on attending and on sharing their experiences with us.  For me and for the other members, it is a learning experience and that is what we are here for.  I know from my own county of Roscommon that there is now a lot of emphasis on biodiversity and we find that people are beginning to talk about it.  They do not want to see products like glyphosate being sprayed around the place, which is good.  I have a few questions but if they have been answered already, the witnesses should tell me that and I can get the information from the other committee members.</p> <p>  I am interested in the issue of buy-in from the public.  How is that going?  Does the council ever run workshops for the public or the schools?  I had a question as to whether the council is completely glyphosate-free.</p><p>However, I understand that in certain cases it still has to be used with invasive species or whatever.  I accept that.  Regarding the buying of the machine, how expensive was that?  How much of a budget does the council have for all this each year?  Obviously it must be increasing its budget for this type of work to be done.</p><p> What the council is doing is commendable.  I studied horticulture and in the years ahead I believe there will be many discussions about glyphosate, having read about it.  One never hears the true stories until years have gone by.  In my view, we should eliminate it everywhere we can.  I know it is needed in some cases and farmers need it sometimes for weed control, but where we can eliminate it we should do so.  However, is there buy-in from the public?  Is there a programme through the schools?  Young people are great.  They are all into biodiversity, tunnels and so forth now.  There is also the cost of the machine.  How effective was the machine?</p></speech>

They are key partners of Wicklow County Council in delivering the message on environmental awareness.  We have worked with the schools in the county over the years through the green schools programme and other activities.  We have an awards scheme every year for our tidy towns, estates and schools.  We have schools awards on biodiversity and community awards on biodiversity.</p> <p>  We have a tidy estates competition, which traditionally was just about how tidy and well-kept the estate is.  We have changed that in recent years and we have asked them to comment on their management practice.  We are looking for information on whether they are managing for pollinators and avoiding the use of herbicides, and that is taken into account in the judging and marking of that competition.  It is changing the attitudes and behaviour within our residents' associations across the county.</p> <p>  We also work very closely with Tidy Towns.  As mentioned, we do an annual event, a seminar, where we get the Tidy Towns and other interested community representatives in and we provide expert speakers.  This year we covered the all-Ireland pollinator plan, Let's Get Buzzing, as part of our event.</p></speech>

The foam stream machine cost almost &euro;30,000.  We still do not have full feedback on its success.  Wicklow County Council does not have a parks department, unlike D&uacute;n Laoghaire which was mentioned by Deputy Devlin and which has quite a large parks department.  We do not.  We are the poor neighbour.</p> <p>  A lot of the budgets are filtered out through the municipal districts for managing this type of thing.  They are aware that their budgets will have to be increased next year, so our local property tax, LPT, meeting will be very interesting.</p></speech>

The Senator will not get any objection to that.</p> <p>  We have nine petitions for consideration today.  Petition No. 21 of 2021 is "Taking in charge" - Mr. Terence Coskeran.  This petition relates to the request that the local authority take in charge a residential development of five houses at Rocksprings, Kilross, County Tipperary.  The secretariat corresponded with Tipperary County Council on the petition on behalf of the petitioner.  The council responded and the secretariat forwarded the response to the petitioner and also to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage requesting further information.  The Department responded stating that, among other things, two key issues need to be determined before the Department would consider providing funding to resolve the developer-provided water services infrastructure at Rocksprings estate.  The committee recommends that the response from the Department be forwarded to the petitioner for comment.  Do members have any views?</p></speech>

He built them in 2004 and had an agreement with the council that once everything was done with regard to its planning at the time, it would take the estate in charge.

The reply from the Department sheds some light on the situation there and outlines two main issues.  The first issue is whether Tipperary County Council has significant capacity to take the wastewater from the treatment plant.  The second issue is the wider examination being undertaken by the Department regarding the alignment of the ownership of the Environmental Protection Agency certificate of authorisation of small-scale wastewater treatment plants to bring certainty to their long-term operation and maintenance.  The first point seems to be covered insofar as the county council made an application on 17 September 2019.  It appears to be the second point where there is an issue.  It is basically the fundamental aspect of taking in charge the transfer of the long-term responsibility or the ownership of the wastewater treatment unit.</p> <p>  This is causing a lot of distress to this chap.  It is going on since 2004.  He had an agreement with the council at the time, but events took over.  The recommendation is that it be sent back to him.</p><p>As I said at yesterday's meeting, I imagine he has got the same documentation on numerous occasions since 2004.  We will see.  Is the secretariat's recommendation agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Petition No. P00043/21 from Mr. Fernandos Ongolly concerns support access to employment for non-EEA PhD students' spouses in Ireland.  The secretariat corresponded with the Department of Justice on this petition on behalf of the petitioner.  The Department replied and its response was forwarded to the petitioner.  The petitioner provided a very comprehensive response.  The committee recommends that the correspondence from the petitioner be forwarded to the Department of Justice for comment and the petitioner be notified of same.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Petition No. P0006/22 from Mr. John O'Malley states that by-elections in Ireland may comply with legislation but they do not comply with the Constitution.  The secretariat corresponded with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on this petition on behalf of the petitioner.  The Department responded and its response was sent to the petitioner who replied.  The petitioner&rsquo;s reply was sent to the Department who responded for a second time advising that, among other things, the programme for Government commits to examining the replacement of by-elections with an alternate list system.  It also commits to establishing an independent electoral commission, which is being processed through the Electoral Reform Bill 2022, currently being debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The committee recommends that the latest correspondence from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage be sent to the petitioner for further comment.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p><p> Petition No. P0008/22 from Mr. James Walsh concerns the banning of herbicides in public places.  The secretariat has corresponded with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and with the 31 local authorities on this petition on behalf of the petitioner.  The Department responded and its response was forwarded to the petitioner.  The Department also presented to the committee on this petition and the petitioner has now replied to the Department via the secretariat.  Approximately two thirds of the local authorities have also responded regarding their use of herbicides in public places.  Wicklow County Council responded and was identified as a local authority with a proactive, environmentally friendly approach to herbicide use.  That county council has recently presented a very comprehensive report to the committee.  The committee recommends that Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s comments and attachments be forwarded to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for further comment.  Do members have a view?</p></speech>

It is only right.  It is to be hoped that more than two thirds of the local authorities will have responded by the next meeting.  As regards the ones who have not, it would only be right for us to examine that at our next public session to see which ones have not responded.</p></speech>

One of the three outstanding city councils has responded while the other two have not at this stage.  The secretariat sent a reminder to them yesterday.  We will look at that next time.</p> <p>  Petition No. P00015/22 from Ms. Eileen Kelly McCarthy concerns Castlemartyr community hall.  The secretariat corresponded with east Cork municipal district on this petition on behalf of the petitioner.  An officer of east Cork municipal district responded stating that it had &ldquo;no responsibility or jurisdiction in relation to this matter&rdquo;.  The committee recommends that the correspondence from east Cork municipal district be sent to the petitioner for comment and that the matter be raised with Cork County Council.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Petition No. P00016/22 from Mr. Gamepro Yt is to make Friday part of the weekend with no school.  The secretariat corresponded with the Department of Education on this petition on behalf of the petitioner and received a reply from the Department.  The committee recommends that the correspondence from the Department be sent to the petitioner, the petitioner be given 14 days to respond and to be advised that if no response is received within those 14 days, the petition will be closed.  That petition was received on 1 April.  We are not really expecting a response.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p> <p>  Petition No. P00017/22 from Ms Rebecca Smyth concerns lower outpatient waiting times for urgent cases.  The secretariat corresponded with the HSE on this petition on behalf of the petitioner and, following a request for further information, the HSE replied and set out the process for managing patients and waiting times.  It further advised that, in relation to this petitioner's specific case, &ldquo;it is currently being reviewed by Children&rsquo;s Ireland Hospital Group under the Incident Management Framework (2020) and when the review is complete, the Children&rsquo;s Ireland Hospital Group will be in contact with the family concerned&rdquo;.  The committee recommends that the correspondence from the HSE be sent to the petitioner for comment.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Petition No. P00022/22 from Mr. Carles Pujol concerns an investigation to identify if Irish citizens have been spied on illegally.  The secretariat corresponded with the cybersecurity and Internet policy division in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on this petition on behalf of the petitioner.  The Department replied and, among other things, suggested that the Department of Justice be asked to consider this petition in the first instance.  The committee recommends that the correspondence from the cybersecurity and Internet policy division be forwarded to the Department of Justice, along with the petition, and that the reply be sent to the petitioner for comment.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Petition No. P00026/22 from Ms Margaret Keogh concerns the carer's allowance.  The secretariat corresponded with the Department of Social Protection on this petition on behalf of the petitioner and the Department replied.  The committee recommends that the correspondence from the Department of Social Protection be sent to the petitioner for comment and the petition, along with the correspondence from the Department of Social Protection, be forwarded to the Department of Health and the HSE for consideration.  Ms Keogh made some very valid points in her petition about the role of carers and the amount of money they save the State.  We all know they are vital in that regard.  Is the recommendation agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I invite members of the public to submit petitions via our online portal at <i>petitions.oireachtas.ie</i>.  A petition may be addressed to the Houses of the Oireachtas on a matter of general public concern or interest or an issue of public policy.

I served on the first committee on public petitions.  At that time, Senator Buttimer and I were very strongly of the view that once the committee got settled in, and now that I am back on this one, it should consider moving outside Leinster House for a meeting and publicising that meeting.  I am not looking for junkets throughout the country but to get our message out.  On the day we move into one province, we could contact the radio stations and local newspapers there and have a sort of public forum.  This will obviously not happen before the recess but maybe it is something we could put on the agenda for discussion in the autumn.  There is a lot of benefit from this committee.  There are always people who are not satisfied with answers elsewhere and they have a forum here, if we see they have a point of view that can be brought forward.  Maybe it is something we can consider.  Of course, the Covid pandemic destroyed all these plans but we might discuss it in the autumn.</p></speech>

He brought this matter up previously and there was agreement that was what should be done.  As he said, Covid put a stop to it all.  I cannot see any problem with that being organised.  It would benefit the committee and start to raise awareness throughout the country if we hold three or four meetings in a year in the provinces and advertise them.

It is possible to get round the legal consideration but I understand that it definitely has to be checked out.</p><p>I agree with Senator Murphy's proposal.  He has raised it before and it is good that he raised it again.  The breadth of petitions we have just discussed shows there is an interest in and awareness of the committee.  The Senator is correct that a bit of publicity for the work of the committee will bring forward other petitions.  </p><p> Speaking of our role as a committee, we were sought for our experience as a committee internationally for other parliaments looking at setting up similar petitions committees.  Covid got in the way of that but maybe we can look at that in our next meeting.  If I recall correctly, one correspondent stated their exploration of their committee was in its infancy and, given the length of time the Oireachtas has had a petitions committee, there was interest in us sharing our experience.  Members like Senators Murphy and Buttimer and Deputy Buckley had time on the previous committee.  That is invaluable for other parliaments across the world to learn from best practice.</p><p> I commend the work of the clerk and staff here.  It is not easy, given the volume of correspondence we have received and that they also have to try to liaise with various Departments and organisations.  That is much appreciated by us and by the petitioners.  </p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I would like to welcome Ms Saoirse Brady, executive director, and Ms Sarahjane McCreery, Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT; Mr. John Farrelly, CEO; and Dr. Susan Finnerty,  Mental Health Commission; and Mr. Jerry Carroll, chair, and Ms Fiona Murphy, Irish Criminal Justice and Disability Network, ICJDN.</p> <p>  I remind committee members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically present on the campus of Leinster House.  I ask members who are joining remotely to confirm whether they are on the campus prior to making their contributions.  For anyone watching us online, witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely due to unprecedented circumstances, and I ask people to bear with us if any technical issue arises.</p> <p>  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses giving evidence from locations outside the parliamentary precincts that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending and giving evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  At this point, we do not have clear guidance on whether privilege extends to them.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I ask Ms Murphy to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

In writing this statement I am much reminded of a young boy I was humbled to know, Kevin Dunford from Ballina, County Mayo.  A bright young boy with a life limiting condition, Kevin was non-verbal.  Despite these challenges, Kevin had the innate ability to communicate honestly and assertively using all his other senses, his beautiful eyes, hand movements and gestures.</p> <p>  Inspired by Kevin and his ability rather than his disability, we began to study international evidence relating to the prevalence of persons with a disability engaging with the criminal justice process and their over-representation within the prison population.</p><p>We wanted to explore how we could ensure every measure possible is taken to support persons with disability who engage with the process.  Concerned by the possible consequences for those with a disability, in particular individuals with hidden disability, it was important to not only understand their lived experience, but also the experiences and challenges of those working in the system and their awareness of disability and neurodiverse conditions, mental health, addiction and early childhood trauma.  In light of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and other domestic legislation, the need to establish a practical working dialogue and understanding in relation to access to justice, human rights, structural violence and abuse was ever more critical.  With the support and encouragement of the Association of Criminal Justice Research &amp;amp; Development, ACJRD, and other stakeholders, the initiative was developed through examining research, the gathering of anecdotal evidence and capacity building.  The ICJDN was developed and has contributed to various events and discussions over the last number of years.  Importantly, in 2016, seminars entitled &quot;Towards Compliance with the UNCRPD: the Role of Criminal Justice Professionals&quot; were held in Limerick and Dublin.  To bring together participants from the areas of disability, health and criminal justice, a round-table discussion organised by the ICJDN was held to facilitate the sharing, learning and exploration of opportunities that would improve access to justice in a way that would be cost-effective, collaborative and mutually beneficial.  What clearly emerged from the report was the willingness and active desire, from both criminal justice agencies and the disability community, to work proactively to meet a shared challenge in a very human way.  While in the process of designing online training materials, with thanks to Ms Breda Fitzgerald, Ms Kasia Zabinska and board director Mr. Eamon Ryan, an important communications technique was developed.  The PARC technique was showcased in 2019 at a neurodiversity and criminal justice conference.  Feedback was incredibly positive with an eminent professor, Dame Sue Bailey, a consultant child and adolescent forensic psychiatrist and professor of child and adolescent mental health, remarking that the material should be on every public health screen across the country, thus illustrating its flexibility across other settings such as healthcare and education. <br/><br/>Our training also includes a powerful video shared by Prosper Fingal.  Produced by and featuring individuals with a disability, it aptly places the audience in a position where they are left examining their own attitudes and unconscious bias.  In designing materials we were keenly aware that whenever an individual engages with a public service body, there is an automatic power imbalance and more often than not, those who are engaging with these services are in a vulnerable position.  Rather than focusing on individual disabilities, we sought to concentrate on how persons may present, the challenges and obstacles they face, while also providing training on how to tune in and manage encounters compassionately and safely through effective communication, de-escalating techniques, tools for early identification and when to seek support and intervention.  <br/><br/>In 2019, we delivered a pilot training programme to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The model of our training delivery is multidisciplinary and depends very much on the participation of healthcare professionals and advocates with lived experience of disability.  This was followed by further approaches and discussions with three other criminal justice agencies.  Proposals were sought, submitted and positively received.  The structure of the ICJDN was informed by findings in the UK from the Bradley report, where Lord Bradley identified that one of the main problems with previous policy development has been the piecemeal approach taken.  He noted that one of the most common phrases repeated to him by stakeholders time and again was that people and organisations were working in silos.  <br/><br/>The ICJDN continues to take an inclusive and holistic social model approach to addressing effective access to justice for persons with a disability.  All the valuable work to date has been done <i>pro bono</i>and this is not sustainable.  Despite continuing engagement, we are concerned that the proposed actions from the round-table discussion and evidence-based research have yet to be implemented.  Due to Covid-19 and its disruption across public bodies, we are still awaiting responses to each of our proposals.  In the meantime we need to highlight the necessity for adequate funding and a more formalised structure to progress the work of this initiative.  We strongly feel our approach will effect change and positively impact on the criminal justice process for those with a disability, rather than serving as a mere box-ticking exercise.  We believe an investment of resources is likely to provide a net benefit to the State in terms of delivering improved outcomes for people with a disability who deserve support and specialist care provision.  However, this can only  be done through the appropriate delivery of valuable supports and resources that honestly address the challenges faced by those working in the system.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague Dr. Susan Finnerty, who is the independent inspector of mental health services.  The commission is an independent statutory body established under the provisions of the Mental Health Act.  Our principal functions are to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of persons detained in approved centres.  The remit of the commission has also been extended by an amendment to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which is going through the Oireachtas and will provide for the establishment of the decision support service for adults with capacity difficulties.</p> <p>  People with a mental illness should receive compassionate care and treatment in a modern health system.  They should not be incarcerated in prisons or criminalised.  Although there have been improvements in the attitude towards, and treatment of, people with mental illness in the justice system, there still remains significant barriers.  Dr. Finnerty recently published her report, "Access to Mental Health Services for People in the Criminal Justice System", which raises a number of specific concerns.  People with a mental illness and who have been accused or convicted of a criminal offence have unequal access to mental health services compared to those who have not offended.  Ireland is far behind comparable countries in providing a comprehensive forensic mental health service when a person with a mental illness encounters the criminal justice system.  Also, there are many gaps in general Irish mental health services, which lead to mentally ill people ending up in the criminal justice system.  As the inspector and I saw with our own eyes, we still have people who are severely ill locked in isolation units and other areas of Irish prisons awaiting mental health care in appropriate settings.  This fundamentally breaches their human rights and Ireland has been rightly criticised by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment for this.</p> <p>  In some prisons, the in-reach teams are substantially under-resourced and struggle to provide a comprehensive service.  The inpatient forensic mental health service in the Central Mental Hospital, CMH, provides care and treatment based on international best practice, but the waiting list for a place in the CMH continues to grow as more mentally ill people enter the prison and justice system. After decades of reports stating that the CMH was not fit for purpose, we have a new state-of-the-art building in Portrane which should be opening soon and this will increase the beds from 102 to 170, including a unit for children and an intensive care regional unit.  This will bring our forensic beds from two per 100,000 to 3.5 per 100,000, but this is still substantially lower than many other European countries.</p> <p>  In regard to the south of the country, there is very poor resourcing of the forensic mental health teams in Cork and Limerick.  It is quite astounding and still there is no coherent plan for the development of these services.  There are no intensive care regional units in the south and west, as set out in the Government policy of a "hub-and-spoke" model of forensic mental health services.</p> <p>  Our interviews and those of the inspector with service users, prisoners and carers were enlightening and demonstrated that there are multiple points in the pathway for care of people with mental illness who enter the enter the criminal justice system that require resourcing and changes.  This is especially urgent in the diversion of mentally ill people away from the criminal justice system into mental health services where their needs can be met.</p> <p>  I want to briefly touch on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In 2009, the commission and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issued the Report of Joint Working Group on Mental Health Services and the Police.  That report made a number of recommendations including the creation of a 24-7 statutory social work service, expanded training for garda&iacute; and the implementation of adequate court diversion programmes to deal with minor criminal matters involving individuals with mental health problems.  Twelve years later, very few of these recommendations have come to fruition.  One issue which we have focused on over the last few years is the increased use of section 12 of the 2001 Mental Health Act which gives a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power to take a person into custody if they believe a person is suffering from a mental disorder and that because of a mental disorder there is a likelihood of the person causing immediate and serious harm to himself or herself or to other persons.</p> <p>  Section 12 was enacted with the expectation that it would be used in exceptional circumstances.  There has been a worrying increase in the volume of applications made.  There were 1,971 admission orders for involuntary detention from the community in 2021 and 35% of these were initiated by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, compared to 32% in 2020.</p><p>Given the increase in applications made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Mental Health Commission, MHC, contacted the Garda Commissioner and the Policing Authority and met with them in July 2021 and at a number of meetings throughout the year to discuss its concerns.  I acknowledge that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has engaged in a meaningful way with the MHC over recent years and shares a number of the MHC's concerns, not least the human rights aspect of section 12.</p><p> The statistics provided to the MHC by the Garda in relation to use of section 12 applications are worryingly high.  In 2018, 4,000 people were taken in custody using this section of the Act.  This may indicate a systemic issue where thousands of people are being detained by the Garda ostensibly with little independent oversight or scrutiny.  As it stands, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na still remains the only agency immediately available day or night to respond to crises in the community, and the limited training and support available to its members creates a situation where the most vulnerable in our society are potentially being failed.  People with a mental illness should receive compassionate care and treatment in a modern health system as opposed to being forced into a criminal justice system which cannot meet their needs or vindicate their human rights.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.774" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Saoirse Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022062300002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation and the opportunity to present on this very important topic of accessing justice.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, is Ireland's leading NGO campaigning for rights in the penal system and the progressive reform of Irish penal policy.  Our core message is that a penal system that protects and promotes human rights, equality and social justice and relies upon prison only as a measure of last resort will contribute to safer communities for everyone.  People with disabilities are a significant but overlooked population in the Irish penal system, and the IPRT accordingly welcomes the opportunity to highlight the challenges these individuals face and to identify the ways in which the State can better vindicate their rights in accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The topic under discussion today is wide-ranging but we will focus on three key issues.  First, the lack of data on disability within the penal system; second, the treatment of people with disabilities in the penal system; and third, the importance of diversion from the criminal justice system.  I will be echoing some of what my colleagues have said.</p> <p>  The IPRT&rsquo;s research has identified significant gaps in data on the prevalence of disability in Irish prisons.  Reasons for these may include some disabilities going unrecognised within the penal system and-or issues arising in respect of the screening tools used in prison.  The limited data available in Ireland primarily relate to psychosocial or mental health disabilities and intellectual disabilities within the prison system.  Mental health among the prison population is a serious concern, with some studies estimating that the prevalence of severe mental illness among the prison population is four times that of the general population.  It is estimated that nearly one in three prisoners in Ireland has an intellectual disability, although data are incomplete.  The Inspector of Mental Health Services has noted that people with intellectual disability are over-represented in all parts of the criminal justice system, including police custody.  The absence of robust and current data on the extent of disability of all forms within the prison population and those interacting with the criminal justice system makes it difficult to address the rights and needs of these individuals.  Therefore, we recommend that systems for collection of data on disability should be devised and implemented across the criminal justice system to identify and address the barriers faced by people with disabilities in accessing their rights.</p> <p>  Prisoners with disabilities face many challenges in navigating the prison environment.  For example, the IPRT&rsquo;s 2020 research report, Making Rights Real for People with Disabilities in Prison, identified significant concerns about the environmental accessibility of Irish prisons for people with disabilities, with some individuals being unable to leave their cells or wings for large portions of their prison stay and, accordingly, having limited access to education, employment and recreational activities.  There were also difficulties for prisoners with disabilities in accessing healthcare services such as physiotherapy and speech therapy as well as mental health supports that go beyond psychiatry.  The report found that inaccessible information and a lack of information on the prison and its rules can cause difficulties for people with disabilities in following the disciplinary system.  There was a lack of awareness among prisoners with disabilities on their right to reasonable accommodation, with some describing being denied access to devices they relied upon outside of prison.  There were concerns around people with mental health illness being held in isolation and-or safety observation cells, which in some circumstances amounted to solitary confinement or, in other words, confinement in isolation for more than 22 hours a day.</p> <p>  Bullying of prisoners with disabilities has been identified as a matter of concern in both the IPRT&rsquo;s report and a recent report from the Inspector of Mental Health Services.  This can sometimes result in people trying to hide their disability while in prison.  Therefore, we recommend the Irish Prison Service undertake accessibility audits of all prison settings, engage in a disability equality analysis of its service, and ensure all those working in prison receive training on responding to the needs of prisoners with disabilities.  We also recommend that all prisoners experiencing mental health difficulties should be offered appropriate non-psychiatric responses, including access to psychology, counselling, and survivor-led peer support.  The placement of people with disabilities in solitary confinement should be prohibited, in line with international human rights standards.</p> <p>  The IPRT wishes to take the opportunity to re-emphasise that people with severe psychosocial disability should not be in prison and should, wherever possible, be diverted from the criminal justice system and provided with access to appropriate treatment in the community or an alternative therapeutic environment.  The focus of the recently established high-level task force on diversion is welcome, and the IPRT eagerly awaits publication of the task force&rsquo;s final report and implementation plan.</p> <p>  Regarding the potential human rights issues in diverting prisoners into secure psychiatric settings, the IPRT is clear that there must be robust consent processes and procedural safeguards in place whenever a transfer is to take place.  The IPRT is soon to publish research on the rights of people detained in secure forensic settings in Ireland, which will further inform and develop this position.  We call for the high-level task force final report and high-level implementation plan to be published without further delay.</p> <p>  I thank the committee members again for the invitation to attend today&rsquo;s session.  My colleague Ms Sarahjane McCreery and I are happy to discuss further any aspect of our statement or answer any questions the committee might have on the issues raised or anything else we can help with.</p></speech>

I was called to the Bar and did my first year in devilling in criminal law, which involved a lot of prison visits.  That experience of closed doors and absolute control over your life when you go through them has haunted me since.  From my very first visit to subsequent visits during that year, I came away with that sense of helplessness.  How frightening that must be for someone entering into the prison system for the first time.  If a person has a mental health illness or issues, intellectual disabilities, or any disability, how much more helpless must that person be?  That came across strongly, particularly in Ms Brady's opening statement.</p> <p>  Establishing the data is very important, as are establishing rights.  How are rights vindicated in the prison system for people with disabilities?  I went on to be an employment lawyer so I am used to disability under both the Equal Status Act and under the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the vindication of rights for people with disabilities in that context, but how is that in the prison system?  The threat and the experience of bullying must be all the more if a person is obliged to hide a disability.  I appreciate any advice back on how the committee might do that.</p> <p>  It is very powerful to hear the sheer number of people against whom section 12 is being used, and it is quite frightening.  While I understand its necessity in law and that there is a necessity to have that power in certain, very exceptional, circumstances, it strikes me that the training and competencies should be questioned.  I have enormous respect for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but in the heat of a moment, what checking or oversight is there of its members' discretionary use of this?  We have checks and mechanisms in other areas of criminal law that safeguard against the exercise of Garda discretion in situations like that, but what systems are there and what recourse to appeal is there?  It would be important to hear that.</p><p>Coming back to Ms Murphy, it horrifies me every time there is a major incident or a significant incident in the country that there is a rush to judgment of mental health issues.  This instant rush to judgment always belies an unconscious bias at national level.  The presumption is that once you have a mental health issue at all, somehow you are out of control and you must be curtailed and corralled.  There is a whole appalling discriminatory attitude that follows that.  Ms Murphy's contribution has articulated very well the programme she runs to expose that unconscious bias.  Given the vulnerability of suspects, what can we do to support them?  Might we ensure they have representation beside them so they are not left vulnerable?  Perhaps I had best leave it there.  The erosion of the presumption of innocence once any sort of mental health issue manifests concerns me, regardless of whether that issue has always been there - it may have been diagnosed and gone untreated - or is being exacerbated by being in a situation where you are a suspect or in the prison system.  What more can we do and how can we do it?</p></speech>

The IPRT has done a "know your rights" accessible guide in plain English, based on the prison rules, setting what your rights are.  In the research I referred to, we found that if somebody is deaf in the prison system there are very limited interpretation facilities.  Again, that comes down to resources.  There is an ongoing review of the prison rules.  We hope that will take into account some of these issues around disability.  However, we need to look at other more innovative ways to communicate with people and ensure they know their rights from the outset in order for them to be able to vindicate them at all.  Ms McCreery may wish to add something.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.782" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarahjane McCreery" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022062300002#D00600"><p>To add to what Ms Brady said, in the Making Rights Real for People with Disabilities in Prison report, prisoners spoke of a lack of information in the form of Braille, audiovisual information and easy-to-read language.  That applies not just to the prison rules but also to all types of information pertaining to what goes on in prisons, like the prison regime and how to navigate the prison.  That information was extremely inaccessible for the 16 prisoners in the report.  On vindicating rights, the IPRT always flags the need for an effective complaints mechanism in prisons, and that is really important to flag again now.  In our report, people in prison with disabilities noted they were afraid to make a complaint to the complaints system in case they received ill-treatment by the prison officers they were complaining about.  A lot of the time that was related to disability discrimination, which is really problematic.  We have been calling for it for a very long time, but an effective complaints mechanism needs to be in place in prisons and currently it is not.  It has been under review for a long time now and it has been promised but we need it effective immediately and not just for people with disabilities but for everybody.</p></speech>

It really needs to start on the street with the first encounters.  I am reminded of an allegation that was made against a young man with autism that he was hitting two girls with sticks.  He was arrested and was not treated very well in custody.  He was awarded costs against the State.  There was an issue about whether the man was lawfully detained under the Mental Health Act 2001.  The man could not communicate verbally and his mother was dead, so neither could give evidence.  That shows how quickly the unconscious bias steps in.  By all accounts, previous complaints had been made to the garda&iacute; about suspicious activity around the area and I think they jumped to a conclusion about this individual.  It goes back to training.  Garda&iacute; are under-resourced anyway.  In our interactions with them, individually they are quite passionate about addressing this issue as well.</p></speech>

It came to our attention during Covid.  The figures went up at the start of Covid and people were especially vulnerable.  It seems that the gaps in our health system are being filled by our justice system, that is, by the Garda.  With the lack of community services, garda&iacute; are stepping in.  To give a sense of this, 650 people end up detained in a centre.  There is a whole process to vindicate your rights, including tribunals to ensure that things are procedurally correct and that you also have a mental disorder, because deprivation of liberty obviously must be in accordance with law where it happens and must be limited.  Our understanding from the Garda is that section 12 was used approximately 5,700 times in 2020.  If only 650 of them ended up in a centre, what happened to the other 5,100 cases?</p></speech>

We do not know what is happening there.</p> <p>  The Senator asked what the checks and balances are.  We do not know what they are.  We have met the Garda on a number of occasions.  For example, if you are brought into a station for drunk-driving, you have more rights than a person who is picked up based on the view of a garda that he or she has a mental disorder.  You would have to question the capability of a garda to make that assumption, so it is a questionable area.  We have raised it with the Garda and the Department of Justice and we think there should be a process in place to vindicate people's rights so at the very least they get the same rights as a drunk-driver and it is time-limited to a degree.</p> <p>  On training, we have met with the Garda.  Again, we did not get a lot of information.  We got some information but it seems that the Garda does a lot of its own internal training.  It trains its own people.  This year we have organised with the HSE that we are going to do a full day with garda&iacute; at a senior level and different people in the health services.  However, on training the new garda&iacute;, you would think that needs to come from professionals outside the Garda in both the legal and mental health areas.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Dr. Finnerty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.792" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Susan Finnerty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022062300002#D01600"><p>It is interesting, and the point has been made, that people with disabilities need to be diverted away from the criminal justice system.  We have to go back further than just the Garda.  We have to look at what mental health services are providing.  In general, what most mental health services are providing is an out-of-hours service that centres around emergency departments.  The only option for garda&iacute; at that stage is to bring people either directly to an approved centre or inpatient unit or bring them in through the accident and emergency department.  On diversion, there are no arrest-stage diversion services in Ireland.  A pilot is supposed to be starting in Limerick.  It has not received any funding as far as I am aware.</p><p>It is a good model that is based on the Memphis model, which is the original police diversion.  Were mental health services to be available to garda&iacute; in order that they could assess whether someone has a mental illness or disorder and whether they need inpatient treatment or support from other agencies, that would be the key to stop garda&iacute; bringing people for admission or holding them in Garda stations for lengthy periods while they try and decide what to do.  Arrest at the stage of police diversion is really the key to stopping people with disabilities actually getting into the criminal justice system.</p></speech>

I do not think that any of us is.  We are advocating for greater supports for them.  They are in a position where they have to make decisions unsupported.  I take the point.  External training would be of assistance, along with a panoply of other options.</p></speech>

The IPRT said it estimated that nearly one in three prisoners in Ireland has an intellectual disability, so it could be greater.  It indicated that we need a system for the collection of data.  Has consideration been given to what kind of system is required or how it would work?  I am sure there are many with intellectual disabilities who also have mental illnesses, and we need to gather that information.  How do you solve a problem if you do not know the extent of it?</p> <p>  The Mental Health Commission provides inspection of approved centres.  Are all prisons considered approved centres and are they inspected?  We have to realise that many prisoners have mental health issues.  That has been said here before.  It was mentioned that a general prison inspection report has not been seen since 2014.  Have all these reports been gathered but not published?  If so, why is that?  It is worrying that these reports are not being published.  Again, if we do not know the extent of the problems in the prisons, how can we deal with them?</p> <p>  A number of people mentioned the high-level task force and diversion.  Will they expand on that aspect?  It would seem to be a good development, but what if it is not properly resourced?  Reference was made to the joint working group on mental health services and the police and the fact that 12 years on there has been no change.  We must ask if it was the case that it was not resourced properly or was not implemented.  There are many different reports.  If proper resources are not provided and if these reports are not implemented, they will not make the difference they are supposed to make.  What advice is there for the committee or the Government on how to move these matters forward?  You can have reports coming out of your ears but unless they are implemented and properly resourced they will not make the difference that they should make.</p></speech>

It focused on transparency in the system, so specifically on data and data collection systems.  We propose that the criminal justice system generally should have a system of equality monitoring that is in line with the CSO and that staff and prisoners should be trained.  Staff should be trained to recognise why the data is being collected and how to support prisoners in collecting it and prisoners should be trained in how, in the context of their everyday lives in prison, it would benefit them to disclose this kind of data.  We also made recommendations on race and ethnicity data.</p></speech>

To be fair to the Department of Justice, it is one of the lead Departments that is concentrating on putting data across the system.  However, it has not been successful in this regard to date.  I often wonder because if you did not have the information right on an arrest or transfer warrant that is required in law you would be released so why not change the law whereby if there is specific data in respect of disability that it is included?  Where it was available to the State previously, it should be available now.  That is one way.</p></speech>

We inspect approved centres and produce reports after our visits.  Those reports are published.  We do not have any jurisdiction in prisons.  That is the function of the Inspector of Prisons who does inspections with his or her team and produces reports.  The decision to publish the reports rests with the Minister for Justice.  I have no further information on that.</p> <p>  The extent of mental illness in prisons came to my attention and that of the previous Inspector of Prisons.  Through her assistance, we did visit the prisons.  I was able to go with her as part of her inspection team and I was able to write the report on circumstances in the criminal justice system for people with mental illness.  However, the Mental Health Commission does not have any jurisdiction in the prisons.  That is the Inspector of Prisons.</p></speech>

These inspections have been carried out and they are routinely carried out by the inspector of prisons but they have not been published.  We did see very detailed inspection reports published around Covid-19 on all the different prisons.  They have been incredibly useful and informative because we think there should be transparency and these reports should be published.  That would lend us real oversight into what is happening in a prison.  We also understand that the legislation to put in place a national preventative mechanism to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is imminent.  I understand that it is imminent.  That would broaden things out to ensure that people who were detained in health facilities would also fall in the remit of that new preventative mechanism that would be co-ordinated by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  That is something to look at and something we have often called for.</p> <p>  The UN Human Rights Committee is examining Ireland next week in Geneva under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  We have made a submission on that which deals with some of those issues.  We can send that to the committee.</p></speech>

It might have mentioned that PULSE could be used for that data collection.  Anecdotal evidence has suggested that people have ended up in court, and it is only at that stage that it becomes apparent that they have a disability.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has a really important role in respect of early identification.

I think it is led by former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch.  It comprises the Garda, the Prison Service, civil servants from the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and a few other people.  We have raised these areas with the members of the task force.  They are looking at different areas so they can put actions in place.  One of those was the diversion programme, it must be a year ago now.  The idea was that they were going to pilot that in Limerick to see if we could roll it out in the rest of the country.  Very often it is a matter of the interactions between different State agencies.  Is the Department of Health or the Department of Justice funding it?  It was the first one I got from the Garda and the leadership in Limerick and they were really determined to put it in place.  It sounds like a good idea.  That alone happening would set a trend.</p></speech>

It has been one of the most revealing and frankly unnerving sessions we have had.  The failure of the justice and penal system to recognise and respond to people with disabilities is quite shocking.  In some cases it seems to amount to people being punished because they have an unidentified or unsupported disability or even an identified one.  The witnesses' insights and recommendations are invaluable in helping us to prepare reports and hold authorities to account.</p> <p>  Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, aims to ensure that people with disabilities can make their own decisions.  Given that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 is being rushed through the D&aacute;il at the moment I will mainly focus my questions on that.  My first question is primarily for the Mental Health Commission.  A significant source of concern was reflected in the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth during pre-legislative scrutiny about the lack of engagement with disabled people's organisations, DPOs, in developing the decision support service draft code of practice.  There was actually no engagement with DPOs on that.  Could Mr. Farrelly clarify whether governance arrangements are in place to ensure that decision support services are engaging meaningfully with disabled people and their representative organisations in the performance of their functions?  I refer especially to organisations speaking to the experience of people with intellectual disabilities of mental health services, and neurodivergent and older people.</p> <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 retains the use of substitute decision making but General Comment No. 1 on Article 12 of the UNCRPD took Article 12 to prohibit substitute decision-making.  When Ireland ratified the convention in 2018 the State entered a declaration permitting the retention of substitute decision-making.  I am curious to know the commission's position on substitute decision-making.  If anyone else wants to come in on that as well, that would be great.</p> <p>  Another area of concern is the exclusion from the Bill of people involuntarily detained.  The Government plans to leave changes in this area to legislation amending the Mental Health Act.  I am wondering if the witnesses would agree that this is unhelpful and stigmatising to other people with mental health difficulties in realising rights around will and preferences.  Should the Government address these issues in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022?  Finally, the Assisted Decision-Making Act 2015 is about valuing an individual's will and preference.  Do the witnesses have suggestions or examples, perhaps from other countries, of how this can be achieved in carceral settings, be it imprisonment or those involuntarily detained?  How do we take their capacity to make decisions seriously?</p></speech>

It is not correct.  Unless there is some technical term that I am missing, even to give that impression is just not correct.  We have put a lot of work into engaging with stakeholders.  We have a stakeholder forum every month where we ensure that the voice of the person is heard.  I am happy to send the Deputy the facts of the matter.  Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn has contact with hundreds of organisations and people non-stop.  It may be that there are issues with Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 but we are not accountable for bringing that through; the Department is.  In terms of the Mental Health Commission's decision support service, DSS, there is not.  If there is some technical thing we have missed or that we are not speaking to the right people, I would want to know.  The reason we have taken on this decision support role is that we want to vindicate the rights of people with a disability and we want to vindicate people's human rights.  There may be some confusion regarding what one group is informing the Deputy on what we are doing and I am happy to discuss that.  Quite genuinely, we have put the engagement at the centre of it.</p></speech>

If the Deputy has factual evidence that this is the case she must, please, give it to me and I will absolutely make sure that those people are included.  We have seen hundreds of groups and thousands of people.  Our engagement got a significant response.  We want to hear from people.  Why would we not want to hear from people?  The whole point of the Act is to help these people.</p></speech>

That flies in the face of the whole purpose of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  They were the concerns we heard at the committee from DPOs that said they were not engaged with.  That would be assuming incapacity rather than assuming capacity.  The DPOs we engaged with were extremely put out by that, understandably, and so was the committee.</p></speech>

It is something we would definitely like to fix if we can get evidence that it is actually occurring or would occur.  There is an assumed capacity provided for in the Act.  One of the powers we have under the Act is to monitor, enforce and regulate that people are using the Act in good faith.  I actually read that in the paper.  The idea that a bank teller would somehow not believe a person had capacity and refuse them an account - I was part of a HIQA investigation where we went into the centres for people with disabilities.  None of them had accounts.  The staff were running the accounts and using the money.  We heard similar things like that from the staff.  However, when we pushed it, thousands of individuals were given bank accounts.  This was before the Act.</p> <p>  Quite genuinely, the Act may have some interpretive and analytical flaws and academic, perceptual flaws.  Most Acts do.  I am more than happy to relay that question to the director and give the Deputy a formal reply.  I would be very surprised if someone went to a bank and that happened with the powers we would have.  If they came to us, we would absolutely go after that area to make sure they were using the law properly.  The other thing is working with the banks.  I know the banks have received a lot of flak but they have actually engaged with this in terms of training and bringing people up to standards in terms of the Act.  It is unfortunate if what the Deputy says is the case.  I would not like that to be the case.  I hope we can get a meeting with the people who think that may be the case.  Through all our consultation and talking to thousands of people, that never really came up until the Deputy mentioned it.</p></speech>

Obviously we have talked a lot about resourcing the garda&iacute; and how they are under-resourced.  I would say the same for the Irish Prison Service.  Prison officers are not trained in how to deal with mental health issues in the way that sometimes they need to be.  It is an unfair pressure that is put on them.  That is something we really need to think about.  The report we mentioned earlier talks about the under-resourcing of interpretation services for people who may be deaf or of people being isolated in their cells because they cannot cope with the physical conditions in prison due to their disability.  When there is overcrowding that is an issue as well.  People should be in single cells.</p> <p>  On Deputy Cairn's other point regarding the exclusion of people involuntarily detained, along with our colleagues in mental health reform we have written to the Taoiseach on this very recently.  We think this should be addressed now.  It will need to be addressed at some point so why would we kick it down the road?  There is a huge issue there for the exclusion of people who are involuntarily detained particularly around things like advanced healthcare directives.  We would hope that would be addressed before the Act is finalised even if it is being pushed through at a very fast pace. </p></speech>

We have engaged a lot not just with disability organisations but also with self-advocacy groups.  Unfortunately because we have not been able to roll out what we are trying to do, we do not think it is fair to take up their time without having the resources to help them as well.

Ms Eileen Flynn is not able to attend in person this morning and she asked me to raise a few questions on her behalf.  She works with the newly formed Joint Committee on Autism as well.  She has been speaking to autistic people about their experiences and one of the things she has learned is that some of the sensory inputs others might not notice can actually be physically painful for autistic people.  In fact many autistic people describe it as being like torture.  In accessibility reviews of the prisons and other places of detention, have they been assessed for sensory accessibility?  What screening procedures are in place within the justice system for neurodiversity, intellectual disability and people with other impairments who are vastly over-represented in prisons and face prejudice as witnesses or defendants at trials?</p> <p>  All our guests have talked about the lack of information on disability and the huge barriers to be overcome to make sure that people with disability have equal access to justice.  What can we do immediately to improve the data collection and sharing between agencies involved in the justice system on disabilities?  Why can the Garda public attitudes survey and the quarterly national household survey not start collecting and sharing useable information on disabilities immediately?  Could the witnesses explain areas where they feel the revised Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 falls short of the standard set in the CRPD when it comes to people with disabilities' equal access to justice?  One example of this is not going far enough when making sure disabled persons are accommodated on juries and still using substitute decision making instead of upholding all disability people's rights to supported decision making.  </p> <p>  Those are Ms Flynn's comments.  Can some of the witnesses reflect on them and comment? </p></speech>

It has been raised a couple of times.  I will make sure the director gives the rationale and the MHC's opinion in the Decision Support Service, DSS, on it.</p></speech>

That was a huge issue for people with autism within the penal system, many of whom might be undiagnosed.  AsIAm members are the experts in the area so we hope their project in the prison system will be up and running again.  The Making Rights Real for People with Disabilities in Prison report identified that if people with sensory issues who may have neurodivergent conditions, have to share a cell this can be very overwhelming for them and the noises from other people, the lack of personal space can cause them quite a bit of trauma.  Single cell occupancy is something we have recommended and mentioned before.  The numbers in prison at the moment are the highest they have been in a very long time.  We saw that the numbers reduced dramatically during Covid-19 for various reasons.  We have more than 4,000 people within the prison system.  I think it is a 7% increase on the same week last year.  That is of concern.  The numbers were starting to go in the right direction.  We were starting to see people serving more community service orders and other diversion mechanisms being put in place.  The more people who are in prison, the more we have to think about those with disabilities and how we are accommodating them and addressing any of the issues they might have.</p> <p>  Regarding the sharing of data between different agencies, GDPR is the thing that I imagine a lot of the agencies would mention.  When they are collecting the data, they would have to look at putting protocols in place and whether or not they are getting consent from people to share their information with other agencies.  I do not see how it could be done without that.  That is something that could perhaps be explored by some of those agencies.</p></speech>

The environment needs to be explored, whether it is a Garda station, a prison or a courtroom.  It has to be looked at holistically.  If the environment is right and supported properly, that is the most beneficial support you can give to someone with a disability.  The Criminal Courts of Justice are laid out properly but there are many other courtrooms around the country and many Garda stations where the environment would not be conducive for people with disabilities.  A lot of investment would need to be put into that.</p></speech>

There is great goodwill around the table.  I am not an expert in the areas we are discussing, but one thing I noticed is the lack of co-ordination on bringing things together.  The Bradley report from way back included information about everything operating in silos.  Having listened to quite a number of bodies, all doing great work, such as garda&iacute;, prison officers and so on, the one thing that is lacking seems to be some drawing together of the strands that should inform us all as we are going along.  Just awareness training and getting people on side would be the way to do it.  That is the point I would like to emphasise, and we probably will emphasise it in anything we send back to the committee.  We appreciate very much the opportunity this morning as well.</p></speech>

We see the evidence given to us in our committee.  We looked into where we go &ndash; is it health, education or disability?  What are the agencies that we need?  There is no overarching body that, first of all, has power to implement, but is actually capable of bringing the strands together.  Mr. Carroll&rsquo;s point was well made.</p> <p>  I thank one and all.  We will revert back to what Senator Seery Kearney raised.  It is certainly something to look at.

Other colleagues will join us remotely and some are coming in a little later.</p> <p>  Today we are continuing our meetings on the recommendations Nos. 4 to 19, inclusive, of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, which relate to care and social protection.  Today we have representatives from the Disability Federation of Ireland, Disabled Women Ireland, and the Independent Living Movement Ireland.</p> <p>  I welcome our witnesses this morning.  Ms Fleachta Phelan, senior policy advocate with the Disability Federation of Ireland is joining us here in person.  She is very welcome.  Joining us remotely are Ms Amy Hassett and Ms Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta, co-directors with Disabled Women Ireland.  They are both very welcome.  Ms Fiona Weldon and Ms Eileen Daly from Independent Living Movement Ireland are very welcome and join us remotely.  Ms Weldon is the strategies for change co-ordinator and Ms Daly is a CREATE life coach.  We are very accustomed now to having these hybrid meetings, which is great because it really maximises participation.</p> <p>  Our committee is charged with overseeing the implementation of the 45 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, which we regard as a blueprint for achieving gender equality in Ireland.  Our focus is very much on how to implement those recommendations.  We will produce an action plan at the end of our term in December.  We want to focus, therefore, on the practical implementation of the recommendations.  We are conscious that many of today's witnesses, and our witnesses generally, have already participated in the citizens' assembly process.  We do not want to duplicate that work.  We want to build on the great work the citizens' assembly has done.</p> <p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable.  Participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those who are participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, the participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I welcome all of our witnesses and thank them for being here to engage with us.  We ask for a time limit of five minutes each on the opening statements.  I thank the participants for providing the committee with some very detailed opening statements.</p> <p>  I call Ms Fleachta Phelan to make her opening statement on behalf of the Disability Federation of Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.840" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fleachta Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022062300002#A00300"><p>Many thanks to the committee for inviting us to speak.   The Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, was delighted to contribute to the citizens' assembly deliberations last year and welcomed the thoughtful and strong recommendations that came through from the committee, which reflected many of the concerns that disability organisations, including all of us here, have been raising for many years.</p> <p>  While the focus of the assembly was on gender equality, and we know disabled women often face discrimination on multiple fronts, it is notable that many of the recommendations we are discussing today would actually benefit all people with disabilities.  They would also help Ireland to meet its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.</p> <p>  It is important to note at the start that we could have a full session on any one of the recommendations we are discussing today, but nevertheless I am sure we will all do our best to give some thoughts to the committee for its own reflections.</p> <p>  As my opener, I want to pose a question to the committee.  The most recently published 2021 Central Statistics Office survey on income and living conditions, SILC, poverty data shows that disabled people are now five times more likely to live in consistent poverty than the general population.  The data shows that 19.2% of those unable to work due to long-standing conditions such as disability or health issues live in consistent poverty, while the national average is 4%.  Also, the at risk of poverty rate for this cohort for 2021 was 39.1%.  This rate increased by almost 6% last year, while the national average at risk of poverty rate declined to 11.6%.  These statistics are very stark.</p> <p>  My question, for this committee, and for our country, is whether we believe it is acceptable that people in Ireland, by virtue of being disabled, should be locked into poverty, a significantly lower standard of living, and the extreme stress that goes with trying to live on an insufficient weekly amount.  It was very heartening for many of us that the citizens who deliberated on this did not believe this should be the case and gave parliamentarians like the committee members a very strong mandate to take action to change this deeply unfair situation.</p> <p>  We have seen recently how powerful our social protection system can be in protecting our society from poverty.  The pandemic unemployment payment was set at a much more adequate rate of &euro;350 a week, and the 2021 poverty data show how effective that policy choice was, with the general at risk of poverty rate declining, even with the substantial amount of economic upheaval caused by the pandemic.</p><p>Disabled people, however, have found this very difficult to watch because they continue to be expected to live for the rest of their lives on a much lower disability allowance rate.  At that stage, it was &euro;203 a week, now increased to &euro;208.  Two in five people who rely on this payment to live are at risk of poverty.  This shows that our current social protection provision is completely inadequate.  We know that last year's Indecon report on the cost of disability documented what many of us here have been highlighting for a very long time.  It concluded that people with disabilities have annual extra costs ranging from &euro;8,700 to &euro;12,300, although that can reach up to &euro;23,610 or more for those with multiple disabilities.  The basic annual income provided by disability allowance is &euro;10,816.  It can be seen that those sums do not add up.<br/><br/>DFI is increasingly receiving alarming emails and phone calls from disabled individuals who are struggling to make ends meet due to the cost-of-living crisis.  Even though the Government had the cost of disability report in hand for budget 2022, disability allowance was only increased by &euro;5, the same as every other payment.  This was an increase of 2.5%.  As we know, inflation is now running at 7%.<br/><br/>I want to quote from one of the emails we received recently because it illustrates the problem with painful eloquence.  Permission has been sought from the author to quote this email.  It is a fairly long extract.  </p><blockquote>	[Disability allowance] does not even cover essential outgoings, even when stripped back to the lowest amounts possible.  I use as little fuel as possible, yet cannot pay my bills without going without food for days on end.  The fuel allowance has been cut off since the second week of April, even though it is still cold at night.  It seems inhuman that our government treats the most vulnerable in society this way.  Such extreme poverty amounts to social exclusion, a large 'no entry' sign on every ordinary pleasure.  A &euro;5 cup of coffee with a friend is an unaffordable expense on an already overdrawn account.  Regular and unexpected household costs set me back for months, particularly if I cannot repair things myself, like broken blinds, boiler or washing machine repairs.  People need to have money in their pockets in order to get out of their homes and mix with the real world.  Social isolation is not an acceptable solution to the misery of having no money to join the rest of humanity in ordinary, even inexpensive, pursuits.  Even with the living alone allowance, fuel allowance and household benefit, I am constantly overdrawn due to the necessity to eat and keep warm, yet stay connected with friends, on such a miserable sum.  </blockquote><p>Acting on recommendation 14 to set social protection rates above the poverty line is thus extremely urgent for disabled people.  It is also important to remember that the members of the citizens' assembly indicated they were willing to pay to support increased social welfare provision and a more equal Ireland.  Some 95.6% of citizens indicated that, if necessary, they were also prepared to support and pay higher taxes based on the principle of ability to pay and to make the recommendations a reality.<br/><br/>I have concentrated mostly on the social protection recommendation as the committee has already heard a number of inputs on care and, as I believe, Independent Living Movement Ireland, ILMI, and Disabled Women Ireland, DWI, are likely to make strong and important contributions on this.  However, I will add a couple of short lines on care before I conclude.  People with disabilities are often forced to rely on others, including family members, for care and support.  Many family carers step into the caring role because there are no, or completely insufficient, State supports available for their family member.  If the State provided and properly resourced independent living options, this could remove the necessity for family carers to compensate for and mitigate a lack of state provision.<br/><br/>As a result, DFI considers recommendation 10 to be extremely important.  It addresses one of the most important rights for people with disabilities, namely, the right to live independently.  We and our members have been calling on the State to support and resource this right for decades.  We were pleased that this right was so strongly supported by the citizens' assembly, with a unanimous vote to support it.  Ensuring a person is resourced to live independently includes providing a whole range of services a person may require and that includes personal assistant support, assistive technology, accessible public housing and transport, and an income above the poverty line, all of which we have called for over many years.  We have also long-supported the creation of a statutory right to home care and we are an active member of the Home Care Coalition, a group of civil society organisations advocating for this right.<br/><br/>I thank the committee members for listening and I look forward to the discussion.</p></speech>

Ms Hassett and I will be splitting the opening statement but I will start.  Disabled Women Ireland is the national disabled person&rsquo;s organisation, DPO, representing self-identified disabled women, girls, non-binary and gender non-conforming people in Ireland.  Our members self-identify as disabled and we understand disability as a broad concept which includes physical, sensory, mental and intellectual impairments.  DWI is an all-island organisation, with members located across 25 counties, living in both urban and rural areas.  We welcome the opportunity to present today on the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality.</p> <p>  We broadly support the recommendations of the citizens' assembly and seek to ensure that actions based on them are constructed in such a way as to not further disadvantage disabled women and to uphold the rights recognised in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, which Ireland ratified a few years ago.  While we use the word "women" throughout our opening statement and will do so during questions later, this is only because data on gendered experiences of disability is lacking and we do not have figures on the experiences of other gender minority groupings, but we strongly support the citizens' assembly&rsquo;s statement in its open letter that trans and non-binary people suffer from particular facets of inequality.  At a time when trans people&rsquo;s rights are facing unprecedented pushback on this island, we want to reiterate that non-binary identities are valid, trans women are women, trans rights are human rights and any deviation from that position fails to acknowledge or understand our equal dignity as humans.  Disabled Women Ireland is nothing without our trans members.  We should not have to say this, but the current climate is such that we can not speak on a feminist, equal future for Ireland without doing so.  In our experience, any issue which disproportionately impacts on disabled women also impacts on disabled gender minority people to at least the same degree, but often to a greater degree.</p> <p>  First, we will speak on care recommendations 4 to 12.  Overall, we support the recommendations made by the citizens' assembly in relation to care but wish to highlight a number of points essential to their being implemented in a manner which recognises the significant proportion of disabled people who are carers and which ensures the rights and agency of all disabled people are respected.  We agree with the citizens' assembly's statement that we need to transform our models of care to ensure that our society values every person, but caution that specific measures must be identified and incorporated into any implementation which respect disabled people&rsquo;s autonomy and ensures they can access any supports needed to exercise that autonomy.</p> <p>  In Ireland, 67% of disabled women are parents and disabled people are almost three times more likely to be carers than non-disabled people.  In fact, 45% of family carers in Ireland are themselves disabled.  Disabled people, and in particular disabled women, are responsible for a huge portion of caring work in Ireland.  We need to acknowledge this and ensure they are better supported in this vital work.  It is also important to acknowledge and respect the interdependence of care.  Care is rarely a one-way street, and the systems we create need to reflect this.</p> <p>  When non-disabled people speak about care, it can often be in a paternalistic way that fails to consider that they themselves receive care support from those around them or in a way that fails to recognise that disabled people are often givers, and not only recipients, of care.  For those of us who have relied on care, or have provided care, we know that these depictions of a one-way model of care are inaccurate at best.</p> <p>  We support the citizens' assembly&rsquo;s recommendation that respite provision for carers should be improved but it is essential that we do not frame disabled people as burdens, a framing that plays a significant role in our dehumanisation.  Indeed, disabled people themselves may also need a break from their families or careers, as we all do, and should be afforded the opportunity to have alternative experiences, build their own social networks and spend time away from their home environments.  We want to be really clear that we do not want to see an increase in respite provision which results in disabled people being placed in institutions, but instead the expansion of such services in ways that include alternatives for those who want them.</p> <p>  We need to be creative and flexible in creating models that work for people on an individual basis, and some alternatives to institutional respite have already been used in Ireland.  Examples of this are family home-sharing or respite budgets being provided directly to families have, in the past, enabled disabled people and their families to create systems which work for them.  Better provision of in-home supports will make flexible, individualised alternatives much more possible and allow more freedom of choice.</p> <p>  We also do not fully support the language of recommendation 10, which focuses on choice of care and support, rather than fully acknowledging disabled people's right to choose their care or support arrangements, with the will and preferences of an individual at the centre of all such arrangements.  The language used in this recommendation undermines the idea of equality for disabled people.</p><p>To say that disabled people should be able to participate as fully as possible in decisions about their own lives reflects neither the spirit nor the letter of the UNCRPD - specifically Articles 12 and 19 which we focus on particularly.  Article 12 requires that disabled people enjoy legal capacity on the same basis as others and that they can access the support they need in exercising this legal capacity.  This means disabled people are entitled to make all decisions about their own lives, and should be provided with any support needed to make these decisions.  Article 19 states that disabled people are entitled to choose their place of residence, and as such, should have access to a range of support services of their choosing so as to enable them to live independently and be included in their communities on an equal basis with others.  As the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities describes in the general comment on independent living in Article 19 " living independently means that individuals with disabilities are provided with all necessary means enabling them to exercise choice and control over their lives and make all decisions concerning their lives. Personal autonomy and self-determination is fundamental to independent living ...".</p><p> We are clear that support or care without choice is neither support nor care.  Support cannot be imposed upon a person.  We are clear that institutionalisation can happen in the home or in the community when the autonomy, will, and preference of a person is not respected.  We agree that all----- </p></speech>

As Ms Phelan talked a lot about, for disabled people, particularly for disabled gender minority people, poverty is a major barrier to realising an independent and adequate standard of living.  The costs of disability can be significant, and insufficient support is available to meet them while avenues to employment are restricted or closed off to disabled people.  As a result, disabled and gender minority people living in Ireland are exposed to high levels of deprivation and social exclusion, as Ms Phelan spoke about.  Indecon published a report last year which stated that the cost of disability can be up to &euro;11,734 and this cost rises with the number of impairments or conditions an individual experiences.  This indicates that the disability-related social welfare payments available are wholly insufficient to allow disabled people and their families to reach even a minimum standard of living.  It is for these reasons that we have broadly supported the assembly's recommendations on social protection.  We believe it is absolutely essential we adopt a fully individualised social protection system and that social protection payments and supports should be set at a level that lifts disabled people above the poverty line, prevents deprivation and supports an adequate standard of living.  We also support the assembly&rsquo;s recommendation on pensions and a universal basic income.  We are disappointed the recommendations do not include a specific reference to the cost of disability or a reflection on how means testing of disability supports places recipients in a dependent position within families.</p> <p>  We also want to highlight the interaction between financial independence and gender-based violence for disabled women and gender minorities.  As stated by the assembly in its open</p> <p>letter, there is no place in our society for gender-based violence.  According to an Irish report, disabled women are, on average, three times more likely to be subjected to intimate violence compared to  non-disabled women.  While there are many different reasons for this, as highlighted by our members' consultations and backed up by international research, disabled women's lack of financial independence plays a major role in this.  Lack of financial independence has been found to be one of the most significant risk factors for being exposed to intimate partner violence and represents a major barrier to escaping an abusive relationship. </p> <p>  We are encouraged to see that within the recommendations produced by the citizens' assembly on care and social protection there is no suggestion of measures which disempower or deliberately uproot the lives of disabled women and gender minorities in the name of safety.  When abuse is directed at disabled gender minority people, we are often met with safeguarding responses that remove disabled people from our communities, disempower them and ultimately fail to protect them.  As calls for increased safeguarding powers grow louder, we want to be clear that we do not support this and they do not protect us.  We need to examine both the causative and protective factors relating to the violence against disabled women and gender minorities, just as we do for their non-disabled peers, in order to substantially address and reduce this violence.  Approaches which rely on a safeguarding approach fail to look past assumptions about our inherent vulnerability to the reality of our lives, and risk restricting or denying our human rights, including our equal right to autonomy, in the name of keeping us safe.</p> <p>  We are encouraged by the steps taken by the committee to prioritise the voices and views of disabled people and their representative disabled persons&rsquo; organisations or DPOs on all issues which</p> <p>impact our lives, as required by the UNCRPD, and hope this marks the beginning of a fruitful and ongoing conversation between the committee members and DPOs which ensures no-one is left behind when implementing-----</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the opportunity to come and share our experiences and observations regarding the citizens&rsquo; assembly recommendations on care and social protection in relation to disabled people.  We speak to you today as disabled women and not women with a disability.  This is a social and political rights stance.  Our impairments do not disable society though and this understanding will underpin our contributions today.</p> <p>  We are acutely aware that disabled people live in a world that systematically excludes us from the ordinary rhythms of daily living.  We welcome the recommendations the citizens' assembly has made to tackle this issue but disabled people as a whole experience inequalities that have a detrimental effect on both our life chances and quality of life.  We feel very strongly that we cannot address gender equality unless we address the reality that disabled women need to be, and feel equal to, their non-disabled counterparts.  Some 13.8% of women in Ireland are disabled - that&rsquo;s a lot of us.  Disabled people are not a homogenous group.  We are all intersectional.  We hold many identities such as gender, race, belonging to an ethnic group, social class, religion, sexual orientation and ability and these identities can overlap with each another.  Understanding intersectionality with regard to disability is essential for the creation of appropriate laws and policies and the design and delivery of accessible, inclusive services.  Each and every one of us has our own unique experiences of discrimination and we must consider everything and anything that can marginalise us.  Article 6 of the UNCRPD states disabled women experience multiple instances of discrimination.  Ireland, having ratified the UNCRPD, must take measures to ensure disabled women have their human rights and fundamental freedoms adhered to and our government must put in place empowerment measures to ensure full participation in everyday living including education, employment, and family living.</p><p>Disabled people experience the same inequalities as non-disabled people.  However, their situations are exacerbated by social and cultural attitudes to disability as well as environmental barriers.  Disabled people have a lower uptake of health screening, are more likely to experience sexual violence, experience barriers to parenting, and are disproportionately affected by the extra costs they face because they are deemed to be disabled.</p><p> It is our lived, learned and professional experience that disabled people do not want to be reliant on their family for support unless both parties agree.  Disabled people do not want carers, caring, home support or support services that impede their life chances to live like everyone else.  These services only allow disabled people to exist and not live.  We want and need access to tailored, person-centred supports that promote choice, control and self-determination in the form of a personal assistance service.  This provision must become a right and must not be subject to resource availability.</p><p> A personal assistant, PA, is an individual contracted by a disabled person to provide him or her with the support he or she needs in different aspects of daily living.  This assistance can look different to all of us because we all have different needs.  Some tasks a PA carries out include support with intimate care, being a homemaker, providing assistance at school, university and the workplace, and parental support.  When out and about, some disabled people need assistance with money management, navigating their environment or support with directing their PAs.  There is no cut-off age for the provision of this support.  I hand over to Ms Daly.</p></speech>

As a disabled persons' organisation, DPO, Independent Living Movement Ireland recognises that many of the so-called supportive structures mostly promote exclusionary practices that separate disabled people from their non-disabled peers in the home, at school, at work and in their social life.</p> <p>  We believe that capacity building is paramount to support parents in demanding their right to quality support in ensuring their children grow up to live good lives, and this includes the provision of inclusive education.  Parents should not be forced into battling with healthcare professionals to get the supports their children need.  Disabled children have rights, just like every other child.  Parents must have access to appropriate and tailored person-centred supports that assist them with their parental duties, if and when required, and this must become an automatic right.  They must also be supported to work and have a career if they so wish.  They must not be forced to give up work, reduce their working hours, or not advance their careers just because they are obliged to stay at home.  It is also worth mentioning that there is an additional cost factor for families of disabled children and adults.</p> <p>  Disabled women need access to appropriate healthcare that meets their specific needs.  Many healthcare services are inaccessible.  Last year, ILMI hosted a consultation session with disabled women from across Ireland.  We heard stories about going for a mammogram or a CervicalCheck screening or seeking gynaecology services were stark.  Disabled women want a dignified experience.  It is their belief that healthcare professionals require disability equality training to understand the inequalities disabled women face.</p> <p>  Disabled women are more at risk of sexual abuse and violence than their non-disabled counterparts.  They need access to accessible information and awareness training about what constitutes sexual abuse and violence.  We want all related healthcare services and support agencies or groups that work with survivors to be well informed and well equipped to support us, and these services must also be easily accessible.  We want disabled women to be empowered, to speak up and have a no-tolerance view of sexual abuse and violence.</p> <p>  It is worth noting that 63.7% of disabled women are mothers and yet they are barely referenced in our current maternity strategy.  Moreover, disabled people are often denied the right to make reproductive decisions, including decisions about fertility, contraception, pregnancy, childbirth and parenting.  This is a human rights violation.  As disabled women, we do not want the powers-that-be to assess our ability to have children nor question our ability or skills to look after them.

I will conclude with some statistics and things to be mindful of regarding work and social protection payments for disabled people.  Data from the 2016 census showed that 30% of disabled people received a third level education compared with 47% of non-disabled people.  Disabled girls and teenagers must have equal access to a broad range of subject choices that reflect their personal abilities and interests.</p> <p>  Professionals working with disabled people should ensure all their services are fully inclusive and have accessible funding streams.  We should have access to accessible healthcare, employment and education - essentially, equal access to all areas of life so as to participate as equal citizens in the State.</p></speech>

I now turn to committee members to open the discussion.As we have always done, a time limit will be put on each exchange, so we may not get to each witness for each question.</p></speech>

The points Ms Daly made are very relevant to the recommendations of the citizens' assembly on violence against women.  We will incorporate those important points.  I was struck by the request for ongoing training of persons working in the Department of Social Protection.  It sounds like the same training is also needed in the health services in terms of engaging with women and gender minorities with a disability.</p><p>It was striking because when looking at gender equality, many organisations have experienced that intersectional layer of discrimination.  It is good that this issue was highlighted.</p><p> I have a number of questions about social protection because that is the area we will drill in to.  On means testing and the call for the requirement of individualised social protection, from what we have heard from other witnesses, it means that we should not be looking at means testing or a household income solely when there are individuals and adults in that household who do not have independent access to income.  There is potential to interpret the reference to "individualised" in the recommendations as meaning there should be a move away from means testing.  I seek further comment on the importance of independence of income.</p><p> The recommendations for a universal pension have been very good and strong.  While we have the recommendation that every individual would receive a universal pension, how do we ensure that it reflects the cost of disability?  At present, when disabled people get to a certain age, their disability needs are not adequately recognised.</p><p> I refer to choices relating to independent living.  Some of what we are considering is how the statutory entitlement to home care is interpreted.  In failing to deliver that entitlement, it seems the debate has moved on to include personal needs assistants as part of what the statutory entitlement should be, for those who chose that service.  Will the witness comment on that?</p><p> Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta mentioned institutionalisation in the home or in residential facilities, about which I am concerned.  The DFI, has done a lot of work in this area, on the routes out of institutionalisation for those in certain care situations.  If we change things, we need to change them not just for the new people accessing care but those who are in residential care.  How does one move out of that model or what of a person in family care who wanted to move towards independent living options as they become available?  It is important to have routes of choice outward.</p><p> What was said about the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, in terms of the effective rates of poverty going down was striking.  We should look to that in general as it relates to the adequacy of social protection payments.  Not only was taking people out of poverty mentioned but the deprivation index was also raised.  The example of going for coffee was interesting.  In our deprivation basket of goods, being able to host a friend should be included in the standard.  Do we use the minimum essential standard of living that the Vincentians have been looking for?  How do we measure whether people are actually living fully?</p><p> The question on respite was interesting.  Perhaps it is not the right word but what was interesting about the recommendation was that it refers to the range of options.  That may provide opportunities for those in residential care, as well as those with home care, to say that they want to go on holidays, take on a project, do a course, or whatever they want to do.  What do the witnesses think about that?</p><p> I know I am out of time.  I thank the witnesses for their strong presentations.  They strengthen and give depth to the Citizens' Assembly recommendations and are true to their spirit.  Lastly, the witnesses should comment on issues relating to people with a disability who are carers, parents and carers more generally and on what specific supports are available to them.</p></speech>

Ms Hassett and Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta, both from Disabled Women Ireland, as well as Ms Weldon have indicated.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.861" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Amy Hassett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022062300002#E00400"><p>I will touch on a number of these questions.  We have been advocating for quite a while, that is, for more than a year or a year and a half at least, for the removal of means testing of disability allowance and having the allowance regarded as a cost of disability payment.  It will not solve all the problems but doing so would go a significant way.  Individualised support is very important and would be a good starting point.</p> <p>  We have a major issue with pensions in that once someone reaches the age of 65 years, across the board in all disability supports, they are no longer considered disabled and are just considered to be old.  This is creating major barriers, which Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta did not get to address.  The transitioning of supports between childhood and adulthood is a challenge, but so is the transition from adult to old age, which may not be the most appropriate way of handling matters.  It is consistently reported to us as being a significant barrier.  As for how we do pensions, we also need to consider the cost of disability.  It could be something different, like preventing a person from being aged out of the disability allowance, which might be the most direct way we deal with that.  Again, this would not be the entire solution but most certainly would be part of it.</p> <p>  Moving towards personal assistance services, which are more tailored and afford disabled people a lot more control over the support they receive, is the way we need to be looking at it.   Home care can be quite restricted and prescriptive in terms of the supports a person is provided with.  We want something that is more flexible and puts disabled people at the centre so they can decide what they need help with.  Home care does not necessarily meet those requirements but Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta will probably speak more to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.862" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022062300002#E00500"><p>I will further add to what Ms Hassett has comprehensively dealt with regarding some of the economic issues.  The root of a few of the Senator's questions comes down to the same issue, which is the agency and autonomy people have in deciding what their support looks like and what support they need to live what they consider to be a good life.  This touches on choice in support and home care, routes out of institutionalisation, institutionalisation in the home, and the issues around respite.</p> <p>  A lot of the time, home care services are not delivered in a manner that is emancipatory or centres the person.  People do not have control over who is entering their lives and what kind of supports they get.  It should not be called support but they are grateful to have anything.  This is not how we should model support for disabled people at any age.  As Ms Hassett reiterated, this also applies to older people, particularly older disabled women who seem to be especially disadvantaged.</p> <p>  There are different forms of institutionalisation.  In the home, if people do not have a choice about the care - "care" can be a fraught word in our community - or support they are receiving, it is not support.  If they do not have control or agency over their lives, they can end up experiencing institutionalisation in their own home or even in a supported living arrangement that is supposed to be or nominally is community based.  We need to interrogate that and ensure that people have choice and control over the care and support they receive.</p> <p>  Looking at routes out of institutionalisation, we are supposed to be decongregating and moving people out of institutionalised settings.  A lot of the time this stuff is fraught and people can struggle when faced with de-institutionalisation or leaving an institution.  That is because people's personal experience of institutionalisation is an absolute nightmare and they suffer significant trauma, which they need support in overcoming.  At a point when we are closing down institutions in this country, however, we completely fail to support people in exercising control or choice.  We move them out of communities that they might be familiar with and instead of something that should be an incredibly empowering experience, we approach it with such little regard to someone's autonomy that it is not seen or experienced as such.</p> <p>  Ms Hassett covered the range of institutions quite well.  We want people to be able to have breaks from the people they live with in the same way that we all need breaks from the people we live with.  We want people to experience different things but we cannot do that in a way that effectively means that first, disabled people are painted as burdens, which is such a danger and second, that people are placed in institutions because of that.</p></speech>

The lack of a personal assistant service is very stark in Ireland.  If we had a rights-based approach to personal assistants some of the inequality that disabled people face would not be there with regard to access to education and living the normal rhythm of life.  Many disabled people are forced to use supports they do not want to use.  They do not have choice, autonomy or self-determination.  Disabled people are less likely to have meaningful jobs than their non-disabled counterparts.  The other witnesses have made the other points I was going to make.</p></speech>

Reading the citizens' assembly report the one thing that struck me was that citizens did not believe in the entrenched level of poverty that people with disabilities live with.  If this is the case it cannot be justified by the State.  This came across very loud and clear in the report.  I want to touch on several areas.  As it stands there is broad agreement among all political parties and Independent politicians that specific service supports and resources need to be put in place for people to be able to live independently.  At the same time we see these chronic blockages to this happening.  There appears to be an institutional inability to listen to those with a disability and to value the voices and words of those who live with disability and who love people with disabilities as to what it is their needs are.  Independent Living Movement Ireland will come to the Oireachtas next week for an event on personal assistants.  I hope it is well attended.  It is critical that work on this is done.</p> <p>  Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta touched on the pathways for people to be able to live independently.  At this point have we any pathway that works functionally?  Has any pathway in existence, which has been designed with a disabled person in mind, delivered for somebody with a disability?  The area of institutionalisation is a very important part, particularly with regard to people becoming institutionalised in their own homes.  One of the opening statements mentioned a take-it-or-leave-it attitude that is sometimes seen by those with disabilities.  I ask Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta to comment on this from the perspective of a younger person and as somebody who, as has been mentioned, ages out of the disability payment.</p> <p>  Domestic violence and abuse against people with disabilities have been referenced.  We know the statistics of those with disabilities and their experience of domestic abuse, domestic violence and gender-based violence.  What interaction have the groups had with the Minister and the Department on the upcoming strategy on domestic and gender-based abuse?</p></speech>

I will go first to Ms Daly as I am conscious she did not speak on the previous question.  One of Deputy Clarke's questions is directly about Independent Living Movement Ireland.</p></speech>

To be honest it is very challenging, as everyone has said.  Institutionalisation is a complex issue.  As we know, it is not just a matter of taking someone from the four walls they are familiar with.  People need support.  They need the people they want around them, including professionals in many areas who will advocate with them and for them and really get to know who they are as people and what they want.  Many disabled women and men who live in institutional care have not been exposed or given the right to make basic decisions such as what they want to wear, what they want to eat for their dinner or who they want to hang out with.  Expecting someone to suddenly be able to run a household and manage money is alien.  However, it can be done and it has been done.  It needs to be done in very creative ways where people's experiences and voices need to be heard.  The HSE and other agencies need to work collaboratively with disabled persons organisations and other services that support a person's right to choice and control at whatever age.</p> <p>  With regard to young people I will refer specifically to my own experience.  I am very thankful that as an 18 and 19 year old I was able to experience life on campus in UCD.  I do not know whether that would happen today.  It has really shaped who I am.  It would not have happened had it not been for the Centre for Independent Living, which is now Independent Living Movement Ireland.  Many young disabled men and women do not have this access at present.  It is a rite of passage to assist a young person to get to know who they are.</p> <p>  I want to refer to the rights of older persons.  Many older women with a disability want to continue to lead active and full lives.  Just because someone is over 65 it does not mean they do not have the right to contribute to society.  It is ageist and it is a form of discrimination.  Ms Weldon would be more familiar with the policy issues that Independent Living Movement Ireland is working on with regard to gender-based violence.</p></speech>

I will now go to Ms Phelan becomes she did not speak on the previous question either.  I will then go to Ms Weldon and anyone else who wants to come in to respond to Deputy Clarke's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.869" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fleachta Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022062300002#F00700"><p>I will make several points.  On the pathways out of institutionalisation, as members know it is about the services being connected and Departments speaking to each other and co-ordinating.  An issue I work on is housing.  We often have the experience of people getting an offer of a house from a local authority but the personal assistant hours or support package required is not available on the health side to enable people to move into the house.  We have the crazy situation where people are unable to take up a housing offer because they cannot move forward.  To come back to the question asked by Senator Higgins, one of the most dramatic examples of this is the more than 1,300 people who are inappropriately placed in nursing homes due to the lack of supports in the system.</p> <p>  With regard to income adequacy and the PUP, I completely agree with the Deputy that it is very heartening to some extent to see how strongly the citizens took a line on this when they looked at it.  It is striking and concerning because while there was significant political will in the country to provide an adequate income almost overnight when large swathes of the population suddenly lost their income, there seems to be an acceptance that it is okay for disabled individuals to live for the rest of their lives on a completely inadequate income.  It is an entrenched institutionalised inequality.</p> <p>  Something we sometimes hear in the discussion is the need to incentivise disabled individuals into the workforce.</p><p>We know employment rates are substantially lower than EU averages.  There is scope to address the structural barriers to employment and to increase employment rates, but I am extremely concerned about individuals who cannot work due to their disability.  The idea that we could incentivise those individuals by keeping them on an income which is below the poverty line is completely inadequate.  On the question of what is adequate, there is a broad societal commitment to the minimum essential standard of living among anti-poverty groups.  Meitheal does not factor in the extra cost of disability.  If one wishes for adequate provision, one one has to build in the substantial extra costs that we are aware of.</p></speech>

Ms Weldon might come back in to follow up on Ms Daly.  I will then call Deputy Hourigan and invite Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta and Ms Hassett to respond first.</p></speech>

Being defined as disabled, whether by non-disabled people or disabled people, is very negative, which is not okay.  Disabled people can disable their own self-belief.  We grow up in Ireland with negative thinking about being different, not being the same and not being equal.  We need to address that.  We need to empower disabled people, including disabled women, because we are at the margins, being defined as disabled people.</p> <p>  The issue of sexual violence is stark.  In my experience, many disabled women and some disabled men have experienced it, but it is not discussed or talked about.  It is as if they say that they are disabled and this is part and parcel of life as a disabled person.</p> <p>  Some 80% of disabled people do not have any meaningful employment.  Why is that okay?  Why is it okay that they need to go to resource centres and day activation services?  Why is it okay that they do not participate in the normal rhythms of life?  That is not okay.  We are talking about people without people.</p></speech>

A number of opening statements today identified how rich and diverse the lives of women with disability are.  Many are parents.  Many are also carers.  People who are not engaged with this discussion may not properly identify that many people in our society have a disability of one type or another, across a spectrum of disabilities, and they are living incredibly rich, diverse lives, which needs to be recognised by policy.</p> <p>  I want to use my time to focus on a particular part of that policy.  I know Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta referred in her opening statement to how disabled women are often carers and sometimes work at the same time.  One of the strongest recommendations of the citizens' assembly relates to the right to access flexible working.  I have been on the Joint Committee on Disability Matters for some time.  We have had many sessions on the incredibly low levels of employment among women with a disability.  It strikes me that we are not doing enough to develop types of employment or access to employment that truly suits women who have caring responsibilities and-or disability to deal with.  Could we talk a little about that?  We have some legislation about working from home and we have work-life balance legislation.  I notice that legislation is limited to carers and parents.  That may be a missed opportunity and may pose a problem to parents who are looking for employment who would be eligible for that programme.</p> <p>  The EU structures for flexible working include things like job-sharing, the four-day week, working from home, remote working and flexible working.  We have a four-day week pilot and yet not one Government Department or significant public body is participating in it.  I would like to hand over to the witnesses and to hear about what would break down some barriers to employment.  I know it is not just a matter of flexible working and that there are also issues relating to access to supports such as technology or personal assistance in the workplace.  Should the pathways follow the person or the employment?  How does one even navigate getting an interview?  I would like to focus on that area if possible.</p></speech>

If they would like to address any points raised in the previous round, that would be great.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.876" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022062300002#G00700"><p>People might have been surprised at the emphasis on violence against disabled women in the submissions from us and from ILMI.  The simple fact is that supporting care and social protection are key reasons we experience much higher rates of violence in our community.  If we do not have the financial independence to leave certain situations or we have been forced into being financially dependent on an abuser, then we become vulnerable.  If we have no choice and are forced into the take it or leave it mentality with regard to care, that also creates vulnerability.  It is not our bodies or minds that are vulnerable but the structures in the State which actively disempower us.  Ms Hassett will address a couple of matters related to that and consultation, because we have input on that.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy Hourigan's question directly, flexible working is one issue.  Ultimately, all of this has to come together in order for us to live full lives where we can have everything, work, have families and be supported in doing so on our own terms.  What we are seeing right now in the legislation tabled on flexible work conditions is significantly weaker than what we were already entitled to as disabled people, as a reasonable accommodation.  The legal standard set out for me to request to work from home as a reasonable accommodation because of my disability is much higher.  Now, we are seeing employers say that they may have to give a written refusal.  A broader idea of flexible working has been presented which waters down something that was already a key right for disabled people.  It was not necessarily honoured all the time, but it existed.  We now see discussions about flexible working and working from home that ultimately create more rigid systems than we should have been entitled to already as disabled people.</p> <p>  We see, again and again, the idea that we have to fit these rigid definitions of what we need to look like as a worker or to be as a disabled person accessing work.  When supported employment systems are implemented, they are often capped.  People might have access to a certain level of work or a job.</p><p>However, it is never going to be meaningful if there is no access to progress up the ladder within that.  These are significant issues that come up.</p><p> When it comes to having a whole-life picture, of which work is one part, flexibility is absolutely essential.  If we continue to create systems that are fragmented and bitty and in which people have to fit into one box to have access, we will never be able to create a system that will really empower disabled people to engage meaningfully with the workplace if that is something they want to do.  I am almost discouraged that having moved through the pandemic and towards more flexible working conditions over the past two years, there is now massive pressure to get people back into the office.  We are even seeing organisations that supposedly have a disability rights focus being really resistant to creating those flexible working conditions.  As we roll back on absolutely everything employers were happy to roll out for non-disabled people over the course of the pandemic, I am less hopeful than I previously was.  We have shown we can do all of this remotely and flexibly over the past two years, which gave more of a balance than we ever had before.  Right now, however, we are seeing a return to conferences not offering hybrid options, workplaces demanding that people go into the office and a return to nine-to-five working.</p><p> The important point was made that no Departments have offered a four-day work week arrangement.  We have been told there will be an increased participation of people with disabilities within the Civil Service to 6% of the total workforce, but that is less then half of the representative number.  Let us be very clear about that, taking into account that the incidence of disability is counted very narrowly in the census and very widely in terms of who is counted as a disabled employee in the Civil Service.  I am not optimistic in this regard.  I think the Civil Service is a particularly stark example of where action is just not being taken in this regard, and it is reflected in all kinds of employment all over the island.</p><p> My colleague, Ms Hassett, might comment quickly on the consultation.</p></speech>

We made a submission to the research team when it was holding consultations.  In addition, we held a consultation with intellectually disabled women, in collaboration with another disabled people's organisation, DPO, the National Platform of Self Advocates.  We were supported by Inclusion Ireland in doing that.  We submitted the results of our consultation to the research term.  We were not initially contacted directly or approached by those who were working on the strategy.  We were quite disappointed by this given that, to my knowledge, we are the only national DPO representing disabled gender minorities.  We highlighted that lack of consultation to the research team at the time.</p> <p>  An important point relates to how the parameters of the research were defined in that they did not cover some of the unique types of violence experienced by disabled women, including, for example, violence perpetrated by a caregiver.  We had to argue for those points even to be considered.  The team was a little more open after these initial conversations but it was something of a difficult road to get there.  The reason I am being explicit about this relates to Deputy Hourigan's point.  Disabled people live rich and diverse lives and this has always been the case.  We may not always have been recognised as living rich and diverse lives but we have always done so.  The question we really have to ask ourselves collectively, given this has always been the case, is why our policies do not reflect that reality.</p> <p>  Fundamentally, what it comes down to is that disabled people and DPOs are not involved in designing policies.  We are consulted but whether our views are taken on board is an entirely different question.  The reason the strategy did not necessarily include within its parameters issues relating to disabled women is that disabled people were not involved in the designing of those parameters.  When we think about how to create policies that will suit disabled people and will be specifically flexible to encompass disability and all the different sorts of marginalisations people can experience, we need to think holistically.  We need to start involving those people in designing the policies, the research and the systems we use to address the problems and reflect the kind of diverse and rich lives disables people lead.  We have the experience, knowledge and expertise and we are happy to provide it if we are given appropriate supports to do so.</p></speech>

We need to go back a lot further to consider why disabled people, both women and men, do not see employment as a right for themselves.  We need to look at how a disabled child is given a label or diagnosis.  Whether or not we realise it, we all make assumptions.  Our expectations for children with disabilities as they grow into teenagers and adults are different from those for their non-disabled counterparts.  Fortunately, mainstream education is becoming more inclusive, but we still have a way to go.  This is something about which I feel very strongly.  We were getting there but there still is a way to go.  As members will know, within the special education system, which is a term I like, there is currently no career guidance available to disabled students.  I would argue that even in mainstream education, where people need bespoke information or services, teachers and other education professionals do not have adequate information or expertise to deal with specific issues students need to be addressed.</p> <p>  Difficulty in accessing education at third level is still a barrier for many people. This comes back to a lack of expectation in the first place and the lack of a flexible curriculum to accommodate diverse learning styles and abilities.  How then can employment even be accessible to many disabled women?  We know from the research and statistics that, generally for girls, there is a very low uptake of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects, and this is even more the case for disabled girls.  I work a lot with individual women and groups of women who want to challenge themselves and move into employment and meaningful careers of their choice.  It is all about raising expectations, providing information and supporting people to get where they want to go.</p> <p>  The other side of that is supporting employers.  We need to open a dialogue with them, answer their questions and help them to navigate the system and provide reasonable accommodations that will support disabled employees to be productive and to move up the employment ladder if they so wish.  If part-time employment or volunteering is what somebody wants, it should not be frowned upon.  We all have a right to contribute in whatever way we want in order to be our best selves.  Paid employment is something to which many people aspire.</p><p>However, if it is something that a person is unable to participate in for whatever reason despite wanting to, we need to think outside the box and adapt policies to accommodate that.</p></speech>

Ms Weldon has pointed out in the Teams chat that many disabled persons have a third level education yet cannot secure employment, which is an important observation.</p> <p>  As no other members are indicating, Ms Weldon wishes to contribute.  I also wish to invite Ms Phelan to contribute, after which I will ask any of the other witnesses who would like to make a final set of points to contribute.  I might ask them to focus particularly on recommendation No. 12 of the Citizens' Assembly, which was about lifelong care for persons with disabilities and stated that there should not be any break in the services provided, or any need to reapply for support, when a person turns 18 years of age.  What specific measures should we be recommending as a way of implementing this recommendation?  Interestingly, quite a number of the witnesses have focused on the other break point of 65 years and the sudden difference in measures when someone reaches that age.  That is a valuable point that we have taken on board.  Is there a practical response to recommendation No. 12?</p> <p>  I invite Ms Weldon, Ms Phelan and then any of the other witnesses who would like to make final observations on any of the points we have raised or anything they believe we should have considered but did not today.</p></speech>

We want support with the right to personal assistance services.  This goes for all disabled people, not just physically disabled ones.<br/><br/>I am not 65 years of age yet, but I will be, and when I turn 65, it will be like I am no longer disabled.  I will be an older person and I will only be able to fit into the older person's support services, which is ludicrous.  ILMI is continually advocating and we have a campaign for rights-based support services in the form of personal assistance.  We do not have that yet, with the current service being <i>ad hoc</i>and different in every county.  I have vast experience of supporting disabled people of all walks of life to secure personal support services that help them to live the normal rhythms of life.  It has taken up to three years to get agreement from the HSE to give some people those services.  That has involved hard work on developing their support plans but we have also needed to work with other agencies, for example, local and national politicians.  That is simply crazy.  If we had the right to personal assistance, many barriers would disappear.  We could do, we could live, we could be like a non-disabled person can.</p></speech>

If there is to be a universal basic income for an individual, surely work must be done on the means test for adaptation grants, particularly where there is a high level of need.</p> <p>  There is an anomaly.  I call it that because I do not believe that anyone set out to do this deliberately.  That person just did not think.  Modern families are not reflected in grant applications, particularly applications in respect of children whose parents are no longer married.  That status does not diminish the needs of the child, but it has a profound impact on the child's ability to stay with a parent if the house does not have a level access toilet, bathroom or something specific to the child's needs.</p> <p>  Ms Daly touched on the important matter of education.  Previously, this committee heard from those in education as well as education providers that there appeared to be a pigeonholing of women and girls in terms of the availability of subjects, even at secondary level.  Are we saying that women with disabilities are further disenfranchised from third level or meaningful employment if they cannot access even the low level of education options that other women can?  We are at real risk of creating an unequal education system for people with disabilities if this issue is not addressed.</p> <p>  My final point is for Ms Phelan.  Reference was made to assistive technology.  Good work was done on adapting homes with integrated assistive technology, for example, a wheelchair user being able to use a control panel to open windows behind counters.  How much more of that has Ms Phelan seen?  How prevalent are such houses?  I can think of two in the entire country.</p></speech>

I am sure that the others will have something to say on this matter as well.  The transition point is not just at 18 years of age.  People can get disability allowance at 16 and, if they manage to attend further or higher education, there is another transition point at the end of that process.  A classic issue that arises is of someone having a personal assistant to support him or her throughout university but, at exactly the time he or she needs the personal assistant for support in applying for employment, the person loses the assistance because its funding is attached to the education of which he or she had been in receipt.  The person goes back to being on his or her own without the personal assistant's support.  This often has to do with funding lines, consistency across Departments and where the breaks occur.</p> <p>  Another issue that arises where transition points occur or qualifications are received is that of the Department of Social Protection writing out to people checking to see whether they still have disabilities.  People can make very dark responses to that.  For example, they might say, "My limb has not grown back in the interim but thank you very much for checking."</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy regarding housing and means testing.  A key point that we would make, particularly now that we have the cost of disability report - we already knew, but it is there in black and white now - is that the means test does not in any way factor in the extra cost of disability.  It should be included in the thresholds.  The maximum allocation has not been increased in more than ten years.  This week, the Department announced a review of the adaptation grants.  Many of our organisations will be submitting strong consultations making recommendations in that regard.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on modern families.  We sometimes hear from separated parents.  Often, the father has a disabled child staying with him on weekends and is struggling to find a housing situation that is suitable for the child because the mother, being the child's primary carer, has managed to stay in the home where there is already a system in place.  There is not much support for the other parent.</p> <p>  The number of smart homes is increasing, but there are not many examples.  The new housing strategy for disabled people is starting to be rolled out.  As assistive technology reduces in cost, there will be many opportunities.  It is also a question of having an approach of building universally designed homes in general.</p> <p>  I will make a few points about the issue of poverty, given that we are wrapping up.</p><p>We rank among the worst countries in the European Union for the poverty of disabled people.  We are ranked among Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Bulgaria - with no disrespect to those countries.  As a rich European country that ranks mid- to high-table on many social indicator tables at EU level, it is distinctly shocking.  The roadmap for social inclusion includes the only specific poverty reduction targets that we have for disabled people.  We are aiming to lower poverty rates for disabled people by 2030 to rates that are higher than our current levels for the general population.  While it is extremely problematic to have an unequal set of goals, they are the only goals we have and we use them to argue to the Department.  While we have those goals, there are no actions in the roadmap that indicate how we will get there.  We will absolutely not get there by the Government giving &euro;5 every year or second year.  It is just not going to get us there.  There is also very important work by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that records and estimates the public service cost of poverty.  The idea is that it is too costly to give people a decent income and yet we are not factoring in all the other systemic costs that poverty creates around health, our justice system, and all sorts of other costs that are there.</p><p> We have seen how our citizens' assemblies in this country have often been ahead of the system.  The citizens have deliberated and made recommendations, while the system does not seem to be ready to be there with them.  There is one source of hope for all of us.  As Deputy Clarke said, the public is willing to pay extra to move towards a fairer system.  The question is why the system is unwilling.</p><p> On the question as to why the system is unwilling, I mentioned the issue of incentivisation earlier.  I find it concerning that in some discussions with the Department of Social Protection on a set of policy spaces, some officials have asked whether it is the job of the Department to provide an income above poverty level to individuals.  We argue emphatically that it absolutely is.  It is concerning to hear that response.  We have to look at how on earth we move towards that goal.</p><p> I refer to two pieces of research that are relevant.  We have not mentioned how there is a disability pay gap for disabled women in the workforce.  The disability pay gap is higher for women than it is for men; surprise, surprise.  That is another issue that needs to be considered.  There is also an important piece of research by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, from last year that looks at children in poverty.  It highlights the fact that children of disabled parents are substantially more likely to live in poverty and are more likely to live with difficult health conditions.  This is particularly the case if the mother has a disability.  It is an area that requires a lot of attention.</p><p> To conclude on a slightly broader point, I attended the National Economic Dialogue as part of my work on Monday this week and, yesterday, I took the train to Balbriggan to attend the Social Inclusion Forum.  The forum is run by the Department of Social Protection and the National Economic Dialogue is run by the Department of Finance.  I was struck by the gender make-up of the attendees at both events.  It may not surprise committee members that at the National Economic Dialogue - it is a guesstimate - there was a 70% male participation and 30% female participation.  At the Social Inclusion Forum, the balance was reversed.  This was very striking.  At the National Economic Dialogue, the Department of Social Protection ran a workshop, which many of us attended, and it was very focused on labour force participation.  There is an increasing focus from the Department to bring disabled people back into the employment market.  As we are at full employment levels, there is now an interest in those groups.  However, the word "poverty" was not discussed in the workshop until many of us showed up and raised it.</p><p> The broader point is the question around gendered understandings of who speaks in which spaces and in which areas of expertise.  It was very striking to see the gender balance being primarily male in the economic space and primarily female in the social inclusion space.  The question I put to the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, in our discussions at the Social Inclusion Forum yesterday was how we bring those two spaces together, because there are separate conversations on economics in one room and social inclusion in another and yet our economy should run to support our society, including all our disabled citizens.</p></speech>

As the Chair will know, I was at the Committee of Public Accounts this morning.  I have an observation to make on what Ms Phelan said about the two different rooms and the economy and social inclusion divide.  I want to back up that point.  I worked as a Government adviser for nearly ten years.  Much of this was on the social side involving the Department with responsibility for children, the Department of Justice, and the State.  On the economic side, it involved the Department with responsibility for housing, where decisions are made that have huge commercial effects and are broadly financial decisions.  The same gender divide that Ms Phelan mentioned was replicated in that context.  For example, I recall meetings on the establishment of the Land Development Agency, which is a huge multibillion euro project that is capable of providing significant financing.  There were 25 to 30 representatives around the table and I recall being the only woman who spoke at those meetings.  It stood out to me, having spent so much time on the social side of Government.  It is about bringing it together and even calling out the fact that the rooms look are different.  I do not know if everyone else is observing this.  It is important that the people who make up the 70% on the economic side recognise that there is something wrong with the look of their room.  I wanted to amplify the point that was made because it is an issue that cuts across the work we are doing more generally.</p></speech>

It is not a particularly difficult issue to understand.  The economists are serving GDP.  The social inclusion people are focused on people.  The fact is that if we decide that economics is all about GDP, it will never service people, the citizens of our State, and because we have decided that is the way it is, we will never bridge that divide.  It probably says something nice about our gender that we are not the ones dominating in the economic room.</p> <p>  This is also reflected in our housing strategy, where housing is seen as an asset and a commodity as opposed to a vital public service.  We have seen that dichotomy throughout the history of the State.  I want to point out that because of this decision, Ms Hassett and I are part of a generation that is locked out of the housing market.  No amount of education will compensate for that.  Finding rental properties that accepts a housing adaption grant is kind of impossible.  This has also been made significantly difficult by the fact that the first Fine Gael-led coalition decided to row back on housing accessibility standards in a big way.  Obviously, that was during a financial crash but it has made housing less accessible than it was when we were building crap houses during the boom.  Again, it was an excellent economic decision that serviced GDP, as opposed to the people of this island.</p> <p>  We talked a little bit about transitions and I will finish on this point.  The transition is not just to 18 years of age.  The fact is that we decide to transition children out of systems with a valid onward trajectory after their education, such as at three years of age, when we decide to send them to segregated preschools; at five years of age, when we decide to send them to segregated schools; at 12 years of age, when secondary school fails; or at 15 years of age, when the leaving certificate is seen to be too much for disabled people.</p><p> The fact is that the transition at 18 is just about the continuation of services.  If there is not a valid pathway, however, because we have already decided that disabled kids do not deserve to be on one, then it really is not all that relevant anymore.  We need that transition of services, but we must ensure that we have not put disabled people on the wrong path long before that stage.  The reason we are all talking about what happens at the age of 65, and I point out that Ms Hassett is in her mid-20s, at best, and I am in my 30s, is because we talk about nursing homes and what is going to happen to us when we are old at a shocking rate and have done so forever.  Does the committee know why?  It is because we see what is happening to our disabled elders, who have fought their entire lives to stay out of institutions and who have then been thrown into nursing homes.  Think about that.  People have spent their entire lives fighting not to be put in an institution, only to be then told that they are no longer disabled and put into a nursing home.</p><p> Of course we are freaking out about the transition at that age.  It has been basically threatening us.  Even though we have a pandemic that effectively eradicated a large portion of the people living in nursing homes, this seems to be the preferable model of care for older people.  It is the preferred model because it is massively profitable.  This is the only reason why it is the case.  Nursing homes make fantastic money.  They actually cost the State and people more than it would to provide support for older and disabled people in their own homes.  We are still building nursing homes, however, and we have decided that they are the right approach, even though what has happened to people in nursing homes is disgusting.</p><p> Of course we are talking about what will happen when we reach the age of 65, because we are all terrified.  I am looking particularly in this context at younger human rights advocates who think that disability is never going to happen to them, even though it is only a step away.  It is a step off a kerb, a virus or just as far away as something like that happening in anyone's life.  The fact is that we are all going to end up in nursing homes with brunch options because they do not see it as a bad idea to put disabled or older people in nursing homes.  Until it is seen as a bad idea, and I will not use unparliamentary language, it will not be an issue.  Therefore, we are really going to focus on the age of 65.  Part of the reason the focus is on those aged 18 is because parents and disabled people shout loudly about this aspect.  Trust me, however, if the committee members were to talk to a large group of disabled people, they would discover that we are greatly freaked out about the age of 65.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.898" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Amy Hassett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022062300002#L00500"><p>I will try to tie together a few different points.  One little thing dawned on me.  I had forgotten the cost of disability report.  We all need to remember in respect of that collection of information, that we are still struggling to get the fine-grained, detailed data we need concerning gender minorities.  We have that report, but it does not contain a great deal on gender.  This is impairing us in terms of fully understanding the extent of these problems.  When we are talking about the data we have available, it is important to remember when we are going through this reporting procedure to the UNCRPD committee that we must think about how we collect data better.  This is going to be one of the things that will be extremely important in the years to come.  The question is how we can get the fine-grained, detailed data required, specifically relating to gender, and not just to women but also to other gender minorities.  We essentially have no data on these aspects now.  We are flying blind and as best we can, using accounts of experiences based on individual conversations and those kinds of things.</p> <p>  Regarding means testing, we talked about the means testing of housing adaptation grants.  Earlier, we also talked about means testing for disability allowances and other social protection measures.  The point I wish to reiterate in this respect is that removing means testing is a way of keeping people out of poverty.  Equally, though, we must bear in mind that even if people are not living in poverty, having to account for the cost of disability in their daily lives is impairing them from planning for their future and from putting systems in place in that regard.  Taking the example of middle-class people who are disabled, they will still find it more difficult to plan for their future and to invest in the things they wish to relative to a non-disabled person.  Therefore, when we talk about means testing, it is an important aspect right across society.  It is simply not fair that people who have disabilities incur more costs than people who do not.  Nobody should be living in poverty, but fundamentally as well nobody should have to cover the costs of their disabilities.  Everyone should be supported in society to enable them to have the ability to do so.</p> <p>  To come back to the Chair's question on how we can implement recommendation 12 in respect of transitioning through life stages and ensuring continuity of support, we have talked a lot about age and how ages represent major barriers in respect of the continuity of support.  Geographic location is another element in this regard.  The support services available to people depend to an incredible extent on where they live.  If people move from one region to another, it is a nightmare to try to re-establish all these supports.  I can tell the committee this because I am doing it right now and it has been taking about ten hours a week to try to get the systems in place.</p> <p>  Why is that the case?  How can we do something about it?  We must examine how we can overhaul the system and create one that is much more focused on the individual, that is, a system that is much more person-focused.  How do we ensure that support follows the person?  We talk about reasonable accommodations in employment.  We are having the same issues in that regard where the supports are tied to the workplace rather than to individuals.  We must explore how we can create systems that follow disabled people themselves, irrespective of where they move in the country and of what age they are.  If we can do that, if we can build those systems and involve disabled people and other marginalised groups in building them, then we will start to deal with these problems and we will start improving the situation.</p></speech>

Services needing to follow the person is a great line.  It sums up much of what we are saying.  I thank all the witnesses as well for the observations and comments they have made on the MS Teams chat function, which the secretariat officials are noting.  I call Ms Daly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.900" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eileen Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022062300002#L00700"><p>Following on from what Ms Hassett said, I agree that supports need to follow people throughout their life cycle.  I know many young people who desperately want and who have had the opportunity for employment, but many of them have been unable to take up such offers of employment because they do not have the right to a personal assistant, PA, to support them if they need that support.  Additionally, the major issue here is that employers do not understand the role of a PA in the workplace.  This is another issue on which there needs to be a great deal of education and awareness.</p> <p>  To finish, I will focus on access to healthcare and some of the actions that must happen in this regard.  Access to healthcare is a major challenge for many disabled women, particularly if they need the support of a PA and equipment to transfer from a wheelchair, for example, onto an examination table or something like that.  Therefore, the first point is that the environment is not physically accessible enough to meet the needs of many people, including mine.  Second, many healthcare professionals do not understand or have never been informed or educated about the role of a PA in healthcare settings.  Many people, and I have personal experience of this, do not want their families involved in their healthcare provision.</p><p>Those people have been living independently in the community with the support of their PAs for all their adult life and they want to continue that.  Many of us also want the support of family members and that should be a right.  However, if someone chooses not to have a family member's support, that should also be a right.  I feel strongly that we need to educate in universities such as the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, University College Dublin and everywhere that provides training.  I would be more than happy to be involved in programmes to do that.  This is urgent.  Many men and women are excluded from basic healthcare services.  They are terrified to access them.</p><p> Returning to a point made earlier, there is a lack of understanding around personal space and bodily integrity for many people.  People become ill.  Others invade one's space when one needs a specific service.  One's voice is forgotten.  One may be in a position where one is ill and at that moment unable to articulate what one wants and needs.  All these things need to be addressed.  Disabled people and their advocates need to be involved in the process.  We must be aware that it may not always be someone's wish for a support person to be a family member.  He or she might prefer someone independent.  It should be that person's choice and within his or her control.</p></speech>

Ms Daly, Ms Hassett and Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta and I live in a system that supports difference.  We have felt different.  We do not facilitate disabled people to live an ordinary, minimal life.  We are guardians, mothers, fathers and parents, and hold many other roles.  I am a disabled mother of an adult son but it is scary to think that the Irish support system would have the right to assess my parental capacity to look after my son.  That is ridiculous.  It is crazy that we have to endure that sort of systematic oppression.</p> <p>  It was mentioned earlier that the disability sector is very profitable.  There are many millions of euro involved.  The stark reality is that it employs mostly non-disabled people.  We need the DPOs, such as ILMI, Disabled Women Ireland and others, to be nourishing and available to be called upon when a disabled person needs an answer.  Unless we are talked to, nothing is going to change.</p></speech>

Ms Phelan said earlier that we could have a whole session on each of the recommendations of the citizens' assembly.  I am conscious that we have covered an extensive range of issues with our guests this morning.  We on the committee are grateful for our guests' time and for the fact they have shared their experiences, some of which were very personal.  They have shared their expertise and passion with us.  They have articulated powerfully the views, positions and experiences of many persons with disabilities in the context of the recommendations of the  citizens' assembly.  They have particularly focused on the gendered dimension of disability, which, of course, is our focus as the Joint Committee on Gender Equality.  We are conscious, as our guests have pointed out, of the intersectional nature of the work we are doing.</p> <p>  Our guests have also shared with us the richness and diversity of the lives of the disabled persons they represent.  They have articulated powerfully for the rights-based approach and for the principles of independence and self-determination.  They have also pointed out, critically and rightly, some of the areas in which the recommendations of the citizens' assembly require some adjustment, change or difference in language.  It has been incredibly valuable for us to hear from them today and to have the opportunity to develop our thinking and understanding of how we can best move to implement those important recommendations of the assembly.  I should that many assembly members follow our proceedings online and engage with us.  We are grateful to them and to all our guests.  </p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank Ms Fleachta Phelan from the Disability Federation of Ireland, Ms Amy Hassett and Ms Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta from Disabled Woman Ireland, and Ms Fiona Weldon and Ms Eileen Daly from ILMI.

The committee is meeting in public session to consider the Remediation of Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks Bill 2022.  We are joined by the following witnesses: Mica Action Group Donegal is represented by Mr. Michael Doherty, Dr. Andreas Leemann, Mr. Aidan Houton and Professor Paul Dunlop, who is joining us remotely; Clare Pyrite Action Group is represented by Dr. Martina Cleary and Dr. Michael Carmody; and Mayo Pyrite Action Group is represented by Ms Martina Hegarty and Ms Josephine Murphy.  We have received their opening statements and other submissions and I thank the witnesses for those.  They have been circulated to members.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  Witnesses attending in the committee room are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contribution to today's meetings.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The committee welcomes the opportunity to hear from the witnesses.  Our job as legislators is to ensure this Bill is fit for purpose and solves the terrible difficulties people have experienced with houses across more than the three counties represented here.</p> <p>  We are constrained by the fact that this is a two-hour session.  I ask witnesses to confine their opening statements to five minutes, after which we will move to the members.  There will be six minutes for each member to ask questions and for witnesses to answer.  I always ask members to keep questions direct and to the point to give witnesses the opportunity to respond because it is the witnesses we want to hear from.  If members agree to that, I think we will be able to fit everybody in.  We have the full membership present or represented and other members who have joined us may wish to contribute.  </p> <p>  We will hear first from he Donegal group, followed by the Clare group and then the Mayo group.  I ask Mr. Doherty to give his opening statement on behalf of the Mica Action Group Donegal.</p></speech>

We have around 7,000 affected homes.  These primarily arose during the Celtic tiger years.  Self-regulation of manufacturers, together with inadequate local authority enforcement of standards, allowed unfit concrete blocks to enter the Irish market for years.  The regulations that should have protected consumers did not do so and homeowners were unknowingly exposed to defective products destined to fail on the biggest and most significant purchases of their lives.</p> <p>  In desperation, we chased the quarry owners, insurance companies and those that provide bonds on our homes.  We chased the banks for help.  No one would help us.  No one was interested.  We had no option but to chase the State that allowed this disaster to unfold, albeit unknowingly &ndash; or was it?  In 2014, we made the State aware of the issue with evidence submitted to Donegal County Council.  Minutes have been provided.  It took until 2020 for a scheme to arrive.  A so-called 90-10 scheme would end up akin to a 60-40 scheme, costing the average homeowner more than &euro;100,000 for demolition and rebuild.  That was if you could afford to access the scheme in the first place.  That scheme was correctly rejected.</p> <p>  A massive campaign saw over 20,000 people arrive on the streets of Dublin on 15 June and 8 October 2021.  Our demand was 100% redress, no less.  As a result, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, set up a working group over the summer months.  It was meant to facilitate a solution but instead saw the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage defend its old 90-10 scheme.  No progress was made because it was thwarted and stymied by the attitude and actions of the Department.  We soon realised we were seen less as victims and more as chancers or opportunists looking to get something for nothing.  All we wanted were our homes back on a like-for-like basis, only what we had already paid for.</p> <p>  That was not an unreasonable request, especially when we look at the nearest precedent available, namely, the pyrite remediation scheme, mainly in Leinster.  These homeowners were provided with true like-for-like replacement, including house finishes, end-to-end contract management by the State and zero cost to the homeowner.  Instead, we are offered a grant to fix our homes, leaving us to find contractors who will work to the grants provided, which are wholly inadequate.  The inflationary world we live in is all at the homeowner&rsquo;s exposure, none of it at the State&rsquo;s.</p> <p>  To further frustrate the process, the Department has red tape to the nth degree as regards terms and conditions and caps and exclusions which leave this scheme unworkable.  Members will hear them tell us that the rates are independent and fair, as they came through the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI.  The reality is that the SCSI was dictated to under the terms of reference, which create a significant difference between eligible costs and true costs.  This inhibits any chance of 100% redress.  Examples are 15-year-old standards leaving us to make up the differences and not even a carpet allowed for in the home by way of finish; no allowance for the replacement of foundations which are made of the same deleterious materials as are in the defective blocks; and no allowance for other defective block structures like walls and garages, all equally capable of killing members of our family as they subside and fall over time.  Real costs versus allowable costs at current rates represent more like an 80% grant.</p><p>This leaves homeowners out tens of thousands of euros - a shortfall we simply cannot afford. </p><p> To compensate, homeowners requested a penalty-free downsizing option that would allow the grant based on their current home size to be redirected to building themselves a smaller home for the money.  Instead, Government saw fit to hold back on the grant amount it was prepared to give and instead provide a grant against the smaller home, leaving the homeowner with the same problem and still out tens of thousands of euros, still trapped and unable to afford to rebuild.</p><p> The committee will hear of science today, or the lack of it, in the assessment and categorisation of our homes.  The IS 465 protocol has not allowed for the inclusion of other pertinent deleterious materials such as pyrrhotite.  It has not allowed for the testing of foundations that our experts will show is playing with fire and will ultimately cost the State more in the long run.  </p><p> We have excluded homes.  Many of our rental homes are not eligible.  Small buy-to-let landlords cannot afford to replace these homes and their tenants have nowhere to go.  Holiday and retirement homes, some inherited homes and homes occupied by vulnerable adults that are not classed as principal private residences are excluded from the scheme as it stands.  These are equally innocent victims of unfit products entering the market for years.  While they are not demanding they get pushed in front of others, they are rightly demanding that they are not excluded from the scheme.  Prioritisation, yes; exclusion, no.</p><p> We have identified 35 different issues in the general scheme, all of which to a greater or lesser extent render the scheme unworkable.  These are tabled in the submission.  Many of these were heavily debated and negotiated over the past six months between homeowner representatives and officials.  The negotiation was undertaken in good faith on the part of the homeowners and progress appeared to be made.  However, the Department continues to attempt to exert what can only be described as coercive control over the homeowners as opposed to seeking a solution-based approach.  Families are stressed to breaking point.  They have endured years of uncertainty and anxiety of every possible description.  The scheme should be a way out of this nightmare.  Instead, its inflexible, cynical, illogical and blinkered approach is burdening homeowners with yet more stress.  Where is the empathy from the State?  Why would the State not allow homeowners to downsize without penalty when it comes at no additional cost?  This is not 100% redress, despite what the State might claim.  Homeowners will be out tens of thousands of euros with some cases amounting to six-figure sums.  The caps are discriminatory and must be adjusted to take into account our current environment if not completely eliminated.</p><p> Ignoring the science is a cheap sticking-plaster solution that will drive homeowners through this nightmare not once but twice in their lifetime.  Innocent victims are abandoned under current exclusions and our demand is that ultimately no homeowner with a property including defective concrete blocks, DCB, should be left behind and we want that in writing.  We implore the committee to study the submissions and after today&rsquo;s scrutiny, forward recommendations to the Minister that address these key issues.  After ten years of heartache, allow us a path to restore our lives, a path to true 100% redress and no less.</p></speech>

My apologies for the late and altered opening statement.  After two years of arduous campaigning for inclusion in this scheme and only two working days to prepare for the meeting on behalf of County Clare, the committee may understand it was difficult to decide exactly what to say in five minutes.</p> <p>  I am an ordinary homeowner put in an extraordinary situation.  On 10 August 2020, I stood outside my modest bungalow in County Clare and listened to an engineer explain that there were suspected defective concrete blocks in my home.  It could be pyrite or mica and only core testing would tell.  The problem was serious and degenerative, and could not be repaired.  It was a serious structural defect that would only worsen over time and no assistance was available to me in County Clare.  Assistance was only available to homeowners in counties Mayo and Donegal.  It is impossible to fully explain the impact of getting this news to somebody who has not been on this journey.  It hits you in the gut.  It is a sickening, prolonged and toxic anxiety.  It involves sleepless nights and lying awake wondering how long you have and how much time before your home becomes dangerous.  The fear of your own home grows and becomes an almost obsessional routine of checking for evolving damage.  Your life changes as you become alienated from what used to be normal reality and the shadow of this is always present, disrupting your whole life, your family life and your community.</p> <p>  I will tell the eminent members of the committee that this problem my not yet be in their counties but it is coming.  We currently know of defective concrete blocks, or suspicions of same, in 12 counties along the western and eastern seaboards.  It is likely a problem in every county.  The decisions the committee comes to and the recommendations it makes will be instrumental in influencing how this crisis plays out among members' constituents, neighbours, friends and family.  They may have defective concrete blocks in their homes and do not realise it.  Do not let the situation play out elsewhere as it did in Donegal and Mayo.</p> <p>  Once I recovered from the initial shock of the discovery, next came the questions.  How could this happen?  How could the most fundamental, taken for granted, mundane thing, that is, a humble concrete block, be crumbling inside the walls of my house?  A concrete block should last for 100 years.  If we are to look at our built environment, houses are intact that were built decades ago.  As an academic and researcher, my default mode is to investigate and to find answers, if there are any.  Somebody had to be responsible; something had to be done; something had gone wrong somewhere.  That engineer admitted he had visited at least 40 to 50 houses with the same problem in the Clare-Limerick area.  However, beyond that he would say no more due to what he termed a conflict of interest.  This was my first but not my last encounter with what I describe as avoidance of the elephant in the room.  I was to encounter many such moments in the months that followed and due to the scale and influence of our main supplier in County Clare, CRH Roadstone, I would encounter several such conflicts of interest.</p> <p>  On 4 September 2020, I founded the Clare Pyrite Action Group with a membership of one.  I was inspired by what I learned of the action groups in Mayo and Donegal.  When you find yourself in this situation, you quickly realise that the ordinary homeowner has nowhere else to go.  In the first month, I tried to find help and advice from the local authority, the pyrite remediation board, local solicitors and local Deputies.  I even wrote to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I was passed from one office to the next and from one dead end to another.  The resounding response was that there is no pyrite in County Clare and no help was available.  I was alone.</p> <p>  However, within two months of setting up Clare Pyrite Action Group, I had been approached by 25 similarly impacted homeowners.  Within six months, that number had doubled.  Today, because of the research I have conducted on the ground among our membership, I am aware of 1,025 private homes with confirmed or suspected issues.  The homes impacted include homes on 17 private housing estates, five local authority housing estates and 11 public and private dwellings.  This is only the beginning.  There is most definitely pyrite in the concrete blocks of County Clare.</p> <p>  On 14 June 2022, the Government finally admitted that was the case and Clare was allowed access to the DCB grant scheme.  It was a milestone achievement for every person who has worked hard to secure this admission over the past two years.  It is a moment to acknowledge this accomplishment after the arduous and extraordinarily difficult process through which we have been put.  We have followed carefully all of the things that are happening and the response of the people in Mayo and Donegal to the issue and we are worried.  We had to watch from the sidelines because we were excluded from the working group negotiations and had no input to the terms and conditions of this new scheme.  Clare met the IS 465 qualification in July 2021 in the submission to the Department.  We met fully and rigorously the criteria that had qualified 150 homes in Mayo for the scheme.  I can only speculate, and forgive me if I am wrong, that this was a strategic and deliberate delaying strategy to ensure the interim conditions and new qualification criteria would be introduced to limit and prevent as many of us as possible from entering the scheme.  I point in that regard to the damage threshold, which is of particular concern to us.</p> <p>  The statements of the eminently qualified witnesses who will contribute to the follow-on panels this afternoon arrived around midnight last night.  As I read their biographies, I could not help but reflect on the extraordinary situation we are in today.  We, the ordinary homeowners, are facing the full power of the State, all of its resources and its ability to secure the most qualified and professional voices from the most established and respected bodies in the country.  They are all working on behalf of the State to ensure its position will be unquestionable and upheld.  It is impossible not to feel that we, the homeowners who are the victims, are on trial, and for what?  For daring to expect more?  For daring to demand more?  For expecting that the homes we have worked hard to pay for and continue to pay for should stay standing around us?</p><p>We expected oversight of regulation to ensure that the blocks used to build our homes would be sound and enforced.  We have been let down on so many levels, particularly by the State, which continues to fail in its duty to do right by its citizens, the ordinary workers and taxpayers of this country who are impacted by this issue.  That is us; the people sitting before the committee today.</p><p> I received a text message recently from an engineer who had been there on the first day-----</p></speech>

Of particular importance to us, in County Clare, are four issues.  First, is the damage threshold, which we feel has been introduced to be deliberately prohibitive.  From the testing done on buildings, we know that it is only at the core testing stage that the science proves that even though the render may look fine, the blocks underneath are crumbling and rotting.  I have included some visual examples of that in my submission to the committee.  We are also worried about homeowner access to independent assessment and testing, which is crucial in determining the true gravity of the situation for homeowners.  There is a conflict of interest right across the system, from engineers to testing companies and other professionals.  We have encountered several difficulties along the way in ensuring there is an independence of testing regime.  We are also concerned about the remediation options for pyrite and reactive sulphate damage.  There is a sulphate attack in County Clare.  The option there is demolition.  That is what the experts are saying.  We cannot continue to retain pyrite blocks in the buildings.</p></speech>

I am joined today by Ms Josephine Murphy, who is also impacted by the issue; and online by Mr. Thomas Campbell, a chartered engineer who has been supporting homeowners in counties Mayo and Donegal through this nightmare.  We are here today because we must provide the opportunity to the people of County Mayo to finally move forward with their lives and rebuild their homes.  We want to feel happy in our homes again.  We want the scheme up and running.  Over the next three weeks the Oireachtas will play a key role in deciding our future.  We need its support in ensuring the Bill is not passed until it is fit for purpose and provides all supports necessary to homeowners to rebuild their homes.  Today we welcome the opportunity to address the fundamental flaws that exist within the legislation and the scheme in general on behalf of the people of County Mayo.</p> <p>  As homeowners, we are acutely aware of the damage that is in our homes.  There is no escape from the daily mental stress of monitoring the expansion of cracks, the appearance of new cracks and the constant worry about how we are going to be able to afford to rebuild our homes.  We are extremely concerned about what lies underneath our homes.  Many homeowners are reporting cracking floors and jamming doors, which indicate either issues with the foundations or possible pyrite heave, similar to that experienced by homeowners in Dublin.  Many homeowners in County Mayo are very nervous about the introduction of a damage threshold.  While we accept that every home entering the scheme must have damage, it is unacceptable to block homeowners from entering the scheme by introducing a damage threshold.  It creates another layer of stress, as well as additional paperwork and fees, for homeowners, some of whom have been waiting up to ten years for the delivery of an effective scheme.  As homeowners, we know what is needed to rebuild our homes.  Over the last two years the committee has listened to our demands for 100% redress.  It is not a sound bite.  It is what it will take to rebuild our homes.  A total of six homes have been rebuilt in County Mayo to date.  We welcome the fact that those homeowners will benefit from any changes to the scheme.  However, those who had no choice but to remediate before the scheme commenced have been left behind.</p> <p>  On 3 March this year, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, published rates that were supposed to reflect the true cost of our rebuilds, but the resulting figures were tarnished due to restrictive terms and conditions set out by the Government.  The terms of reference dictated four estate-type homes and four rural-type homes, each increasing in size.  The SCSI was asked to generate figures based on 2007 building regulations.  The cost to employ an engineer to generate all of the paperwork necessary rebuild our homes - of up to &euro;15,000 - was requested to be ignored.  Smaller homes cannot carry the weight of these costs on a square foot rate.  Boundary walls, which are a threat to the health and safety of our children, were excluded.  There are others limitations which I have included in the briefing document.  The SCSI is not at fault here.  It completed the task with one hand tied behind its back.  Since the publication of the rates, we have seen inflation rise to more than 9%, but the square foot rate of &euro;161 on offer by the Government today will not rebuild my home.  My home will be one of the smallest to enter the scheme.  However, based on high-level quotes received to date, I may be up to &euro;50,000 short of the cost to rebuild my home.  We were promised that the scheme would be like for like, but no money is on offer to replace the finishes I have in my home.  I have worked hard to make my house a home.  It is not a like-for-like scheme.  It is disingenuous to suggest that it is, just as it is false to inform the general public that we are receiving 100% redress.</p> <p>  As homeowners, we are being restricted by not one but two caps.  The current upper grant cap is &euro;420,000.  Removing the allowance for rent, storage, and possible emergency costs, we are left with &euro;395,000.  The cap forces 33% of our homeowners into even more debt.  It leaves them unable to send their children to college or unable to rebuild a granny flat for their parents.  Homeowners will not be able to draw down a top-up or second mortgage as their homes are currently worthless, while many are still repaying their first mortgage.  We proposed a workable solution, namely, allowing homeowners to downsize their home but receive the cost of their current footprint.  Unfortunately, it was rejected by the Government.  It is the only solution that provides a true pathway for homeowners to receive 100% redress.  There are multiple benefits to the homeowner and the State in this approach.  It enables the elderly, those planning for retirement and vulnerable adults who are living in the counties with the lowest disposable income in the country to rebuild their homes.</p> <p>  Our request to the committee today is to enable us to get on with it.  We ask that we are provided with what we need to rebuild our homes.  As homeowners, we have been placed in one of the most stressful situations of our lives.  We want to escape this mental anguish.  We did not create the issue, yet we are being asked to pay for it.  Over the last ten years we have been actively campaigning for the scheme.  We are not in this alone.  There are now 12 other counties with us.  This is a second attempt to deliver a workable scheme.  We are not asking for compensation.  We are not asking for anything extra but to be able to rebuild our homes.  We need to get it right this time.</p></speech>

There are many other Members of the Oireachtas present today who are not members of the committee, so I ask Deputies and Senators to keep to the strict time limit of six minutes.

From a County Clare perspective, it has been very frustrating.  Whereas people from  counties Donegal and Mayo have had more than two years of at least informal negotiation with the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage and officials, the first negotiation with residents of County Clare took place on Monday of last week.  Earlier, Dr. Martina Cleary was restricted to a time limit of six minutes in delivering her opening statement.  I respect the fact that there are time constraints at committee meetings, but it is wrong for the issue to be condensed into six minutes, given the extent of the problem County Clare and length of the campaign to get here, which has been a two-year journey.  Cracks and crumbling blocks are just a physical manifestation of the problem.  The damage that has been done to the county and to the mental health of many homeowners is extensive.  My colleagues and I can account for the fact that the health of homeowners has deteriorated significantly over the past year and a half, as they have faced the unknown.</p> <p>  I will get straight to the questions.  I.S. 465:2018 is the benchmark test for getting one onto a redress scheme.  Over the past 12 months in County Clare we have seen that there are flaws within the testing model itself.  Five samples that Dr. Clearly, Mr. Simon Beale and I believed to confirm the presence of pyrite were sent off to a laboratory in England.  Weeks later the result came back stating that there was insufficient proof.  It struck me that samples were being taken from walls on the good side of a house.</p><p>To use a medical analogy, it was akin to checking a patient for a suspected brain tumour but taking a tissue sample from the big toe.  They were taking the sample from the opposite end, not getting the crumbling bag of dust that they wanted and they said there was no pyrite present.  Are the witnesses worried that if we stick with the current IS 465 testing of core samples, we will end up with more houses not getting near the damage threshold or any entry threshold whatever?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.927" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Martina Cleary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062300002#D00200"><p>To correct the Deputy, the results that came back met the IS 465 criteria with exactly the same measurements, analysis and rigour that had already qualified Mayo with at least 150 houses.  We specifically chose our consultant engineer because he was one of the most experienced in the country.  We chose Petrolab as one of the most independent labs available.  They came back and everybody was puzzled as to why the Department asked for additional criteria and testing.  It stated very clearly that the analysis regime had already been met.</p> <p>  What we worry about is that they were changing the regime.  With Clare County Council they made us go through extraordinary measures to find this causative link between pyrite in the block, oxidation and damage, which was producing gypsum and secondary minerals like thaumasite, a sulphate attack that is far more problematic.  I am sure Dr. Andreas Leemann will be able to speak about that as well.  It is not just pyrite we have but a secondary sulphate attack.  Sulphate levels in the blocks in County Clare are far above regulation standards.</p> <p>  They are changing the IS 465 standards behind the scenes but what we are primarily worried about is what is worded from the working group, which is that the minimum damage is now 1.5 mm for group 2 listings.  There is already an assessment regime in place and it has been working perfectly well, supervised by IS 465 engineers.  They are prepared to sign off on that.  However, the new group 2 is very different.  The original group comprised cracking on one elevation.  We often see that with the damage we see in Clare.  Not all the cracks are 1.5 mm across.  However, getting to the core testing stage we have numerous examples.  The block under the render would be in a critical state of collapse; it is dust and rubble and it is critically dangerous.</p> <p>  We are very worried about the visual inspection only, which denies homeowners access to that level of core testing because it will not be available.  We speculate as to whether that would even be independent.  It was absolutely essential that we had independent engineers because we were worried about the results being compromised otherwise.  We have several examples of that because of the scope of our supplier.</p></speech>

It only happened in spring this year.  It seems to be a different beast to the IS 465 testing of homeowners in Donegal and Mayo, and that point must be noted as the structure of this is put together.</p> <p>  I will probe further on the damage threshold of a 1.5 mm crack.  On the one hand we can believe it is preparing a hierarchy for some homes to enter the redress scheme more quickly than others.  Is there a fear that it will exclude some homes and the local authority, Clare County Council, will come back to some homeowners who may have painted or plastered a crack, or it just cannot be seen, and say there will not be redress for them?</p></speech>

We did not have a grant and some engineers - some IS 465 and some not - were telling Clare homeowners to cover the cracks, rake them out, fill them in or keep paint on them.  There were a variety of different solutions to keep water ingress or rain out.  We had no other option to try to preserve our homes.  There was no grant so we were left in rotting homes trying to mend them and fix them.</p> <p>  If this is a visual inspection only, somebody may say there is no cracking visible.  There are examples in the report I provided of homeowners and Clare County Council testing of the absolute danger these people are living with beneath a cosmetic sheen of plastic paint.  There is really only a cosmetic fix and there must be core testing because it is the only way we can truly see what is underneath the render.</p></speech>

I will focus my questions on the Mayo witnesses.  I know Ms Murphy has been dealing with this for a long time and during the course of her answers she might tell us how long it has been exactly.  Ms Hegarty has been dealing with it for the past number of years as well.</p> <p>  I have three questions.  I know our main aim is to have the scheme fit for purpose and nobody is locked out because he or she cannot afford to get into it.  With regard to retrospective flexibility, I am aware one homeowner in Mayo had to replace her home because her engineer told her she was in danger of a catastrophic event.  She had absolutely no option.  Why do the witnesses think it important that there is a retrospective element, albeit very limited, to the scheme?</p> <p>  What does option 1 mean to the witnesses and how do they know other options are not acceptable?  Ms Hegarty stated the only solution for pyrite impact is total demolition, including foundations.  Why are homeowners in Mayo deeply concerned about the introduction of the damage threshold?  That builds on what Ms Hegarty has already said.</p></speech>

We have struggled long and hard in campaigning to have the foundations covered, and that is very important.  With foundations it is important to look at IS 465:2018+A1:2020, particularly annexe D, which relates to remedial works.  Table D1 on page 39 applies to Donegal only, where option 1 is to demolish an entire dwelling to foundation level and rebuild.  Table D1 on page 40 applies to Mayo only and option 1 is to demolish an entire dwelling and rebuild, and the foundations are not included.  Nevertheless, Mayo County Council have it in their overview under costs not covered.  That is bullet point No. 4, which states that foundations are not covered and homeowners must fix them.</p> <p>  With regard to the IS 465 document, the expert panel on concrete blocks issued clarification notes in respect of option 1 in annexe F, stating the panel was not informed during the investigations of any failures of concrete foundations due to aggregates containing deleterious material in the concrete in foundations in Donegal or Mayo.  That is true and it is an accurate statement.  In 2016, nobody had undertaken exploratory works to determine whether foundations needed remediation.  However, the concrete for the foundations would have been, more than likely, sourced from the same block supplier and it is imperative to prevent costs to the homeowner for any further need towards rectification.  These should be remediated.</p></speech>

That homeowner had no choice, spending approximately &euro;185,000 to get the home replaced.  The homeowner was in a life-or-death position and could not live in the home as it was.  There are people like that throughout Mayo, potentially in Clare and definitely in Donegal that have been left behind in such a scenario.</p> <p>  Ms Murphy spoke about foundations.  With pyrite the position is clear-cut and it is in the blocks everywhere.  It does not matter where the walls are in a home and nobody will insure that house unless every item of pyrite has been removed.  Mr. Aidan O'Connell was part of the committee that created IS 465 and he mentioned that.  There is no option but to totally demolish the home to remove the pyrite.</p> <p>  The damage threshold issue was adequately put by Dr. Cleary.  It is the exact same in Mayo.  We have questions coming back to homeowners in Mayo about why they are not sending in pictures of internal cracking when there are plasterboards on the wall.  A decision will be made on homes based on a desk study and such studies contain photographs that are most likely grainy.</p><p>It makes no sense to start a process of trying to decide whether somebody's home can be fixed, based on a photograph or a piece of paper.</p></speech>

I welcome all of the witnesses.  I will direct my questions to Dr. Cleary of the Clare Pyrite Action Group.  I pay tribute to her and her committee for the strong determined work they have done on behalf of homeowners in County Clare and, indeed, I will mention Clare County Council, Ms Anne Haugh and her team and the engineer, Mr. Simon Beale.  It has been a long hard road.  The fact that the Clare Pyrite Action Group has been locked out of informal discussions is disappointing.  There is a different view to this because of the different dynamics in Clare and the impact of pyrite on houses.  For those reasons, the damage threshold is an issue for pyrite homes.  Dr. Cleary has elaborated a bit on that, but I will give her an opportunity to elaborate further.  Will she elaborate further on the deep issues?  Evidently, a visual inspection will not be enough.  The core testing that was done on various homes in Clare proved, without any shadow of a doubt, that the homes had pyrite; that it was very damaging and that the integrity of the block was crumbling, even more so than if it was a mica home.  Will Dr. Cleary explain that to us?</p></speech>

However, in some instances, because the homeowner is maintaining the render, one does not always see it.  The are four categories in the groupings in IS 465 as they exist up to this point in terms of the damage threshold assessment.  It is perfectly functioning.  It is ratified by IS 465 and Engineers Ireland stand behind it.  Category 2 of that is only web-like cracking on one side.  Many people will not meet this new 1.5 mm threshold.  What one is doing is leaving people trapped in these groups that might look fine visually, but are structurally unsound and very dangerous.</p> <p>  A second thing which is manifesting in all houses, no matter which stage they are at and about which we are very worried, is black mould.  Black mould ingress is coming in to the inner leaf.  I have brought an expert with us, Dr. Michael Carmody, to whom I will defer, if I am allowed.</p></speech>

Cracks appeared in the block in approximately 1997.  A few years later, this progressed to mould contamination, the most concerning of which is black mould.  I am representing evidence of health defects on family members.  We have had worsening cases of underlying asthma, rhinitis and fatigue.  These symptoms will only occur in my brothers when they are staying in the home.  I am also speaking today as a medical doctor to convey the health risks associated with black mould, which is affecting the interior of defective-block-affected homes at all levels of degradation.</p> <p>  Mould hitchhikes its way into a home.  A black mould requires a continuous water supply to sustain it.  It is contaminating the structural materials, which will need to be removed.  Black mould is mould that produces mycotoxins.  Mycotoxins are compounds that can be inhaled, ingested or transmitted via the skin and are small enough to penetrate human cell membranes and cross the human placenta and blood-brain barrier.  They can inhibit protein synthesis and disrupt immune function.  These actions are associated with disease causation, as well as exacerbation of existing disease.</p> <p>  Evidence can be supplied, as needed, for the associations that are shown in scientific literature between black mould and illness.  Strong associations exist between exposure and the worsening of lung conditions such as asthma, which affects one in 13 people in Ireland, the causation of asthma and the higher medical risk to the immunocompromised person.  Black mould is reported to impact or cause decline in cognitive function, a worsening of autoimmune conditions, mental health conditions, chronic fatigue and cancer.  Some people are more genetically prone to the more severe mycotoxin-associated illnesses.  The severity of illness is associated with duration of exposure.</p> <p>  Treatment of mycotoxin-induced illness often requires medication, including steroids and other immunosuppressants, which carry their own risks.  N95 masks are recommended at an industrial level for workers exposed to mould.  The Health and Safety Authority, the European Union, the World Health Organization and the Centres for Disease Control give a guidance on mould and black-mould contamination, to include some of the associated health risks.  This is the same black mould that is present in buildings with defective blocks.</p></speech>

That will be removed in the new Bill.  It has been proffered as the cheaper option that will take away the &euro;7,000 bill which was prohibitive to owners.  That should never have been prohibitive in the first place.  It should have been provided in a timely manner and up front.  We need a variety of things in this country.  We need independent laboratories.  It is absolutely unthinkable that tests have to be sent abroad, because we believe that the laboratories in this country are somehow compromised in terms of the autonomy of the results coming back.  There needs to be more independent research done as well.</p> <p>  The short answer is that we need to retain some kind of core-testing mechanism where the homeowners have the right to appoint their own engineer who will work on their behalf and has access to the results.  That has been essential for us.  If we did not have that, as I know Limerick did not, we would have no ground on which to stand to see what is happening and understand and interpret it.  If one puts that completely into the housing authority's hands, one is putting all of the control of diagnosis of a house and remediation options completely at the discretion of the Government.</p></speech>

My colleague in Dublin, Senator Boyhan, and I are together in this.  I am a building contractor and a blocklayer.  I understand everything the witnesses are saying, but I will tell them why the core testing has to go ahead.  The Government is now pushing a retrofit grant that is going out throughout the country.  The grant is to insulate one's house.  If one insulates a house with pyrite, it accelerates what is happening.  We had 30 people here yesterday from Limerick who have pyrite in their houses and have formed a group.  I get two or three phone calls per week from people, because I am a building contractor, to ask me to come to look at their houses and see what are the criteria.</p> <p>  When this first happened, people rang us and asked what they would do.  I said to people to seal it up, until somebody got to them, because we did not know what was coming.  We did not know what grant aid would be available to people and we told them to seal up the cracks to stop the water getting in, because of the pyrite issue.  What has been proven in terms of people who had poor insulation in their houses, such as those houses built in the 1980s which would only have had 40 mm white insulation, is that of the houses that had pyrite and had insulation pumped into their cavities, 90% of them are showing up with pyrite in our country because insulation accelerates what is happening.</p> <p>  If the Government does not allow the core testing to go ahead to make sure there is not pyrite in the houses we are insulating, it is causing a bigger problem in the whole country, because it will accelerate a situation of which it has control.  Core testing has to stay there.  The lack of engineers we have to test this is also a big problem.  The engineers that engineered people's houses on the first day, who were taking the certified blocks and stones were good enough at the time for the banks, institutions and the Government, to meet regulations when they were building their houses.  They were good enough to sign off on people's houses and now they are saying they are not good enough to do testing or even be part of testing, or to do core testing and send it to an independent lab in order for us to get fast-tracked results.</p><p> On one hand, the Government is looking to insulate houses, which can accelerate the damage caused by pyrite, and, on the other, it is stopping coring to find out if homes have pyrite from going ahead.  All the blocks I am talking about came from Clare, which borders Limerick.  The problem lies with the quarries used at the time.  Some houses have the Clare blocks and some have the Clare infill, that is, pyrite is not in their blocks but in their floors and bursting up through the floors.  Some houses have it around the outside, where clause 804 was laid in order to put in the sewers and so on, which is causing the footpaths to burst up.  People wonder what is wrong and whether the ground has subsided.  It has not.  It is the pyrite.  The question comes back to the witnesses, and they have answered it a couple of times already.  What is their thinking on pumped insulation going into houses that could have pyrite?  In any of their cases, has that accelerated the process of pyrite showing out?</p></speech>

In 2013, the owner of a house applied for SEAI services.  On 2 December, he got a reply stating that the services could not be rendered because of the cracks in his gable and that the SEAI would not carry them out.  It was in 2013 that we found that out.  In 2014, that couple found out that they had pyrite.  The SEAI was offering services for cavity wall insulation in 2013 and knew that it was exacerbating the issue.</p></speech>

There are a lot of houses in Limerick on which people have done remedial work because they had cracking.  They have removed the plasterwork, put mesh onto those areas and got products that soak in to make the blocks harder.  The problem now, however, is that when the winter comes again, the moisture will build up inside that and the whole lot will come off in a leaf.  The problem you have when you build a house is that you have a wall plate that holds up your roof and, if you have a hip roof, you are putting the pressure onto the corners of your house.  If you have a bungalow with an A-frame roof, it is all held together with triangulation of timber.  If one of your cavities is weakened by pyrite, your house will come down around you.  The Government 100% has to allow coring in order to ensure that we do not put any family in a dangerous situation.  Furthermore, with the insulation grants, we have to make 100% sure that coring happens in order to make sure we do not exacerbate a problem we already have.</p></speech>

I have surveyed 90 houses.  Fifty-six of them have this cavity wall insulation, 26 do not and others are not defined.  Our report also shows that the water is crossing the cavity.  It is not the insulation; it is crossing inside.

Is it the witnesses' understanding that nothing can be done to the foundations under this scheme?</p></speech>

The idea is that the redress should be for the 1,800 sq. ft, that is, the original size, but that the smaller home can then be built back and that the offset, the cost, to build back the 1,600 sq. ft one from the allowance received from having a home of 1,800 sq. m-----</p></speech>

If we were getting 100% redress, we would rebuild the houses we had to the same sizes at zero cost.  The reality is that our scheme is more like an 80% redress, which leaves a 20% shortfall.  For example, if homeowners get a grant of &euro;160,000, they might find they are &euro;50,000 short and cannot get that &euro;50,000, so they take that &euro;160,000 and build whatever size house they can build for &euro;160,000 and then they are not out any money and do not have to go to the bank.</p></speech>

If the redress scheme is not modified, do the witnesses think that will be an issue?  Will the witnesses expand on issues with costs?</p></speech>

The idea of the action being taken by some homeowners at the moment, which is a type of class action, is that it is geared to recover from the State, through the courts, the difference between the grant that is allocated and the true cost of replacing one's home.  For example, if the grant is at &euro;160,000 but the true cost of replacement is &euro;200,000, the class action we are looking at is to recover the &euro;40,000, not the entire amount of money because we are not looking to get the grant paid out twice.  That is what it is for.</p><p>We believe this is a cynical move designed to distract people from believing it is possible to follow one of two avenues.  These are in respect of the grant process and the possibility of the shortfall being made up through the class action.  This seems to be designed to scare people away from taking both paths and to protect the State by having any recovered costs given to the State as opposed to the homeowner who was lost out on the money in the first place.  In the example I gave, it looks like rather than the &euro;40,000 shortfall going to the homeowner to make up the difference, which is the reason it was designed, it would be recovered by the State against the &euro;160,000 it paid out in a grant.  It is terrible to think anyone would set up a system like that.  That is our big problem with it.</p><p> I will pass the question on costs over to Mr. Houton, our quantity surveyor in our local area in Donegal.t</p></speech>

Somebody put it well earlier in saying the SCSI had one hand tied behind its back.  It was given parameters and could not price for foundations or the current regulations.  It could not even include in its square-foot rate floor coverings, such as a simple carpet or laminate flooring.  I looked at a 2,500 sq. ft. house, for which the SCSI had a rate of &euro;147 per square foot.  I allowed for an inflation rate of 9%, which is a conservative estimate given the volatility in the price of materials, as builders will know.  Every second week, people are getting an email indicating that the prices of materials are increasing.  For example, last week I received an email stating that the price of insulation will go up by between 20% and 25% on 1 July.  I added 9% to account for inflation to the rate of &euro;147 per square foot set by the SCSI for a standard four-bedroom house, one of the most common house types in Donegal.  I then worked out it would cost approximately &euro;10,000 to take out foundations, dispose of the materials and put in new foundations.  This worked out at approximately &euro;4 per square foot.  Building to the current regulations adds approximately &euro;11 per square foot.  Including floor coverings, whether tiling, laminate, carpet or whatever else, would add a further &euro;5 per square foot, giving &euro;147, plus &euro;13 per square foot to account for inflation, &euro;4 per square foot to account for foundations, &euro;11 per square foot to cover the current regulations and approximately &euro;5 per square foot for floor coverings, it amounts to &euro;180 per square foot.  That is what it will cost to complete a 2,500 sq. ft. house from start to finish under current regulations.</p> <p>  The other parameter I ask the committee to consider is in regard to smaller houses.  There are items that will cost the same amount regardless of house size, whether it is 2,500 sq. ft., 2,000 sq. ft. or 1,500 sq. ft.  These include kitchens, stairs, fees and connecting and disconnecting electricity.  The final amount was approximately &euro;50,000.  Divided by 2,500, that works out at &euro;20 per square foot over a 2,500 sq. ft. house, &euro;50 per square foot for 1,000 sq. ft. house.  There is a &euro;30 per square foot difference between a small house and a bigger house.  It will be &euro;180 per square foot for a 2,500 sq. ft. house but for a 1,000 sq. ft. house, it will be approximately &euro;210 per square foot for the same specification with a smaller size.  Smaller houses will cost more per square foot to build than bigger houses.</p></speech>

The proposed scheme is suggesting an upper cap of &euro;420,000 for homeowners to rebuild homes.  However, a secondary cap on the square footage rate has also been put in place.  I thank Mr. Houton for his update on costs.  For local builders and developers to deliver on these rebuilding challenges, what implications will this have in the current climate of high inflation in the cost of construction materials?</p></speech>

From my perspective, anyone who picks up the phone and contacts a contractor will find that no one is willing to give a quote.  Where a contractor does give a quote, it is &euro;200 plus per square foot.  My house is less than 1,000 sq. ft. in size.  It is ridiculous to think it will cost me over &euro;200,000 to rebuild my home, and the cost is only getting higher.</p> <p>  The problem is I will not get &euro;200,000 from the Government.  I will get approximately &euro;160,000 and maybe even less.  I may also have to pay engineering fees of &euro;15,000.  Mr. Campbell is available on video link.  We have gone through, item by item, every single aspect that it will take to rebuild our homes and the rates available are not workable.</p> <p>  As Mr. Houton said, on the materials side, the costs are moving.  One of the big concerns about the scheme is that homeowners will be tied to a timeframe to rebuild their homes.  That is not doable right now.  I had homeowners ringing me last night in panic because they were approved for the scheme last year.  They are waiting to start their rebuild.  They were hopeful, as the rest of us were, that all of the time and effort put in over the past year would be productive.  They are now panicking because they have only two months left to rebuild their house.</p> <p>  To be honest, everything in the scheme is anti-homeowner.  There are no key performance indicators, KPIs, or timelines set for any local authority or housing agency.  The timelines, the criteria and every single other aspect are set for the homeowner, and they are set for the homeowner to fail.</p></speech>

Will the regulations be updated to reflect the current SEAI figure over time?  That figure could go up or down.  I would like to get the campaigners' understanding of that.</p></speech>

That is what we have been told all along.  The caveat I would apply in that regard is that we have been told a lot of things over the last six months.  Ms Hegarty and I have been working closely with some of the officials and much of what we understood would happen did not materialise last Tuesday.  All I can tell the Deputy is what we were led to believe, which was that there will be a one-stop shop, a seamless process that will include the grants from the SEAI where a homeowner decided to seek them.  That is our understanding of that.</p> <p>  On the costs, it is important to understand the reasons for the differences exist between what SCSI put together and what Mr. Houton sees as our prices on the ground.  These can be summarised under two headings.  One is that the terms of reference given to the SCSI deliberately excluded true costs and the Department decided what the eligible costs were.  A figure of &euro;15,000 in professional fees that a homeowner has to pay is not included.  The cost of foundations has been left out.  The Department is expecting us, on a leap of faith and without the science, to say the foundations are okay.  Most homeowners want to change their foundations and will pay for that themselves.  That will cost another &euro;10,000.  No finishes of any kind are provided for, not even a basic carpet.  We know what it takes to finish a house.  It will cost another &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000 and the homeowner has to find that.</p><p>There are also boundary walls and garages.  You cannot be in your new house and have your children running around in the street when walls and garages have the potential to fall down over time.  These are costs that the homeowner will bear.  People could very quickly spend &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 on these things but they cannot access that money.  That is why we want an option for downsizing.  We should not deprive people of the chance to take the grant, to take the hit on the equity in the house they already bought and paid for and to liquidate part of it to spend on building a smaller house they can afford.  It would be criminal of the State to block that.  That is what we are facing.  If the committee is to recommend anything, it should be that people who are prepared to take the hit on the size of the home they already bought and paid for should not be deprived of a second chance to avoid going near banks and to pay for a house out of their grants, as they wish to do.</p></speech>

In a second, I will invite him to share with us the outcome of the testing he and Petrolab have carried out.  There were some deeply worrying findings with regard to the very prominent role of pyrrhotite.  I have read and listened to those findings.  I will also invite Professor Dunlop to comment on his findings, the regulations that were in place in this State in 2002, 2004 and 2008 and how those regulations were not implemented or incorporated into IS 465, which underpins the current scheme and will underpin the scheme to come until it is reviewed.  I suggest that Dr. Leemann and Professor Dunlop take approximately two minutes.  I will then invite Mr. Aidan Houton, Mr. Michael Doherty and Mr. Thomas Campbell to speak on cost inflation.  As has been talked about, the SCSI has done costings but these are based on the 2007 regulations and exclude the foundations, which is deeply worrying.  Right now, the scheme would be based on the SCSI report from January 2022.  Under this scheme, it is estimated that it would be late 2023 before the Minister could review this.  That means that the costings will be two years old.  Mr. Houton's testimony is deeply worrying.  It occurs to me that when this scheme is operational, it will be necessary to base it on up-to-date SCSI costings that include foundations and meet the appropriate regulations for 2022.  I ask Professor Dunlop and Dr. Leemann to speak first and then perhaps Mr. Doherty and Mr. Houton could take the second question.</p></speech>

I will quickly say something about the role of pyrrhotite in the concrete blocks from Donegal.  Pyrrhotite is the unstable form of iron sulphate.  It oxidises, which results in a first phase of expansion.  This is relatively small.  It is the rust that is formed from the iron.  Sulphur is then released, which leads the concrete blocks to expand due to the formation of a new minerals.  The first is called ettringite and then, in the second stage, another sulphate mineral that leads to the loss of the concrete's strength, thaumasite, is formed.  At a given point, carbonation, that is to say the concrete taking in CO2 from the air, kicks in.  This boosts the formation of thaumasite, which means a loss of strength.  In the end, these two new mineral phases, ettringite and thaumasite, disappear because gypsum is formed.  This is the end stage.  With regard to the standards and the levels of sulphur that are allowed in aggregates, Professor Dunlop has looked into this question and can comment.</p></speech>

Dr. Leemann is one of these and another is Mr. Nick Scaglione from the USA.  We have looked at the concrete issue independently without being restricted to the IS 465 protocols.  We presented our research at the European Parliament on 23 March.  We invited Engineers Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, and people from the Department to join us and to look at the findings.  It is absolutely clear from the research we have done that pyrrhotite is oxidising and releasing sulphur, which is turning into sulphuric acid and attacking the cement hydrates.  We have found the process connected to the cracking of concrete blocks in Donegal.  It is a real thing and cannot be ignored.<br/><br/>Mr. Doherty has already said that many of these homes were built during the Celtic tiger years.  The regulations that were in place at that time, the European standards on aggregates for concrete, EN 12620:2002, specified very clearly that, if pyrrhotite is present in the aggregate, then 0.1% of sulphur can be released, which is a very low level.  That was published by the NSAI in 2004.  Its regulation was called SR 16:2004 and used the exact same wording.  The NSAI updated that standard in 2008 which was then called IS EN 12620:2002+A1:2008.  I know that is quite a long title but I mention it for the record.  This standard said the same thing, that special attention must be given to aggregates that contain pyrrhotite and that you cannot have more than 0.1% sulphur being released into concrete. <br/><br/>Analysis that we have done with Dr. Leemann and Mr. Scaglione has clearly identified that in areas where there is this cracking, you find pyrrhotite being oxidised and sulphur being released.  Dr. Leemann presented really good results that show sulphur being released <i>in situ</i>in the blocks in Donegal today.  We have also shown the process whereby these secondary minerals, ettringite and thaumasite, form and expand, causing cracking.  It is a really serious problem because, in Donegal, those involved in the IS 456 process have decided that the problem is mica and mica alone.  People involved in the setting up of that protocol are holding on to those old ideas.  We need the science to move forward.</p></speech>

I am substituting for Deputy Flaherty.  I thank all of the homeowners who are here today, the committees that are behind them and all of the other homeowners behind those committees.  For the benefit of anyone who has not dealt with this issue and is new to it, the mental stress everybody here and everybody they represent are under is absolutely extraordinary.  You really cannot understand it until you are in the middle of it.  That needs to be at the forefront of everyone's mind.</p> <p>  I will come back to the damage threshold and the issue of the foundations.  Deputy Conway-Walsh referred earlier to Mayo County Council turning down 20 applications last summer.  Some 19 of these rejections were overturned on appeal.  That is relevant because the expert group's report cited Mayo County Council's work on a damage threshold as one of the reasons a damage threshold is being introduced.  Will Ms Hegarty comment on what was involved in that?  She was one of the homeowners in question.</p> <p>  With regard to the foundations issue, I know Mr. Campbell has made some proposals as to a potential solution.  Will he talk us through those proposals?  Will he also explain the difference between raft and strip foundations and the relevance of that difference to what is under discussion today?</p></speech>

Again, decisions on houses are being made based on desktop studies without anything being physically seen.  Having outsourced the contract to review homes, Mayo County Council decided that there was no pattern of cracking present.  Over a period of two months, we were put through what can only be described as absolute torture.</p><p>We had to get our own engineers out again to reassess our homes and put forward more evidence to say that we should be accepted onto the scheme.  The only reason that we did get onto the scheme was because during the appeal process an independent engineer was brought in from outside the county.  In conversations with him when he attended my home he basically said "I do not know what I am doing here".  When one thinks about it, if one local authority can have one opinion on the damage threshold, what is going to happen when 12 local authorities have an opinion on the damage threshold?  It is going to be unworkable.  The only way to roll out the scheme effectively is to have one central hub, not 12 local authorities.  I will now hand over to Mr. Campbell to speak on the foundation side.</p></speech>

This would have been done during construction to get to a suitable bearing capacity whereby one had to excavate deeper to get to a solid area.  Under the current scheme, that excessive amount of blockwork needs to be removed, replaced and built on the existing strip foundation.  There are a number of practical issues with that from a construction point of view and a health and safety point of view.  If it is the case that the house is in a housing estate there would be quite a deep excavation required adjacent to the public footpath and to the other properties.  If it is a house in the countryside there could be excess costs around landscaping where one must take it back and dig a deeper hole.  A very practical solution to this is to remove the defective blockwork, remove the infill hardcore that is there, replace the hardcore in compacted layers and then create a reinforced concrete raft up closer to ground level where one has poor ground conditions.  This is what the designs do and it is a very practical solution.. By today's standards, where there is excessive blockwork below that is greater than 900 mm, and the infill stone is greater than 900 mm, one is required to put in a precast concrete slab at floor level to span between the blockwork.  This is to carry the house and carry the floors because hardcore greater than 900 mm is susceptible to settlement.  From a cost point of view, doing a reinforced concrete raft versus the blockwork and a precast slab would probably work out cost neutral but it is very much a more robust and practical solution from a construction and building point of view.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.1010" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062300002#J01000"><p>I am basing the costs in our area at roughly around &euro;180 per sq. ft.  That is the cost, roughly, to build a house.  So, a 2,000 sq. ft house would cost some &euro;360,000 plus VAT.  The VAT on that house would be &euro;48,600.  That VAT is the first thing the Government could waive, which might bring us back into a slight part of redress.  The percentage rate that we are missing is the VAT.  If anyone who has pyrite in their house could remove the VAT this would be &euro;48,000 that would bring us closer to getting where the costings are.</p> <p>  Going back to the building process, I will just start with a house that has pyrite at the moment.  If I come in the front gate I may see that there is a tarmac drive, if the house is lucky enough to have one.  If the house must be taken down then the sewerage sytem and the footpath and everything around the house will be impacted because it will involve going down to the foundation level.  This means all of the sewerage system being taken up.  The &euro;180 per sq. ft does not cover all the external works.  It is just to the builder's finish.  It does not include a kitchen, curtains, paint, or reinstatement of bathroom tiles.  It comes up well short of the costings being given at the moment.  To remove all the rubble from the site it now must go to licensed tips.  One might not have a licensed tip near enough to the area so there will also be a transport cost of getting that material from the household to a licensed tip.  This also adds another cost.  When one works this out, it could be an extra &euro;30 per sq. ft more by the time all of the remedial works around the house are done such as reinstating lawns.  It is not a small job to take out the material that must be taken out.  The Government has not looked at this and the costings have not been looked at.  If the Government wants to come closer to the costs - and we have Government people here and they all want to help - then 13.5% VAT on a 2,000 sq. ft house is &euro;48,600.  This figure should be added into the redress scheme, 100% straight away.  This brings us closer to where we need to get to, but they still need to raise the rates.</p> <p>  When the materials are purchased they are at 23% VAT.  The contractor then puts 13.5% on the bottom.  That is 10% more on the materials' costings that are coming in.</p></speech>

On the back of the working groups last summer, we did that and we were quickly told that in our restricted economy this would not be an option.  It just would not be something they were prepared to consider.  This is back to the point that the Department dictated the terms of reference.  It was a no-go area and not even up for discussion.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, took the terms of reference, with all of the exclusions, and did the best job it could.  I do not have an issue with them.  The issue is with the terms of reference that excluded all of what should be eligible costs, such as all the elements the Deputy spoke of.  That is stuff we must find for ourselves as homeowners, and that is not right.</p></speech>

That has been taken off the table but it now needs to be looked at by the Government to say that it must come back in.  That is a sizeable amount of money that would go a long way to helping with redress.</p></speech>

It is one thing they could actually go along with.  It is also very easy to police because an invoice could still be issued including the VAT and then it would go back to Revenue with a zero VAT rating on it for people who have pyrite or mica in their houses.  It could very easily be looked at and very easily managed.  It would be transparent across the board if anyone was trying to manipulate the figures.  The square footage would be there and any quantity surveyor would tell if somebody had been trying to up their the square footage.  The material costs and everything would be done out on spreadsheets to show what square footage was being charged.  The square footage can be worked out and the VAT can be easily seen.  It is one simple measure by which we could make sure that we can get the 100% redress.</p> <p>  Mr. Houton said that different areas have different prices.  Taking into account the timelines, this issue could be extended into the fact that the contractors are just not there.  There are five contractors in my area with 30 years' experience who have now pulled out of the building because they say they can no longer afford to build.</p><p>That is going to be another phase we and the Government must take into account.</p></speech>

When I say "we", I must include the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, who has probably had more engagement with the group than any of us put together in recent years.</p> <p>  I thank all the members of the Mica Action Group from Donegal for contributing so much over the years to its ongoing work.  The voluntary effort and the hours they have put in on behalf of homeowners in Donegal is very much appreciated.  Without that work on the ground, we as politicians would not have got to where we are today.  Two years ago, Professor Doherty and I were sitting in the Clanree Hotel with the Taoiseach, but we are in a very different position today.  We are better informed.  As time moves on, we are learning more about the difficulties.  It is important that whoever is in government, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage allows the scheme to evolve.  I have no doubt that in a year's time there will be other issues and other scenarios will be realised.  It is very important that we have a mechanism to allow the scheme to evolve and change.</p> <p>  Professor Dunlop talked about pyrite being present in the block and sulphur being released.  The Donegal group is aware that we have other presentations today from the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, Engineers Ireland and also from the Department.  To what extent has Professor Dunlop's information been shared with Engineers Ireland and what is its view of it to date?  Is it in agreement with him or does it oppose it?  The presentations that were made today are helpful for us.  We will use them as best we can and put what we heard to the representatives of Engineers Ireland, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, and the Department because this is an ever-evolving situation.  Many issues have been dealt with this far, but we are not there yet.  I, for one, want to get a scheme across the line before the summer recess.  That is very important.  I took a lot of criticism some time ago, but I stand over what I did to ensure the old scheme was not scrapped.  A lot of work is happening on the ground in Donegal and possibly in some other counties whereby people could prepare for contract and go through the different stages.  It is very important that they are now ready to go because it will save a lot of time.  That is why I wanted to save the scheme from day one.  I am glad I stood over that.  I still stand by it.</p> <p>  Could Professor Dunlop respond on what the situation is in terms of the opinion of Engineers Ireland on the results of his investigations on pyrite?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.1019" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Paul Dunlop" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062300002#K00300"><p>I thank the committee for letting me in again.  I would like to bring Mr. Leemann into the discussion as well.  The main issue we are worried about in Donegal is not so much pyrite as pyrrhotite, which is another form of unstable iron sulphite.  It is more highly reactive than pyrite and it is well known internationally, in the United States - in Massachusetts and Connecticut - and also in Quebec in Canada.  Mr. Leemann has presented work that he has done in Switzerland where very high-strength concrete used in foundations and megastructures like dams fails because of oxidisation of pyrrhotite.</p> <p>  To date, from what I can see publicly, Engineers Ireland has been fairly quiet, but I heard its representatives speak on the radio.  Dr. Martina Cleary organised an excellent conference a few weeks ago.  All I can say at the moment is that there is a denial of the problem in Donegal that pyrrhotite is widespread.  Mr. Campbell can speak about this as well.  Some 86% of the homes in Donegal that he has sampled have appreciable levels of pyrrhotite in them.  It is a major issue.  People from Engineers Ireland or the NSAI, who are wedded to this old idea that mica is a problem in Donegal need to shift.  There is a serious pyrrhotite issue.  Pyrrhotite is classed as a geohazard.  Other types of geohazards are hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis.  This is a real problem.  I accept we need more research to try to understand it, but evidence is there to show that it is a widespread issue.  I will hand over to Mr. Leemann, who may have other comments to add.</p></speech>

Investigations are ongoing by Engineers Ireland on behalf of the Department.  Is pyrrhotite part of the investigation?</p></speech>

I also know that there is an understanding that pyrrhotite must be part of that review.  It is excellent that it is doing that, but I have no idea who is on the panels.  I just hope that they are open to the evidence that is being presented.  The European seminar to which I referred discussed the many reports that are coming back from Petrolab and also from engineers on the ground who are dealing with homes in Donegal.  The committee could speak to Mr. Campbell about the number of houses he has done.  Dr. Ambrose McCloskey is another engineer who is on the record as saying that most of the homes he has been testing have come back with pyrrhotite.  We need more research on the issue, but the small bit of research we did with Mr. Leemann clearly shows that pyrrhotite is present, and that it is oxidising and releasing sulphur and that an internal sulphate attack is happening in Donegal.  It is not just a mica issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.1023" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062300002#K00700"><p>I will not take all the time because I am conscious there are Oireachtas Members present from other affected counties who have questions and I want to allow them time.</p> <p>  I wish to ask a question about the point Professor Doherty made in his previous contribution on downsizing and to tease it out a little bit in terms of his thinking.  I understand where he is coming from in that respect but does he have concerns given that there would be planning implications in such a scenario in terms of replacing a like-for-like situation with a new house?  There would be planning costs as well as professional fees and costs for other matters.  In addition, there is the planning process, which could go through a local authority process and ultimately be appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am just playing out the other side of the argument.  What is Professor Doherty's view on that?  Why is he not concerned in that respect if we are to go that route?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.1024" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Michael Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062300002#K00800"><p>The first point is the issue of inconvenience, which I accept is associated with planning permissions, including all of the ones Senator Cummins listed.  But there are then non-starters, where there is no pathway forward.  It is not an inconvenience, it is a non-starter when people do not have the &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 they need to rebuild a home.  That has to be priority number one.  That is what downsizing offers, should a homeowner decide to go that way, as long as there is not a penalty, such as they are trying to impose at the moment.  That is number one.</p> <p>  The second issue is that when it comes to the inconvenience factor, there have been conversations already around not having to go through planning, so long as one is working off the same footprint of the home.  Even if the footprint was shortened somewhat to make it a smaller home, they would largely be on the same plot as they were before and exemptions in that regard are being explored.  With a bit of creativity, we could make all that work, and we would not have the level of inconvenience that a homeowner may have to put up with, but the starter for ten is that we need a way to get a home rebuilt when people do not have the &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 to bridge the shortfall.  That is where penalty-free downsizing is an option and cannot be taken off the table.</p></speech>

I come from that perspective myself, but what he suggests in terms of the creativity piece is fraught with danger due to potential legal challenges on planning.</p><p>I am not saying that as a block; I am just saying it as a reality.  We could end up in a scenario where a homeowner wants to downsize because they want to get that project off the ground but are then challenged through the planning process.  I am acutely aware of and would be very concerned about that issue for homeowners affected.</p></speech>

No one from the Department or elsewhere has said people cannot downsize.  They are just saying they will not provide the money needed to do the downsizing.  It is not the case that they have investigated it and found it fraught with danger and, therefore, will not allow downsizing.  They will absolutely allow downsizing but will reduce the grant money and give a grant towards a smaller house.  This is not a technical issue for them.  It is purely a financial issue for them.  Even though it is a cost-neutral option to them, they are looking for an opportunity to claw back some of the grant money they were prepared to give because the homeowners find they can do nothing else other than downsize.  It is an opportunity for the State to pull back some of the money it was going to give in the first place.  That is the only logical explanation.  That is where we are at.</p></speech>

If someone gets a grant of, for example, &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000, will the Government subrogate to that extent or is it fully subrogated meaning that the person cannot pursue a claim?  Do people need to give back the amount they receive and keep anything over and above it or is it that they cannot pursue a claim and the Government can pursue the claim in full?</p> <p>  Is there any intention on the part of the Department or anybody else to pursue the DCB suppliers?  Are there many cases that could be pursued?  How many people in Clare, for example, who have found their houses are now defective, could have a claim they could pursue or are the majority of cases for one reason or another not legally pursuable?</p></speech>

They identified that through receipts, through direct purchase, through clerks and even through connections.  Those that are unknown are usually second or third home purchasers.  It may be that the builder has gone out of business, is deceased or cannot be identified, or it is a development on a housing estate and they would know where the blocks came from.</p> <p>  Over the past two years, we have observed that very few solicitors are prepared to take on the power and might of the biggest company in the country, which is our supplier.  It is the responsibility of the State to address that.  There is no point in asking us, the homeowners, the questions.  It is the responsibility of the State and all its legal might to answer that question.  Regarding blaming the fact that it is the taxpayers' money; we are the taxpayers.

It took us by surprise.  We had a 61-page document to go through.  It was Thursday of last week before we got all our issues discovered, raised and tabled.  This is very recent - less than a week.  It is quite a complex issue when it becomes legal.  We have sought legal advice on it and we are still awaiting that legal advice.  So far, we have been led to believe that at a high level this is something to put the frighteners on people chasing any claim from anybody.  We are sorry to see that part.</p> <p>  There has always been talk about chasing the perpetrators but it has never found its way on to anything in black and white that we have seen.  If it has, it has certainly not been pursued with any vigour.  In the document again the homeowner is the easiest port of call.  The homeowner seems to be the target as opposed to the quarries that allowed it or as opposed to the local authorities and their failure to regulate the standards that would have avoided this disaster in the first place.</p> <p>  As homeowners, we feel victimised.  We feel that we are an easy target.  The bigger businesses, banks and insurance companies are not being pursued with any vigour as far as we can see.  In black and white in the general scheme, there we are, named again.  It contains language such as jail sentences of five years and fines of &euro;50,000 for anything deemed fraudulent.  All the language we are seeing here is pointing to homeowners and how to manage these people who seem to be looking for something for nothing.  I go back to the simple point: all we want is what we had and what we paid for.</p></speech>

What they have gone through in Donegal and elsewhere has been very difficult.</p> <p>  Mr. Doherty saw the general scheme of the Bill last week.  I know this is not pre-legislative scrutiny but we are talking about the upcoming Bill and what might improve it.  What changes need to be made to the Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.1041" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062300002#L01600"><p>There is quite a lot in that.  We have suggested 35 different amendments in our submission.  To catch the essence of it, we had three pillars from the beginning.  The first relates to cost: 100% redress and no less.  The scheme has a cap of &euro;420,000.  When the scheme was announced at the end of November last year, that cap affected 18% of our homeowners.  Because of inflation, it now affects one third of our homeowners.  That cap needs to go to &euro;460,000 to stay where were at the end of November with 18% affected.  If the cap is raised to &euro;460,000 at least we are back to where we were at the end of November and 18% of our people will need to suffer a cap over and above the square-foot cap.  There is one starting point.</p> <p>  The second one is the need for penalty-free downsizing.  We cannot penalise people who are taking the grant available and trying to make the most of it to build a smaller home.  That is just morally wrong.  The third thing relates to the rates.  The rates need to be solid.  The rates need to be reviewed before we launch the scheme.  We cannot launch a scheme that will hit the ground in months with figures that go back to February 2021.  They need to be reviewed and up to date.  A number to allow for inflation needs to be applied to that because otherwise our rates will be in arrears for the next 12 months and the homeowner carries that cost.  Those are the cost issues in pillar 1.</p> <p>  Pillar 2 relates to the science.  We have scientists and geologists here.  We have a compelling case that says we have missed the elephant in the room.  The elephant in the room is a deleterious material that is not even referenced in IS 465, called pyrrhotite.</p><p>It should have been referenced because there is a 2004 European standard that ought to have been included by NSAI and was not.   We are suffering the consequences on the back of that.  We are in a stand-off between the Department and the local authority in Donegal, where 369 applications are stalled because they do not know how to deal with pyrrhotite as IS 465 filters out everything bar pyrite and mica.  That stand-off is still to be resolved and it has been running since January.  We are six months into it.  We need to be in a place where we can say "if in doubt take it out".  I have no issue, nor has any homeowner, with NSAI doing what it needs to do to understand the science.  If we have a policy of "if in doubt take it out" and there is science that removes that doubt, we have no problem with moving to a place the science says is safe to move to, but we cannot put the cart before the horse.  We cannot ask homeowners to go through this twice in their lifetime with the risk of the unknown.  The unknown has not yet been clarified.  The Department's position is that it will have a go and if it does not work we will have a second bite because that is what the 40-year guarantee and the second grant is for.  That does not deal with the mental aspects of a homeowner going through this twice.  Pillar 2 is all about the science.  We need to get the science right and then the 40-year State-backed guarantee is in case some other unknown evolves over time due to new learning.  That is fine.  We understand that.</p><p> A point was made earlier about the scheme evolving.  There is a lot of learning at this point in time.  The Department and the Government have a lot of information.  We do not need three or four bites of this.  We had a bite of it in the 90:10 scheme from January 2020.  This is the enhanced scheme announced at the end of November.  We have told the Government and officials what needs to happen to make this work.  We do not need two or three more bites of this.  We can do this right this time if the will is there to do it.  If there is further learning down the road, we will take that when we need it but let us not make excuses for not doing the right thing now by saying this scheme can evolve.  Let us take what we know, what needs to be done, and do it this time.</p><p> Pillar 3 is about excluded homes.  There are other people who will not avail of this grant but they are equally victims.  They paid for their homes and they are being excluded.  There are people in second and third rentals.  At the minute, the principal private residence is covered, as well as the first rental property.  If people happen to have a second or third rental property, which some did for investments for the future or for pension funds, they are not eligible.  We have nowhere for the families in those homes to go, not to talk about the fact the landlord is out because of it.  What does he do with the second or third property?  There are homeowners who bought and invested and have been part of the Mayo, Donegal or Clare landscape but are being excluded.  These people bought in good faith and the Government is not looking to include them in any shape or form.  These people are not saying they should be pushed to the front.  They are just asking not to be left behind.  If there is a revision in three years, which is being talked about, we need language in place now stating that no defective concrete block home will be left behind.  For these people, it is not a case of not ever but just not today.  They will take that. </p></speech>

I have three very specific questions.  My first question is for Dr. Leemann.  Given everything he knows about the kinds of deleterious materials that are in these counties, what does he think when he hears of options for just the outer leaf and not the inner leaf, or the brickwork but not the foundations?  The source of the aggregate might be the same or similar for the brick and the foundations.  Does he think these are credible options, based on his knowledge of the science?</p> <p>  We have moved away from talking about pyrite and mica exclusively to a range of other deleterious materials.  Based on Mr. Campbell's understanding and the information that is out there, what is the level of prevalence of these materials in any of the affected counties that he has knowledge of?</p> <p>  The way this legislation is set up, the first review of the unit cost the Minister can do is 12 months after the introduction of the legislation.  The legislation is due to be commenced in late autumn or early winter of this year.  It would therefore be late autumn or early winter 2023 before the Minister would be allowed to revise the base rates upwards.  Given what Mr. Houton knows in general about cost price inflation, and given that the original base rate was set early this year, where does he think costs will be two years after that original SCSI report?  How big a gap will there be between those rates and where inflation is going to be at the latter end of 2023?</p></speech>

If there is pyrrhotite present in the aggregate used in the concrete, it will oxidise and create an internal sulphate attack.  How fast this goes on depends on the reality of humidity.  It is lower for the inner leaf than for the outer leaf.  You cannot transfer the data or knowledge gained from the blocks to the foundations because the ratio between aggregate and cement content changes for foundations.  There is a certain buffer of blocks to take some of the sulphur.  However, it goes off stronger in blocks because there is more cement, and you can form more expansive ettringite and more thaumasite, which leads to strength loss.  In principle, if it is in the concrete, pyrrhotite oxidation cannot be avoided.  The question of gaining information as soon as possible to make the right decisions is not only for foundations; it is for any concrete of this quality that might have been used for stairs, garages or even bridges.</p></speech>

That is 86%.  The remaining 11 homes had traces of pyrite.  In 61 of the 66 homes that have pyrrhotite, or 92%, there were appreciable amounts of pyrrhotite.  It is there in large quantities and it is up to the scientists and the geologists to tell us how best to deal with that.</p></speech>

All we can do is look at the last few years.  They have gone up this year alone.  At the beginning of July, the cost of insulation will up again by 25% to 30%.</p></speech>

I presume from what Mr. Houton has said it is highly likely that the level of inflation from January of this year to October or November next year will be way above 10%.</p></speech>

It used to be that things went up by 5% or 10% throughout the whole year but from 2021 on, materials went crazy because of the volatile market.  They were so hard to get.  The price of the materials going up was one thing; getting them was another.  If we carry on the way we are going, it might be 10% for next year.</p></speech>

How long does it take before the effects can be visibly seen, if a home has been constructed with one of these deleterious materials?  Do weather conditions or geographical conditions exacerbate it, such as being in a coastal area?  In her opening statement, Ms Cleary said there were ten or 12 other counties where people may end up with this problem but are not aware of it yet.  In fact, she said it could be an issue in all of our counties.  Are there particular factors that would exacerbate the problem?</p></speech>

In terms of conditions required, all that is needed to get pyrrhotite reactions going is oxygen and moisture.  We have plenty of both in Ireland.  It is something that we just cannot stop.  Dr. Leemann has much published research in this field.</p></speech>

Not all sides of a house would be affected in the same way because the level of moisture changes according to exposure.  We cannot say it would take five years for damage to appear because it depends on pyrrhotite content and concrete quality.  The blocks have varying concrete quality and they are not all the same.  For example, there are the foundations of the houses in Connecticut.  Some foundations demonstrated signs of damage after three years, while for others it took 20 years to show those signs.  Translating this to Ireland, some foundations might have no problem but others are surely a ticking time bomb.  We do not know exactly when it will go off.  There is a difference according to pyrrhotite content, concrete quality and exposure conditions.</p></speech>

It is difficult to answer that question.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their assistance in this matter.  It has been very helpful.  From the testimony it is very clear how stressful and worrying the issue has been, not just over the past couple of weeks as we waited for the publication of the Bill but over the years as the witnesses have seen their houses and homes crumbling.  We want to do the very best we can to try to get this right.  I thank the delegations for helping with that.  We have two more sessions today and we will meet representatives of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, Engineers Ireland, the Department and the expert working group.

This is our second public meeting in our examination of the Bill on dwellings damaged by the use of defective concrete blocks.  From the expert working group on the scheme we are joined by Mr. Paul Forde, chair and Mr. Martin Lynch, general manager of the pyrite remediation scheme.  From Engineers Ireland we are joined by Mr. Damien Owens, registrar, Mr. Alec McAllister, associate director of advocacy and engagement and Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Connell, chartered engineer.  From the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland we are joined by Mr. Kevin Brady and Mr. Miche&aacute;l Mahon who are chartered quantity surveyors and Ms Sabrina Mackin who is a chartered building surveyor.  Members have been circulated with the relevant papers and opening statements.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  Witnesses attending in the committee room are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contribution to today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I will invite Mr. Forde, Mr. Owens and Mr. Brady to make their opening statements after which we will go to a question-and-answer session with the members.</p></speech>

My name is Paul Forde and I am director and chairman of DBFL Consulting Engineers.  Last January, I was appointed by the Department to chair the expert group on the enhanced defective concrete block scheme.  The expert group created three working groups.  I am happy to be here today with my colleague Mr. Martin Lynch, who is general manager of the pyrite remediation scheme and who chaired one of these groups.  We thank the committee for inviting us to assist in its discussions and deliberations on the general scheme.</p> <p>  I have been in practice as a consulting engineer for more than 42 years and I am a founding partner of DBFL Consulting Engineers.  The committee has been furnished with my qualifications and professional memberships, among which are fellow of Engineers Ireland and fellow of the Institute of Structural Engineers.  I have 14 years of extensive experience in investigating and resolving pyrite problems in a wide range of buildings.  I have acted as an expert witness on several occasions.  I was appointed as a member of the original Pyrite Resolution Board.  I chaired the technical committee that drafted IS 398-2.  Of particular relevance is the fact that this part of the standard dealt with the methodology for remediation works.  In 2013, Engineers Ireland appointed me to act as chair of its original assessment panel in respect of its pyrite register.</p> <p>  In January 2022 I was asked by the Minister to chair the expert group to advise on the proposed enhanced defective concrete blocks grant scheme.  The expert group was established to consider and advise the Minister on the technical issues that needed to be resolved.  These included issues such as the damage threshold for entry to the scheme, the parameters around the second grant application, an independent appeals process, a review of the certificate of remediation and consideration of the rebuild cost prepared by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.</p><p> The expert group met for the first time on 27 January 2022 and delivered its report on 16 March.  As I said earlier, the expert group created three working groups.  The first working group, which was chaired by Martin Lynch, dealt with the damage threshold and the building condition assessment reports.  The second, which was chaired by John O'Connor, dealt with the proposal to provide for a second grant to cover the possibility of future damage and to deal with the independent appeals process.  The third, which I chaired, dealt with the certification of remediation works carried under the proposed enhanced scheme.</p><p> In early March, John O'Connor and I met with representatives of the Mayo and Donegal homeowners - Martina Hegarty and Michael Doherty -  and discussed the terms of reference of the expert group.  We met again on 9 March during which the homeowners' views on all relevant issues were discussed.  At each meeting, we were very impressed by their representation, as, I am sure, the committee was earlier, and understood their concerns.</p><p> At the outset, the Minister emphasised that other longer-term technical issues required further investigation.  These included matters such as a review by the NSAI of I.S. 465, which deals with buildings damaged by deleterious materials, and a review of the Irish standards in respect of concrete blocks, including aggregates.  The NSAI has also been requested to examine and test foundations and to report back to the Minister.  The expert group produced two reports relating to short-term technical issues in respect of which the Minister required immediate recommendations.  These were the report on the enhanced defective concrete blocks grant scheme dated 16 March 2022 followed by an addendum report in respect of the SCSI rebuild costs dated 29 April 2022.  The expert group's recommendations for the Minister's consideration are set out in these two reports.  I understand that these reports have been made available to members.  Mr. Lynch and I are happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

My name is Damien Owens and I am registrar of Engineers Ireland and a chartered engineer.  I would like to introduce Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Connell, chartered engineer, who joining us online and who sat on the expert group on the defective concrete blocks scheme, and Mr. Alec McAllister, associate director of advocacy and engagement at Engineers Ireland.</p> <p>  Engineers Ireland is one of the oldest and largest representative bodies on the island of Ireland.  It has more than 25,000 members. This membership incorporates all disciplines of the engineering profession in Ireland - consulting and contracting organisations, the public sector, semi-State bodies and educational institutes.  Our members are organised into regional branches, engineering divisions and societies.  Engineers Ireland awards the professional title of chartered engineer in line with the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1969.  Chartered engineers have been assessed by their peers as professionals in their field in delivering the highest standards of quality, expertise and innovation to serve the needs of society while ensuring public health and safety.  They adhere to the Engineers Ireland code of ethics in all  areas of their engineering practice. The registered professional title is recognised  internationally and under Irish law.  According to the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations (SI 9 of 2014 and code of practice, chartered engineers are one of the three professions that may act as assigned certifiers.  Engineers Ireland has also established and maintains registers of suitable qualified persons in specialist areas, including IS 398 pyrite assessment and remediation, historical landfill and IS 465 mica and pyrite.  Our members contribute to the development of national standards and policies with consultative groups across industry.  Recent submissions include a draft code of practice for fire safety assessment of premises and buildings, a submission to the joint Oireachtas committee on professional indemnity insurance and submission on the climate action plan in May 2021.</p> <p>  It is important to understand the role of the engineer in the context of IS 465.  IS 465 establishes a protocol for assessing and determining whether a building has been damaged by concrete blocks containing excessive amounts of certain deleterious materials - aggregate containing free or unbound muscovite mica or potentially deleterious quantities of pyrite.  It describes the methods for establishing the extent of the problem and categorise dwellings, the scope of any testing required and the evaluation of the findings and provides the chartered engineer with guidance on the selection of the appropriate remedial works to be undertaken.  The role of the registrant, an engineer on the IS 465 register, as set out is purely to prescribe-oversee testing and provide guidance on appropriate remedial works.  By virtue of being on the IS 465 register, a registrant is not acting as an assigned certifier or in any other statutory role.</p> <p>  In late 2018, Engineers Ireland was requested by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to provide a training programme with the outcome of establishing and maintaining a register of engineers considered competent to assess buildings damaged due to precast concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials in accordance with the standard and hold professional indemnity insurance.  This register lists chartered engineers who have the necessary direct professional experience, competency and specialist training in accordance with the requirements set out in the standard.  The register went live in June 2020 and in the region of 30 engineers are on the register.</p> <p>  Since the inception of the register, Engineers Ireland registrants have provided feedback based their experience on the operation of the defective concrete blocks scheme and surveys conducted by registrants on several hundred properties.  This feedback included making the case for the extension of IS 465 and associated grant scheme beyond Donegal and Mayo on 16 December 2020 and a submission to the working group on the defective blocks grant scheme on 21 September 2021.  The September 2021 submission provided a wide-ranging perspective on the operation of the scheme and highlighted areas that were perhaps discussed today such as pyrrhotite and cavity foundation.  The overwhelming sentiment from registrants regarding the scheme was the lack of certainty concerning partial remediation and the liability for any second and subsequent investigation and remediation works.  In addition, there was evidence that there was a potentially different mechanism of deterioration of concrete blocks.  This aspect requires additional investigation to accurately characterise mechanisms of deterioration so that suitable remedies can be designed and implemented.  Subsequent to these inputs, Engineers Ireland was invited to participate in the expert group on the enhanced defective concrete block grant scheme chaired by Mr. Paul Forde in February of this year.  This afforded the opportunity for engineering practitioners to provide input to the revised scheme.</p> <p>  Engineers Ireland has worked with stakeholders to implement a register of experts for the implementation of IS 465 and provide feedback from registrants to enable continuous improvement for all stakeholders.  We welcome the attention that the committee is giving to the Remediation of Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks Bill and we look forward to working with the committee, Government and other stakeholders towards an improved solution.</p></speech>

In addition, it operates the statutory register for the protected title of quantity surveyor and building surveyor.  In addition to promoting the highest standards in surveying, we undertake research on a wide range of economic, industry and practice-related issues in the public interest to produce regular reports including relating to construction costs.  Some committee members are serial attenders at our briefings.</p><p>In recognition of this construction cost expertise and the independence of the SCSI, we were requested by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, to provide construction cost information for the Government&rsquo;s defective concrete blocks grant scheme in late 2021.<br/><br/>The terms of reference were agreed upon between the Department and the SCSI on 7 February 2022.  These terms set out the parameters within which the SCSI would produce an independent, stand-alone construction cost report for the demolition and rebuilding of homes affected by defective concrete blocks, which was option No. 1 in the terms of reference, and also propose a cost methodology for partial remediation, which were options Nos. 2 to 5.  It should be noted that the report is based on the parameters of the defective concrete blocks grant scheme as announced on 30 November 2021.  The SCSI had no role in setting the parameters of the grant scheme, including, for example, in respect of which building regulations apply and the exclusion of foundations, etc., and also no role in the setting of the grant amount.  The SCSI report on construction costs for the defective concrete block scheme was published on 3 March 2022 and was welcomed by all stakeholders, including the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and the MICA Action Group.  The SCSI undertook this extensive work <i>pro bono</i>in the public interest and was supported by a significant number of our volunteer chartered quantity surveyor and chartered building surveyor members.  Hundreds of volunteer hours were involved.<br/><br/>Turning to the report methodology and key findings, the SCSI produced a bespoke, stand-alone report on the full demolition and rebuild costs, in the context of remediation option No. 1, for homes affected by defective concrete blocks in the north west as of February 2022.  As per the terms of reference and the parameters of the scheme, while the SCSI position is that it is best practice to build to current building standards, the costs in the report are based on new for old without betterment, on pre-2008 building regulations and on excluding new foundations.  Consideration of the 2014 Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, was included, because that standard is central to quality assurance as it is of particular importance that building regulations are adhered to for all developments to ensure defective building issues are not repeated.  The costs do not include fees for the scheme itself, as noted in table 2 on page 8 of the report.  <br/><br/>Regarding the methodology, the pricing schedules were drafted by an SCSI expert working group and issued to chartered quantity surveyors based in the north west, primarily in Donegal, with direct professional experience of residential development and mica-impacted homes.  The completed schedules were returned in February to provide up-to-date, relevant cost data for the report.  These returns were analysed by the working group, with further input from additional chartered quantity surveyors experienced in the field.  Additional cost data from the Department and the MICA Action Group were also reviewed as part of the consideration of average rebuild costs.  Average rebuilding rates for eight house types, including typical estate-type homes and one-off homes, were provided, ranging from &euro;145 per sq. ft to &euro;165 per sq. ft, priced at February 2022 material and labour rates.<br/><br/>It is particularly important to note and stress that the costs outlined in our report are average costs based on agreed unit sizes and on an agreed specification, as outlined in detail in our terms of reference.  In addition to option No. 1, the full demolition and rebuild approach, the SCSI considered options Nos. 2 to 5, concerning partial remediation, of the grant scheme as part of this report.  The report includes a non-exhaustive list of ancillary items that would inform the construction costs.  We found these elements to be extremely site-specific; therefore, we believe estimates based on gross floor area were inappropriate.  I mean that expressing estimates for remediation work based on cost per sq. ft is inappropriate.  A site-specific cost exercise will have to be undertaken for the specific elements to be replaced, incorporating the additional items affected in the context of those elements referred to above.  The determination of how such a site-specific remediation scheme would be established is a policy matter.  A model similar to the I.S. 465 register of chartered engineers, as referred to earlier, may provide a blueprint for establishing a panel of appropriately qualified professionals to undertake such work.<br/><br/>Regarding the impact of construction cost inflation, we were pleased to engage with this committee at the end of last month on this issue and our submission to that meeting set out our views on the current uncertainty impacting the sector.  Of note is the fact that some commentators discussing residential construction cost inflation refer to the SCSI tender price index and our house rebuild calculator.  These aspects, however, are not appropriate reference points for the defective concrete block scheme as the tender price index relates to commercial property, while the house rebuild calculator is intended for insurance purposes for individual estate-type houses only.  For this reason, the SCSI undertook to produce a stand-alone, bespoke report for the defective concrete block scheme.<br/><br/>The input costs of delivering residential developments, be they single or multi-unit developments, are wide-ranging.  They include hard costs, which are the construction costs, and soft costs, such as planning, enabling works, utility connections and charges, building control regulation and other statutory costs.  The primary drivers for the current price inflation, though, are high price volatility across a range of building materials, particularly insulation, cement, plasterboard, metals, fuel and labour cost increases, as well as the extremely high demand for projects underway across many tiers as the industry continues to readjust in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis.  Furthermore, regarding the first half of 2022, it is clear that Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine has impacted the price of materials previously sourced from that region, especially steel and base metals, while it has also led to a dramatic increase in fuel and energy costs.<br/><br/>Despite the volatility in construction costs, only a short time has passed since the SCSI defective concrete block report.  If there is a requirement to determine the impact, if any, of current construction cost inflation on the rebuild figures from February, we believe that the most accurate way to do this would be to re-do the entire cost exercise in full for all eight house types.  For our part, and this is noted in our report, we have undertaken to review these costs and update them in March 2023.  I note as well that we previously offered to re-cost the current study that the members have in the context of applying current standards and including new foundations when required.<br/><br/>The SCSI welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the resolution of this critical issue.  We appreciate its gravity, and we undertook this extensive work in good faith and in the public interest.  We are pleased that the report has been generally positively received by stakeholders.  We thank all those that contributed and we wish the committee well in its ongoing scrutiny.</p></speech>

It will still be helpful, however, if the members can keep their questions direct.  I call Deputy Calleary.</p></speech>

Starting with Mr. Forde, and focusing on the recommendation of the expert group concerning the damage threshold, there is concern that this aspect is going to be used to exclude homeowners rather than anything else.  This concern is exacerbated by the specific citing of work completed by Mayo County Council on the damage threshold.  I am sure Mr. Forde is aware that Mayo County Council proposed to exclude 20 homeowners from the current scheme last August.  On taking an independent appeal, 19 of those people won their cases.  Mr. Forde may not be aware, however, that the county council, when sending out an engineer earlier this year to assess new applications from homeowners, sent someone who was not I.S. 465 qualified.  In that context, he will understand that people are experiencing weariness and a lack of confidence in Mayo County Council regarding the damage threshold issue.  Will Mr. Forde share the work that Mayo County Council prepared for the expert working group?  It is not cited, but just referred to in the report.  Will the damage threshold differ depending on whether a situation involves pyrite, mica or pyrrhotite?</p> <p>  This leads me on to the issue of pyrrhotite.  Given Mr. Forde's experience in this area, and he is highly regarded in respect of his expertise, what is his view on this issue?  We heard evidence in the last session that it is extremely prevalent and exceptionally corrosive.  I would like to hear Mr. Forde's thoughts on this aspect, given his experience in this regard.  </p> <p>  Turning to the process for admitting other counties, and we know there are at least 12 more counties involved, people in County Sligo have been waiting for some time.  They are very frustrated by the process.  We had the experience of people in Clare as well, who were forced to go through many hoops, as we heard about earlier.  All the time this is happening - and I need everybody to understand this - it is adding to the stress experienced by each homeowner.  These are homeowners, families and people whose entire lives have been turned upside down through no fault of their own.  This is what we must all keep in our minds during all the work we are doing on this.  This is not about facts and figures; it is about people.  </p></speech>

The first dealt with the criteria for admittance, the second concerned pyrrhotite and third addressed other counties.  The working group was charged with specific tasks and some of the queries the Deputy raised are outside the scope of the working group.  Nevertheless, I will do my best to answer as far as I can.</p><p>I will pass the question on criteria for admittance to the scheme to Mr. Lynch because he chaired working group 1 which specifically dealt with that issue.  </p><p> Mr. Simon Wall and Mr. Martin Ruane, two representatives of Mayo County Council, contributed the experiences in Mayo to the expert group.  I will ask Mr. Lynch to respond to the first question, after which I will answer the second and third questions.</p></speech>

I have been actively involved in remediation schemes since 2014 at various levels and have been involved in the successful completion of about 2,500 pyrite remediation houses since then.  As Mr. Forde stated, one of the group's key tasks was to assess the entry level of a damage threshold to be considered.  The scheme I manage at the moment is the pyrite remediation scheme, which is often referred to as the east coast scheme.  IS 398 sets out the thresholds and damage levels to be met for entry to the pyrite remediation scheme.  IS 398 has categorisation of zero damage up to a damage condition rating of 2, or DCR 2.  Scheme participants who are currently accepted into the scheme must have achieved at least a DCR 2.  They would have significant damage as defined in the Pyrite Resolution Act and they would also have test results, sub-floor, correlating with pyrite reactive, from a low to a significant level.</p> <p>  The task of the group was to review how we could manage the inflow of applications into the defective concrete blocks scheme and look at what level of damage could be perceived to create an entry point.  The key objective was to be homeowner-focused, dealing initially with the worst cases of damage, bringing them to the front and dealing with them as early and as soon as possible and assisting homeowners in getting through that process.  In the first three or four years of the scheme we managed in IS 398, the majority of the worst-case damaged homes were entered in and successfully remediated with all homeowners back in their homes.</p> <p>  We reviewed the IS 398 standard.  We also looked at industry standards with regard to damage to properties.  The collective agreement among the working members of the group, representatives of which are here, was that the IS 465 needed to have a qualification on a threshold, so that an entry point for the worst affected homes could be considered.  The consensus was, as in the expert report, that a minimum damage of 1.5 mm of cracking to the external leaf would be set as the entry level for damage.  The collective group also recommended that this be reviewed, perhaps annually, and updated to reflect the flow of applications and the level of damage that was being met with analysis of information, be it in testing results or in the information being received in the damage condition rating reports that were coming in.  Those are the considerations of the working group on the damage condition threshold and how we got to the collective recommendation of 1.5 mm.</p></speech>

I will focus my attention on Mr. Mahon and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn will look after the engineers when his turn comes around.</p> <p>  I want to put on record the enormous gratitude many of us have for the independent way the SCSI undertook that very difficult role.  I know that it has to tell us that everyone very warmly welcomed it but I am sure that behind the scenes there were people quietly wishing that things were different at the time.  I will not ask Mr. Mahon to comment on that.</p> <p>  I am particularly interested in whether the provisions of the legislation before us are fit for purpose in the context of current cost inflation.  I am not asking for comment on policy matters, just the facts in terms of inflation.  The scheme is set up whereby the SCSI's report from January 2022 will underpin the first set of regulations in relation to the unit cost and the ultimate cost ceiling.  The Minister has made provision to review that every 12 months but the first review will be 012 months from the commencement of the Act.  We understand the Act will probably be commenced in September, October or November of this year, which would mean the first review and first possible increase in those rates will be at the latter end of 2023.  I know it is impossible to predict inflation but given that the Minister must also remain within a 10% cap when he or she - perhaps the Minister will be replaced - deals with the matter in the latter half of next year, how likely is it that inflation will be at or below 10% of the rate set in the report the SCSI has just done?  I am asking Mr. Mahon's professional opinion on that.  It is a serious question.</p></speech>

The problem is that it is quite evident that there is inflation out there at the moment.  There is a lot of anecdotal information about construction cost inflation.  Unfortunately, there is no independent data set in which inflation has been collated.  We have volunteered to redo that study in February or March 2023.  We think it is best to gauge inflation over a protracted period.  It is only four months since we did the report, so we would prefer to wait and see what the impact is over 12 months.</p></speech>

One sense that I got was that it is not that different materials are increasing in price but that different sized contractors experience that inflation in terms of their purchasing power from the supply chains in different ways.  A big developer such as Cairn Homes, for example, is able to bulk buy and buy early.  Given that this is a grant scheme and one that will rely in many ways on local contractors and suppliers, would it be fair to say that because of their more limited access to and lower purchasing power in the supply chains, they could experience cost inflation at a higher level than larger contractors?</p><p>Could we see quite abnormal cost inflations in County Clare versus County Mayo, or in different parts of those counties?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in that there are regional variations across the country in the cost of building, and even across the county.  It may be even different to build in Buncrana versus Bundoran.  There are regional variations.  Yes is the answer but I would state that it might not necessarily be county by county but rather by region.</p></speech>

I thank all of our witnesses present here today.  As I did not get the opportunity to speak in the previous round although I was here, I wish also to thank all of our witnesses who were with us here this morning for sharing their own experiences.</p> <p>  I will start by thanking Mr. Forde and all of the members of the expert group who had a very difficult task in dealing with a very challenging and emotive situation.  We have homes which should be safe and comfortable places for people to live but clearly are not.  That is something that all of us in the committee want to rectify for families.  </p> <p>  In response to the work and recommendations that the expert group put together, and the amplification it had from residents&rsquo; voices and their recommendations, there are many welcome changes in this latest iteration; most of which came from the expert group report and directly from homeowners.  These are things like the taking on of the cost of testing; retrospective inclusion; the certificate of remediation having that legal footing; an appeals processl and, of course, the extension to other counties. </p> <p>  My first question is to ask Mr. Owens about the extension of the IS 465:2018 beyond Donegal and Mayo.  Is he satisfied about how that is dealt with in this legislation?</p> <p>  My second question is directed to Mr. Mahon and I thank him and all of the members of his organisation for all of the work they have done on this.  It has produced what he refers to as a standalone, bespoke report which is crucial to ensuring that this scheme is as fair and as equitable as possible.  There are hard costs, soft costs and auxiliary items are all included, and there are very thorough costings.  A great amount of work has gone into it.  I, like others, am worried about the impact of inflation and I appreciate that he has offered to work on an annual basis, which is very useful.  I would like to learn a little more, however.  If he was asked to look at things again about how long I would like to know how long his work would take, how big a body of work it would be and would that delay matters in any way ?</p></speech>

I will address initially the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the ability of IS 465:2018 to be extended to other regions.  Our members undertook a survey about a year into the operation of the scheme to get members' feedback and the evidence from members and registrants was that they had seen evidence of deterioration in other counties.  Based upon that and on getting core samples done, which was evidence-based, the case was then made to extend the scheme to those counties.  The key thing is that any extension is based upon evidence but that evidence will require a great deal of testing.  We and our members are already seeing that there are considerable delays in having additional testing done and there is pressure on testing resources whereas, originally, a test could be completed and results could be back in three or four weeks.  That is now taking several months.  Mr. Brady will comment on what he has found.</p></speech>

If the scheme is extended, it will depend upon the timelines of the survey.</p> <p>  Putting things in context, we have been looking at this scheme since the end of the year 2021.  It took two to three months to produce this report, from start to finish and that was very intensive.  We were relying on volunteers, as every member who filled out the information is a volunteer.  To extend the scheme, if the parameters are extended and if we have to look at regions, we will need to consider how long that will take but there will be a significant body of work to be done.  Hundreds of hours were put into this report in analysing and in collecting data.  It took two to three months for this current report but it depends on the parameters of any extension to the scheme or to its terms of reference.</p></speech>

The information coming back is showing that houses in certain areas would have a minimum amount of insulation in their cavities and when their cavities are pumped with insulation, this seems to cause the moisture to cross from one cavity to another, even though the material used is breathable.  This is now causing issues and is accelerating the pyrite in houses that only have pyrite.</p> <p>  To protect people in their houses at the moment, and to protect the country and the taxpayer, would it not be the best thing for any house that is retrofitted with pumped insulation, to have a basic core test done?  At the outset, I wish to state that I have been a contractor for over 30 years and have seen this from first-hand experience.  That is one of the questions I would like to have answered because if it is proven in a number of years time that this retrofitting has accelerated the deterioration of houses that have pyrite, prevention would be better than cure.  Can our witnesses go on the record here and tell me, please, if they believe it should be a recommendation that before any house is pumped with insulation, a core test should be done to provide results on any house to ensure that it does not have pyrite?</p></speech>

On 8 February a retrofit grant system was launched for this country and the SCSI was present at the launch.  The figures given on the day were from October.  I deal with quantity surveyors on a daily and weekly basis.  I understand that regions can vary and that the price per square foot can change but quantity surveyors are usually given between two and three weeks to come back with a price for a project that we might be looking at.  Once you have the baseline set up on your system you can work throughout this whole country.  At the moment the price per square foot in Limerick is between &euro;172 and &euro;180.  I can tell the witnesses that because I am dealing with it on a daily basis.  I understand that the witnesses are dealing with different regions.  An insulation increase of 25% is coming on 1 July, news of which came to me by letter from Kingspan.  I get weekly letters from suppliers to tell me about the different increases on different products.  Some increases come every fortnight and some come every month.  Concrete and different aggregates usually come every month but suppliers of insulation might write to me every two weeks.  We have a computer system that updates that and shows, on a weekly to two-weekly basis, how fast this is moving.  That is why I have not priced houses in two years.  It is too dangerous to do so because one increase could take out your profit margins.</p> <p>  The lack of builders is also driving the price up because we do not have the tradesmen.  We are ten years behind in apprenticeships.  A figure of &euro;145 per square foot does not fit with me, no matter where you are in the country.  A figure of &euro;170 to &euro;180 per square foot is more accurate.  Can the witnesses address that point?</p></speech>

There is no doubt that we are in unprecedented times with inflation.</p> <p>  I will go back to the Deputy's point on the cost per square foot.  Our report clearly states that it is a snapshot in time of February 2022.  The devil is in the detail and there have been some comparisons done.  This needs to be compared and contrasted.  People might be comparing figures that comply with the current building regulations and they might be including foundations or more site works.</p></speech>

If your house burns down tomorrow morning you have to bring it back to today's regulatory standards.  You do not have to go back in time to the regulations from 20 years ago or from ten years ago.  You bring it up to today's standards so that is the square foot price that you would be quoted for today.</p></speech>

We met the groups from Mayo, Donegal and Clare earlier on and there was a suggestion that the SCSI had one hand tied behind its back in this.

We have stressed our independence in our report and we have stated clearly that we should look at the cost of bringing buildings up to current regulations.  We reviewed these remediation options but we did not pursue them because we did not feel it was possible that the costs that were expressed were costs per square foot.  What we have done is we have provided a useful baseline which informs the debate.  That is the reason we took it on and agreed to those terms of reference.</p></speech>

As a technical person I do not feel comfortable talking about this because we could talk for a half a day on whether or not the foundations should be included and that was a decision made by Government for the reasons it made it.  Our report was a live snapshot of average costs that we did to try to help society.  We did not include foundations.</p></speech>

I mentioned in my opening statement that the Minister recently requested that the NSAI carry out investigations and testing of foundations in the affected areas.  Once that report is completed we will be in a better position to assess whether foundations need to be addressed or not.</p> <p>  My second and final point on this is that, to date, I am not aware of any foundation problems associated with pyrrhotite in the country.  I have not heard any evidence of such occurrences.  That is not to say they may never happen but I have not heard of one instance of it across the country.  Nevertheless, the NSAI has been tasked with investigating and reporting.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that the Department is open to addressing the problem if such a problem is proven to exist.  No one is looking to turn a blind eye but we need proper investigation, analysis and reporting.  As I said, we are coming from a starting point where we are not aware of any such occurrences.</p></speech>

If we find evidence that foundations need to be replaced it would be logical to say they should be included in the scheme; that is fine.  From an engineering perspective, if you are going to replace the outer leaves - and I am referencing pictures I have seen of an outer leaf removed and of the floor being held up by scaffold, acrow props and things like that - you could replace the foundation as part of that as well then, if it had to be done.</p></speech>

That work is under way.</p><p>It is important to note that the standard relates to concrete blocks.  It is well defined.  Concrete blocks are not usually found in foundations.  The foundations are not looked at and there are reasons for that.  I will hand over to my colleague Mr. O'Connell to deal with the query on the outer leaf.</p></speech>

I have probably overseen and dealt with the repair of approximately 2,500 properties.  Like Mr. Forde, I have worked on both the IS 398 and IS 465 committees within the NSAI.  I agree with Mr. Forde in respect of the foundations.  He has not seen any such issues.  In our practice, we have seen three cases resulting from foundation damage, and that was primarily within the IS 398 theatre.  The damage was superficial and required only minor repair<i>in situ</i>.  There was no replacement or any requirement for structural repairs to the foundations.  I do not believe it is likely that we will see significant damage to foundations.  I am relatively comfortable with that.  The answer to the Chairman's question, which may have been slightly tongue in cheek, as to whether one could replace the foundations if the balance of the property was being held up on acrow props, etc., is &quot;No&quot;.  If the foundations are significantly damaged as a result of pyrite, pyrrhotite or mica, it is a complete replacement.</p></speech>

In the absence of testing of foundations taking place, how can Mr. O'Connell be relatively confident there will not be problems with foundations?</p></speech>

The matrix of a concrete foundation is quite strong.  There are high levels of cement and it is well compacted in the context of it being placed<i>in situ</i>in the foundations.  In our experience to date, we have not seen any significant damage to foundations when they are placed in the most aggressive environment.  That is why I have a relatively good sense in respect of foundation damage that may be arising from pyrite or mica within the concrete blocks.  However, we will only get the proof of the pudding when we start repairing some of these properties - exposing foundations and examining them in volume.  One cannot make a decision based on a very small catchment or number of properties.</p></speech>

I apologise if I am repeating myself, but I fall back on the fact that the NSAI has recently been charged with carrying out investigation and testing of foundations.  Moving forward, it will not be based on my gut feeling or that of Mr. O'Connell but, rather, on tested foundations.</p></speech>

They relate particularly to the infill and the material that was going to the infill and that is why the other parts of the structure were not affected.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connell may wish to come in as well.  In the context of what we call the pyrite remediation or what Mr. Lynch referred to as the east coast scheme, so christened by Michael Doherty, the remediation is to remove the floor slabs and the contaminated stone.  One does not have to demolish the house.  It is structurally possible to deal with that structural element in its own right but, in so doing, IS 398 specifies that every piece of stone under the floor slab has to be taken out.  That results in exposure of the foundations and, as part of IS 398 part 2, the foundations are inspected for signs of damage.  My practice and that of Mr. O'Connell have seen 5,000 foundations between us without having to remediate any of them.  I will again fall back on the NSAI report that is upcoming.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. O'Connell to come in after me.  I refer to the testing of the new scheme having started in earnest and core samples having been sent away.  Members should not forget the core samples are tested primarily in laboratories in the UK.  As I mentioned, those laboratories are now being swamped by the volume of tests they are getting.  The delay in getting results back is creeping up to several months.  As the results came back, it became obvious that there may be other mechanisms of deterioration and materials within those concrete blocks.  Going forward, we need research into the mechanisms of deterioration and the materials that are being found.  The NSAI is starting work on that  We are in a unique position here.  The demolition of several properties has been commenced, so we can get a full range of samples from across the property - not just the outside walls - to see where the deterioration is happening.</p><p>If we do that and have sufficient numbers of samples, and we need large numbers because, as was mentioned earlier, we should not make decisions based on very small samples, and if we can get enough samples characterised and tested, we should be able to produce characterisation graphs so that we know if there is a particular material in the block and a particular moisture level, we can predict its mechanism failure.  By virtue of that, one would be able to say how a property might behave or where it is on that deterioration path, and use something rigorous and based on evidence to guide our behaviours and our responses to the deterioration.</p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. O'Connell, for his view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.1153" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062300002#X00200"><p>Currently, under the existing IS 465 scheme we are concentrating on properties that have been damaged with muscovite mica and also with pyrite within the concrete blocks.  It has been brought to our attention that there is a potential new causation, which is pyrrhotite, which may be a contributory factor or may be a primary proximate cause.  However, there is another one as well which has not been getting as much daylight or publicity, and that is what we call weak concrete blocks in themselves and where they then undergo wetting and drying cycles during the course of their life.  Over time those weak concrete blocks break down and they effectively mirror the damage that one would see by pyrite or with mica, but there is no smoking gun.  One cannot put one's finger on it and say there is mica, there is pyrrhotite or there is pyrite on its own.</p> <p>  Ultimately, as Mr. Forde said, it is going to be the NSAI that will drive the research and drive the relevant checking.  We are looking for research to be carried out on the wetting and drying cycles and we are looking for some research proposals in respect of the potential impact that pyrrhotite has on the concrete blocks.  Pyrrhotite in itself is not a new issue.  We knew about pyrrhotite when we were dealing with the IS 398 problems.  The difference is that pyrrhotite within the infill material was reacting so fast, because of the type of lithology and the type of geology we were dealing with, that we were not really finding any damage resulting from that pyrrhotite.  All I can say is that one will not find Engineers Ireland, NSAI or any of the consulting engineers dealing with this problem lacking in their enthusiasm to try to categorically come down and find the cause of the damage.</p></speech>

Obviously, enormous credit is due to the campaign that started in Donegal.  Initially we thought the problem was confined to Donegal, but then there was Mayo and now we realise that the extent is far greater.  Limerick and Clare have recently been included.  Many believe we are still only finding out the extent of the problem.  To what extent do the witnesses believe there may be other counties affected by defective blocks and is there a possibility of including those counties in the scheme?</p></speech>

I went on record not long ago in newspaper and radio interviews that we have experience of 12 counties where we have seen damage.  As of last week, we are now on county 13.  That was a substantial amount of properties to be inspecting, reviewing and so forth.  One of the difficulties we are having, and I understand this is a public forum, is that the quarry owners recognise they have a problem and are suppressing some of the information and some of the damage and doing side deals with homeowners to try to suppress it within the counties.  Ultimately, I believe where all these locations are will come out.  I encourage people and Deputies who have knowledge of affected quarries, because I am aware of some areas in the southern part of Ireland and on the south-east coast where there are affected properties and they probably are well aware of where that material has come from, to come forward and give that information to NSAI or Engineers Ireland.</p></speech>

I will follow up on a couple of the points my colleague, Deputy Higgins, made in her contribution regarding the timelines to do the body of work and to redo it.  Mr. Mahon said that  two to three months was the parameter for the existing one and that he was reliant on goodwill and volunteerism to do the excellent work he has done.  He must be able to put an estimate on the timeline to do an enhanced version of what he has done given the extended areas we are talking about.</p></speech>

On the eight house types that were used, they are typical house types.  Mr. Mahon said that he does not view the cost per square metre as the best way to go about this.

Where we have the difficulty - it was in the terms of reference and we did not undertake it because we looked at it in detail - is in undertaking the remedial work options 2 to 5, calculating those and expressing them as a cost per square foot.</p><p>Many issues that arise are site-specific and can severely impact the cost per square foot.</p></speech>

Could I come back in?  I have very little time.  The foundations have not been tested for pyrrhotite; the blocks were.  In 66 of the 77 properties in Donegal, it was not just pyrrhotite, but an appreciable amount of pyrrhotite, that was identified.  In a separate survey by Petrolab, which is the lab in Britain conducting these tests, 97 homes that had samples sent to it for detailed geological analysis were found to have pyrrhotite.  My next question is for Mr. Forde and Mr. O'Connell.  How is it that the group that worked on IS 465 did not include in it testing for pyrrhotite?</p></speech>

At the time we examined the issue in Donegal and Mayo, it was initially identified as being a mica issue primarily in Donegal and a pyrite issue in Mayo.  I have looked at a large number of the properties in Donegal and Mayo.  Pyrrhotite in itself was not being identified as a problem.  Currently, pyrrhotite is not identified as being a causation of the problem.  It has been identified as being present.  I caution the Deputy or anyone else against saying that the automatic presence of pyrrhotite or any other type of material is necessarily a cause for alarm.</p></speech>

It is extremely important that I say this.

He produced evidence in a presentation to the European Parliament to the effect that, judging by the blocks that he sampled, pyrrhotite was unfortunately the deciding factor in the devastation.  There is a serious concern that pyrrhotite is the dominant issue causing the devastation in Donegal and Mayo.</p> <p>  IS 465 underpins the current grant scheme and the updated scheme.  We are spending billions of euro in taxpayers' money to remedy these homes.  Before that money is spent, do the witnesses agree that the science must be based on best international practice?</p></speech>

When the scientific results are available, they will be taken on board.  That is my understanding of the brief given to the NSAI.</p></speech>

Moreover, I thank them for their work.  Without their input, this scheme would not have the same credibility.  Their work is important.  The scheme has been difficult for people across the country.  When people are under attack because their homes are falling down around them, there is much uncertainty.  It is important that we as politicians and the witnesses as professionals treat one another with a little respect.  I respect the work that the groups are doing and what they have presented to us.</p><p>It is really critical and important.  Our witnesses need to be able to have their say.  That said, we had a presentation this morning and it was said there was evidence in Donegal of pyrrhotite causing many of the problems.  I ask our witnesses, especially the engineers, to ensure they contact the representatives present to make sure the houses that have been investigated are part of any investigations that are currently taking place by EI.  It is critical.</p></speech>

Even as part of work on the expert DCB scheme, our members were asked to provide samples, with names and so on redacted obviously, of reports and the findings and surveys so that information could feed into a body of knowledge.  I expect similar from the experts who presented this morning.  Any of their findings should find their way to a body of knowledge for the NSAI or whoever to undertake that research because until all the research is there, none of the research is there.</p></speech>

Likewise, there is the issue with the foundations because there are many homeowners in Donegal who are ready to go with the new scheme.  They have the background work done and are waiting for the new scheme to happen.  It has been turmoil for them but now they are afraid to go ahead because people are saying foundations are not safe.  Who do we believe?  There must come a point where people with background knowledge have to be trusted.  Not to disassociate from anybody else's view or cut it out, but the view of the witnesses must be heard.  As someone with an engineering background and being a former member of EI, I understand what they are saying but not everybody will.  We as politicians have a job to do to tell people current estimations are that foundations are safe.  There is no evidence to say otherwise and where there is, let us know about it and let us have it investigated, but for the moment it is safe.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to outline the difference between a foundation and a block.  My understanding is a compression test is the measure of the strength of a block or of concrete, for that matter.  It is between 5 N and 7 N for a block but for foundations it is probably between 30 N and 35 N.  That is probably six or seven times stronger than for a block.  Moreover, so many rural houses have their street in concrete as well.  Is there evidence of any concrete streets breaking up or difficulties and cracking caused by any of the issues being talked about today?  Generally, is the fact a foundation is so much stronger than a block and that there is so much more cement content factors in our witnesses not being as worried about foundations?  What is their view?</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connell might like to contribute and Mr. Owens might also but if I can go back, and I am sorry to repeat this, the review by the NSAI that has now commenced of foundations, involving testing, sampling and then reporting, will be scientifically-based, so that will be the ultimate arbiter of this.  I do not speak for Mr. O'Connell but I think he is of a similar view.  We have stated our experience and that is what it is.</p> <p>  Going back to the Senator's engineering background, he is spot on.  If the blockwork is 7 N and the foundations are 35 N, it is largely because of the cement content.  The foundation is a much denser element than the quite porous blockwork and the opportunity for moisture and so on to penetrate to the aggregate is much less than the foundation.  Hence, we would expect the foundations to be significantly more resistant to attack.  Mr. O'Connell might like to add to that. </p></speech>

I have already said the stronger matrix of the foundation is why I believe we have seen little or no damage in all the properties we have dealt with under the IS 398 scheme.  What I will also say is as engineers - and please do not take this the wrong way - we are going to be working in a live laboratory, as in, I anticipate we are going to be dealing with the most severely damaged properties in Donegal, Mayo and any other county subsequently approved and included in the scheme.  Being the most severely damaged properties, I expect when we examine the foundations we will get the best knowledge at that stage of what is the potential for damage to foundations for the most severely damaged dwellings that have suspect or damaged concrete blocks.  At the moment, our knowledge is based on experience and what we have seen.  Certainly, we will take every single piece of advice or bit of evidence from any consultant or any external body.  However, realistically, the best knowledge we are probably going to find is out in the field when we are repairing properties.</p></speech>

To reiterate what Mr. Forde said, when the NSAI study is produced, it is about that evidence base and we should work on evidence on this.  I am aware people have concerns and worries about possibilities but I propose we deal with the evidence where we can rely on that.</p> <p>  We move to the second Green Party slot.  I have two brief questions.  I will not take up the full time because I want to let others in as well.  This series of three meetings has generated quite a lot of public interest in this.  For members of the public looking in, what is happening these days that stops this from happening now?  How have we confidence these deleterious materials are not making their way into new builds at the moment?</p></speech>

There is an impression given this is nearly naturally occurring, yet there are quarries producing blocks that have not produced any problems and there are quarries that are producing blocks that have.  From the various expertise of all our witnesses, how much of this is so-called man-made and how much of it is down to specific actions that either were or were not taken?  I am conscious our guests do not want to veer into specific cases but I fear as we go along this is going to be seen as a natural phenomenon when the evidence says it is not.  I apologise for cutting in there.</p></speech>

We have heard evidence today that there could be ten or 12 other counties.  We do not know the extent or how long before these possibilities become apparent.  I want to know what is happening out there.  I do not know who can answer.  Perhaps it is for the engineers.</p></speech>

Much of the deleterious material currently being discovered through sampling and testing relates to properties that were constructed many years ago.  The provenance of some of the materials may perhaps never be known.  One thing that has improved the situation is the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014.  They introduced a chain of control for all the materials used in the construction of properties and how they are deployed.  We cannot speak about the past but certainly from 2014 onwards properties are constructed, there is a chain of control and quality control there.  Mr. O'Connell may be able to-----</p></speech>

The 2014 regulations do not relate to what comes out of a quarry or what goes into a block so in that sense the regulations are not in any way relevant to Deputy Calleary's question.  My understanding is there have been no reforms of building product surveillance from a building control point of view in the past decade.</p></speech>

It is a difficult subject.  What I do know is that in the areas that are very much under the microscope, namely, counties Donegal, Mayo, Dublin, Louth, Limerick and a few other counties, there is a large emphasis on the quarries to comply with the new regulations in terms of the maximum levels of total sulphur and mica etc. that are allowable within the aggregates that are now used in concrete and concrete blocks.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, has done a substantial amount of work in upgrading those standards, in particular, say, the aggregates committee.  But, as I said or intimated earlier, I do know certain quarries that are still producing concrete blocks and material that is wholly unsatisfactory and they continue to do it knowing that material is still wholly unsatisfactory.  I believe that some TDs and other public personnel do know that themselves and I would encourage them to try to use any of their authority to get it stopped.  It is only a few bad apples that are still out there.  Generally, I would say the industry has improved.</p></speech>

With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's comment about the C stamp, I agree with him that one can stamp anything.  However, the current material specifications call for what is called a declaration of performance, DOP, which Mr. O'Connell briefly touched on.  In my opinion, the product will be as good as the content of the declaration of performance.  Therefore, if the DOP is missing something, be it mica content or whatever else, those items need to be addressed.  The Minister requested and the NSAI has commenced on a review of the Irish standards with regard to the production of concrete, including the aggregates contained in the products.  I hope that will move us to a better place.</p> <p>  The previous Deputy commented that we do not want to see these problems as an occurrence of nature.  What I would say to that is the minerals are natural but a product is man-controlled.</p></speech>

Is it reasonable to assume that blocks containing deleterious material at some point made their way across the Border into Derry or adjoining counties for construction purposes?  I am sure we would have had construction companies working cross-Border.  Is anybody aware of a redress scheme in Northern Ireland?  Is there any learning?  Is there anything in place to assist homeowners?  Does it actually exist across the Border?  Is anybody aware of a redress scheme that is in place?</p></speech>

There has been much cross-Border trade in terms of blocks.  What is really remarkable, and we have a very large electoral presence in the adjoining counties, is that we are not getting any reports of properties in the North having defects that were built by block manufacturers in the South.

I think we are on the same page with much of this.  This afternoon has been really interesting.  I thank all the witnesses for their submissions.  Coming from County Mayo, a number of questions are still outstanding for me.  One thing that really struck me was when Mr. O'Connell said we are working in a live laboratory situation.  The challenge for us is that we are approving or helping to finalise a scheme that needs to be able to cope with that and be flexible enough.  I think we will find this in blocks and foundations in Erris and Belmullet when we go into County Mayo.  We know for a fact that foundations have been built with the same blocks that were used to build houses that have been certified as having pyrite in them.  We cannot reconcile the fact that the blocks would be different in the foundations than when used to build houses that have pyrite.</p> <p>  This is my main question.  What flexibilities do the witnesses recommend we work into the scheme so that when we come to the point when the foundations need to be replaced, whether it be in weeks or months, we can do so within the terms of the scheme?  By the same token, in terms of the total rebuilds that are needed, again, that has been verified across the board in County Mayo.  Obviously, we are accumulating evidence all the time.  With any of the homes I have seen, I have witnessed people trying to repair their homes over the last ten years and I have seen what has happened through the months and years.  To me, the repairs have been useless.  Who will be responsible for signing off on these homes if the work that is being done is perhaps not as insurable and is not then fit for purpose if it is proven to be the wrong decision in terms of the options that are chosen?  My two main questions then are on foundations and in terms of the total rebuilds that are needed and who will be responsible for signing off on that</p></speech>

How do we make the scheme flexible enough to be able to do that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.1276" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062300002#AA02800"><p>If the Deputy does not mind, I will take her second question first.  I have quite a strong point on that with regard to the exposure of the engineers who will then be signing off on the rebuilds.  Currently, I think Mr. Forde's and my practice are probably the only two practices in the country that have been able to get professional indemnity insurance to deal with pyrite remedials or works involving pyrite.  I was talking to one of the leading geo-technical consultants, whom I would say is probably number one in the country, only last week and he said he cannot get professional indemnity cover for pyrite.  Certainly, our own professional indemnity insurance has doubled in price singularly because of the pyrite issue.  It is not because of any claims but singularly because of the pyrite issue.  I see that as a huge problem and I have raised it with Engineers Ireland because getting affordable insurance, if any insurance, will be an absolute nightmare.  The responsibility is supposed to be with the competent person, be it a chartered building surveyor, chartered engineer or architect to sign off on these properties.  At the moment, however, my practice will certainly not be signing off on any of them because the professional indemnity insurance is going to go catastrophically high for dealing with these types of properties.  That is issue No. 2.</p> <p>  Issue No. 1 is in relation to what happens in terms of the flexibility of the scheme.  As I said, we are going to be living in a live laboratory but we will be dealing with the worst cases at the very beginning, which then means that as we progress through the scheme, we will be dealing with properties that are getting progressively worse or where we will see progressive damage.  I would expect that the scheme will be flexible enough to deal with that.</p></speech>

I am not sure if there is a bit of a lack of definition between what I was saying and what the Deputy asks.  When the pyrite problem first occurred in Dublin, we heard much talk of pyrite in foundations but there was no pyrite in foundations.  There was pyrite in stone underneath the floor slab but that seemed to be mixed up with what Mr. O'Connell and I, along with other engineers, would call the reinforced or <i>in situ</i>concrete foundation.  We did not come across pyrite in foundations.<br/><br/>The Deputy mentions the blockwork in above-ground walls having pyrite and blockwork in foundations having pyrite.  We call the blockwork mentioned as part of foundations, if I understand the Deputy correctly, the rising walls.  They would also be blockwork built off the <i>in situ</i>poured concrete foundation.  There is the <i>in situ </i>poured concrete foundation and the rising wall built in blockwork up to ground level.  There is also blockwork above ground level.</p></speech>

I am really sorry to interrupt but I only have a few seconds.  If somebody gets approved on the scheme and then finds the foundations must be replaced, how could this be integrated into the scheme?  It is wonderful that Mr. Forde has confidence that no foundations will be impacted.</p></speech>

The recommendation is for it to be set at 1.5 mm.  Given there was no analysis or there is no information on the existing DCB applications, how did the witnesses arrive at the 1.5 mm figure?  Dare I mention whether they could give the foundation of the process in determining that figure?  It is very important.  The experience we have had in County Mayo is that the so-called damage threshold was exclusionary more than anything else.  It is why I am so concerned about this and I want to understand how the figure and recommendation was arrived at.</p></speech>

As Mr. Owens mentioned, a sample of some of the redacted reports was reviewed by the expert group that gave some examples of data collated from Mayo.  We also looked at our experience of having remediated approximately 2,500 houses and the damage criteria assessed against IS 398, a similar type of scheme.  We also reviewed some other industry-recognised standards for determining crack width and damage to properties; they would be set out in <i>Subsidence of</i><i>Low-Rise Buildings, 3rd Edition</i>, from the Institute of Structural Engineers in 2000 and the <i>Building Research Establishment Digest</i>, No. 251.<br/><br/>Reviewing all those documentation and bearing in mind the high level of applications that would be received by the scheme, and with the ultimate aim of bring worst-case homes to the front, looking after and prioritising them, the collective group decision was that 1.5 mm was a fair and reasonable reflection of that threshold.  The group also recommended that it would be reviewed, similar to the Structural Engineers Ireland, SEI, costings on a regular basis.  This would take into account whether the threshold has held, if it must be adjusted or if there is information from other studies of the NSAI on whether it is foundation or core testing from the Housing Agency that will carry out the protocol to assist us in reviewing that threshold.  That will potentially happen on an annual basis or at the Minister's request.  That is how we got to that recommendation.</p></speech>

With one of the properties, the homeowner was forced, or encouraged, to sign a non-disclosure agreement prior to receiving a cash payment to repair the property.  I am not covered by that non-disclosure agreement so I do not have any difficulty in identifying the quarry in future but not in this forum.  I also have other cases, with houses built in recent years, and they are demonstrating damage with the same material present in both those properties.  That is in County Wexford.  I also have cases in County Carlow where similar practices have happened.  I have had phone calls from one or two Deputies asking if I know of problematic quarries in this area because they have seen properties with cracking, etc.  They wanted to know if particular quarries were supplying materials.</p></speech>

The information Mr. O'Connell has given us is very useful.  I will certainly be contacting Ms Mair&eacute;ad Phelan in the NBCO.  I suggest that Engineers Ireland has a responsibility to pass that information on, but not in this forum, for legal reasons.  I am aware of a number of quarries outside of Dublin.  On foot of getting that information, I have contacted the NBCO.  It has the statutory authority to inspect.</p> <p>  This is a very serious issue.  To go back to the question Deputy Matthews asked, there have been no reforms of any aspect of the regulated regime to ensure adequate compliance with the standards for the manufacturing of building products since this issue first arose.  In fairness to former Deputy Phil Hogan, when he was the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government he introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2013.  He made some changes - although they were not as strong as some of us would have liked - to the enforcement and regulation of the building process.  There is nothing stopping either rogue apples or systemic problems in our system.  One bad quarry, over a decade, can be responsible for the total number of damaged houses we have in County Donegal today.  Whether it is a few bad apples or something more, it is really serious.  I wish to put on record that the contact details of the NBCO are public.  The NBCO wants to know about breaches, even from those who have heard reports second- or third-hand.  It will inspect and enforce the regulations.  It is such a big issue.</p> <p>  I will raise a small point in respect of foundations, which is important.  The real issue here is not about foundations, block or infill.  It is where the aggregate that produces those things comes from.  It is possible that in the pyrite remediation scheme there might have been different sources of aggregate going into, for example, the infill and the foundations, whereas in some of the regional markets in the west, the same aggregate suppliers might have been sourced for the infilled foundations in the block.  That would mean that the gut response, which in fairness to Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Forde they have outlined here, may be appropriate on the east coast but may not be appropriate in the west.  However, we do not know whether that is the case because it was never tested.  It is important to make that clear.</p> <p>  I have three questions, the responses to which I think will be helpful.  Clearly the review of IS 465 is really important to the success of the scheme. I ask the witnesses to give us some information on where that review is at, who is involved, when the work is likely to be completed and, crucially, if it is possible for the work to be completed before the new scheme opens.  That would be the optimal solution.  Nobody wants to delay the scheme.  If any of the witnesses has information on that, I would be very pleased to hear it.</p> <p>  The second question is for the representatives of Engineers Ireland and relates to the issue of insurance that Mr. O'Connell spoke about.  One of my concerns in the way the scheme is designed, particularly for the remediation options and not the demolition and rebuild options, is that there may be conflicts of opinion between the engineer who was originally employed by the family to do the conditions survey and who may at a later date be asked to be the certifier for the works, and the assessment by the engineer working for the Housing Agency.  Ultimately, the test of whether an engineer believes an option is the right option is if he or she is willing to certify it and put his or her liability insurance on the line.  From the surveys Engineers Ireland has done of its members, are there any concerns about potential conflicts of opinion?</p> <p>  Finally, going back to the issue of foundations, nobody should be delayed.  The inclusion of foundations in the cost of remediation is not an enormous expense.  In fact, the exclusion of foundations is nothing do with the cost.  Our understanding is that it has more to do with the issue around whether a provider complies with the 2008 building regulations or the 2014 regulations.  Would it be a good idea to apply the precautionary principle, especially when the cost might be minimal in terms of the overall cost of the grant?  Has there been any discussion of the "if in doubt, leave it out" idea?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.1300" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien Owens" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062300002#CC00300"><p>I will respond to the Deputy's first two questions.  On the IS 465 review, as I understand it work is under way.  Engineers Ireland has already been approached by NSAI to obtain some views from our registrants on foundations.  It is also my understanding that a tender process has been completed to get research work done on the composition of the various components.  It will be for geologists to do work on the characterisation of the materials.  That work is under way.  On the question of how long the work will take, I have no idea.  There may be some indication made in the next session.  To respond to the Deputy's point, I do not think the work will be completed before the new scheme opens.  It will take time for the research to be completed.  It should be allowed to be completed so that we can go forward acting on fact.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's second question on the issue of conflicts of opinion, our members sign up to a code of ethics and they should avoid conflicts of interest.  The number of the current list of registrants is quite low, as I mentioned previously.  That will increase as the scheme expands.  The engineers working on the scheme are pretty much bound by geographic region.  For example, an engineer who becomes a registrant in County Wexford is not going to do surveys in County Donegal.  As the scheme expands, more and more engineers will become involved with it.  That will increase the pool of opinions in the certifying and signing off process.  Therefore, I do not have many concerns over conflicts of opinion.  I will refer to one of the other witnesses to respond to the Deputy's last question.</p></speech>

The work the expert group undertook, in particular regarding the certification after remediation works, attempted to provide some additional reassurance to both the homeowners and the certifying engineer by making a second grant possible.  This was also done with a very firm focus on aiding the conveyancing of the remediated properties.  One of the principal targets we had in relation to the certification was that it could facilitate onward conveyancing after remediation.</p></speech>

On the point that was made on professional indemnity insurance, we do not want to see this becoming a bone of contention as the scheme rolls out.  I have one quick question on that.  What are the organisations represented actively doing with the Government, specifically the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and his officials, to resolve the issue?  We do not want to see these types of issues raising their heads.  We would like to resolve them now if we can.  Is there anything we can do to help resolve the insurance issue and bring the matter to a head?</p></speech>

Indeed, we made representations in this House last year on the issue of professional indemnity insurance not just in respect of pyrite but also in fire safety.  It is an ongoing issue.  The situation has improved slightly in respect of fire safety insurance.  We are starting to see some exclusions being built into policies in relation to pyrite.  We are progressing that with the industry.</p></speech>

I ask the committee to liaise closely with the SCSI on that.  We publish regular briefings and reports within our annual timeframe.

This is the third of our sessions today to look at the Remediation of Dwellings Damaged By the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks Bill 2022.  We are joined by Ms Caroline Timmons, acting assistant secretary, Mr Paul Benson, principal officer, and Mr. John Wickham, senior adviser, from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage; and by Mr. Bob Jordan, CEO, and Mr. Peader Espey, programme manager for the defective concrete blocks grant scheme, from the Housing Agency.  I thank them for joining us at this late hour.  We appreciate it.  We have had two previous sessions at which we met with families and representatives of homeowners affected by the issue and with the SCSI, the expert working group and Engineers Ireland, respectively.  Those sessions have given us a good picture of the issues for all involved.  The witnesses' opening statements have been circulated.  We thank them for those.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House.  Witnesses attending in the committee room are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meetings.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite our witnesses to make their opening statements.  I will start with the Department and we will then go to the Housing Agency.</p></speech>

I am acting assistant secretary in the housing affordability, inclusion and homelessness division in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Paul Benson and John Wickham.  We are pleased to attend alongside the Housing Agency and thank members for inviting us to assist the committee in its discussions and deliberations on the general scheme of the Remediation of Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks Bill 2022.</p> <p>  The general scheme of the Bill is the culmination of six months of work and stakeholder engagement since the Government decision of 30 November 2021 on this matter.  I thank all who have helped bring us to this point: the Attorney General and his office, including the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, who have put considerable time into advising and guiding on the development of the scheme; the members of the expert group on technical matters, under the chairmanship of Paul Forde; the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, for its report on construction costs related to remediation works under the scheme; homeowners and their representatives, who have continued to engage with the nominated liaison as the scheme has been developed; the Housing Agency, which is taking on a critical role on behalf of local authorities under the enhanced scheme; and my colleagues, who have worked extremely hard on the defective concrete blocks issue over the past six months.</p> <p>  The general scheme encompasses the key decisions made by Government last November.  These include a 100% grant to an overall maximum amount payable to an applicant under the scheme of &euro;420,000.  Within that overall maximum grant, grant assistance is available for alternative accommodation costs at &euro;15,000, storage costs at &euro;5,000 and immediate repair works at &euro;5,000.  Increased grant rates in the scheme take account of a report on construction costs provided by the SCSI.  I note the rates are set to ensure that homeowners will get a rate equal to or greater than those contained in the report of SCSI for remediation works under the scheme.  The removal of the financial barrier to scheme entry which is a feature of the current scheme reduces the cost for homeowners from up to &euro;7,000 to an estimated &euro;500 to &euro;700, which will be recoupable under the scheme by approved homeowners.  A damage threshold for entry to the grant scheme will be set in order to ensure the worst-affected homes are first into the enhanced scheme and prioritised for approval and remediation.  The expert group has made a recommendation in relation to the appropriate damage threshold which should apply.  This is being considered by the Minister and will, when agreed, be provided for under regulations.  A second grant application opportunity is being made available to homeowners who are approved for remediation options other than full demolition and rebuild.  This second grant opportunity works as the form of guarantee which has been sought by homeowners and will remain available for 40 years.  Review by Government of the maximum grant amount and rates will take place as appropriate.  The extension of the scheme beyond owner-occupied principal private residences will include rented dwellings, to a maximum of one per homeowner, that were registered with the residential tenancies board on or before 1 November 2021.  The scheme provides for the establishment of an independent appeals panel and gives clarity on the four key decisions which can be appealed by homeowners, namely, validation of an application, meeting the damage threshold, the remediation option and grant amount, and a refusal by a local authority to pay a grant.  Clare and Limerick will be included in the enhanced scheme upon commencement, and further local authority areas can be added as the necessary evidence supports inclusion.</p> <p>  I bring to the committee's attention a number of other issues relevant to the scheme and the matters under consideration.  First, a review of a number of technical standards called for by the Government has begun.  These include the IS 465 standard for the assessment, testing and categorisation of impacted homes; consideration of the potential impact of other deleterious materials, for example, pyrrhotite, and the impact or otherwise of those deleterious materials on the foundations of homes impacted; the review of the Irish standard for concrete blocks, including aggregates; and the review of the potential impact, if any, of full cavity insulation on homes susceptible to damage or damaged by defective concrete blocks.  The Housing Agency is being resourced to fulfil the crucial role it will play in the independent determination of the appropriate remediation option and grant amount for each home.  There is the intended introduction of an Exchequer-funded scheme of assistance for local authority and approved housing body-owned social homes which are impacted.  There is provision for a review of the operation of the legislation after three years or sooner if that becomes necessary on foot of a change to the IS 465 standard currently under review.</p> <p>  Our Department made a presentation available for circulation to committee members which provided a recap on the current scheme, the challenges and issues which arose, how those challenges are being responded to, how the new scheme will work and the essential next steps to enable it to commence, which, I hope, members find helpful.  My colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions members may have or to provide further details as required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.1310" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bob Jordan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062300002#HH00100"><p>I thank committee members for the opportunity to speak to them today.  I am the CEO of the Housing Agency.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Peadar Espey, programme manager for the defective concrete blocks grant scheme.  The Housing Agency is a Government body that supports the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, local authorities, and approved housing bodies, AHBs, in the delivery of housing services and solutions.  Our work is framed under three broad themes: being a centre for housing and technical knowledge, supporting the delivery of Government programmes, and building capacity to address complex issues within the housing sector.</p> <p>  The agency's work that is most relevant to today's discussion is our experience in delivering the pyrite remediation scheme.  We have delivered that scheme on behalf of the Pyrite Resolution Board since 2014.  This involves carrying out the remediation of homes damaged due to pyritic heave caused by the swelling of hardcore underground floor slabs.  The Housing Agency has gained a lot of technical knowledge in delivering the scheme.  We are also acutely aware of the difficulties and disruption endured by homeowners whose homes have been damaged by pyrite, and we have set out to provide a service that is sympathetic, transparent and efficient.  By the end of 2021, just under 2,300 homes had been remediated.  We expect to remediate a further 300 homes, approximately, this year.</p> <p>  On the scheme under discussion today, the Housing Agency does not have a role under the current grant scheme but we have been asked to support homeowners and local authorities under the enhanced scheme announced by the Minister last November.  The local authorities are the scheme's administrators.  They are responsible for processing grant applications and for communicating decisions to homeowners.  The Housing Agency's role is to act as agents of the local authorities.  Once a local authority has validated a homeowner's grant application, we will assess the application by conducting a technical review of the building condition assessment report prepared by the homeowner's engineer.  The first step will be to determine if the home has met the damage threshold for entry to the grant scheme.  If the damage threshold has been met, the second step will be to prioritise homes for assessment, sampling, testing and categorisation.  The Housing Agency will then provide the local authority with the determination on the remediation option and the maximum grant amount, based on the calculation methodology and rate provided.  The local authority will then inform the homeowner of the outcome of his or her application.</p> <p>  In respect of our work to date in preparation for the scheme, we have engaged constructively with the homeowner forum group, chaired by Mr. John O'Connor, over recent months.  We provided three technical staff to the expert group and we have held frequent meetings with officials in Donegal County Council and Mayo County Council.  We have also been preparing our team.  There will be five whole-time technical staff working on the scheme, four of whom will be based in the north west, including programme manager Mr. Espey.  They will be supported by IT, finance and administration personnel in the agency.  We will keep resources under continual review based on the entry of additional local authority areas to the scheme, including Clare County Council and Limerick City and County Council.</p> <p>  The Housing Agency is in the process of establishing a framework of suitably qualified chartered engineers through public procurement.  We have conducted a market engagement survey of IS 465 trained and registered chartered engineers to establish their interest in the scheme.  This engagement has been positive.  Once the framework is established, efficiencies will be generated by grouping multiple individual properties within geographical areas for assessment and testing.</p> <p>  As we know, the scheme is being extended to Clare and Limerick and it is envisaged other areas may end up entering the scheme.  To assist the Minister in considering new areas for inclusion, the agency will be involved in assessing properties in areas where it is considered defective blocks may be present.</p> <p>  The Housing Agency is committed to supporting homeowners and local authorities affected by defective concrete blocks.  We aim to create a simplified, cost-efficient and effective process for local authorities and homeowners.  The Housing Agency will work closely with all stakeholders to build confidence and trust in the revised scheme.  We will collate data and support research to ensure the scheme and stakeholders benefit from the learning we gain during delivery.  I thank members for the invitation.  We are happy to answer any of their questions.</p></speech>

This has been a very worthwhile exercise and I thank them for their involvement to date.  Sometimes this issue has got very heated, but we recognise the witnesses bring a very important element to ensuring the scheme works.  We also appreciate the fact the scheme has evolved so much.  That flexibility has resolved many issues on the ground.  There are some more, which the officials will hear from members and others, but as far as I am concerned, I appreciate the changes that have taken place in the context of the evolving situation since the 90-10 scheme was announced.  As time moves on, it is important the Department does not take a position that this is now it.  The one thing I have learned, and I have been heavily involved in this over the past couple of years, as have others, is this situation is continually evolving.  Once the scheme is adopted, I have no doubt other situations will arise.  I hope the Department has the same approach as the Minister whereby there is flexibility because it is crucial to ensure these homes are protected.  It is also crucial to ensure these same mistakes are not made in the future.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  I will ask them together and the representatives can answer what they can.  If they cannot conclude, I ask them to come back with a written reply at a later stage.  When was the Department first made aware of the presence of pyrrhotite in blocks in Donegal?  When was the research tender commissioned?  What is the status of, or timeline for, this research?  How long will it take the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, to review results to enable it to amend IS 465?</p> <p>  There are a few other bits and pieces regarding the legislation.  Last night, one case in particular was brought to my attention where an individual was awarded stage 2 in the grant process.  On examination of the building since the start of works at stage 2, the engineer realised the damage threshold has now increased to the extent that demolition is necessary.  He is no longer willing to stand over the building because the legislation states the applicant cannot go to demolition.  That is part of the new legislation.  Will the Department take a look at that?  It is in the Department's interest to ensure it considers a situation where an engineer comes along and states a building has deteriorated since testing to the extent that it is now declared fit for demolition rather than remediation.  It is important the legislation allows for that because we are dealing with professional opinions as regards somebody's individual opinion.  I ask the officials to reflect on that to see if something can be done about it.</p></speech>

In the first instance, he mentioned the need to be flexible as the scheme evolves.  I will mention the fact a review within three years is already built into the general scheme.  In the meantime, many things could happen.  We are very conscious of IS 465 and the reviews that are ongoing.  The Minister has already expressed his willingness to look at how we might need to change the scheme as time moves on.  The Senator will find the Department is in the exact same position as the Minister on that front.</p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Benson, on the matter of when the Department was first made aware of the Donegal block issue.  He might also answer the question on the NSAI and give an update on that.</p></speech>

The Government made a decision on 30 November 2021 instructing the NSAI to consider pyrrhotite in the review of IS 465.  The NSAI has commenced that process and started that review.</p></speech>

A situation might arise in a county as dispersed as Donegal whereby an area such as Buncrana has an awful lot of these houses versus the area where I am from that has fewer such houses.  More builders may be available for a time, given that they may all be taken up with work in Buncrana.  The priority might be a house in Buncrana although there is a lesser house in Donegal that could be done now.  Because it is not a priority, however, it is not being done and there are builders available to do it.  It needs a bit of flexibility as well.  If I get a chance-----</p></speech>

I will rattle through a bunch of questions and if witnesses do not have time to respond, it would be helpful if they send a brief written response to the committee if possible.  These questions are aimed at clarifying the legislation to help us scrutinise the Bill in advance of it being introduced in the D&aacute;il next week.</p> <p>  In terms of head 13, will Ms Timmons or Mr. Benson talk the members through the cost underpinnings of the scheme when it opens?  When is the first review of those cost underpinnings, the unit costs and the cap, likely to take place?  How will that interact with the NSAI recommendations when the review is published later next year, just to give us a sense of the timelines?  Crucially, what will happen if, when that review takes place, construction sector inflation as recommended by the SCSI is above the 10% cap within which the Minister is meant to remain?</p> <p>  I am aware that the Bill, which has not yet been published, has something different to say with respect to foundations compared with what is in head 15.  It would be useful if the witnesses could outline in general terms what is in the Bill as opposed to what is in head 15.  My understanding is that there may be a delay in the NSAI review and that there has been a delay in the tender process.  What is the best guesstimate as to when that is likely to be completed and published?</p> <p>  On head 21, what will be the criteria for people to be on the appeals board, because that is not in the heads and how can we ensure independence?  The local authorities and approved housing bodies are obviously very interested in head 32.  Will there be a grant application process to which approved housing bodies and local authorities with defective-block buildings will be able to apply?</p> <p>  Some of us had expected that there might be something around a no-penalty downsizing clause within the scheme.  Was it considered and if so, why was it dropped at the end?  Will the witnesses reassure us that local authorities will get additional resources to be able to process the work when the new scheme opens?</p></speech>

What this is about from the Department's perspective is providing solutions to homeowners currently affected, many of whom we have heard from today, extending that right to people who might not even know they are affected and ensuring this never happens again.  I have a point to make about each of those three goals.  The first, on solutions to homeowners currently affected, relates to inflation which Ms Timmons touched on in her contribution.  It is an issue I am keen to hear more about.  As for the extension of the scheme, it has been extended to two other counties and I seek reassurance that the legislation is flexible to extend further, were we to find out anything beyond that.  To alert the witnesses, we were informed in our previous session today that there is a quarry about which there are questions on how it is operating.  What is the Department's response to that?</p> <p>  As for what Mr. Jordan spoke about, at this stage we are all familiar with the IS 465 process.  One query that was raised by homeowners earlier in the session was whether that process would catch everything.  Are we absolutely clear that the testing and sampling being carried out catches everything?  I seek comfort in that regard.  The Housing Agency goes to the local authority with its recommendations on building conditions assessment and the local authority delivers that news to the homeowners.  Why is the authority the conduit?  This is just a procedural question.</p></speech>

We all hope that things will change in that regard into the future.  </p><p> In relation to the extension to other counties, as members will have seen in the general scheme and as will be provided for in the Bill, the Minister may by Government order designate relevant local authorities to discharge or to come into the scheme.  We have already extended it to Clare and Limerick but if evidence can be provided in respect of other counties, the Minister will be more than happy to bring them into the scheme.  It is a question of the science.  The procedure will follow.  That is the best we can say on that.  </p><p> In relation to the query on quarries, I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Wickham.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.1357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062300002#KK00700"><p>At the outset, I want to thank the secretariat and the background people who have facilitated the sessions all day today.  I acknowledge their input.  This would not be possible without that.  I welcome Ms Timmons and Mr. Jordan today.  Given the time constraints, I will head up some headlines.  I will ask if they could supply the committee with some written responses to them, because they are quite detailed.  We have to tease out this legislation.</p> <p>  At the outset, I want to mention, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin did, the idea that the local authority is responsible for processing the applications and for sending on the validation of applications, etc., to the Housing Agency.  That is an issue of resources for the local authorities in question.  They may grow.  There are quite a few there, but there may be more.  I would therefore like some commitment from the Department or some detailed statement on the funding.  This will be a large body of work for some local authorities.  There will be a certain amount of work for the Housing Agency.  The witnesses might touch on the issues of the funding, resources and expertise that are needed.</p> <p>  I would like a briefing document on subrogation, how that all works and how that can be rolled out.  I will not touch any more on that.  In relation to the planning permission exemptions for rebuilding or for modifications of these houses, we need clarity on the issues of the exemption, which is an issue of concern.  The other the issue is the excluded counties.  We need to know more about the pathways for these excluded counties if they wish to be included.  It is my understanding, although I am open to correction, that Limerick and Clare are going to being included.  We need a pathway.  We need to understand the pathway for other countries to come in, if that is an issue.</p> <p>  I also raise the appeals process.  There is a suggestion that there will be a ten-person appeals panel put in place.  At this stage, we do not understand this ten-person panel appeals process.  I would like some information on that.  It would be beneficial to the members of this committee, as well as to all the other people who are involved in this process today, for us to understand that.  </p> <p>  I also raise an area that we do not talk about enough, which is the issue of support for the vulnerable householders and families, for example with counselling and support for themselves and for their extended families.  This is an important aspect and it is a separate part of the compensation.  Mental health is a huge issue.  I talk to these people in Donegal and Mayo.  This is a mental health issue because it is an absolute nightmare for them to be living in these circumstances.  They are strapped for cash, their houses are crumbling all around them and the State has abandoned them.  That is what it amounts to.  We need to hear about that.  We need a briefing memo or a note on the Department&rsquo;s intentions.</p> <p>  Finally, I want to touch on the issue of culpability.  The Minister was reported the other day as saying that there will be some sort of a levy scheme.  Levies on buildings and on the construction sector are ultimately passed down to the consumer.  I have some concerns about that.  I understand that the Government is engaging with senior counsel.  They will appoint somebody.  There will be this issue to address.  Who will pursue the wrongdoers here?  That is what the public wants to know.  They want their homes to be replaced, but they want people to be held to account.  Smaller quarries or people in building, construction and the manufacturing industry have been bought out.  I will not name them, but I know that two or three major conglomerates in this country have bought some of them up.  Who is responsible?  The public is looking at the committee today.  They are aghast by the fact this is costing billions of pounds.  Rightly, people need to have their homes.  Yet, we have got to hold people to account.  That is what the public wants.  The public expects us to hold people to account.</p> <p>  In the last two minutes, Ms Timmons might focus on that.  I have asked that there would be a memo or report on each new issue I have raised here today and for it to be circulated as early next week as possible.  I know that the Department has to give consideration to it and I understand that.  However, in the last two minutes, can the witnesses tell me what the Government's intentions are?  What are the Department&rsquo;s intentions?  What knowledge do they have on how we are going to follow up and hold people to account for this absolute disaster?  That is what the public wants, too.</p></speech>

We will do our best to get back to him.  We are happy to do so insofar as we can.  The issues he has raised are important.  I would like to mention that we are more than empathetic to the issue that the Senator has raised of mental health.  We agree with him 100% that it is an important issue.  We have engaged with the Department of Health on that.  It is providing the MyMind service to homeowners in the affected areas.  The Senator brought attention to an important point.  We can provide him with more details on that.</p> <p>  In relation to the levy scheme, it is the case the Government has agreed that a levy scheme would be considered.  At the moment, the Department of Finance is considering how it might be worked and whether it can be brought under the Finance Bill 2022.  However, I do not have anything more to say about that at the present time.  We can update the Senator in due course as matters develop.  The Minister has expressed in the past that he is keen, just as the Senator is, to get to the bottom of the issue and to pursue wrongdoers in this respect.  It was agreed in November that senior counsel would be brought in review the matter.  The Department has been working in the background to develop some terms of reference.  We will look to progress that matter with the Minister as soon as we can.  We will try to get the Bill to the end point.  Then there are other matters we have to pursue in that respect.</p> <p>  I will briefly discuss the other matters.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the appeals panel earlier.  I wanted to point out that the Public Appointments Service, PAS, will deal with the appeals panels.  It will be an independent process.  We will make sure the criteria reflect that.  The Senator mentioned that the local authority that is responsible for the process must be resourced.  We already have many processes in place whereby local authorities need resources.  We are conscious of that in our Department.  If there is a need for extra resources, we will look at that in conjunction with the local authorities, which will be able to inform us of where they stand on that front.  We are happy enough on that.  I apologise to the Chair, because I can see the time going.  We will come back on the other issues----</p></speech>

We know of the four counties that have been spoken about today.  Then there was a suggestion that this could apply to ten or 12 counties.  Then one of the other witnesses said this could apply everywhere.  I am wondering how does the Department gather that evidence to know the extent.</p></speech>

Obviously, it is not as clear in the scheme.  Sligo is going through that process at present.  Clare and Limerick have just gone through it.  It worked well for Limerick.  Unfortunately, Clare took a little bit longer.</p> <p>  If any homeowner has a concern, he or she can contact his or her local authority, the local authority can ask the Housing Agency, through the Minister, to carry out testing on a few homes in the local authority area, and if it produces a causative link between excessive pyrite or mica and damage to the home, the homeowner can get into the scheme.  Alternatively, the Minister himself can ask the Housing Agency to do that and it will carry out the testing independent of the Department and the homeowner to determine if it is excessive pyrite or mica, and the regulations will allow a county to do this.</p></speech>

Can Ms Timmons state how the public should have confidence that mica, pyrite or pyrrhotite is not getting into the building system at present?  What processes are put in places there?</p> <p>  I have a further question.  These materials must have gone over the Border at some stage, but how have they not revealed themselves there?  I would have said there is a stronger building control there, but how is that building control enacted?  Is it enacted on site when a delivery comes or through certification from the point of source?  How is that done differently over the Border than here and how did they manage to completely escape any materials with deleterious content?</p></speech>

We have the construction products regulation, which harmonises the rules for marketing of construction products.  To supplement performances that are required on a national basis, the National Standards Authority of Ireland produces standard recommendations.  They set performance limits on the chemical composition of particular aggregates and those are the limits and thresholds which specifiers, builders, etc. should look for on the declarations of performance that are an obligation of the manufacturer to produce at the outset.  Those standard recommendations are then referred to in our building regulations in our technical guidance documents and they perform the <i>prima facia</i>evidence of compliance with regulation.  Overarching enforcement of that regime is primarily with the 31 building control authorities, but now we have the strength and centralisation of market surveillance under the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office.  That has been a huge improvement in terms of looking at the extractive industries sector.  Since 2021, their programme of prioritisation would have to be focused on looking at aggregates for concrete and hardcore for underneath floor slabs.  It has since extended, in 2020, to focus on blocks.  It is a very well resourced unit.  In the past year, it would have carried out many proactive inspections.</p></speech>

People can have confidence that there is a good quality regime at present.  There is inspection and certification.  People can have confidence in that.</p></speech>

There is also a responsibility of those who choose those products to make sure that they are fit for purpose and that they are used in the right conditions.  A block, by itself, does not make a wall.  It is a system.  It needs render, insulation and workmanship.  Those are the components that ensure compliance with the building regulations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-23a.1371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062300002#LL01100"><p>Ten years ago or however long it may have been before that was in place, how did none of this block work end up in buildings across the Border?  Is there a different inspection regime or was it the certification from here?</p></speech>

There are many instances of product failure in other countries.  It does happens.  We have had a legacy of experience by working through the pyrite in the hardcore since 2013.  Due to the supply-and-demand pressures of the industry at the time of the Celtic tiger some quarries lost sight of the standards.  There are standards in place and they need to be adhered to.</p> <p>  To follow-up on the Chairman's second point about the system building control amendment regulations, BCAR, having more competent professionals involved in construction works and making sure that they aware of these standards, BCAR has led to a significant improvement and awareness of standards and, as a result, we are getting better quality buildings.</p></speech>

It is hugely under resourced.  Clearly, there is an issue here.  We have been told in the previous session from a highly qualified and experienced engineer with expertise in this area that he is aware of at least one quarry that is still producing substandard material that is going into homes and leading to serious structural damage in homes.  That is what is happening today in this country at the same time as this piece of legislation is in front of us which will involve very considerable expenditure.  While I agree there have been improvements in this area, clearly it is not working.  Is the Department aware that this is not working and that this is still going on and what is the Department doing about the fact that it is not working?</p></speech>

As I stated to Deputy Emer Higgins, it is important that the person who said that does not keep that information to himself.  He needs to bring it to the powers that be that are more than competent to deal with that.  Non-compliance needs to be marginalised.  The system is there.  It needs to be enforced.  That would be my advice on that.</p></speech>

It is really needed.  I would make the observation that given the massive trauma and stress this has caused families and communities across Ireland and the massive cost to the public, it is not enough for us to be reliant on stating that people should make complaints if they have knowledge.  If they do not, nothing will be done about that.</p> <p>  I have a question in terms of the legislation.  On head 24, the subrogation of rights, would it not be in the State's interest to allow homeowners to recover costs against third parties for non-grantable losses such as stress, depression and suffering that homeowners have gone through?  Can homeowners still recover that through legal action or does this prevent them from doing so?  On what basis does the State purport to inherit a plaintiff's rights to recover sums that are not covered by the grants for which third parties could otherwise be liable or are they still open to be able to take legal action for non-grantable costs?</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, this is an <i>ex-gratia</i>scheme.  It is a normal part of an <i>ex-gratia</i>scheme that the scheme would contain a subrogation of rights and this is where the Minister steps into the shoes of the party.  Therefore, the State may be able to recover some of the moneys expended at some point.<br/><br/>I take the point Deputy Cian O'Callaghan is making.  I will have to go back and talk to our legal advisers and consult with the Attorney General's office about the point the Deputy is making.  I cannot give him any further answer than that today.  What I will do is bring up the issue with them and have a look at it.  I will say that this is a standard piece of kit in relation to this type of legislation where it is a grant payment.  Nonetheless, we will take it back and look at it, if that is all right. </p></speech>

They felt that homeowners are being targeted in this legislation, and not quarries or anyone else with responsibility, on this.</p><p>The Minister has been vocal on the issue of recovering costs.  Some Irish companies are currently contributing to the UK redress schemes arising out of the issues relating to cladding in Grenfell Tower.  Can the Department tell us more about what is being done with respect to accountability and recovering costs?</p></speech>

There is no question of any intention to be imputed to that.  I disagree with what the Deputy said because there was no intention to that effect.<br/><br/>The Deputy also asked about the actions that have been taken.  I referred earlier to the Government's intention to appoint a senior counsel to review matters.  We intend to progress that as soon as we can.  The Department has been working in the background in that regard.<br/><br/>I referred the Deputy to the work of the Department of Finance on a potential levy on those in the construction sector.</p></speech>

People in that circumstance need to let the Housing Agency know that is the case.  For the protection of the Exchequer and taxpayer, we will be ensuring that if somebody does try to recover moneys twice, we will be able to recover that as a simple contract debt.  However, that will only arise in those circumstances.  I am sure it will be a rare occurrence that anyone would try to pursue it twice.</p></speech>

I will follow on from our earlier session and what was said about quarries that are operating at present.  While we are discussing issues that have happened in the past, defective blocks and the impact they have had on many households, I am acutely conscious of what is happening right now.  Is the Department aware, through dialogue with a local authority or through the National Building Control Office, of any quarry that is producing defective materials, aggregates or blocks?</p></speech>

That has required collaboration between State agencies, Donegal County Council, the National Building Control Office, as departmental lead, and the Geological Survey of Ireland.  The Minister has requested a report to be prepared for Donegal and we expect to receive that in the coming weeks.  Outside that scope, the market surveillance authority, as I said before, carried out upwards of 150 quarry inspections in 2021.  It has a heavy focus on the extractive industry sector.  How it follows up on those individual issues is a procedural matter.  I am unaware of any-----</p></speech>

Education goes a long way to improving everyone's understanding from the point of view of the economic operators right down to that of those responsible for buildings.  A lot is happening with regard to the review of standards.  We have in recent months produced a guide to make it easily understood by everyone involved what their responsibilities are and to ensure they choose proper products, scrutinise the declarations and performance of manufacturers, and send it back those products if they do not accept them.  It is important that all those in the supply chain take responsibility for putting proper materials into buildings.</p></speech>

Is the Department satisfied that enough is being done to ensure we do not have a repeat of what has happened heretofore?  That is the key question here.

Within the scope of the framework of the construction products regulation, we have ensured that Ireland, as opposed to Northern Ireland, will apply third-party oversight to materials where problems may occur.  That means each economic operator receives an independent audit from a notified body such as the NSAI, among others.  There are upwards of ten notified bodies operating in Ireland.  That gives reassurance around the factory production control with regard to the production of the aggregate and is intended to ensure that the means by which it is produced leads to a credible declaration and performance.  Ireland is unique in how it has responded with a level of oversight behind the factory gates.  That gives more credibility to the marketplace, reinforced with measures by the National Building Control Authority.  The focus on this risk of construction products and market surveillance in this area are important.</p></speech>

What visibility does the Department have in that regard?  Is it the director of services in the planning section or the environmental section in the local authorities who would engage with quarries?  Our guests are saying it is up to the goodwill of the quarries to outline adherence to the guidelines.</p></speech>

The National Building Control Office is heavily focused on the risk that is posed by the extractive industries.  The standards that underpin concrete blocks are heavily technical.  There are defined rules, boundaries and performance limits.  Primarily, the programme of market surveillance is dictated by the national market surveillance authority in conjunction with the 31 building control authorities through regional chairs.  The Department also sits on that group.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has a role.  We must keep in mind that aggregate does not just go into buildings but also goes into civil engineering works.  The Geological Survey of Ireland is also involved.  It is the lead agency with expertise with regard to geoscience.</p></speech>

Our collective aim is to make this scheme the best it can be.  Regarding the damage threshold, how can we avoid families having to live in a purgatory awaiting for the damage to be sufficient?  Pyrite is a terminal condition.  It does not get better.  The witnesses from Engineers Ireland said there would be different thresholds in different counties.  Nobody is ever going to say he or she has pyrite if he or she does not have it.  There is solidarity among homeowners in terms of the most damaged houses being done first.  I have no concern that this would not hold throughout the scheme.  Can we look at a way that ensures we are not in the same situation we were last year in Mayo?  We spoke about being concerned about the mental health of and the stress being caused to homeowners.  Good God almighty, stress was placed upon homeowners when they were refused permission to take part in the scheme but can we look at that to ensure that the thresholds do not exclude families and families do not have to sit there and wait for their houses to get worse and worse knowing they will never get better?  We really have to look at that.</p></speech>

Everyone who has excessive amounts of pyrite in their home will get on to the scheme.  It is a question of trying to bring people into the scheme at the right time so that they are not in too soon or too late.  One of the critical factors the expert group was asked to look at was not the just amount of damage or cracking but what the comfort levels in the home are because if they reach a critical point, you cannot leave somebody in that home waiting.  The expert group has made a recommendation to the Minister, who is considering other issues.  The feedback from this session will help.  The Minister will make a determination as to what the damage threshold will be but it is not intended to be set at a level that will leave people sitting in homes where there is no comfort - you cannot heat them or there is noise or wind.  That is not the intention.</p></speech>

I could suggest that there be different timelines so if somebody is told he or she cannot get in now or for the next 12 months but in 18 months' time, he or she will be able to get in.

There is a massive lack of trust among homeowners because of the way they have been treated.  Initially they ended up in the scheme.  The point was made earlier by one of the homeowner representatives that all of the key performance indicators in the scheme were on the homeowner.  The homeowner gets a deadline to provide information and a timescale to get it done and billed for.  There is very little on the Housing Agency and the local authorities.  What is the Housing Agency's view around that and putting in key performance indicators so that the homeowner will be treated with respect and will know when his or her application will be dealt with when it goes to the Housing Agency or the local authorities?</p> <p>  The appeals board makes a recommendation but the Housing Agency decides.  If the appeals board is truly independent, it should have the power to make decisions as well rather than the Housing Agency making the ultimate decision based on the opinion of the appeals board.  Can the witnesses from the Housing Agency clarify that?  </p> <p>  My next question is for the Department.  What is the timeline for the regulations if the legislation is passed before we go into recess?  What is the projected timeline for the publication of the regulations of the scheme?  I cannot overstate how real the issue of mental health is.  It is very specific to people who live in a home with either pyrite, mica or pyrrhotite.  There are homeowners who are appropriately qualified.  There are homeowners affected by pyrite, mica and inevitably pyrrhotite who have appropriate qualifications relating to mental health and they should prioritised with regard to support because they have walked and are walking the walk.  I do not think anyone of us here who is not in this situation truly knows what it is like to go to bed every night and wake up every morning with this problem.  This brings us back to the damage threshold.  I cannot describe what people went through last July and August in Mayo.  It was bad enough knowing they had pyrite.  To know that there was no future for them for those four weeks was cruel.  There was far more distress because of that than there was as a result of finding out about pyrite.  It is essential that the mental health supports are relevant to where people are.</p></speech>

This is why we are getting our team in place.</p><p>We have done some market engagement with engineers so that as soon as this legislation is given the green light, we will be ready to go and support homeowners.  We are already looking at our scheduling.  It is important for people to know when this work will happen and when it will end.  We will be holding ourselves to account through KPIs but obviously we need to wait for the legislation on that.</p><p> A decision of the Housing Agency may be appealed to the appeals board.  We do not have a say after that.  It is completely independent of the agency.  I want to be clear that no board member or staff member may be on the appeals panel.</p></speech>

Once it makes a decision, it can either direct it back to the Housing Agency or it can substitute its own decision for that of the Housing Agency, which ensures it has that particular power.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the timeline.  Obviously, the Minister has said he would like to try to get this done by the end of the year.  I caution that a large body of work remains to be done on regulations.  We are very aware of the importance of the work.  The team in the Department which has been doing this work has been working flat out for a number of months on this.  We will be trying to get those regulations out as soon as possible to enable the scheme to become operational, hopefully by the end of the year.  That is the timeline at this point.</p> <p>  I echo the Deputy's comments that peer support from people who have gone through it is always helpful with mental health issues.  We will bring that comment back to the Department of Health.  We have consulted that Department on the provisions of the MyMind service to homeowners.  It would probably be a matter for them to consider whether they want to take that point on board.  We would not have the expertise in that respect.</p></speech>

Mr. Benson said the engineer is not responsible for the foundations he does not put in.  He is wrong.  The engineer is responsible for the foundations on top of which he puts a structure.  He is completely wrong in the information he just gave.  Any engineer who has put a structure on top of an existing foundation is required to do all the tests to the existing foundation before he designs the product for it.  That means he is giving an undertaking that the foundation in place is adequate and correct for the construction of the building he is putting on top of it.  He has to sign off on it.  If he does not sign off on it, the insurance will not accept it.  I know this because I am in construction.  I am involved in renovations every day of the week and it is a standard practice.  What Mr. Benson is saying is wrong.</p> <p>  Mr. Benson said he has been involved in the issue of pyrite since 2013.  Why was a quarry making and delivering blocks around County Limerick and County Clare that now has 1,000 cases against it for houses on its own books?  As I am a bricklayer by trade, I understand.  Mr. Benson spoke about the difference in trades and workmanship.  Every section of every building we have ever done is overseen by competent engineers and other skilled people and if it is not right, they take it down.  It is all tested using certified materials.</p> <p>  I made a suggestion at the last committee meeting and you said you would listen to it.  Ireland recently had a census.  Every building that is due to get an SEAI grant gets cored, something the Department trying to drop out of this Bill.  The easiest way to test for pyrite is to use a chisel and chisel areas out or use a core which gives the full details of the blocks going through.  If we do not do a census of all the houses we are now retrofitting and insulation gets pumped on top of existing insulation making the mica travel from one side to the other, we will create a bigger problem for everybody down the line.  That is common sense.</p> <p>  Others can have titles and letters after their names, but I am dealing with this on a daily basis.  I can draw up plans and hand them to the structural engineer.  He will specify what has to go in and he hands it back to me to carry out the work with the proper materials.  In order to future-proof Ireland, the block work needs to be tested for every house that is going in for an SEAI grant, such as external insulation or cavity insulation.  It is a small price to pay.  We should then have a census in every county.  I welcome that Limerick and Clare have been included in it now.</p> <p>  As I said, I have been involved in building for over 30 years.  The same quarry has also provided blocks for public buildings.  We are talking about homeowners, we will now be talking about schools and public buildings after this where these same blocks had been supplied.  It was allowed to bring blocks from the quarry 12 months ago.  It only stopped 12 months ago.  It now owns most of the quarries around this country and is bringing blocks from different quarries.  Thank God, I never used its blocks on any of my one-off houses.</p> <p>  Foundations have gone in on rafts and the material is underneath the raft foundation.  Any house with an infill of over 900 mm is required to use a precast slab but most people did the infill anyway and put the precast slab over it to get rid of the void.  Some people actually put a liquid screed on top of that afterwards to seal it.  It depended on the specification of each individual engineer.  That makes common sense.  All house owners since 2002 have already paid tax on their houses at 13.5%.  Any house, back to &euro;80 per square foot in the 2000s up to whenever the rate went up, already paid &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 in tax.  In this, the VAT is included in the build.  On a &euro;420,000 house, there is &euro;49,996 VAT that is not going to them.  The maximum redress is not, as Mr. Benson has said, &euro;420,000, it is actually &euro;370,004.40.  On a 2,000 sq. ft house, it is &euro;3,600 at today's rate of &euro;1.80 per square foot.  I know that is today's rate because I deal with it on a daily basis.  That is a fact.  Mr. Benson has it is &euro;1.56 to &euro;1.61.  He is way off.  In addition, the Department is taking the &euro;50,000 tax back.  We need 100% redress.  The 100% redress means taking the VAT off to ensure that people can get their houses built to current standards which is what we want.</p> <p>  What engineer will design and build on top of a foundation he would not check out first?</p></speech>

The question I answered was not directly related to foundations.  It related to a different issue.  Engineers have expressed concern about signing off on remediation offers that might be recommended by somebody else.  I did not talk about foundations at all.  I said that the issue of foundations had been articulated well earlier and I did not think there was any value.  I understand the point he is making and he is absolutely right in what he said, but I was answering a different question.</p></speech>

The representative from Engineers Ireland and Paul Forde mentioned the difficulties they have getting professional indemnity insurance.  They mentioned that there were only two companies in the country getting professional indemnity insurance for pyrite.  I may have taken them up wrong, but that was more or less the gist of what they were saying.  This question may be for Mr. Jordan.  Has the Housing Agency factored that in when building the panel?  Are we discussing a scheme that may not work or will not get off the ground because of a lack of any professional indemnity insurance?  I suspect that position could be exacerbated by the issue with foundations and the delay in the foundation work.</p></speech>

There are 426 trained and registered consultant engineers, chartered engineers, in the IS 465.  As part of that we asked for confirmation that they would be able to obtain professional indemnity insurance.</p><p>We did get positive feedback on that.  We will not determine that until we eventually go through the procurement system to try to establish the framework panel.</p></speech>

The specific point made by Mr. Aidan O'Connell and by Mr. Paul Forde was that when pyrite is brought into the equation, and when dealing with pyrite or mica or any other deleterious materials, it was very difficult to get insurance.</p></speech>

It is a global problem.  We are aware of it, particularly after the Grenfell Tower fire and in relation to fire safety standards.  It is hoped the clarity we are trying to bring in with the research we are doing now and the technical concerns coming forward will improve the situation, but we will bring the point back to the Department of Finance.  If it turns out the Housing Agency does encounter problems, we will be feeding that back.</p></speech>

I back the point made by Deputy Conway-Walsh about personal circumstances and finance requirements for the damage threshold.  I believe it is only right that personal circumstances would come into that situation.  There are many individuals who are in hard economic and personal situations.  I would extend this further where certain individuals find themselves with a second home because parents have died who had applied for the scheme themselves.  These people now find themselves in a situation where they have applied for one house and have been left a second house.  I am not sure how to resolve that issue but it is a live one on the ground.</p> <p>  I also want to put on the record the concern about external boundary walls and garages.  The scheme should cater for external boundary walls and garages.  It is not as though the mica does not matter in those walls.  As well as that, many garages actually cater for many of the needs of the house.  In many circumstances the garage also houses the heating system.  I would like the Department to take second look at this.</p></speech>

The Minister has not yet set the damage threshold.  There is a recommendation from the expert group.  I mentioned many other considerations that also need to be discussed, including comfort levels.  These will be taken on board before anything is set.  The agency will then follow those and prioritise homes to be put forward for testing as a consequence of that.</p> <p>  On the other issue raised about boundary walls and garages, as a general rule they are not included.  As the Senator will know, it is just the structure of the home.  There is some flexibility within the Bill in the context of not remediating a structure that would potentially impact the structure being remediated.  The agency will have some discretion around that.</p></speech>

I have some brief questions.  With regard to the engagement with local authorities, including Donegal County Council and Clare County Council, what commitment has the Department made around the administration of the new scheme?  What current resources are in place and when will the actual scheme be up and running?</p></speech>

We have been in more regular contact with Clare County Council recently.  It has not been part of the current scheme but it is coming in when the scheme commences, which we hope is before the end of the year, assuming the legislation gets passed.</p> <p>  I will make one point about Mayo and Donegal councils.  They will have less work to do under the enhanced scheme.  The real heavy lifting in this scheme is the middle piece where somebody has to determine the remediation option and the grant amount, where the testing is arranged.  That work will be gone from the local authorities but they do have other work to do with their own social housing stock and the approved housing bodies.  A scheme is to be brought in for those.  That will mean resources.  The Department does not intend being found wanting when it comes to resources, either for the local authority or the Housing Agency.  Whatever is required will be provided.  It is a huge scheme with a huge cost.  It will not fall for want of human resources.</p></speech>

Delays may possibly be envisaged in getting the expertise.  Again, the locations will need to be validated and the merits of them will need to be assessed.  What does the Department envisage with regard to the required expertise within each local authority to ensure we have speed of assessment on applications that are delivered?  What has the Department discussed around this and what does it feel is required in each local authority?  Consider Mayo County Council as an example.  It is under-resourced in trying to get applications processed.</p></speech>

Donegal County Council has applied over the past year, and extra resources have been sanctioned on a couple of occasions.  Mayo County Council has not.  If it wants to make an application, we would be glad to process it.  I am sure it would get a positive response.  On the longer term resources we need, the scheme is very much going to be administration-based for the local authorities, with a little bit of technical input.  Most of the technical input is now moving to the Housing Agency.  When it comes to paying the grants, it will be the local authority paying the grants and it will have to carry out an inspection to ensure the work has been done and that the &euro;50,000 or so that has been claimed represents reasonably what has been spent.  That would be the local authority's role.  The big technical work is going to be done on local authorities' own stock and they would need significant resources to manage both their own stock and those construction projects.  Local authorities are the owners and they will have to manage the projects.  It will be a shift for the local authorities from what they are doing now to what they will be doing in the future.  The Housing Agency will step in and take on that huge heavy lifting technical brief.</p></speech>

A scheme is to be introduced.  The legislation will provide for that.  What is being worked on at the moment with Donegal County Council is that we will run a pilot.  The council has about 30 or 40 vacant houses.  It will run a pilot with one of the local approved housing bodies in Donegal to see what exactly are the administration, governance, and technical issues arising with regard to the local authority remediating its own stock.  There are more than 1,000 of them and it is a huge undertaking.  It is almost on the scale of the Ballymun regeneration project.  That is the kind of scale we are talking about.  It needs to be right and the only way to find out what the issues are, and to have answers for them when we roll out the full scheme, is to run the pilot.  The work is starting on that.</p></speech>

There is a huge amount of vacancy.  Even the census report we have received to date is delivering data on it.  We need to move on these types of houses, which are desperately required by local authorities to be put back into use.  Certainly, there should be provision for this in the Bill to move swiftly.  Every local authority should look to have these types of properties remediated and put back into use.</p></speech>

It is a huge bill of &euro;3 billion for the taxpayer.  Has the Department had any engagement with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science about providing expertise to the level of scientific research required to go into this type of redress scheme?  What type of engagement have the witnesses had with the Department?</p></speech>

Obviously, as was identified earlier, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, is doing the main technical work on that.  This is the correct body to engage with on that.  Geological Survey Ireland, GSI, is the other body involved in that particular type of work.  There has been no particular necessity to involve the Department to date, but we have certainly been engaging with the bodies under the Department and the agencies in terms of making sure we have the right expertise.</p></speech>

That is something that is glaringly absent from an academic point of view.</p></speech>

There is fairly heavy piece of research to be done there by the NSAI already.  If there are others, we would be very open to engaging with any other Department if we need to progress that.  For the present, however, we have very good co-operation from the bodies we are currently engaged with and we are happy with the reviews that are moving forward.  We are just trying to get them done as speedily as possible.  We are happy that the engagement has occurred and as further research is required we will reach out to any academic body that might be of assistance.  Obviously, that will be subject to a call in that respect.</p></speech>

Equally, it is right that the Exchequer should be compensated by those who supplied dangerous material, particularly when they did so for profit.  I return to what measures will be taken on the subrogation issue.  The Minister said in November that recovering money for the Exchequer is a priority.  Winter came to a close and two more seasons have passed since then.  Terms of reference for senior counsel have not been drafted and nobody has been appointed to look at it.  One of the big issues is statutes of limitation around this.  Whatever chance there was of recovering money if one moved speedily, I respectfully suggest that this elapse of time does not reflect any sense of urgency on the part of the Department.</p></speech>

The sense of urgency in the Department has been demonstrated by the speed with which this Bill has come to pass, which has been on a timeline I have not seen previously.  The Department is doing everything it can to progress all the measures the Government agreed in November.  We have been working in the background with regard to senior counsel reviewing this matter.  However, it will take a little more time for us to get there and we want to get that right.  I ask that the Deputy bear with us in that respect.</p></speech>

A breach of contract claim would be to put the person back in the position the person would have been in had there not been a breach and had dangerous and substandard material not been provided.  Let us say there is a claim for &euro;250,000 and the person gets an <i>ex gratia</i>payment from the State of &euro;200,000.  Is the person's entire claim subrogated or is it subrogated to the limit of what the Minister has provided in the ex gratia payment?</p></speech>

However, if there is a subrogation clause, there is no incentive for people to take legal advice.  Legal advice is not free and costs money.  Why would somebody go to a solicitor, say the person has pyrite and ask if there is a realistic prospect of a claim if there is a subrogation clause?  Realistically, people are not going to do that.  Essentially, what the Department is doing is transferring the risk that all those quarries have of being sued onto the Exchequer.  Ms Timmons can correct me if I am wrong, and I invite her to tell me that there will be a mechanism in place to see, in respect of the individual persons who receive a grant, if there is a case that can be taken on their behalf against the quarries.</p></speech>

To the Deputy's point that there is no incentive for them to do that, I will take that point away and look at it in that regard.  Obviously, it is the State's intention to pursue wrongdoers insofar as it can.  The point the Deputy is making is something that I will have to examine a little further, perhaps with the advice of the Attorney General, and see if there is a position on it.  I will not do that today, if that is okay, because we simply have not reached a position on it.</p></speech>

It would be obscene if the State was going to pay out &euro;3 billion and the only recovery mechanism is a levy on the industry generally, including those who complied and those who did not comply equally.  In any event, all of that levy will be transferred to homeowners, future homeowners and people who are rebuilding their homes because of a pyrite claim in the first place.  Some of the wrongdoers were named earlier.  One of them is one of the biggest construction companies in Ireland, CRH.</p></speech>

As that figure includes the &euro;20,000 relocation cost, the cap is &euro;400,000 in real terms.  Let us just work off the original figures cited by Deputy O'Donoghue.  The VAT impact on &euro;420,000 would take that figure down to &euro;370,000 in real terms.  If we deduct the &euro;20,000 for relocation costs, the cap on what the Government is contributing in real terms is actually &euro;350,000.  These homeowners have already paid tax and VAT on the original home they built.  They are being asked to pay VAT and tax for the second time.  Is it not time to be honest?  There has been a whole communication that the cap is &euro;420,000 throughout country.  Is it not time to say that in net terms, the cap is actually &euro;350,000?</p></speech>

At the start, I asked Ms Timmons whether there was consideration of a no-penalty downsizing.  If somebody was to get a grant of &euro;160,000 but the full cost of demolition and rebuild was &euro;190,000, it would seem to be reasonable that a person could take the &euro;160,000 and build a smaller home on the same footprint.  We thought that would be in the Bill but it is not.  Is there a reason it is not?  I would be interested to hear that.  I would also be interested to hear a little more from Mr. Benson about the pilots for the local authorities and approved housing bodies.  They are obviously very important.  It would be useful if there were some timelines.  At any stage, did the Department look at whether local rates of VAT or whether a VAT exemption would be legally permissible under the VAT rules?  Obviously, that is the big question.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I would have thought the primary reason for subrogation of the Bill would be to allow the State to recoup costs against its own expenditure, rather than some legal rules.  Will Ms Timmons confirm that is the reason?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked if someone does not take the case.  If someone does not take the case, then the subrogation is not effective.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  The State would step in to recoup the costs of the grant that is paid out, on behalf of the Exchequer and the taxpayer.  With regard to VAT, I am not familiar with whether we have checked whether it was legally permissible.  I can check and come back to the Deputy on that.  "No-penalty downsizing" is an interesting turn of phrase.  There is no penalty if one downsize-----</p></speech>

The important point to note for the governance of the scheme is that what we pay for under the scheme and what the grant is used to disburse are actual expenses incurred by the homeowner.  Obviously, there is a system of governance.  Vouched expenditure is provided to the local authority to show what has been paid.  It is a very different scenario that is being proposed in which something that has not been paid for would essentially be provided to the homeowner.  I have no other position with regard to the comment the Deputy is making, except to say that.</p></speech>

I will make an appeal because there are a few weeks left for this to go.  In the case that a homeowner is awarded a grant of &euro;160,000 but, when it comes to hiring a contractor to replace like for like, it will cost &euro;180,000, &euro;190,000 or &euro;200,000, I appeal to Ms Timmons, in her private conversations with her colleagues and the Minister, to consider allowing somebody to take the &euro;160,000 and build a smaller home when he or she is not able to bridge the gap between the grant and the full cost of like-for-like replacement.  That would be a reasonable request.  I will not ask Ms Timmons to respond now but it should be considered.</p></speech>

They did not include demolition of the property.  The figure does not add up to 1,900-odd square feet.  Demolition costs bring us back to approximately 1,730 sq. ft.  There is also the builder's finish, which does not include all of the furnishings the homeowner takes out of the house and has to put back in.  In an average house, that cost is &euro;10,000 for bathrooms and &euro;15,000 for a kitchen.  That is another &euro;40,000 the homeowner has to come up with to refurnish the house.  Will homeowners take down the tiles in existing bathrooms and put them back up again?  They will not.  The figures being cited in the square footage are for a builder's finish.</p><p>This means there is no paint, no carpets and nothing on the walls.

There is a realisation that not only in Donegal, Mayo or Clare because of mica but nationally because of the demand for building houses there is a lack of builders.  I have spoken to the head of the local employment office in Donegal who is very receptive to the idea I am going to put to the Department.  I suggest there should be specific courses run by the local employment offices for builders, as they have for people who want to run their own businesses.  Many people out there could become builders tomorrow but they do not have the competence or know-how.  We could use people such as Deputy O'Donoghue who is a builder or retired builders to work on a tailored builder course to help us have a sufficient number of builders for the mica scheme and to build houses throughout the country.  This is something the Department could take on board and consider.</p></speech>
