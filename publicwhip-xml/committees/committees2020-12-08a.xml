In the context of the current Covid-19 restrictions, microphones in the committee room are for members.  If non-members wish to contribute, they will be facilitated after committee members.  Members are requested to ensure that, for the duration of the meeting, their mobile phones are completely turned off or switched to aeroplane, safe or flight mode, depending on the device.  It is not sufficient to leave them in silent mode as that would interfere with the broadcasting system.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  On the agenda today is the impact of Brexit on the agri-food industry.  The meeting will comprise two sessions.  In the first, we will hear from representatives of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, who are joining us remotely.  The second session will have representatives from the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, Dairy Industry Ireland and Meat Industry Ireland.  The meeting will be suspended for five minutes between each slot to allow the desks to be sanitised.  In this regard, I remind members that there are sanitisation products throughout the room that should be used when taking or vacating a seat.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#A00400"><p>I welcome the representatives from the IFA: Mr. Tim Cullinan, president, and Mr. Bryan Barry, assistant director.  I also welcome the representatives from the Irish Natura And Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, who are joining us remotely: Mr. Vincent Roddy, director of organisation, and Mr. Henry O'Donnell, Donegal national council representative.  We have received the witnesses' written submissions.  They have been circulated among members.  With the Covid restrictions, we are very tight on time.  Each meeting must conclude within two hours so we are going to take the opening statements as read.</p> <p>   Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  They should respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts that the constitutional protection afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given as to whether, or the extent to which, the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  </p> <p>  The current position on Brexit is such that it is really starting to send shivers up our spines.  This morning, I learned that &euro;1.6 billion in tariffs is the possible cost of a no-deal Brexit to this country.  Ninety per cent of this will be related to the agri-food industry.  It really brings into focus the huge challenge we could face in the context of no deal, but even in the context of a deal there will be many problems regarding trade, including our ability to trade with the UK.</p> <p>  I shall open the discussion to the floor.  Members may ask questions to representatives of both organisations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#A00500"><p>I apologise as I have to go to another meeting shortly.  Witnesses may not be that familiar with the tripartite bloodstock agreement between Ireland, the UK and France but I will ask my question anyway.  I am aware that it is a slightly specialised area so I will be happy to ask somebody else if it is not within the witnesses' remit.  The tripartite agreement is on the movement of bloodstock.  In the region of 25,000 bloodstock journeys are made from Ireland to the UK and France and back every year.  That arrangement will, of course, come into jeopardy from January.  I do not know what negotiations the witnesses are aware of.  They will be aware that the majority of brood mares in this country are held by farmers with fewer than four per farm.  This is really interesting and it clearly tells us that brood mares are held right across the country, in many cases as a sideline for farmers.  It is a unique industry and it feeds into the rural economy and rural expenditure.  We are famous for our bloodstock, as the witnesses know.  This matter relates to breeding stock, travelling for racing and movements across the jurisdictions.   I realise it is a slightly specialised area so it may not be part of the witnesses' brief.  If they have  a comment on it or are aware of any negotiations on it, they might be able to share the information with the committee.</p></speech>

With any movement of animals, there will be sanitary and phytosanitary checks on crossing the Irish Sea.  I presume that if there is no deal, trading will involve a tariff.  I have all the tariff rates for agricultural products but I do not have them for bloodstock.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#A00800"><p>I thank both the IFA and the INHFA for their submissions.  Farming organisations have been acutely aware of Brexit.  Agriculture is probably the first sector to have been across Brexit, long before the referendum took place.  Farmers were the first to recognise the challenges that Brexit could present to Ireland.  As we speak, we could be hours - never mind days, weeks or months - away from a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>  The challenges regarding agri-food products are threefold.  The first concerns the all-Ireland dimension to our food production.  There is a need to ensure it is as seamless as possible.  The island is too small to have farmers competing against one another on an international stage, which is essentially what we are dealing with.  The second issue is the British market, the most important market for Irish food produced in the North and the South.  Access to the British market is crucial.  Not alone must we consider Irish food producers' access to that market but we must also consider who else will have access in a post-Brexit scenario.  The market could be flooded with cheaper imitations of Irish products.  The third dimension, which is crucial, concerns the fact that Britain is a land bridge to another important market, namely, the rest of the EU.  How do the witnesses believe we fare regarding the three potential threats, which have been known about since the very outset?</p> <p>  I have specific questions on the witnesses' written submissions but I will wait until others contribute and then we will see whether I have a little time in which to go into detail on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#A00900"><p>We have a very clear view.  The Deputy is correct in that, back in 2016, we had the first conference on Brexit, specifically on the all-Ireland dimension.  That is what the Government signed up to with the protocol.  We all hope the regulations in this regard will be adhered to.  We are all hearing about the Internal Market Bill.  I understand there is some positive news about it this evening.  It is critical that the trade continue north and south, but also east and west.  Specifically on the Deputy's question on the North&ndash;South aspect, as we know, there is an increase of 90% in the volume of live cattle being transported to Northern Ireland from the South this year.  This is critical to support the trade in southern Ireland.  In the region of 80,000 to 90,000 cattle will have been transported to the North for slaughter this year.  Half a million lambs are sent to the South from Northern Ireland every year.</p><p>Approximately 8,000 to 9,000 live pigs are transported to the North for slaughter each week, and 40% of the milk that is produced in Northern Ireland is processed in the Republic of Ireland, mainly in Lakeland Dairies.  The trade that is there is absolutely essential.  We want to ensure that it continues and that is our policy.  We want to be able to trade with Northern Ireland and we are very keen to see more movement of beef - and live animals in particular - to the North for processing there.  Perhaps that will help with the deficit in the British market.  If one looks at it, the Republic of Ireland has supplied beef to the UK market for as long as we can remember.  It is important that this can continue and hopefully the Northern Ireland protocol will facilitate that.  We put &euro;5.5 billion worth of food into the British market last year, which includes 40% of our beef, 30% of our dairy and 100% of the mushrooms produced in this country.  If something goes wrong and if we end up with tariffs, the consequences will be great.  The Chairman mentioned it already, and our figures are similar.  Our figures state that a no-deal Brexit will cost &euro;1.5 billion per year, which is a massive cost.  Compensation will need to be provided should that occur.  Two countries lobbied for a &euro;5 billion emergency fund during the negotiations in Brussels on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, earlier in the year, namely, Ireland and Belgium.  I know the French indicated last weekend that they wanted some of this money to be used to compensate for the loss in fisheries.  However, I made it very clear yesterday in the European Parliament that Ireland is must get proper compensation if it is going to end up in a no-deal situation with tariffs.</p><p> On the third country issue, that is a risk.  We want to ensure that standards are upheld and there is a level playing field.  That is critical.  The last thing we want to see is the UK doing a deal with a third country.  If cheap beef and perhaps chlorinated chicken are being imported, that will be very concerning for our market.  </p><p> On the issue of the land bridge, it is critical that the land bridge is maintained and that we need to get the best access possible to Europe.  It was agreed earlier in the year that there would be green lanes for Irish trucks going from Britain onto Europe.  That needs to be done and those lanes must be freed up.  We need to see measures taken around that and to be honest, I am very concerned about it.  There must be more direct access.  The announcement last week of an extra ferry route between Rosslare and France is a welcome development.  We need to see more traffic using such routes, because the checks that will be made on goods coming in and going out will slow the process down.  We have been lobbying for these measures for the past number of years, and all of the measures that are in our Brexit emergency plan are included in that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Henry O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#B00200"><p>First, on the issue of the all-Ireland dimension, as an organisation with many members, particularly in the Border region and here in Donegal, we see how critical the issue is.  We have concerns and as many aspects remain unclear, we need clarity going forward.  We need clarity on goods or animals coming from Northern Ireland into southern Ireland to ensure that they are always classed as Irish produce when they may be exported further on from Ireland.  We also need clarity on some of the rules of origin in respect of materials which may be assembled in the UK or mainland Britain, containing parts that may not meet EU standards in the future.  Clarity is therefore required on the rules of origin to prevent a situation in which products, potentially containing inferior raw materials that cannot or will not be used in Ireland, come into Northern Ireland and are later exported further into the EU.  Such a situation would create unfair competition in the market for Irish farmers.  There is great uncertainty and clarity is required.</p> <p>  As regards access to the British market, it is a huge issue for our beef farmers.  This access must continue.  Much of our beef currently goes into the market at commodity prices.  Forward thinking is required here, and we must look at planning for the introduction of a naturally reared suckler beef brand that could be sold at a premium price to Britain in the future.  As it stands, we could face huge competition from third countries with very low priced beef products.  We must start looking at alternatives that will give us access to the UK market and provide a return for our farmers.  </p> <p>  On the issue of the land bridge, we can see already that it is going to increase the cost of our exports.  It seems to be a fact of life at this stage.  Therefore we must look at the alternatives.  This could entail not placing so much emphasis on going through the UK, looking at alternative ports, such as Rosslare, and opening up direct channels into Europe.</p> <p>  Finally, I wish to make a general comment on the whole issue of tariffs and restrictions.  I am extremely concerned for the beef industry in particular, considering our major processors in Ireland, which also have a big presence in the UK.  The policy and interventions due to Brexit must take into account the primary producers, who must be supported.  What is good for the processing industry in this situation may not be good for the primary producer and all members should be cognisant of that fact.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#B00300"><p>I welcome the representatives from the IFA and the INHFA, and I thank them for their attendance today.  We have been discussing these issues since 2016, almost within a vacuum, and while we might be getting closer to D-Day, we are no wiser as to what the outcome will be.  We are all aware and have hashed out and discussed at length, the issues and the problems with tariffs, so there is not much point in going there again until we know what we are talking about.  Even without Brexit, we could still have a six-hour meeting today with the two organisations represented here.  Many problems and issues existed pre-Brexit, particularly from the perspective of farming families trying to make an income, so we would have plenty of issues to discuss, even without Brexit.  I am fearful that our eye has been taken off the ball in the sense that our focus is now 100% on Brexit, and many other issues which are affecting the sector are being neglected to an extent.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  There are sectors other than agriculture that are waiting on the outcome of the negotiations over the next few days, whatever that may be, and they have no idea how it is going to affect them.  From the night the result of the UK Brexit referendum vote was announced, the agriculture sector, and the mushroom industry in particular, took a massive hit.  The agriculture sector has an advantage in that we already know how it may be affected, regardless of whether the outcome is deal or no-deal.</p> <p>  Forgetting about whether or not a deal is struck, are there potential gains to be made from this situation?  I would like to know what contingency plans both organisations have put in place or how they can see the sector developing to reap some of the potential benefits.  Like others, I was shocked last week to learn that the humble spud was being used as a tool for leverage in the negotiations and to realise that there may be no chippers operating in Ireland if we cannot get potatoes in from England in future.  Therefore, there must be potential for the re-emergence of the Irish potato sector, not necessarily on a commercial scale, as was in my younger days, when there were a few drills or a half an acre of potatoes on every farm in the country.  Is there potential there, and do the organisations have contingency plans in place?  Have they looked at potential benefits that might come out of this situation?</p><p>Another point that is of interest to both organisations but perhaps the INHFA to a greater extent, is that depending on how Brexit goes, the Welsh sheep might not be going to France.  Is there potential there for us?  Could our sheep sector be a big winner in this if we are prepared for it, have our homework done and have plans in place with the correct supports from the Government?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#C00200"><p>In every crisis, we have to see where there are benefits.  There is a risk with the potato sector.  An issue was highlighted last week by one of our members, Thomas McKeown, concerning a scarcity of larger potatoes for chip production.  We will be looking at this with our members to see if farmers would be interested in developing a sector growing larger potatoes for that market.  On seed potatoes, that will always take time because there are rights around the seeds and so forth.</p> <p>  The Government needs to step up to the plate as well.  Everybody has been highlighting the costs and concerns around Brexit.  We must also look at the gains.</p> <p>  We have a specialised group of people growing vegetables in Ireland.  What happens every year coming up to Christmas is that the retailers put vegetables on promotion.  In some years, I have seen vegetables left in the fields and they were imported into the country.  We have a group of people growing vegetables.  The first call by any retailer should be for Irish produce.  The public's first call too should be to buy Irish, particularly coming up to Christmas.  That is an area on which we can focus.  Farmers are growing vegetables.  We must ensure they are better supported with some Government support around that too.</p> <p>  As I said already, every year 500,000 lambs come from Northern Ireland to the Republic for slaughter.  It is important that we continue cross-border trade.  It also works both ways and we can look at new markets.  Since the start of Covid, the food service sector closed down and consumers are eating more at home.  Lamb was always a product which did not sell in the food service sector.  We have seen a significant demand for lamb for home cooking.  It has also been promoted.  There will be an opportunity with lamb but it is about trying to find new markets.</p> <p>  For some while, I have been raising with Bord Bia as to why it, as a State body, has not been looking for alternative markets, particularly for beef, over the past four years.  The message going from this committee should be about why Bord Bia was not looking for alternative markets.  There is no point in looking for them this evening when we are at a crisis point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Henry O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#C00300"><p>There is an opportunity in general terms to increase the resilience of our farms and perhaps appreciate some of the farming systems we have that are not hugely dependent on outside inputs and imports.</p> <p>  I have already touched on beef going into the UK.  It is an area which will be coming under pressure.  We need to be imaginative to do something with our produce and not just be selling it is as the lowest cost alternative.  Traditionally, there is much trade between Ireland and the UK simply because it is cheap.  As to how sustainable that is for farm families is another question.  There has to be an opportunity for our naturally reared beef to be sold at a premium.  Farmers need help to develop this.  We have already looked at this with Bord Bia.  Hopefully, something will be initiated.</p> <p>  There is the whole area of the diaspora.  There are so many second-generation Irish in the UK whose parents or grandparents came from Ireland.  We have a connection with these people.  If we marketed our produce properly, a market could be developed which would have significant returns for farmers and be good for everybody.</p> <p>  There are definitely opportunities in the sheep sector.  We need to see how Brexit pans out.  At least the sheep industry can be developed in a relatively short time span.  Our sheep farmers would step up to the mark and produce more if they saw a viable return from it, as there has been this year.</p> <p>  I agree with the Senator on the potato sector.  As Mr. Cullinan said, it takes a bit more time to develop that sector but we have to be imaginative and look at things differently.  Just because we have had trading relations in the past, there is no reason why high-quality produce from our farms cannot be sold to alternative markets and, hopefully, even at higher prices.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#C00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending the committee.</p> <p>  Mr. Cullinan and the IFA were in Brussels in the past week or two.  The IFA has raised the possibility of stopping imports from entering the EU.  Up to 100,000 tonnes of beef are imported from the UK and I agree with them on the Mercosur deal.  Did the IFA talk with MEPs?  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, what support was the IFA getting from the 700 or so MEPs?  What was the feeling about stalling that deal, which would give us the opportunity to put more beef into Europe?  State aid rules have been relaxed but they will need to be relaxed more.</p> <p>  The EU is looking at the export of calves.  Will the associations agree there is a requirement at Rosslare for lairage?  Private individuals in France spent much money last year working on developing more capacity and being able to handle more of the suck calves going out.  Will the associations agree with more infrastructure in the line of lairage at Rosslare?  There are more boat journeys, which will be a help but these are weather dependent.  There is no point in codding ourselves on that.</p> <p>  Over the past six months, many bullocks and heifers were going across the Border and it gave a lift to the market.  Was this buy-in for storage?  In the event of this doomsday scenario, will more cattle be exported on the hoof?  Will we need to get prepared for this?</p> <p>  As Mr. O'Donnell has mentioned, there is an opportunity with the sheep sector.  Will sheep coming from the North pay the tariff in?  Will the sheep in Southern Ireland be totally different?  We know there are sheep coming in from the UK, such as stags, ewes and probably lambs, into the North.</p><p>I saw the beef one and the milk one.  Are sheep at the same rate as beef, be it on the hoof or slaughtered?  I have glasses but I might not have seen it.  </p></speech>

We have seen reports in the media about flying calves to their destination on the Continent.  Does Mr. Cullinan think this is practical economically?  Whatever figure we want to talk about, we need to export a serious amount of these black and white calves every spring to keep competition in the trade.  We see the results of the large number of calves that went two years ago in the factory trade at the moment.  Has the IFA carried out research into alternative modes of transport if we do run into trouble with the traditional way of getting calves to the Continent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#D00300"><p>I will take the Chairman's question first.  I was going to bring it up anyway.  The Chairman is right.  We must look at alternatives.  The ferry is important as well.  We want to ensure this continues but we are looking at alternatives because if we look at what is happening with calves, we can see there is a limited market for calves for the Netherlands because of all that is happening in the food services sector.  As there is a limited market for veal, we must look further afield.  Teagasc is carrying out a trial involving flying a plane with 900 calves to Ostend in Belgium.  At least if the calves can get there, it would be easy enough to distribute them right across Europe.  Flying is more expensive at almost double the cost but we could get into newer markets.  There is a demand in Spain, particularly for Friesian bull calves, but even for the Jersey cross calves.  There is a market in Spain for calves that might be 12 to 15 weeks old.  We might need to look at countries outside the EU to find new markets.  Again, this is a job that our food marketing body, Bord Bia, needs to be doing at the moment.  We have made representation to it on that point already.  The Chairman is 100% right.  We must look at where we are.  We have approximately 1.5 million dairy cows and 800,000 suckler cows.  If we are to keep those calves at home, we will have a consistent kill of well in excess of 40,000 per week.  As we all know what happens if more than 40,000 cattle are killed per week, the answer to the Chairman's question is we are working on that.  We want to see calves flying out this country.  Teagasc is doing trial work on that.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Fitzmaurice, it is very important that whatever must be done to facilitate calves going through Rosslare, also be done, be it lairage or something else.  I think it probably would be more important to know there is enough lairage at the other side when they get there, because there needs to be a resting period.  I get the Deputy's point.  If trucks go down to Rosslare and cannot get on a ferry, that will prove difficult.  As we are already seeing problems with trucks moving in France, that is also a concern.  Perhaps we do need a facility there to deal with that.  </p> <p>  Going back to Brussels and what support I was getting for a ban on beef coming into Europe, that was part of our submission early on.  We are putting approximately 240,000 or 250,000 tonnes of beef per year into the UK.  In the event of no deal, if the UK decides to do a deal with South America, that will be another 240,000 tonnes coming in.  Our clear position on that is the current Mercosur deal should be suspended.  Europe cannot take another 40,000 tonnes coming in.  In the event of no deal, I will ask the European Commission to immediately suspend all beef coming into Europe.  I am getting support for this in Europe.  </p> <p>  Regarding the buying of cattle in the South to go North, again, we are having serious negotiations with our counterpart in Northern Ireland.  It wants that trade to continue after Brexit.  What farmers in Northern Ireland do not want are carcases coming into Northern Ireland because we all know that if the meat industry is bringing in carcases, there is no guarantee they are coming from Roscommon or Tipperary.  Farmers in Northern Ireland are very interested in continuing and expanding that trade.  That is very important, which is why that North-South trade will be critically important in the future.  </p> <p>  Regarding more cattle on the hoof, we did meet another agent that wants to export more cattle to Libya next year.  The more cattle we can get out, either calves or on the hoof going to Libya or other places in North Africa like Algeria, the better but we have a market just up the road.  We need to concentrate on and put as much effort as possible into that.  What farmers in Northern Ireland want to see is those cattle going up and being processed in their plants.  There is a huge opportunity for Northern Ireland cattle to go over to the UK and supply that market while cattle from the Republic of Ireland could supply the domestic market in Northern Ireland.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Henry O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#D01300"><p>I do not know what happened with Mr. Roddy.  He was there until the last minute.  In order to keep our market at home relatively stable, we must move these calves so any possible alternative needs to be investigated.  Mr. Cullinan mentioned that Teagasc is doing work on that.  It needs to investigate that fully as quickly as possible.  Regardless of whether we are sitting here discussing Brexit or anything else, it is very important that these calves are moved out of our system.  If not, it will put even more pressure on our beef industry, which is returning little enough for farmers at present.</p> <p>  Regarding trade between North and South, what we need is clarity on how the Northern Ireland protocol will work.  If we have been promised a frictionless border between North and South, that is what is needs to be.  Lambs need to be able to come from Northern Ireland, be processed and be sold anywhere as Irish lamb - and I mean anywhere in the world.</p><p>We need clarity on that.  We also need clarity on the possibility of livestock coming from Britain into Northern Ireland and what will happen those animals.  We cannot have that as a mechanism to undermine our own industry in Ireland.  We need clarity on how that is going to be done.  Everybody knows that the live trade of cattle from the South to the North has increased substantially recently.  As to whether that is pre-planning or pre-stocking for Brexit, nobody is giving me very clear answers.  From a farming perspective, whatever happens with Brexit, we need that facility to be allowed to continue.</p><p> As I said earlier, I still have some concerns with our processing industry, which is very active in Britain as well as in Ireland.  We cannot have our primary producers manipulated in such as way that the only people who make any profit from the beef industry are the processors.  Whatever protocols are put in place need to be cognisant of that, so that farmers do not fall foul and be the ones in the middle and who yet again lose out as the primary producer with no power over the produce we actually produce.  Perhaps I might hand back to Mr. Roddy now.</p></speech>

I will be brief because I am aware that time is against us.</p> <p>  As for where we are with the preparations for a possible hard Brexit, what are the witnesses' views on whether the actual agri-food industry is prepared for it?  Are we prepared to have a dramatic tariff put on beef and on the dairy industry?  How prepared are those sectors for finding different markets?  We are 25 days away from a doomsday scenario that will probably have the greatest impact on Irish agriculture since the 1950s.  How do the witnesses think the food industry is prepared for that doomsday scenario?  I have spoken with colleagues of mine in the UK in the past few weeks about the sentiment of the UK market regardless of whether we have a good or a bad deal.  Do the representatives have information on the sentiment of the UK customer moving against the Irish product or the EU product?  Taking into consideration these dragged-out talks with deadlines moving continuously, there has been great unease within the UK public about this.  They have eventually bought in to where Brexit is actually going.  Do the witnesses believe there could be a backlash towards the Irish product, regardless of whether we have a good deal or a bad deal?  How could such a backlash affect the industry in Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.36" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#E00400"><p>As to how prepared are we, that is a very good question.  We have heard consistently from the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that we are prepared.  Personally, I have concerns around how all of this is going to work.  The Senator is right.  Obviously, a lot more people will be needed for the issuing of certificates for export and there will be IT systems all around that also, so I sincerely hope that we are prepared.  I have been asking this question for quite a while.  I am told that there are more facilities here in Dublin Port and in Rosslare Europort.  This is what we are hearing from the Government so I sincerely hope that is the case.</p> <p>  With regard to the agri-food industry, we will find alternative markets for the dairy sector much faster than for the beef sector.  I am sure members are aware that a substantial amount of dairy produce is exported to Asia and throughout North Africa and all over the world.  There is a more diverse portfolio of exports from the dairy sector than from beef.  That is important.  There is no point in saying anything else.  It is a very disruptive process that has been foisted upon us and is not of our making.</p> <p>  The larger milk processors were developing a joint venture of a cheese plant in Waterford and it is very concerning that while they had obtained permission to build that plant, An Taisce has got leave for a judicial review around that.  This is something the Government needs to look at.  This Irish company, in a joint venture with a Dutch company, is building a plant to get Brexit ready.  It is a &euro;200 million project.  Here we are this year in a country where unemployment hit 26% at one stage, and it is still at 16%, but a company that wants to invest &euro;200 million finds that An Taisce is holding up the project.  This is concerning from the dairy sector's perspective.</p> <p>  On the sentiment of the UK market, we have been doing a lot of work with our colleagues in the National Farmers Union in the UK, and with our colleagues at the Ulster Farmers Union in Northern Ireland.  From a farming point of view, they would much prefer to see beef coming from Ireland or Northern Ireland into the UK rather than seeing a trade deal that will bring cheap beef from South America into the UK because if that happens, the British farmers know that their market is gone.  I looked at the figures just last week and the British market has consistently returned 35 cent a kilogram ahead of the price in Ireland.  It is a very important market.  They want to maintain that price for themselves.  The only way they can maintain it is if the beef is coming from Ireland.</p> <p>  As for the consumer, I have spoken with some of the major retailers and they want a plentiful supply of Irish beef going in there also.  In that space we are working on developing a premium product.  I believe there is no better premium product than the suckler brand.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that Bord Bia has agreed, and together with the Department, we are in the process of setting up a group to establish a brand around suckler beef.  If developed, that brand could create a premium and get it into the higher end of the market.  This will all be a challenge but this is where it is at the moment.</p></speech>

I raised a Topical Issue matter on this a few weeks ago.  While we must respect the right of every citizen to object to a project, this had gone through An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which upheld the application, and a judicial review is now being used to delay decisions on it.  We have to ensure that the judicial system cannot be used to delay a venture such as this, which is trying to diversify our markets.  Every organisation has a right to object but we have to make sure that our system is streamlined in order that objections can get through the system in rapid fire.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.38" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vincent Roddy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#E00600"><p>On the last points raised, I will pick up from Mr. Cullinan's comments on the public sentiment, the impact of Brexit and how the British could view it.  Currently Britain does need beef, so we have to recognise that.  Whatever the sentiment is or is not, they will still need food.  Ireland is best placed to put that in there right now.  Going forward, however, there is the long-term concern that they may move towards other countries.  Mr. Cullinan raised the point, which we have also pushed, on the development of a naturally reared suckler beef brand.  This has huge merit and especially in the UK.  It will also have massive merit right across Europe.</p><p>In response to the point about sentiment in the UK, as Mr. O'Donnell has previously outlined, we have one advantage that most other operators into Britain do not have, namely, the first, second and third generation Irish.  While most of them identify as English, they still have a loyalty to Ireland and to Irish products and that is something we can benefit from.</p><p> A hard Brexit is a major concern.  We hope it does not happen but if it does, we must put in place proper supports for farmers, including direct supports and supports for intervention if necessary.  That will have to happen.  In the event of a hard Brexit, we also need to look at the impact on British beef and lamb going to Europe.  Currently, approximately &euro;500 million worth of British beef is going into Europe.  I know it is lower end cuts but there is a potential for us to make a play for that.  In addition, more than &euro;400 million worth of British lamb is going into Europe.  That is important but I come back to a point that has been raised over and over again, which is the need to make sure we can get the product to the market in time.  That is the reason the land bridge has worked quite well but, unfortunately, it is going to present major problems whatever happens on 1 January.</p><p> We need more ferries.  We welcome the fact that a ferry has been put in place between Rosslare and Dunkirk, but we believe that we need more.  We believe Rosslare is the best port to use.  More ferries are needed and they must be put in place.  Currently, the exports from Ireland into the UK are worth &euro;3 billion a year.  That is between meat and dairy produce.  Some 85% of that goes through the land bridge and that is not going to be possible from January.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bryan Barry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#F00200"><p>I think we should be clear, because we need to convey the seriousness of the situation.  We are 14 working days away from 31 December.  The best-case scenario is that we get a free trade deal and the best-case scenario is a hard Brexit.  The best-case scenario is a significant deterioration in the terms of trade with the UK, with the British market, which is the market for half of our beef.  We will have higher costs, greatly increased bureaucracy and significant difficulty in the other areas in terms of the land bridge.  We are going to have these difficulties anyway.</p> <p>  The worst-case scenario is no deal.  Mr. Tim Cullinan, our president, has described it as Armageddon.  That is a total disaster zone.  That is how serious it is.  Even in the best-case scenario of a deal, we will need access to the &euro;5 billion Brexit reserve fund that we lobbied strongly for.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and this Government and the previous one pressed strongly for that and brought it to fruition.  We are going to need support from that fund in the best-case scenario.  There is no doubt about the fact that we are going to be faced with significantly increased costs.  It is just a matter of whether they are going to be relatively limited, within the goodwill of a free trade agreement or whether agriculture ends up in Armageddon territory.  We need to be looking at the possibility of support coming in early next year, even in the context of a free trade agreement, for the kind of disruption that will happen.</p> <p>  We know that some of the bigger players in the industry have worked hard to put stock in store to try to get over the initial period, but we are going to face into a situation where the terms of trade are different.  Even under a free trade agreement, down the road, we can see our position in that market potentially being eroded.  That is why the level playing field is of the utmost importance.  In a free trade agreement, and in the current negotiations, it is important that the UK is tied in as far as possible into current standards, as well as into standards as they evolve in the environment and food safety areas, among others, in order that it cannot undermine the value of its own market and pursue a cheap food policy, which will affect us and displace us out of the UK market.  This is what I am talking about in the context of a free trade agreement.  That is what it has to be.</p></speech>

I will start with the IFA.  I welcome the presentation.  In 2016, the UK voted to leave.  In the view of the witnesses, did the Government, Bord Bia and even the IFA prepare and fight hard enough at that stage for what was coming down the road?  From the word go, we were told about all the pitfalls.  Mr. Cullinan said that he made it very clear to the European Union that a deal was going to be done at the expense of Irish farmers.  In a no-deal Brexit, Irish farmers are going to need all the support they can get.  It is frightening to think that we are waiting until the eleventh hour to make that point clear to both the European Union and to England.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned that we export 44% of beef, 40% of cheese, 100% of mushrooms, pig meat and lamb.  Will any particular sector be affected most by Brexit that would need more Government supports than others?  What way will farms have to change in order to deal with the demands of the environment due to Brexit?  Are we looking at the development of large-scale farms, which will severely affect small Irish farmers?  The likelihood is that the farming landscape will change.  What are the views of the witnesses on that?</p> <p>  The following questions are for the INHFA.  In talking about the development of ports, reference was made to how politicians and the national media have been primarily focused on Dublin Port, to the detriment of the ports in Cork and Rosslare.  To what extent are we undervaluing and underutilising these other ports?  Are the transport routes to these ports adequate?  Do the witnesses have any suggestions on developing transport across the country to facilitate the new way of doing business after Brexit, such as getting to the ports?  The Chairman is aware that one of the biggest worries in Tipperary is that all the extra traffic will go through Tipperary town and that the N24 will not be able to cope.  My concern is that a small town in Tipperary is going to start getting extra traffic that is going to the ports.</p> <p>  Has there been progress on the proposal to develop the naturally reared suckler brand?  That was suggested by the beef task force.  Surely that would be something worth pursuing, regardless of the prospect of Brexit.</p></speech>

I welcome the organisations here today.  With Brexit looming, in their estimation, which is the most exposed sector in terms of the risk in agriculture?  A lot of discussions are going on at the moment and there is a savage focus on fisheries.  Last week, Michel Barnier was offering 18% more of Irish fish stocks to the UK.  That is quite serious, and I do not think that point has been picked up at all by the State.  Are we just going to blindly go along with it and let our fishing industry go under?  Are we offering 18% of agriculture as well?  If we are, then will the 20% of lamb that we export be reduced to 2%?  Where are we going to lose out most?  Companies such as Carbery Group Limited in Ballineen, in my constituency, which is a great employer, has done much work in recent years to prepare.  Are many companies prepared for what is going to happen next?</p><p>The question as to whether we have access to new markets has already been answered.  Mr. Cullinan referred to flying calves to Belgium and such countries.  Is there access to new markets for cheese, and probably the pig and lamb sectors as well?</p></speech>

I welcome the delegations to the meeting.  We are talking about being prepared.  This is something new for everybody.  No matter how well we are prepared, there will be very serious problems.  Farming organisations and farmers, particularly in this country, need the support of Europe on this occasion.  Everybody is talking about the effect it will have on Ireland, but Britain exports many goods to Ireland.  There will be a knock-on effect in that regard.  I hope there will be a deal because farmers have suffered enough in recent years.  The situation at this time might not be perfect but the cattle and sheep sectors are both going a little bit better than they were.  We were prepared and we were sending a significant amount of beef abroad.  I hope that Bord Bia, the Government and everybody else are out there looking for new markets.</p> <p>  Mr. Cullinan is correct that if there is a no-deal Brexit, there will also have to be no deal in terms of food being imported into Europe on top of the deal that is already in place whereby food may be brought into Europe.  What we cannot allow to happen is for companies from outside the EU to start exporting cheap food to Britain, which would affect Irish farmers.  If the rest of Europe stands by on that issue, we are the ones who will suffer most.  We must ensure that Europe is 100% behind us and supportive of us.  It will have to be supportive of Irish farmers, particularly in terms of funding.  I know there are several schemes.  The French are looking for funding and everybody else will be looking for it, but we will be the ones affected most by this and we need the support of both the Government and the European Union to ensure they give us the funding we need.  I hope we are ready.  We do not know what is coming down the line; nobody does.  No matter how well prepared we are, we just do not know what will happen.</p> <p>  If there is one thing they are good at in Europe and we are good at in Ireland, it is bureaucracy.  By God, if we are going to have more paperwork and more hold-ups at ports and elsewhere, we have a serious problem coming down the line.  If there is one thing we are good at, it is paperwork and holding people back.  To give a simple example, who did the Garda Covid checkpoints set up at the behest of the Government affect most in recent weeks?  As other members will verify, ordinary decent people travelling to work or coming home from work in the evening were held up for an hour and a half.  Those are not the people who should have been targeted.  I am afraid the same thing will happen if there is a no-deal Brexit.  Let us all hope that a deal will be done this evening or tomorrow.  That is important for Ireland, Britain and Europe.  The British are exporting many goods into this country and I hope we will be ready to take a strong stand against them as well.</p></speech>

The UK voted to leave in 2016.  He asked a straight question, that is, what was the IFA doing about it.  We were centre stage and out front before any Government or other organisation.  We held a conference in Goffs, County Kildare.  It was attended by Phil Hogan, the then Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development.  We explained to him how serious the situation was.  The IFA has the benefit of being linked to COPA-COGECA in Brussels.  We have been highlighting the issue there.  To be honest, the Deputy is correct.  We wish to be clear that we are a small nation on the periphery of Europe.  We are the country that will be most affected by this.  The IFA has been highlighting that since the night of the Brexit vote.  We have seen the consequences that can occur.  We are seeing that playing out this evening again.  I do not know what the Government was doing.  It was probably slower off the mark than the IFA was.  In fairness, I suppose it was difficult for the Government because the negotiations are between the UK and the EU.  That is still the case.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked which sector is most affected?  An important sector in the Deputy's part of County Tipperary is the mushroom sector.  The mushroom trade was wiped out at an early stage.  All sectors in agriculture will be seriously affected, but the mushroom and beef sectors are the two critical ones that will be affected.</p> <p>  As regards big farms, this has nothing to do with being a big farmer or a small farmer.  It will affect every farmer straight up.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the suckler brand and asked where that is at with the beef task force.  It was agreed in principle that a stakeholder group would be set up by the Minister to drive this new brand for beef.  There will be a meeting of the beef task force.  My understanding is there will be another meeting next week.  I will be taking up the issue at that meeting.  My understanding is that the group must be set up at the next meeting and it will start implementing measures around developing that brand going forward.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Collins asked almost the same question regarding which sector will be most at risk.  He asked about cheese.  I know that one of the larger retailers in Ireland was processing Irish cheese in the UK but it has diverted it back to Deputy Collins's county.  That cheese is being processed in Cork as we speak.</p> <p>  I do not represent fishermen but I do represent the aquaculture sector.  It is another sector in respect of which there are many issues.  We will not get into that this evening.  The fishery sector has been sacrificed for many years.  What is going on there is concerning.</p> <p>  Deputy Ring made the point that farmers need support from Europe.  We have been front and centre on that issue.  I was one of the people lobbying in Europe for that funding last summer.  As I stated, very few other member states were doing so.  It is important that the message be taken from this meeting of the committee that there were two countries seeking that &euro;5 billion, of which we were one.  The IFA was centre stage with the Taoiseach last July in that regard.  We have to ensure as much as possible that the money is ring-fenced for Ireland.  In the European Parliament last night there was significant support from other member states for our situation, which is very important.  We want to work on that.</p> <p>  On the issue of the cost of food, Deputy Ring raised a very important point that I raised yesterday.  There are imports coming into this country.  We are all going to suffer; it is not just farmers who will suffer.  Every citizen of this country will suffer because of Brexit.  Once there are restrictions on product coming into the country, the cost of food will only go in one direction.  If a product is scarce, all present know that it will cost more.</p> <p>  On the role of the Government, the state aid rules were lifted during Covid.  That has to be continued because the Government is going to have to put its hand in its pocket and co-fund money we are getting from Europe.  This situation is going to cost billions of euro.  The cost for agriculture alone will be &euro;1.5 billion for agriculture per year.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy regarding paperwork.  The last thing any farmer wishes to see is more paperwork.  It is absolutely essential that it is kept to a minimum.  </p> <p>  On the issue of standards, that goes back again to the level playing field.  We have been consistently lobbying on this issue.  In fairness, our colleagues in farm organisations in the UK and Northern Ireland have asked me specifically to help them lobby on standards.  We were trying to get that message driven home from the very start of this process.  </p> <p>  My final word on this is that the key issue is that, obviously, we wish to see a deal being struck.  We are very concerned by the situation as of this evening.  If we do not get a deal, funding will be absolutely critical for this sector going forward.</p></speech>

We need to consider developing the other ports.  There is no point saying otherwise.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, or any Brexit, we will definitely need the other ports.  Rosslare is the obvious choice.  I understand the access into Rosslare Port is quite good.  That is what hauliers have told us.  Rosslare is the obvious one.  Cork is another option but the connectivity into Cork Port in particular may not be as good.</p><p>We definitely need that motorway from Cork to Limerick.  That would help because it would open up the entire western corridor.  As regards the point on the naturally reared suckler beef brand, as Mr. Cullinan has said, there will be a meeting of the beef task force on this issue next week.  The beef task force will be working on it.  The plan is to set up a committee to put in place and oversee that brand.  The Deputy is absolutely right; that needs to happen regardless of Brexit.  It probably should have happened a long time ago.  It is something from which we can benefit in the UK market, as we have said, but also in the European market and, possibly, beyond.</p><p> On the point Deputy Michael Collins made on the comparison between fisheries and agriculture and on what is happening in that regard, we obviously need to ensure that proposed cut of 18% in the quota for fisheries is not replicated in the farming industry.  I also imagine that cut is not wanted in the fishing industry.  The Deputy mentioned other markets.  Clearly, we need to look at European markets but we also need to look beyond.  I know a number of trade delegations have gone to China and other places to develop other markets but that Irish in England is a massive asset and it is time to play that card strongly, especially through the use of brands such as that of the naturally reared suckler beef.</p><p> Fair play to Deputy Ring; he is absolutely right.  Farmers do need that support.  There is no doubt that we need direct and indirect support for products when required.  As regards paperwork, from talking to hauliers we know that the compliance measures that will be in place after 1 January are going to be a nightmare.  I encourage people to talk again to the hauliers.  They have some suggestions as to how some of these requirements could be made more manageable.  I encourage people to do that.</p></speech>

The next number of hours, days and weeks will have a huge impact on the agri-food sector in the broadest sense.  I will try to be as brief as possible with my questions because a number of speakers want to come in and there are questions with the Minister shortly in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  My first question is for both ICOS and Dairy Industry Ireland.  In their submissions, they indicated a number of schemes and supports that are required in order to support their industry, particularly in a no-deal scenario.  I take it that a number of them will be required even if there is a free trade deal because that would not be as free as what is currently there.  I see proposals relating to export credit insurance, labelling and existing and future EU trade agreements.  Considering that we are a month from the deadline and the issue of Brexit has been going on since 2016, to be generous, how far on are we in respect of these proposals?  In other words, are the witnesses confident that the measures their sectors need have been put in place by the Government and the European Union in order to protect them?</p> <p>  My next question is for Meat Industry Ireland.  One of the biggest fears I hear is that farmers will be caught in the middle and the outworkings of Brexit will be manipulated as regards prices.  What measures is Meat Industry Ireland putting in place to protect the prices it pays farmers going forward?  What reorganisation measures is it putting in place in order to ensure the stream of Irish food that comes through its factories is sold on the international market to garner the best possible price, and that that price is in turn passed on to the farmers, the primary producers?  I refer in particular to the short-term implications.  Can we be assured, come January, that we will not see a severe drop in the prices being received from factories?</p> <p>  As regards the structure of the meat sector, and considering the sizeable potential impact Brexit could bring about, have there been any discussions at a macro level within Meat Industry Ireland about the industry playing a patriotic role and contributing back to our society?  Do Meat Industry Ireland's member companies intend to remove the structures whereby they are registered in places like Luxembourg and other third countries and revert back to Ireland?  Meat Industry Ireland's opening statement mentioned that the sector directly employs 16,000 people.  Of course, every job is welcome.  Of those 16,000 people, how many are employed by agencies?  Does the organisation intend to encourage its members to redirect their emphasis so that these workers are directly employed in meat plants in our communities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.55" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#J00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question, which is very relevant.  From a dairy industry perspective, there is huge exposure to the UK market, especially in the context of the cheddar cheese side of the business.  As Members are probably aware, about 6.7 billion l of milk are produced in Ireland every year, of which about 700,000 l are consumed domestically, and the rest has to be exported.  Approximately 2 billion l of that milk would go into cheddar cheese production alone, and 60% of that goes to the UK.  The Irish dairy industry is hugely exposed to the UK market from a cheddar cheese point of view alone.  It is natural that the UK market was a target market for the Irish dairy industry traditionally, as we share the same values, the same culture, the same language, the same food tastes and so forth.  Cheddar cheese would be regarded as UK-type cheese and there is a limited market for it outside the UK.  That would probably be the biggest exposure for the Irish dairy industry in the UK market currently.</p> <p>  A hard Brexit would lead to tariffs somewhere in the region of &euro;1,670 per tonne.  To put that into perspective, 13,000 tonnes of Dairygold cheddar go into the UK every year, out of a total production of about 50,000 tonnes.  That would equate to about &euro;50 million, which is equivalent to Dairygold's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for 2018.  That is a stark figure for our members, farmers and milk producers and shows how serious this is from an Irish perspective.</p> <p>  We have been led to believe that a soft Brexit would mean tariffs of around &euro;200 a tonne.  Outside of the financial tariffs and so forth there will also be costs to transport a product, the delays and the complexity around what has been a very free-moving industry, with 24 hours from the time something is loaded to when it is unloaded in the UK.  We are expecting to add at least eight hours to that and that would be in a good outcome.  That adds further complexity and further cost to an industry that is ill-equipped to absorb it.  The processor works on quite low margins and the consumer is unlikely to absorb the cost, so the person who will be asked to absorb it is the primary producer.  That is the fear my members would have.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what could be done from a Government perspective to try to smooth this over.  Export credit insurance would be a great help to the industry as we try to diversify into new markets with new products and so forth.  From a production and logistics point of view, capital investment programmes wold be helpful as we try to diversify from cheddar cheese.  The UK market will still be a very important market for us going forward but the expansion in milk production that has happened over the past few years is done at this point so it is now about adding value to that growth.  As we try to add value to that, there has to be product diversification but also market diversification.  Support in that regard would be of great help.  My colleague, Mr Mulvihill, from Dairy Industry Ireland might look at this question as well.</p></speech>

We are the only major exporter in the European Union without state-led export credit insurance.  To be fair, the Government and the Department have done Trojan work in preparation for Brexit but, to be blunt, this is the one big gap from our perspective that has not been adequately answered.  Competitiveness-----</p></speech>

We think only three other countries in the EU are without a state-backed export credit insurance scheme.  It comes down to one word: competitiveness.  We are expected to diversify from the British market and engage in hand-to-hand combat with our colleagues across the EU, including France, the Netherlands and Denmark, into new markets but they have export credit insurance and we do not.  Our issue falls between two stools.  It is a Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment competency but we are dealing more with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We are calling on the committee to energise our work on export credit insurance.</p> <p>  The island of Ireland dairy industry is unifying.  It is Ireland's model all-island industry.  We have an exposure of approximately 4 billion litres of milk in all-island dairy products.  The developments between the Secretary of State, Michael Gove, and Commission vice-president, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic, on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol are very welcome.  If there is a deal, we must move forward very quickly in getting all-island dairy product recognised in European free trade agreements, FTAs, and also to have the access to private storage aids and intervention for those products in case of market crisis.  We would really appreciate the committee's support on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.59" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#K00300"><p>I do not think anyone doubts that the meat sector is by far the most exposed sector by a no-deal Brexit.  It is exposed by Brexit in any case but the fundamental problem that we will face from a no-deal Brexit is a tariff wall.  That will be absolutely massive and substantial.  We have no line of sight on what that is likely to be.  We know, for example, that the UK produced a tariff schedule last year and a further tariff schedule this year.  The one this year is more acute and more damaging than the one produced last year.  Those tariffs are highest in the meat sector.  To give any indication of what would happen in the marketplace on 1 January would be crystal-ball gazing without knowing the what the circumstances of the market will be.</p> <p>  If one looks at where we export, the UK market is our biggest market by far compared with any other single market in the world.  The reason is because it is close and because it pays the best prices in the market and has significant demand at retail level and at food service level.  The volume that goes in is 47% to 49% of total volume and total value of exports in any given year, approximately &euro;1.7 billion or &euro;1.8 million in value annually.  Beyond that, the largest proportion of our products is going to the continental market.  Approximately 44% is going into that market, that is the larger consumer countries, such as France, Germany, Italy and some of the Nordic states taking a significant slice of that.  Internationally, the market that we were really looking to was the Chinese market and it is now closed, which is a problem.  A number of different factors are converging.</p> <p>  On the measures we have put in place, any company in our sector is Brexit prepared insofar as that is possible, but we cannot be prepared for a no-deal Brexit because that is the existential crisis.  In that scenario a massive value, around 70% of the market value, will be sucked out through tariffs.  The product will be shifted out of the market and given to the exchequers of the UK and Europe.  We are suggesting that we need a mechanism that in some way draws that in so that the sector is supported.  What we really want is to retain our market share in the UK.  If we do not, the diversification is not available to us at this time to shift the product into other markets.  If we do have to shift it in volume terms, we could also cause some degree of chaos, certainly disturbance, in the other largest segment of the market, namely the UK.  We face a problem in that regard.  We need a tariff mechanism that rebates the tariff that comes to the Exchequer back into the marketplace, that maintains our competitiveness in the UK market and maintains the equilibrium that we currently have in the market.  I understand our position with the Government.  We have spoke to the Government on this time and again, and have been talking about it since 2016.  We understand that until the negotiations are finalised, there cannot be a clear line of sight as to the type of support mechanisms that it might want to make available.  There are two significant funds available.  One is the national Brexit and Covid fund of &euro;3.4 billion, which is available between now and 2024 and the more significant fund is the European Commission Brexit adjustment fund of &euro;5 billion.  They are the mechanisms, as well as the tariffs, that come into the exchequers, which can reverse the revenue back into the marketplace to support us for the period it will take for the market to reach its normal equilibrium.  The only other way that will happen is if there is some sharing of the cost of the tariff, that is, that there is some price elasticity in the UK market such that there will be an increase in that value.  It must be borne in mind, however, that if there are tariffs there is also competition.  The South Americans who are exporting, and doing so competitively, at the high tariff rate that currently faces them in putting product into Europe, they will get an immediate competitive bounce from Brexit because the UK tariff is somewhat lower than the European tariff.  They will be even more competitive in the UK market, and they are ready and prepared to take a slice of that market.  I cannot tell the Deputy with any degree of certainty what the market profile will be in January 2021.  </p> <p>  He asked one other question that I would like to answer, which we repeatedly answered at the Covid committee hearings.  The answer was 2% in respect of workers who were employed through agencies.  Our members' view is that 2% should be heading towards zero.</p></speech>

The figure of 2% through agency is what is represented in a full workforce.  The figure is decreasing and, I believe, will continue to do so.</p> <p>  Mr. Carroll has spoken of how preparedness around no deal and the type of tariff wall that will exist.  We are all aware that there are many other issues that will arise around trading conditions and requirements in the context of Brexit.  From the meat sector's perspective, companies have been preparing for customs have a certain degree of knowledge on that area given experience of trading with international markets, are looking and have been putting more consignment through the direct shipping route between Ireland and the Continent.  That is an area of real concern - what will happen to the product we are sending to continental Europe?  Some 90% of current consignments would go by the land bridge but all sorts of disruption are forecast for that.  They are trying where there is capacity available but it remains a major issue.  We do not believe, even with the new and welcome announcements of new shipping routes direct to the Continent, that come January one way or another there will not be sufficient capacity to take what would be displaced from a land bridge perspective.</p><p>We are working on details of how that can be streamlined as much as possible.</p></speech>

I thank the three sets off witnesses who are here this evening to answer our questions.  I have gone through all the submissions.  We have been discussing this topic for four years, so much of it is not new.  I want to elaborate on two points from the ICOS submission and then bring the others into the equation.  Of all the groups to appear before the committee in the two sessions this evening, ICOS is probably the only group involved in importing as well as exporting.  I ask the ICOS witnesses to elaborate how we will be affected on the import side.  The conversation seems to be dominated by our exports, but what complications might arise affecting imports?</p> <p>  The ICOS submission stated that the erosion of the UK consumer spending power would have a major impact.  I ask all three organisations how they see that.  Even in the best-case scenario, the UK does not come out of this smelling of roses.  We all know that the consumer shops with their purse.  They used to say the housewife, but we need to be careful with that now.  It is the housewife or the house husband who shops and I cannot even mention the purse.  They shop with their available housekeeping and their disposable income.  If this does not go well for the UK, what contingency plans are in place regarding the type of product, and in the case of MII the type of cut, we export?  The type of cut or the part of the carcase that is being sent to the UK may change.  The bestseller over there now may not be the bestseller in future if the consumer does not have the same disposable income.</p> <p>  While this is not directly Brexit related, it may help us with increasing markets.  I ask the representatives of MII to comment on protected geographical indication, or PGI, status.  How might having that status help meat companies to explore new markets or maintain the ones we have?</p> <p>  We have had much conversation about live exports and issues with lairage for calves.  Have MII members ever considered sending calves on the hook as opposed the hoof?  Could we possibly get into the veal side of things from a processing point of view?  It may solve some of the problems we have with live exports if it went out on the hook as opposed to the hoof.</p> <p>  I ask the ICOS representatives to elaborate on part of its submission.  The Northern Ireland protocol aside, ICOS seems to believe there may be an issue in the small print of existing free trade agreements between the EU and third countries which may see Northern Ireland product as a third country product.  While with the Northern Ireland protocol we are trying to maintain an all-island approach and milk will be able to cross the Border as far as we can see, the ICOS submission has suggested there may be a problem in the small print of existing third country FTAs which may not recognise the Northern Ireland milk or product as EU product.  They may see that as third country input and that could have consequences for existing FTAs the EU has.  I ask the representatives of DII and ICOS to comment on that. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#L00300"><p>I welcome all the witnesses.  My first question is for the representatives of MII.  A lot of cattle have crossed the Border in the past six months.  Does MII represent both sides of the Border or just one side?  Do they envisage that production will be ramped up more in the North in light of the Northern Ireland protocol and that in the event of a hard Brexit more cattle would travel on the hoof?</p> <p>  What factories does MII represent?  I understand that all the large processors here have factories in the UK.  How many factories do they own between them in the UK?  Is it helpful to us that they are operating on both sides of the Irish Sea?</p> <p>  We know that many sheep have come across the Border and sheep have come from England; let us call them the cast ewes.  Obviously, that will incur a tariff if there is a hard Brexit.  Will that be a problem?</p> <p>  I presume the dairy sector needs to get more calves out on the hoof because if not, we will certainly have a calamity here.  As Deputy Carthy pointed out, farmers fear that if there is a backlog of cattle, we clearly know what happens to the price for the farming community.</p> <p>  I may be wrong, but on exports I note that the tariff on cheese is lower than on milk.  Why is there such a tariff discrepancy on different items?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses or people from their organisations go to Europe to talk to the different representative bodies?  Have they spoken to MEPs about meat?  Representatives of the IFA and INFHA have appeared before the committee.  Europe is importing beef and there is the Mercosur deal as well as other agreements.  Would the witnesses favour a proper pricing intervention if in addition to tariffs there was to be a big sudden shock preventing us getting into the UK?  Have they considered looking at that to alleviate the problem straightaway?</p> <p>  Is MII disappointed with the tonnage of beef that has gone to China?  It seems to be an unmitigated disaster compared with the amount of beef going out to those countries two years ago which would have probably helped us alleviate things.  I know that Brazil is sending a good bit in.  Are the witnesses disappointed with those markets?  Should Bord Bia be doing other things?</p> <p>  A question was asked earlier about the suckler PGI status.  If we get suckler PGI status will there be a greater premium price for that if it is marketed properly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.66" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#L00400"><p>We were asked about consumer spending in the UK and a possible no-deal scenario.  We are all living with a pandemic and the impacts that has had on segments of the market, particularly food service.  A no-deal scenario that causes major economic difficulties for everyone on both sides, in the UK and in EU member states, obviously will have an impact on disposable incomes.   We will have other issues with even trying to get in there in a no-deal scenario.  We have already seen a significant consumer shift towards purchasing increased volumes of mince.  Mince now accounts for over 50% of all the meat sold through retail and consumed in the UK.  I do not envisage a significant shift in the types of cuts.  There will be a substantial volume of mince, rounds on a periodic basis and steak cuts hopefully throughout the year, but particularly during the summer.</p> <p>  What should we do when faced with lower consumer spending?  We constantly look at diversifying markets.  Our future is still strongly based on trying to hold on to the UK market, service established EU markets and wherever possible broaden our horizon on international markets.  That work has been ongoing and some of it ties in with the question from Deputy Fitzmaurice on China.  My real disappointment is the suspension of the meat plants with China.</p><p>We are working with the Department to try to have that lifted.  It was developing.  Any new market will take time to build up, to find out what it is they actually want and where is the sweet spot.  Progress was being made there but we have been hit since May this year with a suspension that has not yet been lifted.  Apart from the immediate situation of that product not going there, it also raises vulnerabilities and questions in the market as to the security of the supply.  It puts us out of the market when we are trying to build our position.  There is disappointment at the fact that has not yet been resolved and that we are not back in there, and we certainly need it now and in the new year.</p><p> On the wider diversification piece, we are looking at markets such as South Korea, Thailand and so on, but they are extremely time-consuming and slow in terms of progress because of veterinary issues and agreement of protocols.  We have to continue working on them.</p><p> The Deputy raised the issue of Bord Bia.  As I said, our position is to try to hold on to market share in the UK.  It is one of the best beef markets.  It is a deficit market and it has to be the objective in terms of anything we do.  We continue to see that it is where work should be concentrated in terms of Bord Bia working in the UK, as well as working in established EU markets and building our premium level of penetration in EU markets.  Then, wherever we can, we should try to build a presence in international markets.  That is where we want to see the work continuing to focus.</p><p> Around the calf situation and whether the industry had looked at veal, I do not think it is an area where we can develop.  There are a number of veal producers in Europe but it is quite limited, although the Dutch in particular are seen as a major exporter of veal around Europe.  It is not something where we can necessarily build up a position overnight, or in any kind of medium term.  Our strong point is the traditional, mature, grass-fed, steer heifer beef.  I do not see it.  Some elements have been tried over the years but I do not see it as a position for our member companies to go to.  It does not seem to be on their horizon.  Some efforts have been made at it, but it is not an area where we are going to make substantial ground.</p><p> On the dairy-beef piece, it is about being able to do whatever possible in terms of the breeding, so the product coming off the dairy herd is as market-suitable as possible.  The FTA debate is more for some of my dairy colleagues.  Deputy Fitzmaurice referred to &ldquo;a lot of cattle&rdquo; going North.  I do not have the specific figures but while there has certainly been an increase in the number of cattle going North, it is not big numbers either.  If we process 1.7 million cattle here, the increase in the number going there has been very small in that overall context.</p><p> I am not sure that, across the UK, whether in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, there are major plans for growth in output.  I have not heard significant talk about it.  As a market, across a wide range of food areas, they continue to be deficit suppliers despite having a very good domestic market and a 60 million-plus population, so there is still that prize there, hopefully, to be played for.  That is why I said our objective has to be to continue to focus on the UK and holding our position there.</p><p> The Deputy raised the point about the EU level and talking to people over there.  Certainly, we have been doing that from the get-go.  One particular point, which he has probably heard made previously, was to highlight the impact of taking the UK market out of the European beef market.  The EU-28 beef market, as it is today, is 103% self-sufficient, so it is a market close to balance with a little bit of extra that is being exported.  If the UK is taken out of that, the EU-27 beef market on 1 January would be 116% self-sufficient.  That is a big surplus and it is a problem.  The point we have made is not only on the impact of Brexit, but also that it is an impact for the entire EU market.  The problem is not just about Ireland and is not going to stay in Ireland.</p><p> In terms of fixes or interventions, which the Deputy asked about, we do not believe the likes of beef intervention or aids to private storage, APS, if I take the question as being on that, are appropriate mechanisms.  If our objective is to try to continue to keep beef going into the UK market, and to serve the customers that have been built up in whatever way we can, then something like intervention or APS does the exact opposite of that because it takes the product out.  It might seem like it is a solution in that it takes a surplus out, but we have thrown the UK market wide open to competitors from South America and elsewhere to come in on it.  We do not believe that those traditional interventions that have been available from Brussels are the solution.</p></speech>

From what I know, they are also sending more to China.  Does he think they are fit to come in on the English market that quickly?  My honest opinion is that there will be a gap and if there was a no-deal Brexit, the UK would have to get meat.</p></speech>

It is also the case that the UK market is a fresh beef market and consumers are used to fresh product.  It is processed here and it is over there with a just-in-time delivery service.  It has perhaps got too slick in terms of how efficient it is, and that is why one can get shortages in the short term.  As to whether they are eyeing the UK market as a major prize, the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Will they ramp up in the medium term to see the prize?  Yes.  Is it just South America?  No, the US is looking at it very attentively, and Australia and New Zealand obviously have ambitions there.  In time, they can do that.  It goes back to the age-old discussion on whether they decide to target it.  However, they will not be able to supply fresh mince into it, and that is clearly the case, given their geographic location.  However, will they be able to supply more steaks into it than heretofore?  If a no-deal is the outcome, on 1 January, given we currently have no tariffs, we will see a massive hike that affects the competitiveness of our product and they will gain.  The tariffs they would be used to paying going into the EU are a bit above what the UK has mentioned at the moment.</p></speech>

I might deal with some of the questions and I will then defer to my colleague in Brussels, Ms Graham, and to Mr. Farrell.</p> <p>  The first question was from an import-export point of view.  The co-op organisations in Ireland we represent buy products from our members, that is, milk, grain and so on, but we also supply them with competitively priced inputs for their farms, such as hardware, animal welfare products and a wide range of other products.  Obviously, if there is going to be an export tariff for anything leaving the EU going into the UK market, anything coming from the UK market into the Irish market will probably suffer the same cost rises.  That would affect the profitability of the farmers who are our members.  I hope that goes some way towards explaining the point.</p> <p>  On the erosion of consumer spending power in the UK, the governor of the Bank of England said that a hard Brexit could have a more severe effect on the UK economy than Covid is having or will have.  That calls out to me that there are very negative consequences of a hard Brexit from an Irish perspective and an EU perspective, but also from a UK consumer spending power perspective.</p><p>We are fortunate that Irish food and drink outputs consumed in the UK generally attract a reasonable premium over and above what other products on the shelves attract.  The ability of the UK consumer to purchase at a premium will be reduced.  Obviously, products coming from outside of the EU, produced to different environmental, animal welfare, labour law standards and so forth, will be more competitive than what we produce.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.72" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alison Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120800002#N00200"><p>On the question of products of mixed milk origin, we are concerned that, even though we are thankful for the Irish protocols in the withdrawal agreement which allow for the continued trade of milk and dairy processed products on an all-Ireland basis, unfortunately, wider EU policy does not extend this benefit to products produced on an all-Ireland basis because Northern Ireland milk falls outside the EU customs union.  This means that products produced on an all-Ireland basis, namely, products which contain both Republic of Ireland and Northern Irish milk, will, by and large, not be able to access the benefits of EU free trade agreements.</p> <p>  The rules in the EU free trade agreements effectively state that products which can access the benefits must be wholly of EU origin.  There are some exceptions and limited flexibilities.  For instance, in the Japanese agreement, there is a flexibility of approximately 10%.  These flexibilities, however, tend to be limited and do not give us sufficient space for us to be able to continue to export these products which are produced on an all-Ireland basis.</p> <p>  In addition to that, not only are these products excluded from EU free trade agreements, they are also excluded from EU market support tools contained in the Common Agricultural Policy.  Those are tools on which we would rely in times of market crises, such as public intervention and private storage aid.</p> <p>  The EU has enabled this trade to continue on an all-Ireland basis.  It should equally support products which are produced on an all-Ireland basis within its wider policies in order that future EU trade agreements which are negotiated contain rules of origin which allow for products produced on an all-Ireland basis to be exported under preference and get that preferential access to those markets.  Existing EU free trade agreements should be looked at again to see how we can maintain the current trade in those products produced on an all-Ireland basis and can maintain that access at the preferential rates to those markets.  This should be a priority from an agricultural perspective for us going forward.  From our perspective over in Brussels, we see that.</p> <p>  We are talking to different European associations.  ICOS has been chairing a Brexit task force within the European Farmers and European Agri-cooperatives, COPA-COGECA, for the past three years.  Through these organisations and task force we have had close dialogue with the EU institutions and other European stakeholder and industry organisations to put together our concerns, to discuss our preparations and see how we can find solutions.  Through this dialogue, we have built up a strong support about the unique difficulties facing Ireland.  Many of the proposals which we have presented in our opening statement are ones that we have built together with our European counterparts.</p> <p>  It is true that these market support measures are vitally important, particularly in a no-deal scenario, which, unfortunately, is looking more like a possibility as we count down the days.  Market support measures, that is, intervention and private storage aid will be vital.  However, our key ask should be that products of mixed milk origin will maintain access to EU support measures if we are to ask for any flexibility in their use in the coming months.</p></speech>

Mr. Farrell, we are under serious time pressure, so you will have to be brief.</p></speech>

We already have seen a 27% drop in live exports of calves to the Continent.  Within that, the Dutch market has declined by 47% because of the closure of the food services market where veal was the primary product.</p> <p>  What has helped is the increase in farm-to-farm sales and a decision by the Department to increase the TB testing requirements from 42 days to 120 days.  The latter has helped produce a sturdier, healthier calf which has gone into the beef supply chain.  If that measure could be continued, as we are still living with the impact of Covid and with Brexit on the horizon, it would be welcome.</p> <p>  The concern is that if there is a blockage on the land bridge side, that would have a knock-on impact on ferry routes to the Continent.  That in turn might impact on the live trade.  The addition of extra ferry capacity is welcome.  The Danish company coming in with a direct route to Dunkirk will help.  That is welcome.</p> <p>  In the longer term, options around dairy breeding will have to be looked at seriously.  There are measures under way through a calf welfare stakeholder forum which the Department is chairing.  There are measures around sexed semen.  The dairy beef index will have to be increased in terms of dairy farm usage, as well as improving the overall dairy to beef integration which is vital. </p></speech>

We have seen fixed milk prices going from 33 cent per litre in the South to 26 cent per litre in the North.  Can the witnesses explain to me the basis on which these were formulated?  Was it based on a hard or a soft Brexit?  Where is the line that co-operative societies have worked on putting together that fixed milk price contract?  Could we have a scenario that, where they were based on a soft Brexit, that the co-ops will be under strain?  Was a conservative approach taken and if there was a good Brexit, could the farming community get a windfall?</p> <p>  What is the impact of Bord Bia on both the dairy and beef sector?  During the last session of this meeting, we heard about the impact Bord Bia has had over the past four years in trying to secure new markets appropriate to a new regime.  Are the witnesses happy with how Bord Bia has engaged and delivered on providing new markets?  If there was to be a change, where would they see it needed to ensure Bord Bia was more proactive?  The witnesses are the men and women at the coalface.  They might have different views as to how things could be done.  What changes could Bord Bia engage in with the stakeholders to ensure more productivity regarding markets?</p></speech>

We are at a critical time for our industry.  They might let us know if there is anything they want us to raise in the new future.  This scenario is changing by the hour.  As Mr. Carroll noted, we will not really know until 1 January how our industry will deal with the Brexit scenario that emerges.  As it stands, a hard Brexit is probably the best outcome we can hope for at this stage and it is very worrying for the whole sector.  As I said to the two other delegations that appeared before the committee earlier, there will be an additional &euro;1.6 billion in tariffs, 90% of which will be suffered by our sector.  This is deeply critical for our industry.  It has never before been at a crossroads like in this, in my memory at least.  I thank our guests for participating.

Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses and members attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members the meeting is limited to two hours due to the Covid-19 guidelines.  This is to ensure the safety of members, witnesses and secretarial staff.  We have agreed speaking times and slots and I ask members to remain within these agreed times.

This is a perfect situation for a dialogue.</p> <p>  As always, we thank the Chair and members of the committee for inviting us.  Joining me remotely are council members Dr. Martina Lawless, Professor Michael McMahon and Ms Dawn Holland, as well as our chief economist and head of secretariat, Dr. Eddie Casey.  We hugely value our engagement with the Oireachtas and see these meetings as an important part of our work.</p> <p>  As committee members knows, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to endorse and assess the official macroeconomic forecast, assess the budgetary projections, assess compliance with the fiscal rules and assess the fiscal stance.  This focuses on the overall fiscal stance rather than on individual tax measures or spending items and priorities.</p> <p>  The council's fiscal assessment report was published last week and assesses budget 2020.  In terms of the economic outlook, Covid-19 continues to have a major impact on the Irish economy.  The budget projections imply a 6% decline in real modified gross national income, GNI*, this year, followed by a muted 2% recovery in 2021.</p><p>November&rsquo;s Covid-adjusted unemployment rate remains high, at 17.4% for those aged between 25 and 74.  However, the outlook has improved since the spring.  The domestic economy recovered strongly in the third quarter.  Consumption has rebounded and multinational enterprises have supported activity.<br/><br/>For budget 2021, the Government assumed that a vaccine would not be widely available until at least 2022, and that trade between the UK and the EU would be based on a hard Brexit.  This was prudent, given the uncertainties and risks involved.  However, it did not factor in a tightening of the Covid restrictions, as we saw in October.  The budget forecasts cover just one year ahead, compared with the normal five-year horizon.  This gives an extremely narrow picture as to how today&rsquo;s policies might impact on the economy and on public finances.  While medium-term projections are uncertain, they help to promote medium-term oriented fiscal policy.  A return to five-year forecasting is essential for next April&rsquo;s stability programme.<br/><br/>In our report, we developed three scenarios to 2025 to help frame some of the medium-term challenges that Ireland faces.  The extended budget 2021<i></i>projections would see the economy recover to pre-crisis levels of activity by the end of 2022.  A milder scenario, with an effective vaccine next summer, and perhaps we have got closer to that, and an EU-UK free-trade agreement, could see the economy recover to pre-crisis levels somewhat earlier in 2022.  By contrast, a repeat waves scenario, with further level 5 restrictions necessary in 2021 and 2022, could see the recovery delayed until well into 2023.<br/><br/>The outlook remains highly uncertain and the impacts of the crisis might be felt for a very long time.  Sectors such as retail, hospitality, transport and the arts are especially vulnerable to the pandemic.  Counties more reliant on tourism and hospitality have also been worst affected, especially in the western and Border regions.  The impact of Brexit also is still unclear and could be much different from what is assumed.  Ireland is also exposed to international tax policy changes.<br/><br/>Turning to the public finances, Covid-19 has led to massive Government spending on job supports, health responses and measures to stimulate demand.  Tax revenues have fallen sharply in some areas, notably VAT.  Yet corporation tax and income tax have fared better than expected.  A very large deficit close to &euro;20 billion, or approximately 10% of GNI*, is likely both this year and next year.  This will lead to a sharp rise in the debt-to-GNI* ratio, which was already at high levels pre-crisis - the sixth highest in the OECD at the time.<br/><br/>The council assesses that the Government&rsquo;s decision to continue to borrow to support households and businesses through the Covid-19 crisis and to provide stimulus is appropriate, including up to &euro;12 billion of supports in temporary stimulus for 2021.  These measures should help to lessen the lasting damage of the economic crisis, and ultimately lead to a more sustainable path for Government debt.  The council welcomes the use of contingencies in budget 2021<i></i>to cope with any additional costs of Covid-19 and Brexit and the use of the recovery fund, which has not been fully allocated at this point.  Temporary and targeted supports should fall out of spending as the need for emergency measures diminishes and as the economy recovers, although there is some risk that some temporary spending may become permanent.<br/><br/>Budget 2021<i></i>also includes substantial, permanent increases in Government spending of at least &euro;5.4 billion, however.  Rather than being temporary and targeted, these will remain after the pandemic has passed.  They are surprisingly large in the context of past budgets.  Since 2015, budgets have included packages closer to an average of &euro;3.5 billion a year.  The permanent increases could even be as high as &euro;8.5 billion as it is not possible to ascertain the nature of some of the increases in non-Exchequer elements of the public finances.  This reflects ongoing transparency problems in areas outside of the Exchequer that have traditionally not been the focus of the Department in budget discussions.<br/><br/>The council assesses that permanent increases in spending without identifying sustainable funding is not conducive to prudent budgetary management.  To be clear, the council is not opposed to increased spending itself, and the debt-financed stimulus at the moment is appropriate.  However, there is no sense from the budget of how the lasting increases will be financed sustainably over the medium term.  The programme for Government rules out tax increases and spending reductions over large parts of the tax base and existing spending.  The risk is that this will tend to lead to larger deficits and leave debt on a riskier path.</p><p> Looking ahead, the council&rsquo;s simulations suggest that Ireland&rsquo;s budget balance by 2025 will be in deficit of between 2% and 3% of GNI* in the extended budget scenario.  Assuming interest rates remain reasonably favourable, debt ratios, although high, should fall over the medium term except in a repeated wave scenario.</p><p> The &euro;5.4 billion of core spending increases planned for 2021 will slow the pace of debt reduction.  They will add to the deficit even by 2025 and they will contribute to debt being higher than it would have been otherwise.</p><p> The Government faces a number of significant challenges once the economy is on a path to recovery.  Fiscal adjustment may be needed to put debt on a safer path and there are long-standing pressures on the public finances.  These include Ireland&rsquo;s rapidly ageing population, which is set to add approximately &euro;850 million a year to Government spending to 2025, measures to address climate change, reducing the over-reliance on corporation tax, which now amounts to &euro;1 in &euro;5 of Exchequer revenue, and fulfilling ambitions to upgrade the public services.</p><p> The Government must use its medium-term strategy in April 2021 to deliver credible plans.  This should include five-year forecasts; details on non-Exchequer areas; plans for sustainably financing the large increases in permanent spending; proper costing of major reforms such as Sl&aacute;intecare; and an explanation of how budgetary plans would change if revenues fall short.  Three reforms would also help: debt targets set in GNI* terms; tools to save temporary receipts such as unexpected corporation tax; and setting sustainable growth limits for spending.</p><p> I thank the members and we look forward, as always, to their questions.</p></speech>

I have a couple of comments to make on Mr. Barnes's statement.  We are in the eye of the storm in terms of Brexit.  Discussions are ongoing between the EU, with Ireland being central to that, and the UK.  In his statement, Mr. Barnes stated: "The impact of Brexit also [though assumed disorderly for the budget] is still unclear and could be much different what is assumed".  What is his overview of the current Brexit discussions, the risks for Ireland as a small, open economy and the challenges we face?</p></speech>

The assumption that went into the budget, and which we thought was appropriate given the risks involved, was that there would be a hard Brexit, one without a free trade agreement.  The work we have done at the council, and informed by the work with the Department of Finance and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, is that even a free trade agreement would probably reduce long-term Irish GDP by approximately 3%.  A disorderly Brexit would increase that and bring it to almost double and there would be many differences across sectors in particular that we would be concerned about.  The agri-food industry and the domestic SME sector would be particularly exposed, both because they trade more with the UK than the larger multinationals, which make up a lot of our total exports, and because they often export products such as agricultural products or food products, which would attract the highest tariffs under either the EU's tariff regime for imports or the UK's universal tariff, which it would apply to Irish exports going there.</p></speech>

There are still quite a lot of costs involved.  With regard to the direct effect of the free trade agreement and moving to WTO terms, there are still a lot of costs in the free trade agreement that would negatively affect customs.

Where does he see the scarring effects of Covid-19 in Ireland?  He spoke about the three reforms - debt reduction targets, tools to save temporary receipts and sustainable growth.  What are the priorities for the Government?  Could he identify what those metrics should be in terms of dealing with the aftermath of Covid and oncoming train of Brexit?</p></speech>

The question of scarring effects on the economy, particularly transport and accommodation, is something about which we are very concerned.  Some of these sectors have been very badly hit.  We know the Government has put in a lot of support but ultimately we do not know how long those companies will be able to last under these conditions and we do not really know how quickly consumers will start travelling again.  As with some of the effects of a hard Brexit, which, again, is a shock we have never seen, it is very hard for us to evaluate what those risks are but we just need to be aware of these risks, which is why we drew the committee's attention to them.</p> <p>  The second question concerns the difference between the &euro;5.4 billion, which is on an Exchequer basis where we have a very good handle on what is being spent and what is going on and this non-Exchequer part that is also within the general Government.  It is important in terms of public finances, and this is how the European rules are specified, that we should not just look at the Exchequer, which is an important part of the institutional mechanism in Ireland.  We should also look at the overall role of the Government, as measured by the general Government.  This is how the fiscal rules are specified, which is one of the reasons we are so interested in it.  The part that is not covered by the Exchequer is some 20% of the total so it is very big but up until recent years, basically not very much was happening there so it did not have a large impact on the kind of fiscal aggregates at which we look.  </p></speech>

This is basically local government, commercial semi-State bodies and extra-budgetary funds.  Collectively, they add up to quite a bit.  Until recent years, there was not a great deal of action happening there.  This arose in the previous budget and this year as well.  Quite a lot of the increase is coming through in these areas.  We lack two things.  We lack actual information on where the money is being spent.  What we receive is a net figure that gives the overall number but it does not tell us where it is coming from.  There are some offsetting amounts between spending and revenue.  We have asked the Department of Finance to provide us with a much clearer picture of the numbers.  The Department is working on this, which is good news.  It would also be good to understand more about what is going on.</p><p>Quite a lot of it is probably capital investment.  It would be good to know what the investment plans are so that we and others can factor those into budgetary projections.  It is an issue that has arisen over the past couple of years that basically relates to local government, semi-State bodies and a few other things.  We are asking for more transparency in terms of numbers and understanding what the underlying story is.  </p><p> Regarding the Deputy's final question about the areas where the budgetary framework could be strengthened, it is very good that the Government plans to look at the medium term in April.  As we have said, it will face a number of challenges and we believe those challenges may be easier to manage with some measures to strengthen the fiscal framework.  We focused on three.  One is having a target for the debt-to-GNI* ratio.  Obviously, in a period when debt is very high and needs to be brought down, it is natural to target the debt-to-GNI* ratio, particularly a few years ahead where the Government will have a bit of time to control the dynamics.  Regarding one particular concern, previous Governments have had a debt target but, in our view, without very much commitment.  It was also specified in terms of GDP, which is not the appropriate measure of national income, so this really needs to be measured in these terms.  Under European rules, the debt rule is done in GDP terms, which does not make a lot of sense for Ireland and does not give it an accurate picture.  The second area is around a rainy day fund.  We also talked about a prudence account in the past.  These are ways of essentially building up precautionary buffers for future shocks.  It would also be a very good way of saving the excess corporation tax receipts and helping to smooth that over time.  This is a relevant measure to consider after this year where the Government is clearly trying to stimulate the economy in 2021.  The third measure is the kind of control of spending in normal times.  The expenditure ceiling system has not worked that well.  We have also had periods in the past couple of years where expenditure growth has been a bit too fast relative to the speed of the economy so strengthening the domestic controls around that would be helpful.  We also make one or two other suggestions as well.  These could be very helpful measures for the Government to consider as it sets out its medium-term plan in the autumn.  It could put these measures in place that would strengthen the institutional framework as well just announcing what it plans to do.</p></speech>

We have had some better news on Covid with the vaccine.  The next few months will be quite difficult but beyond that, perhaps things will be less risky than we thought.  Of course, there are many unknowns regarding the vaccines.  In the short run, we hoped we would know by this point what will happen with Brexit.  As Dr. Lawless explained, it is a large shock and the short-run effects in the early part of new year could be quite strong.  There is significant uncertainty around both of those things.  Those two things stand out but which of the two is the more important depends on the timeframe.</p></speech>

The report highlights the fact that budget 2021 includes substantial permanent increases in spending that are not matched with a clear future funding source and that this cannot be considered a fiscally prudent approach to budgeting.  Although the Government initially said it would not raise taxes in 2021, it is now saying that there may be some increases in tax.  We know that a number of EU countries such as Spain, France, Norway and Belgium along with Switzerland have a wealth tax.  We have also seen that Argentina is even experimenting with a once-off levy on its 12,000 richest citizens - the so-called millionaires tax - to help pay for the recovery from Covid-19.  What is the council's view on the imposition of a tax on wealth more broadly defined as an additional revenue-raising measure to help to improve fiscal sustainability and overall budgetary balance?</p></speech>

That is one of the things we look forward to the Government announcing in the medium-term plan in April.</p><p>We do not have a specific measure or view about any specific tax.  We welcome the work of the tax commission.  That is a good way of looking at this.  It is important in the long run that the tax system supports growth, that it is fair, and that it is perceived to be fair, so it has a popular legitimacy.  We welcome that work.  That is the best we can say.</p></speech>

This spending provides for measures that would remain post-pandemic.  The report says that this could rise to &euro;8.5 billion after considering non-Exchequer areas and that "There is no sense as to how these [lasting increases] will be financed sustainably over the medium term."  We are aware that the programme for Government commits to no increases in income tax or USC, to indexing bands and credits in line with earnings growth, and to focusing only on tax rises that focus on behaviours including carbon, sugar and plastic.  Throughout the general election campaign Fine Gael attacked Sinn F&eacute;in for committing to a progressive increase in employers' PRSI.  In Mr. Barnes' view, can the Government fund  &euro;5.4 billion increase in permanent taxation through increases in tax on sugar and plastic?</p></speech>

This is very much a question for the Government.  Deputy Farrell referred to the increase of &euro;5.4 billion up to &euro;8 billion, which is a very large increase in the context of recent budgets.  It is also quite a large increase if one looks at it relative to the sum potential tax changes.  Clearly, things such as the sugar tax raise a very small amount relative to that.  It may well be desirable on public health grounds, but it is not something that radically changes the picture in Government revenue.</p> <p>  The imposition of the carbon tax, again, can be very helpful in reducing emissions, which is a goal that we all support.  On the other hand, those revenues have already been allocated to specific things.  Again, it does not provide a general solution for supporting further spending.  If one looks at the increase in PRSI rates, the estimate from Revenue is that this would bring in another &euro;750 million per year.  It is important to view this as context for looking at the impact of these increases in spending.  Of course, the economy will grow over the coming years also, which will provide additional revenue.  At the same time, the costs of standing still, which is the cost of the Government continuing to provide the same services taking into account the costs of paying higher wages, higher welfare rates or maintaining welfare rates in real terms at their existing levels, and the costs of ageing, which will add another &euro;850 million per year on average to public spending, will eat up a lot of the space that growth will create.  It will probably eat up more than the amount that additional growth will generate over some of these, once we get beyond the recovery.  It is a challenging environment and there are difficult choices to be made in terms of increasing spending and perhaps reviewing spending in existing areas.  One thing we call on the Government to look at is to strengthen the spending review process.  That does some good work, but it could be made into a genuine process for looking at whether Government spending is prioritised and delivered in the most effective ways.  There are some very hard choices coming around taxation and spending.</p></speech>

I understand there will be hard choices but I hope we will not see a repeat of what happened previously where those most vulnerable in society were affected again and again, and harder and harder, under the so-called recovery, while so many people never saw any kind of recovery.</p> <p>  Mr. Barnes made another point around the lack of clarity on the non-voted expenditure.  I am interested to hear if he is familiar with how other EU jurisdictions have oversight of non-voted expenditure, which could help inform the committee on how to improve transparency in that regard.</p> <p>  I am also quite interested in the whole issue of capital expenditure.  We are being told that there will be an extra billion euro here, there and everywhere for capital expenditure but what it really boils down to is  &euro;9.3 billion in 2020 and it will be increased to &euro;9.8 billion in 2021.  We are aware of how important capital expenditure is in having a significant multiplier effect.  If there is a vaccine in 2021, which could change the spending on income supports, does Mr. Barnes feel that this funding could be redeployed for capital spending to boost the growth in the overall budgetary balance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.117" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020120800002#H00100"><p>I will attend to those points in turn.  On the general Government figures, this is an issue that comes up in a lot of countries.  Ireland in some ways has better transparency than other countries.  We have a fairly precise idea in terms of providing information on the gross spending there and on a number of other things, including a thing called the "walk", which allows one to move from the Exchequer to the general Government figures.  There is a clear idea of how to do that.  The Department of Finance is looking at it.  We look forward to the Department making progress on that issue and hopefully reporting back to the committee on that.</p> <p>  On capital spending, the Deputy is absolutely right.  We view capital spending as being very important and it has a very big multiplier.  It also has a long-term benefit in increasing the capital base of the economy, providing a framework for structures for public services in the future and, potentially, to support growth.  We welcome that this was part of the budget.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell is right that the increase allocated in the budget was not huge but we must bear in mind that capital spending in Ireland has been growing very fast in recent years and is now at quite high levels by EU standards.  That was very lucky.  It takes a lot of time to plan capital spending and it just happened that Ireland was ramping up capital spending at the right time.  The right thing to do is look at the level of capital spend during this crisis much more than to look at the change.  In the past in Ireland we have seen that capital spending has been slashed during crises.  This current situation actually represents progress in moving towards better fiscal policy.</p> <p>  Another issue in the context of capital spending, which we see a little bit from the Exchequer numbers from last week, is delivery.  On our assessment it looks that capital spending this year will be less than planned.  This raises big questions about delivery for next year also.  Maybe the priority should not be to keep making ever-bigger promises about what the spend will be, which I am not sure would be helpful.  What would be helpful is to make sure that the money already planned to be spent actually does get spent.  The quality of the capital that comes out of this will be very important too.</p></speech>

The report also notes that Ireland faces a threat from changes to the international tax system.  A number of these changes have been enacted in recent years and more are coming down the line.  We have had the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting initiative and the EU's anti-tax avoidance directive.  Other proposals for EU corporate tax harmonisation and a digital sales tax are still being deliberated.  Which of these, in Mr. Barnes' view, is likely to have the biggest impact on the economy's overall budgetary balance in the long term?</p> <p>  The Fiscal Assessment Report refers to Ireland's over-reliance on corporate tax and states: "The funding of Ireland&rsquo;s public services and supports has become increasingly dependent on corporation tax receipts."  In the view of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, how fiscally sustainable is Ireland's low-tax model in light of threats from demographic changes, changes to the international tax regime, relocation risks posed by the concentrated nature of our corporate tax base and the longer-term trends of secular stagnation?</p></speech>

It is, obviously, complicated on the political front in the context of what is going to happen and what is going to be agreed.  There are also domestic considerations.  The new Administration in the United States of America, for example, could also have an impact.  It is very hard to have a good assessment of what the impact of that will be.  Much of the revenue relates to a few companies in a few sectors.  Their tax planning is very complicated and it is very hard to say exactly how any of this will play out.  This cuts both ways.  It could be that ultimately revenue increases, but it could also fall.  It requires a cautious approach.  This is what the council is arguing for here.  The council has a measure of excess corporation tax.  This looks at historical and across-country trends.  We are seeing, given how much Ireland raises, how much of that fits with those longer-term patterns and how much of it seems to be unusual.  This suggests that quite a lot of these revenues cannot be explained in that way.  As this dependency is increased over time, we really think that, as part of the recovery in the medium term, there needs to be a plan to reduce Ireland's reliance on this.  We are in a very risky situation.  This money is being spent on public services and if it was to disappear quickly, which it could, it would leave a big hole in the public finances and that would lead to a painful adjustment.</p><p>We therefore think it is much more appropriate that we anticipate that and that we do not spend it all now, excepting the short term, as there will be big pressure in the next two years.  Beyond that, however, in the medium term we should not count on spending as much of this revenue as we are spending at present.  We need a plan to reduce our reliance on it.  The rainy day fund or prudence account could be a very good way of doing so.  There are big questions about the sustainability of this model, and that pressure will add to the other points the Deputy made, including the point that in the medium term there are other things that are not sustainable.  For example, more action is required on climate change, which is likely to have a fiscal cost.  Ageing is accelerating at quite a fast pace.  We have a young country now but that will not last all that long.  In fact, our population is already ageing quite quickly.</p><p> There are therefore a lot of pressures which will all essentially come due at the same time, once we have moved beyond the Covid crisis and, it is hoped, the medium-term impact of Brexit.  All these things will need to be addressed.  This is why the choices are very difficult.  It is not just a question of getting back to budget balance.  There is a whole set of issues as to how we get there that need to be addressed at the same time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020120800002#J00200"><p>Mr. Barnes is very welcome.  I wish to pick up again on the issue of spending this year.  A significant quantum of resources, as Mr. Barnes referred to in his post-budget commentary, now looks like being a permanent expenditure across a range of different spending heads, particularly in health.  To me, this is really a commentary on the deficiencies Covid-19 has exposed in our public health service.  As much of that expenditure now will be repeat expenditure, it is now essentially in the base.  There is a very clear question as to how we provide the resources to pay those bills over the next few years.  Mr. Barnes very pointedly refers to this in his analysis.</p> <p>  Mr. Barnes also refers to the fact that the tax base is disproportionately dependent on volatile corporation tax receipts.  We know the Government made a political choice not to have the adult, grown-up conversation we need to have in this country about diversifying our tax base and ensuring that those who have the most may pay more in the context of our economic growth, our economic recovery and investment in the public services on which we all depend.  In light of the political straitjacket the Government has talked itself into, as far as Mr. Barnes is concerned what are the options in terms of diversifying the tax base to provide the resources we need to support the public services we demand and on which any modern, decent society should insist?  Does he believe, for example, that wealth taxes have a role to play?  Wealth has not been tapped and wealth taxes have not been identified as a priority by this Government or the previous one.  Does he have a view on the evolution, for example, of property taxes in this country?  We know, and all the evidence shows us, that the vast majority of wealth in this country is held in assets.  Successive Central Bank reports have indicated that but there are untapped resources there that are required to resource our services going forward.  I would like to hear Mr. Barnes's view on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020120800002#J00300"><p>That was a very interesting and wide-ranging set of questions.  Health is a big issue to focus on in the public finances.  As the Deputy notes, there has been a lot of temporary spending on health because of Covid-19 and it was very important that that was done.  As he said, there is a risk that some of that could become permanent spending.  We are not completely away from the kinds of pressures we saw in recent years.  A striking figure is that the permanent health spending next year, taking out the Covid part, will be 30% higher in cash terms than it was five years ago.  That is a very significant cash increase in health spending.  As we know, and as we have discussed in our previous reports, most of that spending came about in an unplanned manner.  It was not originally budgeted for and came about through supplementary budgets and then was locked into the base.  There is also the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare on the horizon.  That is estimated to cost &euro;3 billion.  Some of that, apparently, is in this year's budget.  It was not very clear to us how much of that has been done.  There has been no up-to-date costing of the implementation of that reform since, I think, 2017.</p><p>A lot of things have changed since then.  That is one of the reasons we think that, as part of the package in the spring, it would be good to have a good costing of that.</p><p> Health, of course, is one pressure among many others.  As Deputy Nash noted, and as we have noted, the programme for Government essentially makes commitments not to increase taxes on approximately a third of the tax base.  It also commits not to cut or adjust spending on approximately half of the expenditure base.  It is therefore a very restrictive document.  This is why it is important for the Government to clarify how it will prioritise these issues and address them going forward.  As for the public finances and how these pressures can be reconciled, the choices are unfortunately very clear.  One is higher taxation; another is adjustments on the spending side.  Whether that comes through reprioritising certain programmes or increasing the efficiency of certain activities, those are basically the choices.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council recognises that none of these choices are easy, but these are essentially the choices the country, the Government and everyone faces.  In that context we do not have specific views about wealth taxes or any other way of achieving such an adjustment.  That is really a choice for the Government and the political system.</p><p> As I noted earlier, the tax commission has an important role to play in coming up with ideas and proposals of ways of increasing the effectiveness of the tax system, making sure it is fair and contributes to growth.  As I also noted, the spending review process could be strengthened.  At the moment it is very much an analytical and technical exercise.  It is good work but very technical work.  In other countries, such as the Netherlands, they use it as a way to prioritise government spending and to consider the efficiency of what is done.</p><p> A third pillar in this regard - the council has engaged on it in the past week - is the pensions commission.  As I said, pensions is partly a long-term issue about the public finances but it is also a short-term issue.  Every year between now and 2025, ageing will on average add another &euro;850 million to the spending base.  This is a lot of money, so those things need to be considered.  In that context, we were concerned about the change in the legislation on raising the pension age in the beginning of next year.</p><p> I will make one very specific point about taxation.  We do not have general views about different tax instruments.  One thing worth noting is the fact that property values for the purpose of the property tax have not been updated as planned.  This is one area where a plan was in place which has not been implemented.  It will be important to get back to that if that is what the Government intends.  There is a risk otherwise - we have seen this in many countries - that if the properties are not revalued for the property tax, it never gets done and the tax base suffers as a result.</p></speech>

The most recent Exchequer returns and the trajectory we are on at present would suggest, to me at least, that the deficit this year will ultimately not be anywhere close to &euro;21 billion.  Mr. Barnes may have a different view, but what does he believe is the lowest level at which it might potentially come in at the end of the year, given the trajectory we are on at present?</p> <p>  On public capital expenditure, the council recognises that public capital investment is an important stimulus.  Regrettably, the very propitious lending environment we are in at the moment is not being exploited enough by the Government in terms of borrowing at very low rates for long-term capital investment.  It is very underambitious to simply decide to spend an additional &euro;500 million over the next 12 months, given the deficiencies we have in our public infrastructure and our social infrastructure - for example, in public housing.  Does Mr. Barnes think it would be wiser to invest more now, on top of the &euro;500 million, on top of what is already committed, to unleash the economic potential and address some of the social and public infrastructural gaps we have at the moment, particularly in the context of housing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020120800002#K00300"><p>Let me start with that question.  As I said in a reply to an earlier question, we would focus less on the increase in public investment this year and more on the level of investment.  This happens to be a period during which public investment has been ramped up a lot in Ireland.  By international standards our level of investment is now pretty high.</p><p>The fact that it has not increased much is not too much of a concern.  The good news is that there is a lot of money going into the economy through investment and we welcome that, both in respect of its contribution to stimulus and to wider public objectives.  Therefore that is appropriate.  </p><p> As to whether we should borrow more and what it should be spent on, these are very much political questions.  The Deputy is right to say that this current interest rate environment is very favourable.  The Government is borrowing a lot of money at long maturity, and is locking in those low rates.  These actions are all consistent with the strategy that has been set out.  Whether it should be doing more is a difficult question and some of it relates to the capacity of the economy and of the Government to take that money, to commit to spending it on capital projects and to do so wisely.  We are not in a good position to make a judgment on that but overall, we welcome the high level of investment.  Even though interest rates are very low, public debt is very high and that is a concern.  There are constraints and money still must be used wisely; it is not as though it is free money.  </p><p> On the issue of the Exchequer returns, we issued our report last week before the Exchequer returns  and we were looking at a deficit of a little more than &euro;20 billion this year.  The Deputy is right that the Exchequer returns had quite a lot of news in them and there are quite a few moving parts involved.  One is actually the shortfall on capital spending and it looks like there will be an underspend on the budget for the year as a whole.  As there has been less spending than was built in as a contingency for the level 5 restrictions, it looks a though that spending will come in lower.  Tax receipts through income tax and corporation tax have also been lower, so there are quite a few moving parts to the returns, but we would agree with the Deputy that the budget deficit will come in smaller than anticipated.  I would have thought that around &euro;18 billion or &euro;19 billion would be a reasonable figure.  I am not sure whether Dr. Casey wants to make a point here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.127" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eddie Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020120800002#L00200"><p>I completely agree.  I think that the figure of &euro;18 billion to &euro;19 billion seems likely now, given the shortfall in capital spending we have seen in areas like transport and housing but also on current spending areas that were linked to Covid.  There was a large contingency for Covid-related spending in the areas of social protection and health and that now seems unlikely to be needed even though the level 5 restrictions were put in place, which is encouraging.  In respect of the lower bound, it is hard to say but it could be as low as &euro;18 billion.  I do not imagine, however, that it could be much lower than that.  Again, there are many uncertainties and health spending could still be quite high in December.  We do not know what kind of costs linked to Covid or to the effects of the regular flu season are going to be incurred.  There potentially are other payments that were missing in the returns, so it is unclear at this stage.  There could have been greater transparency on the Covid spending.  For example, we would have liked to have seen more costings done on the measures that were introduced and the budget could have done a better job of presenting clear costings on things linked to Covid.</p></speech>

I know that they are reluctant to comment on particular policy proposals but in their report, they are willing to go as far as using the word "appropriate" when it comes to, for example, the decision of the Government to borrow to finance Covid spending.  Can the witnesses use the words "appropriate" or "legitimate" when it comes to the issue of wealth taxes as a possible response to the hard choices they say we have to make as a result of the risks that exist including Brexit, Covid, possible changes in the global corporate tax infrastructure and so on?  Is it fair to say that it would be appropriate or at least a legitimate thing to consider that rather than continuing to borrow, which we cannot do indefinitely, it might even be more prudent to introduce wealth taxes, as is being done in places such as Argentina, on the back of the Covid crisis?</p><p>I ask in particular because it is now becoming clear that while some sectors have been very hard hit, others have done well during Covid.  Even from the point of view of balancing things up, is the introduction of redistributive taxes to pay for Covid expenditure, additional capital expenditure and so on, rather than borrowing, something that should be actively considered and taken seriously, as it is in other places in the world but rarely here?</p></speech>

Therefore, we are very careful about that and to make clear that we supported and viewed as appropriate the overall stimulus being provided during the recovery.  It is very important that borrowing is undertaken in 2020 and 2021 because that will stimulate the economy.  We have concerns, however, about continuing to borrow during the recovery phase, when essentially that would not be appropriate, given the high level of public debts and the risks that this creates.  As I said, we do not take a view on any specific spending or tax measures as a general rule.  As these are not issues that we analyse, look at or have any expertise in, I would be reluctant to make those sorts of judgments here.</p> <p>  What I will say is there are legitimate questions - the Deputy has raised many of them - about taxation, fairness and the efficiency of different instruments and I think it is worth looking at these things.  As there are many different forms of tax on wealth of different designs, these are legitimate questions for people to ask.  We do not have an answer to them but they are legitimate questions.  The Covid crisis, as the Deputy noted, has had very complex and differentiated effects.  For example, some people have experienced very difficult circumstances and may have lost their jobs, income or businesses while other people have continued to be paid and have not spent very much.  In its wake, we know there have been a lot of savings in the economy, so there is a legitimate question about whether such measures are may be warranted.  Obviously, anything that would help to reduce the long-term pressure on the public finances would help to make the economy less vulnerable and would be desirable.  There are reasonable questions to be asked in this regard.  While we have no specific answers to them, there are questions there and international experience can be looked at.  However, the outcomes, as well as the fact that actions have been taken, also must be considered.</p></speech>

It is interesting that countries such as Argentina and others are now beginning to introduce these taxes on the back of the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>  I will press Mr. Barnes further on the question of wealth taxes, although I acknowledge there are limits to what he can say.  Borrowing entails borrowing from those who have surplus money, at interest, to make up for the lack of money available to finance necessary expenditure in health or capital expenditure, for example.  In the case of wealth taxes, instead of borrowing the money at interest from those with a surplus, one takes it from them.  From a prudential point of view, does it not provide better value for the State to take the money from those who have a surplus rather than borrow from them at interest?</p></speech>

It involved taking a number of existing wealth taxes from a number of different countries, including France, Spain and Switzerland, and looking at what revenue those wealth taxes would raise in Ireland, how many households would be covered and the total revenue that could be raised.</p><p>It was a technical exercise in how different styles of wealth tax would impact Ireland.  Along with the debate on whether we should have a wealth tax and the role it would play, there are many variations in the designs of wealth taxes to consider.  They would have significant implications in terms of how many households would be affected and how much money would be raised.  For example, approximately 80% of household wealth in Ireland is in the form of property.  Wealth taxes across a number of countries frequently exclude the household's main residence.  That makes a major difference in terms of the number of people affected and the amount of money raised.  The broader one draws the definition of wealth, the more money one raises, but also the more households one impacts.  There are many decisions to be made on a wealth tax's design.</p></speech>

I take her point.  The wealth tax that we in People Before Profit have designed and proposed in our budget submissions excludes the family home but is there not a fairly simple calculation to be done?  We have approximately 1.8 million or 1.9 million family homes in the country.  We can work out roughly what they are worth on average.  If we multiply one by the other, we get what component of property wealth in this country is comprised of family homes and what component is comprised of multiple homes, large tracts of land and other property.  Any reasonable assessment of the enormous amount of property wealth will show that the bulk of it is not family homes.  Rather, the main part of it, which is growing, is people with multiple properties and large tracts of land.  These are not about putting a roof over their heads.</p></speech>

It also found that wealth inequality had decreased in Ireland because of rising property prices over the past number of years.  There are still many issues to be considered, for example, what other assets people have.  For example, there are business assets that one would not necessarily want to subject to a wealth take in case it had implications for entrepreneurship.  There are other decisions to be made on whether there is a lower limit.  There are many moving parts even with the design of a wealth tax.  A simple 1% on all non-property assets would be difficult to implement.</p> <p>  As Mr. Barnes stated, we would welcome a commission on taxation examining the broad decisions that would need to be made on the design of the tax base and the interaction between a potential wealth tax with other taxes such as, for example, the local property tax and the capital acquisitions tax.  There are many interactions between various taxes that would need to be considered before implementing one decision on its own.</p></speech>

A lesson we have learned from Covid is that, if we scrimp on health spending, particularly on capacity, staffing and so on, it can have more dire economic consequences in a health emergency.  To a significant extent, our requirement to close down large sections of the economy was linked to the low level of capacity within our health service.  That is a calculation that we must start thinking about.  We might believe that we should reduce spending because it is fiscally prudent but it might suddenly catch up with us in a major way because we do not have the health capacity, thereby costing us more.  Have the witnesses an opinion on reconsidering the relationship between these two matters in terms of whether it is more fiscally prudent to have the health infrastructure, which might cost more initially but save us in the long run?</p> <p>  In terms of reviewing our expenditure and so on, I am interested in tax expenditures and the fact that we do not examine them closely enough.</p><p>Do the witnesses believe it would be important to examine those tax expenditures closely and make a comparison?  This committee and its predecessor have heard evidence from an economist - it may have been one of the witnesses, but I cannot remember - that, in general, direct expenditures tend to be better than tax expenditures.  What is gained from direct expenditure is more quantifiable whereas tax expenditure is more indirect and can often be a runaway train without anyone being sure what we are getting from it.</p></speech>

To give him a little notice to think about it, I will answer hiss second question now.</p> <p>  The area of tax expenditures is important.  People tend to focus a great deal on tax rates, but much of what matters is the tax expenditures.  They get less attention and are typically a little less transparent.  I am not sure that I would generalise completely across all of them.  They are a legitimate instrument but, as Dr. Lawless stated, they should be examined as part of the general tax package.  One of the main risks is legitimacy.  Often, these tax expenditures are regressive.  I agree that they comprise an area to consider in terms of strengthening and broadening the tax base in the years to come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.140" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Michael McMahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020120800002#O00300"><p>The question of how to balance the issue of total capacity and how expenditure is directed towards specific types of capacity within health or any other part of the economy is a difficult one and certainly one on which I would defer to the health experts.  I will give an analogy.  One fact that is always rolled out when a little bit of snow falls and Dublin Airport or Heathrow Airport close is that the airport in Helsinki, which suffers far greater snowfall, has not closed in 30 years or something like that.  It is a calculated decision.  The infrastructure required to keep an airport open despite heavy snow is expensive.  If it is only going to be rolled out for three days every two years, it is probably not the right thing to do whereas shutting down is sometimes the most prudent action even though it is disruptive at the time.</p> <p>  In the health sector, the decision is even more complicated than that.  The questions that Covid has exposed relate to capacity in specific areas, in particular intensive care.  We know that this is not an area that can be easily adjusted flexibly because specialist equipment, specialist hospital areas and specialist staff training are required.</p> <p>  Reverting to the earlier discussion, there are legitimate questions to be asked about what the right balance in spending is.  I am not an expert on health spending, but in my own capacity, it is not obvious to me that, if we were having this conversation two years ago, we would be talking about expanding capacity in the health sector.  It is not obvious to me that we would have expanded it in areas that Covid could then have drawn upon, for example, intensive care.  It is a difficult matter and how we assess the probability of these events occurring and where we would put the extra capacity are important questions.  Where other countries have handled this well, capacity and testing made the greatest initial difference in the crisis in the ability to stay open.  For example, South Korea quickly got mass testing programmes up and running and was able to get results from tests quickly, and it was done in a cost-effective way.  It meant that people were tested more frequently and outbreaks were more contained.</p> <p>  The Deputy is raising important questions.  When a spending review takes place, the adult conversation that one of his colleagues referred to will have to take place about the right ways in which to manage these risks.  We must view them as risks, not certainties.</p></speech>

In our area of expertise as fiscal experts, that is an important lesson to draw.  Fortunately, we got that one right.</p></speech>

Other issues intervened.</p><p>I thank our guests this morning.</p><p> We are talking about the impact that Covid is having but we must have a serious talk about the impact of Brexit on our economy.  Can the witnesses give particular advice on this double whammy?  I have advice that I wish to give as well.  I am one of those who spent at least four or five years before the economic crash raising questions in the Houses.  On the basis that it was not wise to suggest the country was going into a slide, as it would cause a rush on banks and all financial situations, we resorted to asking questions on whether the economy was keeping good economic fundamentals in mind.  The reply I always got was "Yes, it was".  That was not the case and was everything and anything but.</p><p> In this particular situation, I believe we need to be cautious about how we spend and be much more mindful of what other countries are doing for recovery than we were at any time in the past.  Any extra taxation must be weighed against the degree to which that will encourage confidence in our economy, given that we have an open economy, are highly dependent on exports and are a small fish in a very big pool full of many predators.  Is it wise to go for an early restoration of balance in spending in preference to retrenchment or austerity at an early stage?  I know the answer but I seek reassurance from someone else, if possible.</p></speech>

Hopefully, with the vaccine the resolution of the Covid crisis is more predictable and closer than we might have thought last spring.</p> <p>  One of the important things that we and others have shown is that the sectors that are hit are very different.  That is probably better than the same sectors being hit twice, in the sense that the shock is spread more over the economy.  It would be good if that second shock could be avoided as much as possible.</p> <p>  On fiscal rebalancing and the path ahead, we talked about different phases in our report.  We are in a joint phase at the moment where some sectors are still very locked down and disrupted.  Areas like transport and accommodation are really suffering a lot, as are some other parts of the domestic economy.  Also, the unemployment rate in a broader measure is still at 16% and is likely to remain quite high, plus there is a greater weakness in demand.  That is going to be the challenge during 2021 and that is why we welcome and support the measures and stimulus that have been provided in budget 2021.  That is why we think it is appropriate. </p> <p>  Further ahead, as the shocks unwind, the economy must adjust.  Using our five-year scenario, and this is why it is useful to do a five-year forecast rather than a one-year forecast like the Department of Finance did in the budget, we see the extended budget scenario.  We take the budget numbers and roll them out to 2025, assuming no policy changes, and end up with a deficit of approximately 2.5% of national income at that point.  We then did another exercise and asked, while the level of debt would be much higher, what would one need to bring debt to the same downward path as it was in 2019.  In that scenario, we see there is a need for some fiscal adjustment.  It is important to say, which we said last spring and now say again, this is nothing like the severe austerity that we saw from 2008 to 2010.  It is a very different situation and that partly reflects, as the Deputy has said, the better fundamentals of the economy going into this crisis, so that is welcome.</p><p> We see that there is likely to be some need for fiscal adjustment.  In the mild scenario that we have, if things work out very well, it might not be all that big.  If things were to work out worse it would be bigger.  We see that there probably is a need for some fiscal adjustment but we think it is very manageable.  What complicates it is the fact that there are a number of other factors going on at the same time.  One is the need to reduce reliance on corporation tax.  Another two relate to dealing with climate change and ageing.  A lot of other pressures will need to be dealt with.  It is not just a question of getting back into balance but getting to the right sorts of level.</p><p> The Deputy is right that Ireland needs to be very mindful of what other countries do in terms of growth in corporation tax and the kind of things where Ireland is either competing or reliant on what happens in other countries.  At the moment we still are in quite a complex environment for international trade on which Ireland depends heavily as well.  There are a number of issues that Ireland needs to navigate and manage well.</p><p> Another issue is public debt.  As we have seen in the past the costs of being viewed as a relatively weak country can be very high.  In the current environment, where the ECB is running a very supportive policy and Ireland is very much within the pack, this is a manageable concern.  We also know that a lot of the debt has been issued for very long horizons.  Even if interest rates were to rise rapidly that would not actually show up in the public finance numbers for some time but it would show up eventually.</p><p> There are a number of things that Ireland needs to look at, and what we argue for in our report, which are really medium-term issues.  We do not see that there is a need for a sharp adjustment.  We think that this should be done in a managed way that has a minimal impact on growth but helps the economy to get back on track and puts the debt ratio on a downward level thus bringing it back to a level that is more sustainable, less vulnerable to shocks plus, potentially, gives Ireland the ability to absorb another shock of the sort that we have seen in the past because we have seen how valuable it is to be in that position.   </p></speech>

In the past it was found possible to encourage rapid or reasonably rapid economic growth up to this level of wisdom and to allow that to bring our borrowing, and debts, into a reasonable proportion in comparison with our economy.</p></speech>

That is partly because of some of the additional Covid measures.  That should, hopefully, no longer be required and will drop out.  Growth should bring the tax base up significantly and as a significant part of both narrowing the budget deficit and increasing the GNI*, the ratio can be lowered that way but probably not quite enough.  As our analysis shows, even if one allows all of that to play out one is still likely to end up with a deficit at the end and some adjustment is likely to be needed to bring the debt ratio on a sufficiently downward path. </p> <p>  At the same there is a question about what will happen to the sustainable rate of growth in the medium term.  We expect that it is likely to be lower than Ireland has experienced in the past.  At the same time there will be more demands on public services, for example, as a result of ageing.  It will be much harder to keep the budget balance at the same rate and, particularly, to increase spending at the same time without either having other adjustments in spending to offset it or without increasing taxes.</p></speech>

That may be what makes the current situation different from what happened on the previous occasion.  How will that be handled?</p></speech>

Does it make a difference that the whole world is in debt as a result of Covid?  The whole world shut down, whereas the crash of ten years ago had different impacts in different places.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.152" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020120800002#R00400"><p>I think it does make a significant difference.  It is a very good question.  The answer to the narrow question is that, as many people have stated in terms of public debt, it is very helpful for a country not to be perceived as being worse than other countries.  That is what happened from 2008 to 2010 and it was very costly.  This time, there is stronger European support and Ireland's experience is similar to that of many other countries.  That reduces our short-term concerns around the level of debt.  In some ways, if Covid had not come along and we just had to deal with Brexit which, obviously, affects Ireland more than it does other countries, we might have been more concerned about the financing than we are.  The fact that all countries are essentially in a similar boat in terms of debt provides some short-term reassurance.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a key question with regard to the long term.  These levels of debt are extremely high by post-Second World War standards, much higher than we have seen previously.  On the other side, interest rates are probably at their lowest level in recorded history.  That is a very interesting combination.  Some of the best minds in economics are thinking about that question but have not really reached a firm conclusion.  In terms of the public finances, what we do know is that even if interest rates were to rise quite quickly, it would take time for that to feed into the public finances because of the long maturity of the debt.  Obviously, it would not help, but we would have a little time.  In terms of long-term sustainability, if interest rates did go back to a much higher level, that would change the medium-term and long-term outlooks and, of course, would also affect how we think about the short term.  The truth is that we do not really know how all of this will play out.  It does raise very big questions.</p> <p>  As the Deputy stated, it raises intergenerational questions.  We give a significant amount of consideration to public debt, but we should not forget that the State pension is not funded; it is a pay-as-you-go system.  There are significant commitments that have been made for future generations as well.  The sustainability of the pension system is also a big question and may partly be related to the low interest rate environment.</p> <p>  I do not know whether my colleagues, who are probably among the best minds in economics, have more insights on the issue.  If they do not, I will leave it there.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses have any observations on the level of saving among members of the public and what the view of the Government may be in that regard?  I refer to pent-up demand because consumers have not really had anything on which to spend their money.</p></speech>

It is an upside risk to the forecast.  The budget projections from the Department of Finance assumed that the savings rate would stay quite high.  Our view is that it may be a little lower.  Whether those savings are spend rapidly is difficult to say.  I do not think I will go out to dinner every single night when the public health situation improves in order to make up for the fact that I missed out on many nice evenings in restaurants in 2020.  It is very difficult to know how people will behave in that regard.  It does create a risk that people will spend those savings.  I think we can already see that a little in the figures.  The way people have spent money on consumer durables and such products probably partly reflects that they have been equipping home offices, but also the fact that some of them believe they have cash they would not usually have and that allows them to make some of these purchases.  It is difficult to say whether there is a role for public policy in that regard or whether it raises wider questions.</p></speech>

When the virus initially arrived in February, we thought it would last for five or six months.  We have had an evolving understanding of it.  Mr. Barnes rightly stated that the Government was prudent in preparing the budget on the basis of a no-deal Brexit and a vaccine not arriving until 2022.</p><p>The vaccine will arrive sooner than that and we know a little more about the virus.  To paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld, there are still a few unknown unknowns.  What will the impact be if the virus returns, as the flu does, and requires an annual vaccine?  I suppose it is impossible to plan for such a scenario, but it is not out of the question.  Do the witnesses have any observations in that regard?</p></speech>

How those uncertainties resolve and become clear is a big question.  In terms of vaccine costs and so on, we have estimates we took to the Department of Finance in our report.  The sums involved are not huge.  When one thinks of the savings in terms of not having to lock down the economy from time to time, there is obviously a significant gain in that sense.  We hope the vaccine will eventually provide some kind of solution, whether that involves an annual vaccination or whatever.  It is basically very encouraging but we do not really know how it works at scale.  The experience so far is that the phase 3 trial is very extensive but, ultimately, does not involve a significant number of cases.  We are still learning a significant amount about the vaccine.  Much will depend on time.  The months between now and the vaccine being distributed could be quite challenging.  One of the pieces of good news from this autumn is that although lockdowns are obviously very costly and have a major impact on the economy and society, we have learned that we can be somewhat more selective in that regard than we were in spring.  That can be seen in the way less of the economy has been badly disrupted compared with the situation in spring.  The economic impact in autumn is much less than it was previously.  We have a better handle on how to manage those things.</p></speech>

I have two final questions.  If they cannot be answered in detail now, I will accept a reply in writing, as members always do.  What does he make of the fact that, anecdotally, those in the hospitality industry are finding it difficult to attract staff who are doing reasonably well on the PUP and for whom it is not attractive to return to work?</p> <p>  For many years, Mr. Barnes and his predecessor, Mr. Coffey, have been telling us about the dangers relating to corporation tax, that the State is over-relying on it and it is bound to end at some stage or that there will be issues with it.  The view seems to have changed in the sense that we are exposed internationally to it.  The rules on corporation tax may change rather than the pot of gold shrinking because a company fails or something like that.  It is an issue to which we will return.  There is very little time for Mr. Barnes to respond.</p></speech>

Exactly how they are designed and how we exit from them are legitimate questions that will need to be addressed.  From the perspective of IFAC, if there is a permanent or longer-lasting change that results to the welfare system from those programmes, that would need to be reflected in the public finances.  Obviously, it is important in terms of the public finances that once the recovery comes, we move out of the current phase.</p> <p>  On corporation tax, it has surprised us that it has lasted this long.  In fact, it has increased so much in recent years that even Mr. Coffey, who is a great expert on these things, may have been surprised.  There are two issues.  One is the year-to-year short-term volatility, which may be linked to a company making more or fewer profits.  It can have a big impact.  Even if one looks to this year, our view is that corporation taxes can easily shift by &euro;2 billion or &euro;1 billion from month to month.  That is quite volatile but, in the wider scheme of things, it is not a significant issue.  The real issue is about the longer term.  It is very complex to understand what is happening.  It is on the tax policy side and it is also to do with the companies.  We know that much of this money probably comes from companies in pharma or digital.  Those companies have all done quite well during the Covid crisis.  However, something could happen that means they do less well, which would have an impact on Ireland.  It may be that, for whatever reason, they decide to structure their tax affairs differently, which could have an impact.  That is why IFAC is still very cautious on this issue.  We are likely to be closer to the day when these kinds of revenues drop than we were previously.</p><p>We do not know when that will be but we do not believe that locking in permanent spending based on these large sums we cannot rely on is a good idea.  We remain concerned about it.  We have been surprised that it has lasted.  Of course, this year helped us a good deal.  It has been the one good news story on the public finances.  This is essentially the one thing that beat the forecast made in a previous budget.  Anyway, the concern is still there and it is very real.</p></speech>

The report references Ireland's debt to growth ratio and the need for reporting to utilise GNI* rather than GDP.  I will not rehash the various problems with the latter measure.  However, I still have concerns since while using GNI* rather than GDP would be an improvement in terms of providing a more accurate picture when it comes to debt sustainability, there is a risk of hitting the target but missing the point.  We should recognise that there has been secular decline in interest rates in recent decades.  Many believe that we will be stuck in a world of near-zero interest rates for a significant period.  We are dealing with nation states and not the crude household analogy that many ill-informed commentators like to use.  Would a better measure of Government debt sustainability in the context of low interest rates not be net interest payments as a percentage of GNI*?  An alternative proposed by former US Treasury Secretary, Mr. Larry Summers, would be to take the net present value of all future GDP, or, in our case GNI*, which increases in times of low interest rates, and then use that to compare it to the stock of total debt.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.162" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020120800002#T00300"><p>The Deputy is correct.  There are two separate issues.  However we look at it, using GNI* is a more appropriate measure than GDP.  It is far closer to the real fundamental activity in the economy and it is far closer to the tax base.  That is why we made the suggestion.  Unfortunately, aspects of the rules under the Fiscal Responsibility Act are framed in terms of GDP.  That is really what we were pushing against.</p> <p>  The second point raised by the Deputy is a very good one.  It relates to the appropriate level of the debt ratio we should have bearing in mind that interest rates are especially low.  I made two observations earlier and I will elaborate on them because they are relevant here.  It is a reasonable question and one we plan to think about more - many people are thinking about it carefully.</p> <p>  One thing is clear.  We do not know that interest rates are going to stay this low forever.  They could fall further and become increasingly or ultimately negative.  They could increase as well.  We simply do not know.  The extent to which we are sensitive to that risk depends on the debt ratio.  That is why the debt ratio is still a highly relevant factor to look at.</p> <p>  We would obviously look at it differently now from how we did in the 1980s.  However, it is still a useful metric and it is still the right thing to look at.  It is something that adjusts slowly because it is a function of the stock of debt.  It is also a good target because it is not too volatile.  My concern is that if we simply looked at interest payments, which are low, we would miss this point about the riskiness of the position we are in.</p> <p>  The position of Ireland is not the same as a country like the United States.  Ireland is a far smaller economy and far more dependent on external capital.  Its economy is far more volatile too.  Ireland is dependent on far fewer activities than the US.  Ireland has been lucky in recent decades in its growth experience.  We expect that to continue to a degree but it may not happen.  Ireland, therefore, has to be far more cautious than the US, Germany, France or Italy for that matter.  That is an important point.</p> <p>  The second point is that there are limits to looking at the debt ratio.  This is why the council published its long-term sustainability report this summer.  Basically, the report showed that if we got debt on a downward path but nothing was done about pensions and increasing health costs, then essentially the debt ratio would fall to not much below 100% of GNI*.  Then, from the mid 2030s it would start to pick up.  These pension issues are big as well.  It would be a mistake to focus too much on the debt without taking into account these big long-term fiscal pressures that may come from an ageing population.</p></speech>

The council makes a point that the pension deficit should start to bite after 2030.  My understanding is that the council forecasts for economic growth for the period thereafter are approximately 1%.  This means our economy would enter a phase of secular stagnation.  Given that low growth is a driver of fiscal unsustainability, what policies for long-term growth does IFAC see as necessary to boost growth by extension of fiscal sustainability?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.165" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020120800002#U00200"><p>I am not sure whether we would qualify these slower long-term rates of growth as secular stagnation.  Really, secular stagnation is a concept relating to the global economy or the advanced countries within the global economy.  Ireland's trajectory may be different.  The reason we see slower growth is essentially that there is lower productivity in the world.  Ireland has reached higher levels of productivity and so its ability to catch up is reduced.  Ireland will also have an ageing population and that will play into growth as well.  It may be that growth simply ends up being lower.</p> <p>  As Deputy Ryan said, one of the tools that can be used to improve the outcomes of society and long-term fiscal sustainability is an increase in growth.  Obviously, there are many policies that many people have recommended in that sense.  I do not believe we have specific views about that.  Obviously, continuing to invest in education and innovation and continuing to make Ireland an attractive place for businesses and investment are all part of it.  Beyond that we do not have a specific view about how that could be achieved.</p> <p>  It is important to remember that growth is not necessarily the solution that people sometimes believe it to be for the public finances.  It could help, but one of the problems with growth or one thing that goes along with many forms of growth is that if wage growth is high as well, it increases the cost of providing public services.  There tends to be a natural offset between the two.  The long-term sustainability of the public finances may be less dependent on growth than many would assume.  This is because in practice wages and welfare rates are likely to track growth.  If there is higher growth, everyone gets higher income, which is a good thing.  However, that does not necessarily generate large amounts of additional fiscal space.</p></speech>

I am aware of my time.  The council has stated that spending on pensions and healthcare would increase from 13.3% of GNI* in 2019 to almost 25% in 2050.  The council maintains this forecast is based on a no-policy-change basis.  We know that employers' PRSI contributions in Ireland are low by EU standards.  We also know it is likely they will be increased in the years ahead, thus improving fiscal sustainability.  Has the council made any assessment of the potential increase to sustainability from great employers' PRSI contributions?  How could they be used in the offset to increase the pension age?</p></speech>

More people are reaching pension age because of the demographic trends we have had in the past.  Many people were born in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  As those people reach retirement age there will be major challenges, as noted by Deputy Ryan, in terms of pension sustainability.  There are several solutions.  In fact, the menu is fairly well defined.  One option is to find the money somewhere else in terms of general increases in taxation or reductions in spending.  Within the pensions system or related to it, one option is to raise PRSI contributions.  Another thing would be to adjust the level of pension benefits.  Yet another option would be to raise the retirement age.  A one percentage point increase in PRSI would raise approximately &euro;750 million.  If we relied on that instrument only, we would have to raise PRSI rates by a significant amount to finance the pension system or address the pensions problem in that way.  We will need a broader approach.  As we said in our long-term report, we believe raising the pension age gradually and partially to reflect rising life expectancy would be a natural way of adjusting for this.  It could be done in such a way that people spend the same share of their lives in terms of working and retirement.  The amount of time people could expect in retirement would also be increasing but it would not be increasing as fast as if we held it fixed.  We believe that is an important part of any package, because that is essentially where many of the pressures are coming from.</p><p>Tackling that pressure at source is probably a key part of pensions sustainability.  We will see what the Commission on Pensions comes up with.  I am sure it will consider these issues very carefully.</p><p> What is striking is life expectancy at 65.  The length of time one can expect to live to the age of 65 is rising by one year every five years.  If we look to our children, they will be living at least five years longer than us or less, depending on which way we are going.  These are major changes.  I do not think we realise that looking at it every year but life expectancy is increasing very fast.  That is where many of the pressures in the public finances will come from and that would seem a key part of any package to address.</p></speech>

I will take the Green Party slot.  I want to come back to the non-voted expenditure, which Mr. Barnes said is approximately 20% of spending.  He will forgive my ignorance but when it comes to something like commercial semi-State bodies, which I presume are bodies such as ESB, he indicated that there has been quite an increase over the past period.  Could he unpack that for me, so to speak, and explain what that looks like in terms of local government and commercial semi-State bodies?  I presume that when he refers to extra spending he is talking about Supplementary Estimates.  In that context, I am on the health committee, which had a meeting last week.  Considering the times we find ourselves in, the numbers currently are eye-watering.  What is the process in respect of commercial semi-State bodies?  Is it multi-annual funding for capital spending that is the creep up in terms of spending or how does that happen?</p></speech>

That is why we are calling for additional transparency.  I will let Dr. Casey, our chief economist, who is close to the details, tell the Chairman what we do and do not know.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eddie Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020120800002#V00400"><p>It is a great question.  It is something we have been trying to unpack, as Mr. Barnes said.  The areas we are trying to look at are local government spending and teasing out exactly where the spending is going in that sector.  Thankfully, the Department has published a bit more information on that but because it is still very limited, we cannot say how much of the spending that has been ramped up this year will be permanent versus temporary.  In addition, non-commercial semi-State bodies are also included.  If we think of all of the IT companies, technological universities, RT&Eacute; and Irish Rail, those are the types of bodies whose spending from year to year is fairly predictable but every now and then we could see a sudden ramp-up for whatever reason.  We do not know why it has increased this year but we suspect that it is probably linked to investment plans.  That could be a temporary increase or a long-lasting one.  We just do not know.</p> <p>  There are other parts as well, including what are referred to as extra budgetary funds.  The Chairman is probably aware of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is a large fund that was set up with a commercial mandate to invest in the domestic economy to boost growth.  There is spending from that as well that could be identified in general Government expenditure but we do not know how much.  There are many unknowns and as we said, it is up to one fifth of all Government spending so it is very large.  If it is not predictable, we have to ask why and it is very hard to find those answers.</p></speech>

The idea that we could have a 20% spend like that one, particularly by commercial semi-State bodies, and not fully understand where those decisions are being made and where it is being added to the base, is remarkable and worrying.  During the Supplementary Estimate process at the health committee last week, the Minister accepted that a considerable proportion of the spending will add to the base year on year.  I do not forecast a good answer for this budgetary oversight committee if we cannot unpack something like non-voted expenditure over the lifetime of a Government.</p><p> Mention was made earlier of the spending review process in its current format and how it is utilised in other jurisdictions as a way to prioritise spending but also to consider obsolescence.  Deputy Boyd Barrett talked about tax expenditures.  Can any of the witnesses talk to me about how we might better utilise the spending review process in the budgetary oversight process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.174" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020120800002#W00200"><p>This is a very useful tool for the committee.  A number of countries do it in different ways.  The Netherlands is the outstanding example of how to do it.  Currently, we have a process where IGs, the evaluation service, could be used more effectively.  It did much good work on forecasting and describing what is going on in the public sector, which we do find useful, but it is not the same as the kind of process we would see in the Netherlands.  The Netherlands look very closely at different programmes.  Different countries can do it different ways.  All the spending can be tested at the same time or have a regular programme of going through it.  It is important to look at the priority areas.  One of the aspects I recall from the past is that sometimes the areas that were taken out for reviews were not the obvious areas we would look at.  They were areas that were quite small and where one would think the scope for significant savings was quite low.</p> <p>  As the Chairman said, there are two aspects of this.  One is to look at the way spending is allocated between different activities and the other one is to look within activities to see whether there is scope to do things differently.  In this tougher fiscal environment that we will be in choices will be more difficult.  If there is scope on the spending side we might spend less money on activities that are lower priority and that may reflect priorities set a long time ago and see where there is scope to increase cost efficiencies.  It is very useful to use that scope because it then freezes up resources for other areas and, from our perspective, it reduces the pressure on the public finances to borrow more just because we can find the money through what we are doing already.  My understanding from other countries is that those kinds of reviews are most effective.  It is easier to do things to do with prioritisation or setting the parameters of existing policies.  It is much harder sometimes to go into the nitty-gritty of the efficiency.  The Dutch example is very useful.  They have significant expertise in doing this.  They ask some hard questions of themselves about what they are doing.  That kind of process would hugely strengthen the public finances in general.  One of the mechanisms through which that works would be through strengthening the oversight procedure.  It would give the committee the analysis it needs to ask the questions it wants to ask.</p></speech>

In answers to numerous questions from Deputies, we have discussed the issue around debt targets and GNI*, which is GDP.  It sounds to me that Mr. Barnes is recommending that our Government set a domestic debt target.  That is so much about our borrowing and debt management in conjunction with our EU partners.  How does that interact with our EU commitments?  What does Mr. Barnes believe the Stability and Growth Pact will look like in a post Covid-19 world?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020120800002#W00400"><p>Those are very good questions.  In the short run, for this year we have had exceptional circumstances under the EU rules.  That has been very welcome.  It looks as if that will continue next year, which is also appropriate.  Where we go to after that is a big question.  In principle, the rules will come back into play.  Ireland is likely to be in an excessive deficit procedure at that point.  It looks as if they will still go into this procedure despite the fact that there are exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>  Exactly how all that will look in one year or two years' time is very hard to tell, both in terms of how the EU might look at its rules and the way it might enforce them, but also in terms of some of the technical issues such as the way it measures the structural balance.  It is very hard to know where that will be.  The EU looks at issues in GDP terms.  For Ireland, that means the rules apply in a slightly different way from other countries.  One of the issues we are mindful of is that it may be that the rules are not too loose for Ireland at that point, partly because of this GDP issue and perhaps because of other issues.  We do not know whether that will be the case but it is a risk; there is a risk on the other side as well.  We believe it is partly helpful for the Government to think through what it wants to achieve.</p><p>This should be in compliance with the EU rules.  It is difficult to predict exactly what the rules will be but what is done should be the spirit of those rules.  That is why the council promoted a principles-based approach to implementing the rules.  The debt ratio should be thought about in this context.  It is a good target.  Particularly in the context where the debt ratio is very high, it is a very good objective.  It is also something that moves in a relatively predictable way.  As a medium-term target, it is quite good.  In light of this, the Government can set intermediate objectives through its budgets.  It can show how it plans to get to that level of the debt ratio.  It can be a good focal point for policy over the coming years.</p><p> There have been a couple of attempts at having a debt target in recent years.  They are specified in GDP, which is a weakness, but there was also a lack of commitment to them on the part of the Government.  These considerations should really be at the centre of the way the Government discusses the budget if it is to be effective.</p></speech>

It is a great idea for the committee to consider such matters.  There are three aspects on which it should be seeking information regarding the budget.  Better, clearer costings on the spending side are desirable.  Every year, just before the budget, we get a ready reckoner from the Revenue Commissioners.  It gives a really clear sense of how much a 1% increase in the standard income tax rate and other such measures would raise.  On the spending side, however, there is much less information.  I am aware that people get this information in dribs and drabs from the Department but it would be better to have something along the lines of what the Revenue Commissioners produce, which is very transparent.</p> <p>  A second point concerns the walk.  We have mentioned the so-called walk from the Exchequer spending, which is what many of the budgetary publications have focused on traditionally, and the question of how one gets from there to the extra fifth of spending in general government terms, which is the wider measure we are interested in.  That expenditure should be presented in gross terms.  It is really useful for us, members and others to see in very clear gross terms what exactly is being spent and the revenue being taken in.  All we have at the moment is a net picture, which does not allow us to understand the goings-on.</p> <p>  On a somewhat self-promotional point, the standstill scenario we develop at council level is a really useful tool for understanding what is happening the budget from year to year.  We are aware that there will be major increases in spending linked to public services already provided and the public service payments and social welfare payments that we provide.  It is a question of how much extra the Government would be spending on those types of categories if it were to do nothing in its budget in 2021.  The question is linked to determining the demographic changes and the general rates of inflation in the economy.  If prices and wages were rising, what would it cost to increase public sector wages in line with those increases, and how much would it cost to raise social welfare and pension payments in line with them?  If that clear picture were provided by the Departments, we would have a really good sense of how much space would be left over for new measures given general growth in the economy.</p></speech>

The stability programme update will be published in April, and the committee may meet the relevant Ministers in advance.

The stability programme update is probably of particular interest to the council but perhaps of less interest in the general population.  This year, however, is really crucial.  We have included two reasons for that in the assessment report.  First, the Government must make medium-term choices on how it is going to prioritise spending and taxation and how it is going to manage corporation tax and population ageing over the remainder of its term.</p><p>This is the opportunity for it to set out its medium-term plan and it has committed to doing that.  It is important that it does that and it is going to be difficult because any Government in that situation would face hard choices.  It would be helpful if this Government makes those choices at that stage.  Things may change in the years to come, but that is really the point to chart the course for the years ahead.  That would be a good question to ask.</p><p> We set out in our report some specific suggestions for how that information should be presented.  That includes having five-year forecasts that should be done on the basis of the standstill that Dr. Casey just mentioned.  To me, that is the only sensible way of showing forecasts of public spending.  It should include costings of major initiatives such as Sl&aacute;intecare and should explain what the Government plans to do on the tax side.  There is a whole set of basic information that we would expect to be in that report for us to judge it credible.  </p><p> A final pillar of that is to ask about the institutional side.  We have just discussed the debt ratio with the committee and have looked at spending limits, the rainy day fund and prudent accounting ideas.  As the Government sets a course through the relatively difficult fiscal times to come, it would benefit a lot from strengthening the fiscal architecture at the same time.  That would be complementary to achieving fiscal sustainability and that would be a good issue to explore.</p></speech>

We would be concerned if the pension age were lowered in this context.  As I said, we know that the population is rapidly ageing.  We also know that the number of people reaching pension age is increasing.  A policy like that would add a lot of stress to the public finances at a time when we face many challenges, including a high level of public debt.  It would also raise big questions of intergenerational equity.  By being more generous today, are we potentially undermining the system for those who come behind?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020120800002#B00200"><p>Apologies have been received from Deputies Phelan and Cathal Crowe.  Senator Flynn is expected to substitute for Senator Ruane.  Before we begin, I request members to sit only in the permitted seats and in front of available microphones to ensure they are heard.  This is important because not doing so causes serious problems for broadcast, editorial and sound staff.  I also remind them to maintain social distance at all times during and following the meeting.</p> <p>  Our meeting today is to engage with stakeholders on the Ombudsman for Children's report entitled Unmet Needs.  I welcome everybody and sincerely thank our witnesses for joining us.  Ms Linda Comerford and Ms Vanessa Murphy are representatives of Enough is Enough.  We also have Mr. Mark Smyth, president of the Psychological Society of Ireland, who is accompanied by Mr. Odhr&aacute;n Allen, chief strategy officer with the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland.  We also have Mr. Gareth Noble, children's rights solicitor, who is accompanied by Ms Naomi Mulvany, legal assistant.  Mr. Smyth has kindly agreed to deliver a joint opening statement on behalf of the Psychological Society of Ireland, the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland and the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists.</p> <p>  With respect to parliamentary privilege, I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  That means that witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse the privilege and it is my duty, as Chair, to ensure privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if our witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory to any identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The purpose of our meeting is to discuss the contents of the report published by Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children, entitled Unmet Needs.  The report was published in October 2020 with the objective of shining a light on the challenges facing children in Ireland who require access to an assessment of their needs.  I am sure the witnesses are aware that we had the Ombudsman for Children before the committee last week.  I will outline the format of the meeting.  The order of witnesses for the opening statements is Ms Comerford followed by Mr. Smyth and then Mr. Noble.  Where possible, speakers should stick to approximately three minutes for opening statements.  Once all statements have been delivered, I will call on members in the order that they indicate to ask questions.  I invite Ms Comerford to maker her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Linda Comerford" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020120800002#B00300"><p>I thank the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration for inviting me to appear today to discuss the challenges faced by children and their families who require and are awaiting an assessment of need.</p> <p>  For those who may not know, the campaign Enough is Enough was founded four years ago by a group of parents.  We were all parents of children with additional needs and we were all extremely frustrated at not being able to access timely assessments and services that our children needed.  We decided that we were no longer going to sit back and tolerate our children being continually failed by a broken system.  We wanted our voices and the voices of our children, both young and older, to be heard and so Enough is Enough was born.  We do not want scraps and empty promises; we want rights and action.  It is simply not good enough that families have to consistently fight hard for vital assessments and services that their children require to support them in their development and everyday life.</p> <p>  Data to the end of September show that the backlog of cases for assessment of need has grown from 5,533 just a short while ago to 6,058.  Of those, the HSE stated just 185 were overdue for completion because of exceptional circumstances.  These are not just figures, they are children.  This is a shocking indictment of our Government.  Despite a legal obligation on the State to complete assessments within three months of an application being received under the Disability Act 2005, this does not happen and many parents are forced to take legal action.  As a parent, it is gut-wrenching to see one's child struggle and not be able to help.  We fight for assessments and services in order that we and our children can get the support we desperately need. </p> <p>  The fight for an assessment of need is just the beginning.  When an assessment is finally completed and a child receives a service statement outlining the therapies and supports he or she needs in order to thrive, parents have to once again fight for their child to receive these therapies as the child's name goes on a lengthy waiting list to access the supports required with many of them ageing out of one list and having to start the process all over again on another list.  This is extremely frustrating and very damaging to a child's well-being and development. </p> <p>  We also have many concerns regarding the new standard operating procedure for assessment of needs.  How does the HSE think that a desktop examination is an appropriate way to determine if a child meets the definition of disability?  Parents and guardians fill out the application forms but are not professional therapists and may fail to provide information or fail to see areas of concern in their child that a professional would notice.  This means their application may be rejected and the child will not be assessed or will have to wait longer to be assessed should the parent have to provide additional information or where the HSE facilitates an appointment with an appropriate health professional to establish more detail regarding the child&rsquo;s presenting difficulties.</p> <p>  What parents want is very clear.  We want a clear pathway to services and supports from time of diagnosis to end of life, timely assessments followed up by appropriate therapies and services that can be accessed when needed, full enactment of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act and a commitment from the State to deliver a rights-based approach to services and support for persons with disabilities and do away with the loophole that provision is "subject to resources".  We want an oversight committee with a regulatory remit to oversee and govern the delivery of disability services.  We want our children to be treated with respect and dignity and not as if they were invisible or lesser than others and for our voices to be heard.  We do not want pity or empty promises; we want action and positive change.</p> <p>  On behalf of Enough is Enough, I again thank the committee for inviting me to attend.  I am happy to take any questions and discuss this issue more comprehensively.</p></speech>

We welcome the opportunity to contribute to the discussion generated by the report from the Ombudsman for Children titled Unmet Needs.<br/><br/>Our representative bodies share the concerns of the Ombudsman for Children about the unacceptable delays that have been experienced by many children and families who have required an assessment of their needs.  There has been a long and sad legacy of assessments not being completed within specified statutory timeframes.  This has resulted in parents and children enduring years on waiting lists, having to pay for expensive private assessments or trying to challenge the HSE in the courts to have their children&rsquo;s needs identified.  None of this is good enough.<br/><br/>To complete evidence-based assessments in a timely fashion, children&rsquo;s disability services and assessments of need should have been resourced with the required staffing.  Instead of providing the staffing required, the HSE has embarked on an alternative, less widely publicised pathway that is of great concern and which we draw to the attention of the committee.  In January 2020, the HSE implemented a new standard operating procedure, SOP, for assessments of need across the country.  While our professional bodies are supportive of an SOP in principle, we have significant concerns regarding the procedure in its current iteration.  All of these concerns were relayed to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health in and were reflected in the final report by the on the matter.  The implementation of the new SOP has proceeded despite our professional bodies clearly stating that it is not in the best interests of children and, we would contend, without in any way acknowledging the recommendations of the committee.  Furthermore, the commitment to meaningful engagement with professional bodies to address our concerns given by the HSE to the health committee in 2018 was not honoured.<br/><br/>It remains our considered opinion that the changes to clinical practice described within the SOP will, in many cases, prove detrimental to children and their families.  Our members are also concerned that compliance with the SOP could lead to them being in breach of codes of conduct and ethics of their respective professional body and the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU.  The SOP is neither evidence based nor based on good practice in assessment of children with disabilities. <br/><br/>It is our opinion that the preliminary team assessment, PTA, model embedded within the SOP being implemented by the HSE is contrary to the spirit of the Disability Act 2005, which was developed as rights-based legislation.  The PTA is a brief screening assessment.  Its introduction has significantly reduced the level of assessment provided to a child under the statutory framework of assessment of need.  Prior to the SOP, the child&rsquo;s needs determined the level and type of assessment provided.  These assessments varied substantially because children&rsquo;s needs vary.  However, the SOP replaces this with a uniform screening assessment to be completed by two clinicians in a maximum of 90 minutes, regardless of the child&rsquo;s presentation and needs.  <br/><br/>The new SOP does not facilitate the diagnosis of, for example, autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability and will no longer be provided as a part of the assessment of need protocol.  Instead, children will be identified as having &quot;health needs&quot; in the service statement.</p><p>The Disability Act states that an assessment report will state whether the applicant has a disability, indicate the nature and extent of any disability and describe both the health and education needs occasioned by the disability, as well as the health or education services required to meet those needs.  It is our view that in the majority of cases it will not be possible for a psychologist, an occupational therapist or a speech and language therapist to answer these questions or to feed these back to parents within the maximum timeframe permitted within the SOP of 90 minutes.  Adequate time with parents or guardians and the child is required for the purposes of direct assessment.  It is also essential to give parents or guardians time at the conclusion of an assessment to process their reactions to any diagnosis or other feedback.</p><p> In our opinion the HSE&rsquo;s introduction of the PTA in place of comprehensive assessments will give rise to the following risks.  A child may be deemed likely to have a disability but require further comprehensive assessment to determine the nature and extent of their disability.  However, as the child will already have completed his or her assessment of need, AON, as defined in the SOP and not the Disability Act, there will be no defined legal timeframe within which this further assessment must be carried out.  Our members have reported that since the implementation of the PTA this month, the outcome in almost all cases has been a recommendation for further assessment.  It is crucial to note that this further assessment will not occur within the legislative framework of the Disability Act.  Accordingly, there are no statutory requirements for assessments to be completed within an acceptable timeframe.  It is also important to consider that this is only to complete an assessment to identify needs.  This is not the same as receiving intervention which should follow assessment.</p><p> A child may incorrectly be deemed not to have a disability because the disability was not apparent during the brief 90-minute screening.  The absence of evidence in a single screening session and setting is insufficient evidence to warrant a determination of the absence of a disability.  If a child receives an incorrect determination of no disability, he or she will consequently be denied more comprehensive assessment and receive either no or inappropriate intervention.  A child&rsquo;s difficulties may be incorrectly outlined due to a comprehensive assessment not being permitted within the PTA model.</p><p> In many geographical areas, each of these scenarios will result in substantial delays for many children and their families in accessing a wide range of appropriate and needs-based financial supports, educational provision and health services.  In addition, in many cases children risk being placed on potentially inappropriate and long waiting lists for assessment or intervention.</p><p> The Disability Act does not entitle children with disabilities to services to meet needs identified through the AON process.  Having often waited for lengthy periods for full assessment to be completed, children with identified needs then must go on a new waiting list to receive psychology, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy services.  The wait time for these services can be months to years depending on geographical location.</p><p> Rather than seek to address those challenges identified by the Ombudsman for Children, the primary goal of the new SOP would appear to be solely to enable the HSE to meet its statutory obligations under the Disability Act.  In order to achieve this goal, the SOP seeks to replace a comprehensive professional assessment process with a uniform brief screening session, as well as to designate diagnostic assessments as health needs.  We are already seeing the entirely predictable result where the assessment of a child&rsquo;s needs indicates that the child needs an assessment.  The original mistake made in developing the AON process was in separating assessment from intervention.  Assessment and intervention should be part of a seamless service offered to children with difficulties.  This flaw in the system is now further compounded by the PTA.</p><p> Four case vignettes attached to our written submission briefly illustrate what is now happening every day across the country.  The implementation of this new approach will exacerbate an already intolerable situation for children and their families.  The Psychological Society of Ireland, the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland and the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists seek the support of the committee in recommending an immediate cessation of the SOP.  We also seek the committee&rsquo;s support in recommending the HSE take a standards-based approach grounded in good practice models of professional assessment of children with disabilities.</p></speech>

I am privileged to appear alongside Mr. Smyth and Ms Comerford, both active and brave campaigners in this area.</p> <p>  I appear before the committee in the context of an excellent study by the Ombudsman for Children on the unmet needs of children whose assessments are required and where services are badly needed.  I appear before the committee as somebody who has attempted to use advocacy and legal avenues to highlight the challenges, deficits and gaps in provision brought to me on behalf of children and their families, as well as assisting those families navigate the system and the hurdles they face.</p> <p>  The Disability Act 2005 created a most progressive path for children in having their assessments and services identified.  The intention of the Oireachtas at the time was to ensure that children, within a short period, could have their assessment needs determined.  The purpose of the Act is to ensure that assessments are conducted to ascertain whether a child has a diagnosis or a disability, as well as the extent of that disability.  The Disability Act sets out clearly that the provision of an assessment must be commenced within three months of its initial referral, completed without undue delay and certainly no later than three months from its commencement.</p> <p>  It is a national scandal that 91% of children do not receive their assessments within the timeframe prescribed and mandated by law.  This has led to untold and ongoing damage to, stress for and real prejudice against children.  It cannot be dressed up as being anything other than a breach of their rights.  It is also significant to note that the Oireachtas made it clear under the Act that an assessment should be carried out without regard to costs or capacity to provide the assessment.</p> <p>  The dilemma faced by many parents when their children are not meeting their developmental milestones, presenting with challenges or being left behind by their peers - where they may be non-verbal, unable to perform basic tasks independently and are totally reliant on their care givers - is to how best to proceed to meet the needs of their children in a timely manner.  The Disability Act provides them with a mechanism to achieve a pathway to progress.  Sadly, however, it is not just the letter but the spirit of this legislation that has been and continues to be bypassed, circumnavigated and routinely ignored.</p> <p>  The overall health budget for 2020, as set out in the approved service plan, was &euro;17 billion.  The priority provided to children in assessing and meeting their needs remains woefully inadequate, however.  Why do children require assessments?  It is always important for any parent to determine the needs of their child.  It is also crucially important for children that they receive that intervention and assessment in a timely manner while ensuring there is no further regression, prejudice or loss of opportunity.  An assessment of need is often a gateway to other services, to an appropriate type of school learning environment, to special needs assistant provision, to resource teaching hours and to applications for domiciliary care allowance to help support their needs.</p> <p>  Against a backdrop of failing children and their basic entitlements, the HSE introduced a new model of how children are to be assessed in January.  It did so without any adequate communication with the representative bodies or without any adequate concern for the needs of the children in question and their families.  It has in effect sought to kick the can down the road in the proper assessment of children in a blatant and cynical way.</p> <p>  Under the new model children will no longer be assessed as they have heretofore under the Act.  There will be no multidisciplinary assessments which seek to determine what the Act requires, namely, to determine whether a child has a disability and the extent of those needs.  Instead, we have a triage system where an initial assessment will be conducted to ascertain whether further assessments are required.  The child in need of an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, assessment will not have it commenced or completed within the six-month time limit prescribed by law or at all.  Instead the HSE has sought to include such assessments in service statements which they will then claim are subject to resources.</p> <p>  How can we create a service statement setting out the services needed for children when we have not assessed what those needs are in the first place?  How can this model be in compliance with the Disability Act?  Whose interests does it serve?  One thing is clear - it does not serve the interests of children requiring early intervention.</p> <p>  In a High Court affidavit provided and endorsed by the court over two years ago, the renowned expert in autism, Dr. Rita Honan, set out the clinical rationale for early identification and early service delivery.  In her affidavit she stated that the diagnostic assessment is the gateway to treatment and the subsequent reduction of symptoms, as well as increased cognitive and adaptive functioning for the majority of children on the autism spectrum.  Every day this is delayed leads to missed learning opportunities.  Dr. Honan stated that retrospective analysis suggests that differences in development between typically developing children and those with autism may be apparent at an early stage in a child&rsquo;s development.  Detecting young children at risk before the full impact of the syndrome is present and implementing treatments can alter the course of early behavioural and brain development, thus resulting in improved outcomes.</p> <p>  The HSE is well aware of the critical need for early diagnosis and dedicated intervention.  The Ombudsman for Children report clearly highlights the continuing challenges faced by children and by their families.  During the Covid-19 pandemic the UK Parliament amended legislation that suspended the operation of certain legal requirements for children.</p><p>To the great credit of this Oireachtas, we did not do the same.  The Disability Act remains in force and stands tall as progressive legislation.  It simply requires the HSE to implement it.  I fear greatly that a substantial further number of children face the real risk of being lost and their childhoods diminished as a result of the new model, and that service delivery will therefore be even more out of reach than previously.  </p><p> As for what this committee can do next, I would welcome greatly a motion, tabled in both Houses of the Oireachtas and taken on a cross-party basis, that reaffirmed the Oireachtas&rsquo;s intentions and aspirations regarding children and their assessments under the Disability Act.  A reaffirmation of these assessments being delivered in full, on time and as provided for within the six-month period set out in the Act would be a powerful response to what is emerging.  It would vindicate the position of the Ombudsman for Children and his report and of the representative bodies holding the line against this non-child-centred approach.  It would recognise the campaigning efforts of many groups I have had the pleasure of working with on children's rights issues, including the DCA Warriors, Dyspraxia/DCD Ireland, Down Syndrome Ireland, Family Carers Ireland, AsIAM, the Involve Autism D6 group, the D12 campaign for an autism specific school and inclusion, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and many others.  Most fundamentally of all, it would show to children and their families that the Oireachtas has not forgotten the importance it attaches to the full workings of the Disability Act.</p><p> Finally, I thank this committee for bringing this vitally important matter for children into the public arena.  It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that the needs of these very vulnerable children and their families are met and their potential as fully functioning young people and adults can be realised.  I know many Deputies and Senators have often said to me how busy their constituency clinics and email inboxes are from families on this issue.  It is a real challenge up and down the country and it is therefore vital that we get this right.  This is about enabling children.  It is about helping them to be the best that they can be and removing unnecessary obstacles and barriers to allow them to reach that full potential. </p></speech>

I will just briefly explain the format for questioning.  Time is very limited, as we must vacate this room at 6 p.m. due to Covid regulations.  I ask Deputies and Senators to address their questions to a person or persons.  Five minutes are allotted for each questioner, which includes the answers, so I ask both members and witnesses to be conscious of that.

Listening to Mr. Noble calling out the names of all the different organisations that come together to fight for these children's rights was stark.  It is actually shameful how we treat those children.  I have a number of questions.</p> <p>  We have heard much about the impact on children caused by the lack of services.  I ask Ms Comerford or Ms Murphy to tell me about the impact on the families of these children, because theses children have parents and siblings who will also be impacted by the lack of services.  When people come to me, parents are often at the end of their tether while trying to support their children.  I ask Ms Comerford and Ms Murphy to talk about the impact on the wider family.</p> <p>  My question for Mr. Smyth is how easy is it to assess a child in 90 minutes.  I am a mother of four children and were I to put my child into a room with a stranger who was tasked with figuring out where the child was coming from, whether there were any issues to be addressed or determining the child's personality type, my child would completely close up and would not get involved.  I am just wondering whether that is easy or difficult.  What are the potential impacts when children do not get the services they require when they require them?  Does it come to a point where the situation is irreversible and it is impossible for a child to catch up on lost time if he or she has not received the early intervention he or she needed?</p> <p>  Mr. Noble works with and represents many families.  Has he seen an increase in the number or the severity of cases?  If so, what is the remedy for that?  Is there a cost to the State at the end of that process?  Do the children get the services they need at the end of that process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Linda Comerford" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020120800002#D00400"><p>On the question of the impact on the wider family, parents only ever want the very best for their children.  If a one notices that one's son or daughter is not meeting his or her developmental milestones or if something else sticks out for one, the first thing a parent will want to do is to get help and to access the therapies and services to remedy that or at least to help with it.  However, it often happens that parents reach out for support but do not know where to go because there are no clear guidelines and time will have passed before they find out that they need to apply for a needs assessment.  The type of assessment available to parents and children depends on where they are in the country.  For example, Ms Murphy and I could have very different experiences in accessing assessments for our children.  Ms Murphy may have a good experience with her son and I could have a horrendous experience with my daughter.  Her son may be assessed at home and at school, yet my daughter may only be assessed in a clinical setting.  Therefore, there are vast differences in service provision.</p> <p>  Parents are trying to manage the needs of a child at home when they do not really know what to do.  They are not qualified therapists or professionals and do not pretend to be.  Consequently, they are trying to do their best, while caring for other children.  Many families have more than one child with extra needs.  For example, in my home, three out of four of our children have extra needs and juggling that is really difficult.  I have spoken to families the length and breadth of the country and many of them are suffering from burnout.  They believe they are failing their children, despite the fact that they are doing everything they can for them.  Burnout is very real and that cannot be overstated.  I say that as a parent who has suffered from extreme burnout.  It was an horrific place to be and there was little or no support.  There is also a fear among parents that if they say they are suffering from burnout, they will be threatened with the possibility of their children being put into foster care by the HSE.  Therefore, they know they need help but are afraid to reach out for it.  </p> <p>  This can have a huge impact on relationships, whether they are with partners or extended families.  Sometimes due to the fact that extended families do not live with the child, they may not see the differences the parent sees and the child may behave differently in different circumstances.  Often, people will say that a child does not look as though he or she is autistic or has a disability.  This makes it very difficult for parents and it is stressful.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020120800002#D00500"><p>On Deputy Whitmore's question as to whether it is possible to complete a evidence-based assessment in 90 minutes, the answer is "No", as it is not.  None of our psychology, speech and language therapy or occupational therapy colleagues would stand over that.  It goes completely against all standards that we have and is contrary to our training on evidence based practice.  The HSE is asking us to rely on a subjective opinion, as to whether a child has a disability within too short a timeframe.  It also goes against all international standards and our training using psychometric testing to be able to get a standardised approach to testing.  Staff are being put under intolerable pressure to come to a conclusion based on that 90-minute assessment already, where they literally have to tick a box which states that a child either has or does not have a disability.  As we explained in our opening statement, if the clinician ticks one or the other, the child may then go on for further assessment, because it is an assessment to determine whether or not the child needs an assessment.  This means that they no longer come under the scope of the Disability Act and then must wait for further assessments.  It is a significant challenge and an impossible decision for a clinician to make which, as we have outlined to the HSE, may place occupational therapists, psychologists and speech and language therapists in a position in which they are expected to act contrary to professional and CORU standards.  Services are grossly inadequate at present in respect of the number of clinicians available and if they are being put in a place where they are being asked to act contrary to their training, the recruitment and retention of disciplines within the disability services will become much more difficult.</p> <p>  Significant risks also exist in respect of unmet needs.  If a child is not designated as having a disability, there are mental health risks for that young person as he or she grows older and wonders what is wrong with him or her, why he or she feels the way he or she does, and why he or she cannot keep up with his or her peers, because such children do not have an identified need for which they can receive support.  I wish to echo the points made by Ms Comerford on the cost to parents.  The cost to parents of having unmet needs identified makes parents feel like they have missed something, they are not good enough parents and this is simply not fair.  Parents are exhausted; they are full-time carers 24-7; they are sitting on waiting lists for three to five years; they are firefighting; fighting the HSE and fighting within the courts.  Therefore, the cost in respect of not getting an accurate assessment of needs is a cost to the whole family and not just to the child.</p></speech>

The problem we have found is that the complaints officers determine in our favour but the HSE ignores its own complaints officers.  Under the Act, someone could enforce in the Circuit Court the determination of the complaints officer if it has not been carried out within three months.  This means a further three months have to elapse before he or she can go near the Circuit Court.  When we go to the Circuit Court, the HSE never defends its positions.  It concedes on the first day.  This has a financial cost.  However, such costs are dwarfed when set against the financial costs that parents have to deal with while waiting, for example, paying for private assessments that often are not recognised by the HSE or educational providers and engaging private services, in particular speech and language therapy.  There is also the emotional cost that Ms Comerford has spoken about so powerfully.</p></speech>

I read their opening statements this morning in preparation for this meeting.  My blood was boiling.  I am a relatively new Deputy - I was elected a year ago this month - and this is my first time being a committee member.  I struggled last week when I heard the Ombudsman for Children say that moving a child from one list to another was just an old-fashioned three-card trick.  Today's testimonies compound that statement.  It is worrying.</p> <p>  I will ask four questions of the witnesses.  I imagine Enough is Enough and the others feel like it is like Groundhog Day, with them having to tell their stories time and again to a load of politicians and hoping that something will change.  I have been on the other side.  I was involved in campaigns, not concerning children, but other issues about which I and my party were passionate.  Just keep at it.  Things will get better if there is enough political will.</p> <p>  Regarding the new standard operation procedures, I believe it was mentioned that parents must fill out some of the report themselves.  Will Enough is Enough elaborate and tell me how difficult doing that is?  Will it lead to more unmet needs for children?  I am seeing another three-card trick.  It is a way of ticking a box and saying something is done without there being any follow-up.</p> <p>  Mr. Noble spoke about a cross-party motion.  I like that idea.  It is relevant and something that our committee could pursue.  Has support from parties been received or has there been a conversation with them?  Would members of this committee be interested in supporting it?  We in Sinn F&eacute;in would be in favour of it.</p> <p>  The barrier in the HSE to implementing the Disability Act was mentioned.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?  Why is that the case?  Is it down to money, staff or political will?  Why is there a reluctance to implement the Act?</p> <p>  My final question is for Mr. Smyth.  The report of the Psychological Society of Ireland discussed psychology, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy services.  These services are better in some areas than others.  Has there been any research into why some areas are outperforming others and whether their services can be replicated?  If a service is working, leave it working.  If it is not working, we should find out how others are doing better.  We need to move away from the postcode politics of people getting better services depending on where they live.</p></speech>

It has ten or 12 pages and much of it is box ticking.  It asks various questions about the child and the areas in which he or she is struggling.  The form will be difficult to fill out for some parents because they also have a disability.  I might notice something about my child, but it might be more significant if a professional notices.  For example, I recently noticed my son had a swallowing issue.  I did not believe it was a major issue, but upon assessment by a speech and language therapist, he now has a choking hazard and needs a thickener.  I would not have realised it was that serious.  Issues like that can go unnoticed.  If I tick the wrong box on the form or, because I do not see something as being serious, I do not see the need to relay it through the form, my son might not get an assessment or the assessment officer who gets the form might not see a significant need.  Whether an assessment is granted is often based on what the parent puts on the form, but all parents are different.  A parent might be accurate on the form or be very clued in, but we are not professionals.  We are just noticing issues with our children that we want rectified and we want professionals to help us with that.  Based on our answers, however, we might not get those professionals.</p></speech>

He asked whether I had had a conversation about my suggestion on a cross-party motion.  I have not.  Perhaps I will leave it to the committee to decide how to take the suggestion forward.  It would be a powerful message to send out on foot of the Ombudsman for Children's careful study.</p> <p>  I have lost count of the number of theories I have in terms of speculating as to why this is not being done.  It probably comes down to a lack of planning, resources and, most of all, priority.  I can think of a large number of examples of situations where assessment officers themselves have told parents that assessments would not be done for two or three years and that, if they wanted to identify appropriate school placements, they would be better off taking the private route.  I know of parents who have taken up two or three cleaning jobs just to pay for that assessment.  In Deputy Sherlock's constituency in Cork, we have seen private service reports being done but not being recognised by the HSE.  In one case I was involved in, the HSE refused to recognise a report that was conducted by a private service provider.  The mum then applied for an assessment of need, there were major delays and we brought the matter to court.  The HSE then commissioned the same private service provider in Cork to do the assessment on its behalf.</p> <p>  There is a great deal of wastage in the system.  There is a lack of thinking.  Most of all, there is a lack of priority.  The money is there.  It is just being diverted elsewhere.</p></speech>

It is down to both.  A good argument has been made that, if there are long surgery lists, one hires more surgeons.  One does not shorten the length of the surgery, offer fewer surgeries or ask someone else to do it.  It is a case of insufficient resources.</p> <p>  The system is working well in some areas.  They have sufficient staff to meet needs.  We have a postcode lottery, and that is not good enough for parents.  There is also a recruitment issue with the hiring of health and social care professionals, HSCPs, through the HSE panel system.  It does not get the right staff into the right place.  That is a barrier to making the system work.</p> <p>  The current standards-based system works.  In areas where it works well, though, it will not work any more after the new preliminary team assessment, PTA, model has been introduced.  The committee should be in no doubt that the PTA model is not the equivalent of a yellow brick road to enlightenment whereby a child's needs will be identified and met.  It is a pathway to a further Oireachtas committee hearing in a year's time when children's waiting lists have moved from three-to-five years to five-to-eight years.  I spoke to colleagues this morning, and none of them had a waiting list of less than three years.  In one area, parents were getting standardised letters saying that, at the age of five years, their children would be seen at ten and, at the age of ten, their children would be seen at 15.  We need to get ahead of this now so that we are not back here in a year's time and exactly what we have predicted has happened.</p></speech>

It has been compelling evidence that has dovetailed very much with the evidence of the ombudsman last week.  The AOTI submission states:</p> <blockquote> 	The new SOP does not facilitate the diagnosis of, for example Autistic Spectrum Disorder or Intellectual Disability and will no longer be provided as a part of the AON protocol.  Instead children will be identified as &lsquo;health needs&rsquo; in the service statement. </blockquote> <p>Mr. Smyth might help me to understand that more fully, as succinctly as possible.  If it does not take in ASD and ID, what does it take in?  If they come under health needs, will that not exclude potentially thousands of children?  Children are being de facto reclassified, which means the services do not have to follow.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

I will start and my colleague can add to that.  The preliminary team assessment will identify as a conclusion that the child has health needs and those health needs are to have further assessment to clarify what they are.  As some of the other witnesses have noted, this is a box-ticking exercise . At the bottom of the form, the clinician will be asked whether the child has a disability, which puts the clinician in a position of not being able to answer that within the 90 minutes.  The need is further assessment.  The child, from the HSE's perspective under the spirit of the Disability Act, has had an assessment but the assessment has concluded that there is a need for further assessment.</p> <p>  As an example, I spoke to a colleague earlier.  In their area, they had completed 26 PTAs within two weeks.  The outcome of all 26 PTAs was that the children needed further assessment.  The HSE has met its obligations legally under the Disability Act, but the children will now move on to waiting lists that currently range from three to five years.  Once the flood of new cases come into that, however, those waiting lists will continue to grow.</p></speech>

Without a diagnosis, services cannot be accessed; that is the critical issue.  If we step back, the real issue, and the original mistake in the AON process, related to separating assessment from intervention.  Assessment and intervention should always be part of the same seamless service offered to children.  That flaw in the system has been compounded by the new SOP-PTA model.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>

That was to clear the existing backlog of evidence-based assessments completed by clinicians.  The &euro;7.8 million is not towards the PTA model but the pre-existing one.</p></speech>

There is an evidence base, based on any rational , independent or objective assessments, to suggest that the policy is completely wrong and needs to be reviewed, reversed, rescinded and reshaped into a new policy, taking into account voices such as those of the three compelling witnesses we have heard from during this meeting.  That is something the committee will take seriously.</p> <p>  What are the witnesses' views on the consistency of outcomes for children among the CHOs?  Reference was made to recruitment.  I received a response on 17 September 2020 to a parliamentary question in which I asked the number of occupational therapists hired from each university by the HSE.  The witnesses might note the following figures on the back of an envelope if they have a pen handy.  In 2016, 135 were recruited, while in 2017, 120 were recruited, which was a reduction.  In 2018, there was a further reduction to 119.  Thus far in 2019, there have been 73.  The difference between 73 and 119 is stark and I imagine that when the figures come in for 2020, there will have been a further reduction.  How are we going to crack the conundrum of ensuring there are sufficient trained personnel to deliver the services, depending on what that service needs to look like, following our forthcoming interaction with the Minister?  I will ask him these same questions.  How are we going to deliver for children if there are not enough people who are suitably qualified to assist children such as Linda's?  What is the best way to ensure we recruit enough people in order that every child can get access to the services?</p></speech>

Among all the HSPCs that responded - more than 1,200 - 92% suggested that the current panel-based system of recruitment was not fit for purpose.  Despite the Government over the past ten years noting a recruitment and retention issue in respect of health and social care professionals who are required on the ground to deliver these services, its own method of recruitment is one of the greatest barriers to getting staff in place.</p> <p>  Over many years, I have seen statistics where the HSE talks about recruitment of professionals.  They may be approved posts but may not necessarily be in place.  Some of the published statistics refer to approved posts but the time it takes to get that person in post is an entirely different matter.  We also need to examine, across the whole spectrum of psychology and speech and language and occupational therapy, the breadth of experience and what grade the posts are.  We have a grade structure for clinicians on the ground, most of whom are senior.  Many of these children and their families require significant expertise among the clinicians to be best supported, but also that is also required to support the staff in order that the staff will not burn out early in their careers.  We need to ask difficult questions about posts being created and what level of seniority they are to ensure that the appropriate level of supervision is available within those disciplines to provide the support those families need.</p></speech>

If the professional bodies were consulted, we could say what the best approach is, but we have not been consulted.  The SOP and the PTA model will not align with what we know best practice is, but even if we were following the best practice model, we would need staffing and infrastructure to deliver that, but neither the right model nor the staffing and resources is in place.</p></speech>

I am conscious that we have a small number of people in here but behind them is a large number of families and children who have struggled yet were denied services and rely on each other for support.  I thank the witnesses for the hard work they have done to support other families and people who are going through the nightmare journey that they have experienced.  I appreciate that it is another unfair burden.  We have talked about care burnout where not only must they care for their own families, they must now look out for each other's families.  While there is strength in that solidarit,y the work being done still takes energy.  I thank them for keeping up that work and energy.</p> <p>  I noticed that Mr. Noble shook his head at the idea that the new model met the legal definition of "assessment".  Does he think the SOP would stand up in court if they are so far beyond the bounds of the Disability Act?  I appreciate that if matters have already begun, he cannot talk about them.  Who represents the HSE when it goes to the Circuit Court?  Has it brought in outside legal services or is it an inhouse team?  If it is an outside legal service then there is a marginal cost that is probably significantly more than the cost of hiring people to do this.  Value for money have been the watchwords of the Civil Service for a long time.  Such a practice does not seem to be value for money and, when one adds in the emotional cost, it makes no sense whatsoever.  I would like to hear the view of the witnesses on those two issues.</p> <p>  Can Mr. Smyth refer briefly to the panel?  If not, perhaps he will provide information to us on the weaknesses of the panel recruitment process.  I ask for that because I am conscious that that is something which is used in social work.  The committee has previously debated social work recruitment and related issues so I am sure there is an overlap.</p></speech>

He is right that I have huge difficulties, from a legal perspective, as to whether this is in legal compliance with the Disability Act because, as I said in my presentation, the purpose of the Act is to determine whether a child has a diagnosis and the extent of that diagnosis.  Having listened to Mr. Smyth and his colleagues, I do not know how a diagnosis can be achieved in a 90-minute meeting that is very dependent on the questionnaires Ms Comerford and other families have been provided with.</p> <p>  In the absence of a very serious rethink on this matter, High Court challenges are inevitable.  Those costly court procedures are unnecessary and can be avoided but they will be necessary to meet the needs of these children.  I cannot say what the High Court or any other court will say but it is my view that this will not stand up in court because it cannot be said to be compliance with the Disability Act.  Privately, at senior levels of the HSE, there is agreement with my assessment.  They know that this is inevitable and I cannot understand why they would go to court about something that everybody privately or publicly might consider to be a real issue.</p> <p>  I cannot comment on the issue of the legal teams who appear for the HSE.  I simply do not know the nature of their relationship with the HSE other than to say that when they do come to court they regularly concede that the timeframes are not those mandated by law, which is a cruel trick to play on families.  Many families have received a letter saying, "We know we have do this but you are going to be two or three years waiting because of our current capacity and workloads".  Yet the Disability Act has made it very clear that the cost of those assessments is not a defence to the non-implementation of limits.  That is, again, a very progressive section within the Disability Act that needs to be preserved at all costs.</p></speech>

The ombudsman's report is out of date because when it was published, the HSE had admitted that 554 health and social care professionals, comprising various therapists so vital for children's development, including physiotherapists, psychologists, speech therapists, occupational therapists and so forth, were involved in Covid-19 swabbing and contact tracing.  The majority of these staff were involved in swabbing in the community, which could have been carried out by other medical professionals and nurses who had responded to the Be On Call for Ireland initiative but had not been recruited.  In my own part of the country, three quarters of the speech and language therapists in counties Roscommon and Galway were involved in contact tracing and testing.  Before the lockdown there was a four-year waiting list for access to speech and language therapy and occupational therapy in those counties and I believe they have now increased.  What feedback have the witnesses received about the impact of Covid-19 on the delays?  Will it compound the problem?  What specific measures can be taken?  When a preschool child is referred for speech and language services, for example, that support will not be forthcoming until after he or she receives his or her first holy communion, which is an unacceptable situation.</p></speech>

Speech and language services were already threadbare but they have been decimated by that.  There has been a very slow response, having spoken to the members of various bodies, in terms of redeploying people back to the services.</p> <p>  As the Deputy mentioned, there was a waiting list of four years. Referrals did not stop because people were redeployed to tackle Covid and kept coming.  Therapists returned to provide services with lengthier waiting lists than before the pandemic but that is if people are redeployed back to services.  This morning when I spoke to colleagues I found out that psychologists, occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists were redeployed to the AON unit to clear backlogs.  They, therefore, went from Covid testing and swabbing to clearing the backlog of legacy assessments.  They were moved from their disability and primary care teams but sent to do PTA assessments to conclude that the child needed further assessment.  Then they have to return to the services they came from, which have lengthier waiting lists, because they could not do the assessments that were required under the new PTA model.</p> <p>  We need a commitment that the clinicians will be put back on the front line to do their jobs and to provide them with additional staff to support them.  If we do not provide additional staff on the ground to meet this need, we will no longer have a disability service because staff will burn out and leave.  We will be unable to convince them to work in the disability services in the first place.  We need to address this now to address the legacy issue.  Last week, the ombudsman captured the scenario well when he said: "In this scenario we are not robbing Peter to pay Paul, we are just robbing Peter."  We wholly concur with his conclusion.</p></speech>

In evidence given to the Joint Committee on Health by the HSE they categorically stated that once those therapy staff were relieved from contact tracing and swabbing they would go back into the front-line services.  Are the witnesses saying that has not in fact happened and they have not gone back into the front-line services, as the HSE had stated in evidence given before another Oireachtas committee?</p></speech>

HSE representatives who appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health stated categorically that staff would be put back into front-line services to deal with the backlogs that had been created and now we find out from evidence given before this committee today that this blatantly is not happening.  It is an issue that needs to be taken up in conjunction with the Joint Committee on Health because the HSE is saying one thing to the committees and doing something completely different.  It is similar to the actions that are being taken regarding the SOP, a horrendous situation where we have the professionals and Members of Parliament clearly stating that they should not go down a particular avenue and the HSE is then blatantly ignoring that stated policy, which is completely unacceptable and intolerable.</p></speech>

In the short time I have been a member of the committee, I am conscious of the level of inequality in care for children and we talk about the rights of the child.  I very much thank the witnesses for coming in and presenting to us, which is appreciated.  It is not they who are at fault.  As one of the witnesses said, they are the professionals and hold children&rsquo;s best interests at the core of what they do.  It is hard to understand that a commitment was given that a child would have to wait no longer than three months for an assessment and now they have to get pre-assessed to be assessed, which is just kicking the can down the road.  As a Traveller woman who came through primary and second level education with full-blown dyslexia and really struggled for many years, I know the impact having any sort of a learning disability can have on a child in feeling less than the other children in the classroom.  I am not an educational professional when it comes to children with special needs.  The question I have for the witnesses is what would they like this committee to do as we go forward to address some of the backlog where children&rsquo;s needs are not being met?  If any of the witnesses could answer that question, I would give my support to make happen to the best of my ability.  That is my only question.  I thank the witnesses for coming in and for their level of work.  I stress that as a 30 year old woman who went through the education system with a disability, it has a dramatic impact on one's learning, mental health and everything else that goes with that.</p></speech>

The one thing we do not want is for this to be just another committee or that we speak to more politicians and tell them our frustrations and anger about how our children are being neglected and for that to be heard but then to blow away in the wind.  We want TDs and Senators across parties to finally come together and put this issue to bed and put the children first.  These children will not stay children; they will become adults.  One of my children is an adult with a disability.  If the members think children services are bad, it is gets to a whole new level once they turn 18.  It is diabolical.  All that happens is that all the different struggles are being pushed further and further down the road.  When they get older it is so much harder on them and on their families.  They are frustrated and Covid definitely impacted; we see how bad the services are.  It really has impacted on how much our young people are struggling because, by God, they are struggling.  Enough is enough and I know Ms Vanessa Murphy will concur with me on this.  We just want to be finally heard, for the parents, the children and the professional bodies to be heard.  Positive action with full engagement needs to happen.  I do not want to be sitting here in ten years time talking about this.  I do not want a point to come in the future, when the members are retired and my son has children - and God forbid one of them has a disability - when he would have to go through the same fight I had.  I do not want to see that happen for anybody.  We need to put this matter to bed and finally to put children first and provide them with the level of supports they need now in order for them to reach best potential because when they become adults it gets so much worse.</p></speech>

As Ms Linda Comerford said, the majority of our group would have young children but dealing with their needs will be pushed down the road.  In my circumstances, I ask myself if we cannot change things now what will it be like for my six year old when he becomes an adult.  Whatever the cost to the State is now, the cost with be trebled with residential placement.  Where are these children to go?  If they are not getting early interventions and the help they need now, where will they be in ten years time when they become adults?  There are not residential places for all these children who have been left behind and that is where many of these children are headed if they do not get the help they need now.</p></speech>

It is very important that parents of children with special needs or disabilities are listened to.  I totally agree with what they said.  Action is needed and they need to see more action.

Early intervention is there for a reason.  It is there because it mitigates against difficulties down the line.  Certainly from a legal perspective, the rights of young vulnerable adults are even less available than for children under the Disability Act.  Picking up on what Senator Flynn, Ms Comerford and Ms Murphy have said, parents who come to see me, often now through Zoom now, are beyond wanting tea and sympathy from decision markers.  They want action.  One mum recently said to me, it is like they put up the 110 m hurdles along the track, she gets over them and then she looks around the other side of the track and the 110 m hurdles are being put up all over again.  We have got to stop that.  We must look after our carers.  We must empower them to feel that when they go knocking on a door they will be invited in rather than closed off.  I see many young people now in adulthood who are struggling.  They do not have day centres to attend and respite is an invisible entity and at the more extreme end because their needs were not met at an early stage, we are taking them into wardship and residential centres and so on.  Much of this can be avoided if we take early intervention seriously.</p></speech>

In terms of what we would be asking the committee to do, we would be asking for support for an immediate cessation of the SOP because, as we said, it will not meet children&rsquo;s needs and will only exacerbate the existing problem.  We were dismayed that the 2018 heath committee recommendations were largely ignored from our point of view.  What we really do not want to see is that the work of this 2020 committee will be similarly ignored because otherwise it will be a number of years down the line before this is addressed..  That is why we want parents&rsquo; voices not just to be heard but acted on.  We do not need more talking shops.</p><p> Parents are exhausted.  We need to be their voice and advocate for them in order that they will not have to fight.  To echo what Ms Murphy said, we do not want to end up with children being put in residential care.  That is expensive and ineffective.  We know that early intervention works, that it is cost effective and that it is evidence based.  We need to be doing it - not waiting around - and trying to rectify the mistakes.  Something else I would like to see, which is an aspiration but one the children of Ireland deserve, given that this comes from a rights-based perspective, is children having a right to intervention, not just assessment.  Assessment identifies need.  It is heartbreaking for a parent who has fought to get their child's needs identified to then have to start another fight for help to meet these needs.  We need to ensure, as my colleague, Mr. Allen, said, that assessment and intervention flow from one to other because assessment has to have intervention,  for both the children and their families.</p></speech>

It is a very important session, so that is much appreciated.  My questions are for Mr. Noble in regard to the new model of assessing children.  If he were Minister, what would he identify as the unnecessary obstacles and barriers that need to be removed immediately?  What are the key changes that should be implemented, possibly with less effort than others?  What key priorities does he identify within the service statement he mentioned in his opening statement to meet the needs of a child-centred approach?  How would that be implemented in terms of HSE diagnostics, intervention, recruitment of personnel and possibly the funding model which goes with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.247" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Noble" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020120800002#J00300"><p>I often find it strange how little we hear from the HSE about wanting additional funding to meet its obligations under the Disability Act for recruitment and so on.  I recall being involved in one case a number of summers ago where it took longer than the six-month timeframe for a complaint to be heard.  In that case, the HSE's solution to the backlogs was not to call for more recruitment of speech and language therapists, OTs, physiotherapists or psychologists.  Instead, much to the bewilderment of the court, its priority was to beef up the complaints system and recruit more complaints officers to deal with it.  We were going to go from having one national complaints officer, based in Naas, County Kildare, to three or four.  That was the solution and it demonstrated where the priorities were and the lack of will to deliver in that regard.</p> <p>  I am asking the HSE to do no more than comply with the law.  The law states that its assessments must be commenced within three months and must be determined no later than three months from the commencement.  We know, however, that 91% of assessments are not conducted within that timeframe.  In addition, in terms of service provision, before coming to this meeting I lodged nine complaints on behalf of families, all going back into the system to try to progress assessments or service delivery.  We were dealing with service statements where we were told that the assessments referred to non-verbal children requiring urgent interventions as soon as possible.  All these phrases were littered throughout the assessments, yet the service statement today suggested that the earliest day by which these children will be seen for those key interventions is August 2022.  That is an unacceptable dereliction of duty and an unacceptable breach of a duty of care.</p> <p>  There is going to be a further cost in this regard.  In a High Court case of 2007, Mr. Justice Peart found that four months was an unacceptable period in the life of a two-year-old and the context of early intervention.  He said valuable time was being wasted.  In the context of a four-month delay, which by the time the child was being assessed had increased to four months, he ordered that child and their parents to be awarded &euro;50,000 in damages.  It is crazy that parents would ever have to countenance coming to the likes of me to have basic rights vindicated.  I would love nothing more than for my role to be made redundant.  The way to make my role redundant is simply to comply with the law.</p></speech>

In my constituency of Mayo, the demand for speech and language and occupational therapists is enormous.  Do we get value for money by throwing money at it?  Can we recruit the specialists to meet the significant demand from families and parents?  Do we have a response to this in any way?  Can a solution be found?  What are Mr. Smyth's thoughts on the matter?</p></speech>

However,the resources have to be there in order for them to be used better.  We have speech and language and occupational therapists and psychologists who have the requisite skill and expertise to provide these services, but we need a new system of recruitment to get them in place in order that the right person is in the right job at the right time.  As I said earlier, I can provide a copy of that report on recruitment to the committee for members' perusal.  We know the process does not work, and we have been saying for ten years that we need to be listened to in order that we can get these people in place and ensure that children have their needs met.</p></speech>

There has been underinvestment in health and social care professional services for many years.  We understand the financial difficulties and the challenges within which the HSE is operating, and the impact of the recession ten years ago, but there has been historic, chronic under-resourcing of health and social care professional services and that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

One relates to the assessment, while the other requires that the service statement be reviewed no later than 12 months after it is drawn up, reviewed or amended.  Many families, including mine as well as others the length and breadth of the country, seldom get a review or, if they do, there is a loophole as to why it cannot be done.  The child might have seen one person once who amended the statement, which means the review can then be dragged out for another 12 months.  Every step of the way, one has to fight.  Even in that 12 months, the child may not have received any services, so chances are that he or she will have regressed in one area or another.  What is a priority for a child this year might be different from what it is for him or her next year.  Their needs are forever changing and I see that with my own kids.</p></speech>

As a result of the way the models are configured, preschool children are dealt with by the early intervention team and are then transferred to the school-age team lists.  For many parents, however, their children are never seen by the early intervention team before they age out.  In addition to what Ms Comerford said about other lists, children must then join another waiting list for the school-age team, which relates to those over the age of six.  Multiple lists are in play in this regard.</p> <p>  Ms Comerford made a good point about the review process.  At the bottom of every assessment of need it is stated that the assessment is to be reviewed on X date.  This is mostly ten months after the date of assessment.  I have never once heard of a parent being contacted by the HSE liaison officer on the day the child was to be reviewed to invite them in for a review.  It is only when the HSE is asked, and then the parent has to justify what further assessments might be needed.  There is an old phrase "A week is a long time in politics", but it is a long time in the life of a young person and it is even longer when he or she has received no services through that 12-month period.</p></speech>

I am angry with the HSE and because Ms Comerford and Ms Murphy have had to go through this.  There are parents who are still going through this and who will go through this for years to come.</p><p>It does not make any difference whether we throw money at it and how much money we throw at it, we seem to not have the clinicians to deal with it.</p><p> As a public representative, many parents have come to me over the years who needed their children assessed.  One would ring the HSE and try to get in touch with the HSE to get appointments or one would ring Enable Ireland and do whatever one could to get the child an appointment as quickly as possible.  To my embarrassment, sometimes, I have had to talk to parents whose children have not been getting the services they should have been and I have told them it might be time for them to walk away.  Imagine having to say that to a parent.  I have been in tears with parents over the years when they could not cope with their children any more because they have not been supported in caring for the child.  Not getting the care for the child leads to the child going into residential care.  There was no other choice but to tell the parents that to get the services they need they may have to walk away and let Tusla come in - and they will get every service under the sun then.  I have had to do that with parents with a very heavy heart.</p><p> What is happening to our children today is shameful.  I am a parent.  I have children and foster children but I am in shock at what I am hearing today.  There will be cases down the line where we have failed and where the HSE has failed the children of this State.  What will be done about recruiting these clinicians?  I feel that Mr. Noble should be where the HSE is.  He is in the wrong job and should be over where Mr. Smyth is.</p></speech>

I am grateful to those carers and mothers and fathers who have been going through the toughest of times trying to have their voices heard and being a voice for other parents who are not strong enough to shout for their child.  I thank Ms Comerford and Ms Murphy for being the voices of those parents.  As a politician, I am completely ashamed.  While I do everything I can, it is difficult when one is up against the system we have today.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Keogan.  Working on mental health on the ground over the years, it has been heartbreaking, personally and professionally, to have parents in front of me.  I have had parents who had late diagnoses and who had to act as parents, carers and prison officers at times because of the risks their children were dealing with.  These parents were beaten down by the system.  As the Senator eloquently put it, these are the parents who have the energy to fight.  Many parents do not have that energy any more and it is wrong.  We have a broken system and what is being put in place will not fix that system.  It will make it worse.  I have encountered parents who have loved and still love their children with everything they have but have said they could do no more.  As the Senator has described, they let Tusla take them because they just cannot do it.  We have had parents whose mental health has been impacted.  They have given up their jobs and risked losing their houses because they love their children and fight for them.  They should not have to fight.  We have clinicians on the ground who are hearing these stories and are powerless to do anything about it.  I agree that we need more staff but we need the staff to come into a system that is evidence-based, rather than throwing money and staff into a system that does not meet children's needs.</p></speech>

I am pleased to see how well-informed the committee members are.  That reflects their experience with constituents and others they have worked with.

This is 2020 and these are our vulnerable children and adults with disabilities today.  That is shameful and if the members do not remember any other words from today, they should remember those and use them to keep fighting.  This really has to change.  I do not want any parent to go through what we have gone through.  We get calls and messages every day.  It is hard but one keeps going.  Some parents are sleep deprived because their children do not sleep.  We could be chatting at 5 a.m. and we have not gone to bed because our kids have not gone to bed.  We have to fight because, if we do not fight for our children, who will do it for us?  That is why we are here.  We want, once and for all, positive change and for our children to matter in this country.</p></speech>

For them to be the voices of those children is important and we will take on board what they are saying.</p> <p>  In response to Mr. Smyth, a simple temporary solution would be for the cessation of the standard operating procedures.  Mr. Smyth obviously has serious concerns.  The required consultation has not happened, either with Mr. Smyth's organisation or with the parents, to ensure reforms are made that will meet the needs of the children.  I am prepared to make that call to the Minister and it would give that bit of breathing space to allow a better system to be put in place.</p> <p>  On the new system coming out, Mr. Smyth's statement noted that his organisation's "members have reported that since the implementation of the PTA this month, the outcome in almost all cases [to date] has been a recommendation for further assessment."  Can he give a percentage on that?  What percentage is essentially kicking the can down the road and putting further delays on these children?  </p></speech>

One community healthcare organisation, CHO, completed 26 PTAs in two weeks and all 26 were referred on for further assessment.  My impression from my speech and language and occupational therapy colleagues is that this will be a consistent outcome.  Clinicians will not put their careers or professional standards on the line to make a determination of disability in 90 minutes and give a false sense of what a child's needs are or will not indicate what their needs are based on 90 minutes.  My expectation is that this will continue to occur and place a further burden on our creaking system.</p></speech>

Like many other Deputies and Senators, I deal with this topic regularly in my constituency.  The committee feels passionate about the issue and wanted to examine it as one of our first topics but we do not want to be part of a report that sits on a shelf gathering dust.  I do not want to be the Chair of a committee that oversees anything like that.  It was fantastic that we had these presentations today in advance of our meeting with the Minister of State because we can directly put those issues, concerns and questions to her and we will have further engagement in the new year.  Then we can meet as a committee about some of the suggestions that were made, such as the cross-party motion.  The good thing about this committee is that it is cross-party.  All parties, as well as Independents, are represented.</p><p>It is the appropriate forum in a way to try to get that cross-party approach that everybody wants to see.</p><p> I sincerely thank the witnesses.  The testimony of Ms Murphy and Ms Comerford was powerful.  I know they are tired and that it is a battle and a struggle but we really appreciate them giving up their time and coming before the committee today and telling us their stories.  When I speak about this topic I always say people should not have to tell their stories to their local Deputy or anybody, and the system should not be like that, but we appreciate being able to hear first hand from people exactly what they are going through so that, hopefully, we can use it to help fight the battle alongside them.  I thank Mr. Noble, Mr. Smyth and the other witnesses.  We really appreciate it.  As I said, we will continue with this topic next week, when we will have engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte.  We will possibly consider it again in the new year.  My sincere thanks to everybody for coming today.  We genuinely appreciate it and we will be staying on top of this topic.</p><p> I propose we publish the opening statements to the Oireachtas website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I remind everyone to vacate the room immediately to allow for cleaning and set-up of the next meeting.</p></speech>

The meeting has been convened to consider the 2020 Supplementary Estimate for Vote 45 - Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, which was referred to the committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Niall Collins, and his official to the meeting this afternoon.  My thanks to the Minister of State, his officials and the Department for the briefing documentation they have provided to the meeting.  As the Minister of State is present, the official should refrain from speaking in public session.</p> <p>  I will now ask the Minister of State to make his opening statement.  Members can ask general questions on Vote 45.  The first questioner up is Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh.  We will hear first the opening statement from the Minister of State.</p></speech>

I am grateful for the opportunity to address the committee as part of its consideration of the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for 2020.  The Minster, Deputy Harris, sends his apologies for not being in attendance today and has asked that I represent the Department in his absence.  I propose to give a brief initial overview of the Supplementary Estimate and I will be happy to address any questions that members may have.</p> <p>  By way of background the Minister, Deputy Harris, was before this committee as recently as last month as part of the 2020 Further Revised Estimates process.  At that point Vote 45 for this Department was established and &euro;2.3 billion was moved from the Department of Education in line with the functions that transferred to this Department along with approval of some &euro;173 million in additional funding for the Vote.  It was highlighted to the committee at that stage that the intention was to return to seek consideration of additional funding required for a once-off student support initiative.  The idea was that this would be dealt with subsequently through the Supplementary Estimates process and this is reason we are here today.  The 2020 Supplementary Estimate currently before the committee relates exclusively to the additional &euro;43.5 million expenditure from the Vote in 2020 to implement the once-off Covid-19 student assistance fund for the academic year 2020-2021 announced as part of budget 2021 and agreed at the Government meeting of 17 November.</p> <p>  The Department has been conscious of the impact the pandemic has had on our students.  To ensure the safety of our students and staff in further and higher education, the majority of college tuition is being provided online for this semester and this is being further considered in line with public health advice.  This level of uncertainty and the additional pressure on our third level students have been difficult and require significant financial, operational and well-being supports.  In recognition of the challenges facing third level students, the Government has approved once-off funding to provide additional financial assistance in this academic year.  This is projected to cost some &euro;43.5 million based on current estimated student numbers.  To pave the way for addressing this uncertainty and pressure, financial and mental, on our students a range of measures have been provided in 2020 through this once-off ring-fenced additional funding provision.  This once-off fund in 2020 will provide financial assistance at this unprecedented time to approximately 170,000 students in our third level sector.  This funding builds on the measures announced as part of Covid financial supports for the sector in July.  Elements of this funding assisted students through the provision of laptops for disadvantaged students and increasing the student assistance fund.</p> <p>  The Department has engaged intensively with the Higher Education Authority, Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, and key stakeholders such as the Irish Universities Association, the Technological Higher Education Association and Technological University Dublin in developing this process.  As part of this process it has been critical to acknowledge the limited timeframe for distribution of this funding in 2020 and the necessity that existing processes need to be utilised.  Officials in the Department continue to engage with these stakeholders in the roll-out of the funding.  Measures are being put in place to mitigate the risks of duplicate payments and to ensure appropriate levels of governance in line with the guidelines for SUSI and the higher education providers.</p> <p>  This once-off ring-fenced funding allocation for 2020 will not have any long-term impact on SUSI grant provision or other student services and will not alter the review of SUSI which is being developed.  The Covid student assistance fund will provide financial assistance to all full-time third level students in publicly funded institutions in recognition of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Therefore, in cases of more than one third level student per family, each student will be entitled to receive the full &euro;250 amount.  I thank the committee again for its consideration of this Supplementary Estimate and I am happy to engage on any issues which members wish to raise.</p></speech>

When the Minister of State uses the term "full-time third-level education", he is not including any of the students under his own brief as Minister of State with responsibility for skills and further education.

In the circumstances, the rebate is to be welcomed, as has it has been at previous committee meetings on the subject attended by the Minister of State, the Minister and the heads of universities.  However, there is an ongoing campaign at third level institutions to increase the budget, which is why I asked for a breakdown of the figures.  While the students have a legitimate concern, as illustrated at the last meeting, there is a very significant fixed cost in our third-level institutions which does not change whether students are receiving tuition in person or online.</p> <p>  I wanted to focus on hardship or welfare supports for students, particularly where parents had lost employment or are furloughed because of Covid.  Is it envisaged that supplementary supports will be available through third-level institutions to support students who might find themselves in that position, either in the overall or supplementary budgets?  That will include a mix of students, including those who may or may not be in receipt of a SUSI grant.  </p></speech>

In a welcome move a number of months ago, the Minister, Deputy Harris, announced a review of SUSI rates for next year.  I presume the review will include eligibility criteria.  If there is a review, everything is up for review.  There has been no significant review of SUSI for a long time.  Outside the review, I believe an additional &euro;20 million has been allocated to SUSI for next year.</p></speech>

We do not need to get into the specifics because it is a broader debate.  Last week we had discussions on funding with the third level institutions.  We have had these discussions before.  When the Minister of State was in opposition, his party and mine raised the issue of funding for third level institutions.  While the additional funds are welcome, particularly the initiative to give something back to students, having fees at all is an issue.  I was in my first year in third level in 1995-96 when the then Fine Gael, Labour Party and Democratic Left Government with a Labour Party Minister for Education abolished fees.  They slowly came back until they were formalised, I think in the Thirty-first D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  I would like a meaningful discussion and actual Government action on the issue with the agreement, I hope, of all parties in the House to recognise the need to bridge the funding gap, and to ensure we maintain our high position in the league tables.  We should broaden out third level education and qualifications beyond universities to other third level institutions, apprenticeships and everything else.  We need a conversation and I would appreciate the Minister of State's views.</p></speech>

The Estimates are straightforward.  Having read and understood them, I think this is welcome.  We all wish we could do even more for students but this is a welcome measure.  As Deputy Alan Farrell mentioned, we need to see the fees issue resolved in the longer term.</p> <p>  To stray slightly away from the Estimates, my questions are on mental health supports in our third level institutions.  We need to aim to remove some of the financial pressures on students this year due to lack of part-time work and additional costs.  Third level students have had an experience of college this year, which has been unlike any other year.  The budget contained welcome announcements on mental health funding.  I would like to see that followed through specifically into the third level area.</p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to some of the savings to come from the National Training Fund.  It was inevitable that the full amount has not been spent given the Covid context.  We are also aware of the programme for Government commitments on the need for housing and the need to retrofit housing, leading to an increased need for tradespeople in the coming years.  This is outside today's discussion and the Minister of State may not be able to provide detail on it.  Are we planning ahead to address that shortage in tradespeople?  Looking ahead, do we foresee additional spending to get back to where we know we need to be after this?</p></speech>

It was broken down into various component parts, including &euro;20 million for student assistance funding and a scheme to purchase 17,000 laptops.  I do not have the exact amount for mental health supports but I think it was &euro;3.4 million to fund additional mental health supports in each of our institutions through their support services to engage additional psychologists and counsellors to provide extra capacity for students, particularly in the pandemic year.</p><p>Our agricultural colleges were raised in this committee and in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The agricultural colleges do not come under our remit but come under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  In recent days, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine has made &euro;200,000 available for a hardship fund for students attending agricultural colleges to cover mental health supports and the purchase of IT equipment or Internet connectivity.  It is basically a catch-all fund to support students who are experiencing hardship and do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase the supports and the IT equipment needed.</p><p>We are very conscious of the shortage of people in the trades.  The apprenticeship action plan is being drafted at present and will be published early in the new year.  It is envisaged that a number of new apprenticeships will be offered.  A &euro;3,000 incentive is being offered to employers to take on an apprentice, with I believe &euro;1,000 on signing on and &euro;2,000 after a year - it might be <i>vice versa</i>.  That incentive has been very popular and has been extended to the middle of next year when it will be reviewed.  It has been quite attractive in encouraging employers to take on apprentices.  I believe about 700 apprentices have been engaged through that incentive to date. </p></speech>

Earlier the Minister of State mentioned an additional &euro;20 million for SUSI grants.</p><p>That is certainly welcome but, on a connected matter, will the threshold regarding the amount of money students in part-time work can earn be increased?  I understand it is currently &euro;4,500, which is very low.  This also leads to a disincentive for students to find part-time work to help fund their education.  The Minister of State may not have that information here today but I would be grateful if it could be provided in writing.</p><p> On the issue with which we are presented today, students who get the SUSI grant get a top-up of &euro;250 while students who do not get that grant get a credit note of &euro;250.  There is a difficulty with that.  A constituent contacted me on this matter.  It is welcome that the students will receive this payment of &euro;250 before Christmas but my constituent raised the issue of qualifications for this payment.  It has been stated that this money will be given via a top-up in the SUSI maintenance grant or by way of credit note for students who are not in receipt of this payment.  The student concerned will receive a &euro;250 credit note which can be used for on-campus services or any outstanding fees to be paid to third level institutions.  This year alone, this student has paid a &euro;224 student levy contribution to the National University of Ireland, Galway.  He also pays rent of &euro;475 a month in Galway.  He is therefore not in a position to use that once-off student support grant of &euro;250, which would be of great help to him.  </p><p> The sense I get from him is that, by giving some students the &euro;250 cash sum on top of the regular maintenance grant, another barrier to education has effectively been created.  Most students, regardless of the SUSI fees grant, will have their fees paid off by now either with money earned working full time throughout the pandemic or with a loan they have secured.  Campuses around the country are closed and there is little to no hope of colleges reopening after Christmas.  On top of this, for final year students like my constituent, a &euro;250 credit note will not mean much as such students may not be returning to full-time education next year once they graduate.  Will the Minister of State look at this issue to see if something can be done in the interest of fairness?  The &euro;250 is obviously very welcome but, in order to improve the situation for some students such as my constituent, I would be grateful if the Minister of State could look at the matter.</p></speech>

If I understand the circumstances she has outlined correctly, this student is a fourth-year student who has paid all of his fees in their entirety and is not in receipt of a SUSI grant.  In that instance, the student will get a cash refund of &euro;250 from his college.  It is relatively straightforward.  By giving students who are not in receipt of a SUSI grant a credit against their next semester fees, future fees or other on-campus charges, we are trying to avoid having to create a whole new payments system and all of the grief involved in obtaining technology, setting up a system, the tendering process and hiring.  We are trying to do this in the most streamlined and straightforward fashion to give the students who are entitled and eligible the benefit of this money as early as possible.  In the case the Deputy has cited, a cash refund will issue.</p></speech>

When the announcement was made that the Department of Education of Skills was to be split up and that the Department in which the Minister of State now serves was to be established, I was not convinced.  I did not make any public comment at the time because I was interested to see how it would work out.  I am, however, genuinely enthused as to how it has worked out.  It was a good move.  We are now putting an emphasis on this aspect of education, which was previously swamped in the larger Department.  The traditional Department of Education can now focus on the primary and secondary sectors and on other bits under its remit while we can speak to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and to the Minister of State regarding this specific area.  I believe he acknowledged in his contribution that a number of policy areas had been allowed to drag and had not really been tackled.  The funding issue is central to that.</p> <p>  While I appreciate the reason we are here, I might ask the Minister of State a general question or probe him a little bit more.  He has mentioned the Cassells report.  Did he say that it had gone to the European Commission?</p></speech>

I do not want to put the Minister of State in the position of making predictions with regard to how we should proceed but there are certainly a number of pinch points in the system.  Every single third level institution and college of further education says that it is underfunded.  Meanwhile, there is a feeling that there is too great a burden on the individual student or on his or her family.</p> <p>  As was alluded to earlier, those of our political persuasion have a vision of free education or education funded exclusively by the taxpayer.  The previous Government ruled out any sort of student loans scheme quite strongly.  I do not mean to put the Minister of State on the spot but can he give us a sense of how we could work together as a committee to tease through these solutions?  There is no quick fix or easy answer.  It is not as simple as saying that a given ideological position is much better than any other.  I remember when this idea first came to the fore, which I myself benefited from, the argument was made that families who would have spent money on third level education would spend it instead on fee-paying schools to which they would not previously have had access.  The argument was that it would only benefit the middle class and that it would not open third level education up to a whole cohort of students who had previously been locked out.  It is arguable whether that was actually the case.  </p> <p>  As to the future funding of third level education generally, will the Minister of State comment as to how effective this new Department will be in driving that debate?  Will he give us some indication as to where he feels we need to go?</p></speech>

I do not want to do a disservice to the process that will arrive at the ultimate decision.  Suffice it to say that the Minister, Deputy Harris, has said on the record a number of times that this is the elephant in the room.  The issue has been knocking around for a long time.  We all know there are no magic money trees in the real world, or at least most of us do.  These are the decisions that will have to be taken.  The Cassells report lays out a number of options, as the Deputy will know.  Different people will have different takes on it.  I will not give the Deputy my person opinion but, suffice it to say that the Minister has said, on a number of occasions, that this is an issue on which this Department will ultimately be judged.</p></speech>

I welcome the Supplementary Estimate.  We all recognise that extra money is needed in light of this exceptional year.  There has been talk about money being spent on mental health services.  I believe all of us in this room agree that getting third level students back on campus must be a top priority for this committee and for universities.  We had the provost of Trinity College Dublin and the president of the National University of Ireland, Galway, here last week and I believe they recognised that.</p><p> I want to make several points.  One of the matters mentioned by the provost and president was that when it comes to deciding whether remote learning should take place, the decision is to be made by the individual lecturer.  Obviously, individual lecturers should have a significant say in this regard but I am concerned that they would have ultimate control over whether students come back on campus or continue with remote learning.  Fortunately, this is an historic day because we have seen the first people on the island vaccinated against Covid-19.  I hope that early next year we will have vaccination rolled out, which will ensure people who are less vulnerable, such as young students, can get back on campus.  What is the view of the Minister of State, the Department and the officials on trying to ensure that we get more people back on campus?  Is it an important priority for them?  What does the Minister of State believe can be done by the Department in addition to what the universities are doing?</p></speech>

Approximately two weeks ago, the Minister and I held a Zoom conference with the presidents and heads of all of the universities, institutes of technology and institutions funded through the HEA.  The main part of the discussion related to a request by us to the colleges, insofar as possible in light public health guidance, the public health advice available and the levels we are at in the living with Covid plan, to afford more on-campus time, particularly to first years, and even if this does not entail lectures or tutorials, to try to roster and schedule students on campus more to show them the facilities and make them aware of the depth of services and facilities available.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right in what he says about the vaccine.  We are all watching developments eagerly day in, day out.  It is giving us huge hope and optimism about a return to normality across so many levels including further and higher education.  I caution everybody on their optimism.  When the vaccine starts to roll out here, and the indication seems to be that it will be early in the new year, we will all have to avail of two doses two weeks apart.  We will be doing the equivalent of vaccinating the population twice, so it will be a big logistical operation.  I hope that with the collective minds, will and energy of everybody involved, it will help students to get back to normality and enjoy more student life than they have heretofore, particularly with regard to sport.</p></speech>

He, like me, represents a constituency in which there is a university and many third level students.  A point raised by the president of NUI Galway last week was that he had a concern about large lecture halls with more than 100 students.  I fully appreciate the risk associated with this and how we could not do it but there are feasible methods whereby we can break up classes into smaller groups.  Many classes, particularly those comprising postgraduate students, have smaller numbers.  The Department needs to ensure that the universities and third level institutions are kept on their toes.  We cannot have a situation in the new year whereby simply because a lecturer says he or she cannot do it or does not want to do it, that is accepted by the institution.  I thank the Minister of State for his comment.  I know he will keep working on this issue.</p></speech>

The Financial Services Union, FSU, is clear that banking is too important to be left to senior bankers.  It has proudly represented staff for over 100 years and it takes every possible opportunity to stand up for staff, customers, and communities.<br/><br/>I regret that Ulster Bank has declined the invitation to attend the meeting today but I am not surprised.  Information about this process is, as we have discovered, hard found.  Three months ago, media reports speculated that NatWest was undertaking a strategic review of Ulster Bank operations in the Republic of Ireland and that complete closure of its operation was on the agenda.  Throughout this process, the bank has refused to engage with us on what is actually going on.  It has been the media, through strong reporting, that has kept us, and the committee, informed about elements of the process.  So much remains uncertain, unclear and unexplained.  It would be one thing if the decision of NatWest only affected Ulster Bank and its employees but a decision to close a bank as important as Ulster Bank would have a devastating impact not only on the staff but on communities throughout Ireland and on the commercial life of those communities.  It would create enormous uncertainty, and has already done so, for customers of the bank and it raises the distinct possibility that the Ulster Bank loan book, or at least major portions of it, could end up in the hands of a vulture fund.<br/><br/>The decisions around this review are being taken now and so we need action now and that is why we are grateful to the committee for this opportunity to address it.  We have been talking to staff members about the impact of all this situation.  I will illustrate by example the feedback we have received.  The following staff member is not identified, but the words are well worth putting on the record of the committee today.  The employee stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Working on a cash desk in a branch during the recent media speculation has been extremely difficult.  Customers are asking daily when we are closing.  They are asking what will happen to their account, savings, and mortgage when the bank closes. <br /><br />I try to reassure them that it is purely speculation and that Ulster Bank and NatWest are committed to Ireland but honestly, customers are not buying it.  It is so hard to tell customers this when I feel like I am lying to them. <br /><br />Customers are telling us that there is no smoke without fire and the newspaper articles had to come from somewhere.  The longer the speculation and media articles continue, the more difficult it is to reassure customers. </blockquote> <p>Let us put ourselves in the shoes of this staff member.  This person has worked through the pandemic, keeping the bank and service going, has worked in the bank for years, has a real affinity for the bank and its customers and is rewarded by reading about the employee's own future in the media.  The employer will not even inform staff of the terms of reference for the review, its timetable or core elements of the review process.  This is completely indefensible.  While the individual is anonymised, members of this committee know such employees as they are representative of many people around our country.  They know their community, as members do, and they know, as members do, the impact all this could have.  These loyal, dedicated staff members deserve better from their employer and loyal Ulster Bank customers deserve better from their bank.  <br/><br/>Members will have read some commentary about Ulster Bank&rsquo;s financial performance.  Let us take a closer look at that.  Ulster Bank is the third biggest bank in this country.  It has 88 branches throughout the country.  It employs around 3,000 people in Ireland and has over one million customers.  In November 2016, Ulster Bank paid its parent company, NatWest, a dividend of &euro;1.5 billion.  In January 2018, that dividend was also &euro;1.5 billion and in December 2019, a dividend of &euro;0.5 billion was paid to NatWest.  Ulster Bank has paid a total to &euro;3.5 billion in dividends to its parent in the last three years.<br/><br/>NatWest also charges Ulster Bank for services provided by the parent company to the subsidiary.  These can include anything from payroll services to charging for a proportion of advertising and sponsorship that the parent company undertakes.  The committee may be interested to know that NatWest sponsorships the English and Welsh cricket teams.  As a result, Ulster Bank pays a proportion of this sponsorship.  Help for what matters, the bank might well say, but hardly evidence of a bank that is struggling.<br/><br/>In December 2019, Ulster Bank CEO, Jane Howard stated &quot;Our CET1 ratio will be 27% post payment of this dividend which leaves us in a strong capital position and well-placed to continue to support customers' ambitions through excellent products and service.&quot;  It seems clear that NatWest has decided to use Covid-19 as a cover to prioritise some other agenda over any long-term strategy.It has decided that staff, customers, and communities in the Republic of Ireland are of little significance.  To be blunt, it has manufactured a crisis using Covid-19 as cover.  We cannot sit back and allow this to happen on our watch.  It will be too late when the decision is made.  We need to act collectively in the national interest and protect customers, staff, and communities. <br/><br/>The Minister for Finance has a role to play.  He must contact his counterpart in the UK and express the Government's opposition to NatWest selling any part of the Ulster Bank loan book to a vulture fund.  We know the damage that a vulture fund can do.  There should be no place in Irish banking or society for vulture funds.  The Central Bank has a role too.  Currently, any bank can close a branch with two months' notice.  This does not serve customers or communities.  We need a new code of consumer protection that actually protects customers and consumers.  The last few months have seen all the main banks in Ireland announce reviews of their operations.  They all have something in common.  They are all looking to close branches and cut staffing levels.  Bankers are writing the future of banking in front of our eyes.  We know where that got us before.  We cannot allow this to happen again.<br/><br/>The FSU will shortly launch a discussion paper on the establishment of a national banking forum, one where we can all have an input into the future direction of banking in this country.  I hope members will help to lead that debate.  The timetable for this debate is short.  On Ulster Bank, we need members' continued leadership also.  We need political engagement to demonstrate the impact that this decision would have on our communities and staff.  We must all act now: for our communities, to protect jobs and vital commercial infrastructure, for the bank's customers, to protect them from vultures and who knows what; and finally, to ensure a competitive banking system in Ireland, for our citizens, our SMEs and for our economy.  If we do not act now, we face an effective duopoly in banking, with branches closed and jobs lost around the country, and with vulture funds holding the financial keys of family homes.  Without action now, that is the near future for all of us. </p></speech>

By way of information, at our meeting this morning we noted that Ulster Bank and the Central Bank refused an invitation to come before the committee, pointing to commercial sensitivities and so on.  I do not accept that, and neither did the committee.  We will write again to the Central Bank asking that it appear before the committee to hear directly from us our concerns in regard to this matter and to explore with it the general banking scene and what is happening.  Likewise, Ulster Bank refused to come before the committee.  We will write to it again too asking that it come before the committee to deal generally with the questions raised by the Financial Services Union.  It is unacceptable that the bank would not come before the committee.  It is also unacceptable, I think, to the customers and to the employees of the bank that the FSU would be treated in this fashion.  We have asked also that information that has passed between the committee and the bank and the Central Bank to date would be sent to the Minister for Finance.  The committee, following its hearing, may very well decide to insist that the Minister intervene or, perhaps, come in here to explain what the view of the Government is in regard to this matter.</p><p>I accept what Mr. O'Connell is saying.  It is entirely unacceptable and I am sure the committee will endeavour to support the FSU and do whatever we can for it. </p></speech>

I must declare that I am a member of the FSU, as I worked in banking in the years prior to joining it.  However, I had just joined when I got elected, which was a bit of a surprise at the time.  The vital role Ulster Bank has played in supporting local jobs is very clear.  It employs 3,000 people and that has a serious impact on the economy and on regional balance as well.  In 2019, Ulster Bank provided new lending of &euro;3.1 billion into the southern economy and had deposits of &euro;22 billion.  It is the third largest mortgage lender in the State and provides 20% of lending to our SMEs.  That shows how important an impact Ulster Bank has on the economy in the South.  We have all seen speculation rather than detail, as Mr. O'Connell outlined, and it has been recently reported that Goldman Sachs has been employed to undertake the strategic review.  Mr. O'Connell will be aware that Goldman Sachs has been involved in the Irish mortgage market in setting up vulture funds, which buy distressed debts from our retail banks and sell them without paying a cent in tax on their profits.  What contact have the FSU and Ulster Bank staff had from either Ulster Bank or NatWest regarding the terms of reference of this strategic review?</p></speech>

We have also corresponded with the chairman of the board on a number of occasions when trying to ascertain, very basically, what the terms of reference and the timeframes for the review are to give people some sort of indication as to what is planned.  In Ms Howard's case, we have had a number of very cordial meetings with her but elicited very little information, other than her confirming whatever the previous press leak was.  The first time we met her, she indicated that it was pure speculation and the subsequent time we met her she confirmed what had happened the first time.  We anticipate that at our next meeting she will confirm the Goldman Sachs story, which is the latest up-to-date story.  The information has always been behind the curve and we have gotten it on foot of media stories.  It is not credible that there are no terms of reference for the review and it is not credible that there is not a timeline for the review.  The NatWest parent company is beholden to the stock exchange and shareholders and to have an open-ended review on something of such primary importance is not a credible position as far as we are concerned.</p></speech>

It is deeply disappointing that Ulster Bank has failed to come before this committee, given the impact its withdrawal would have and the distress it would cause.  It is important that Mr. O'Connell relayed the real-life experience of what staff are going through and, as he said, it is not just one particular member of staff, but all staff.  It is hugely distressing for them.  On 19 October, my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, asked Ulster Bank to come before this committee.  The Minister for Finance has not met with NatWest or the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Doing so would be extremely important.  What is the FSU's view on what the Minister for Finance needs to do now to progress this matter as soon as possible?</p></speech>

Any entity operating within the State that is invited to an Oireachtas committee should attend.  I also welcome what he said about the Central Bank because of the seriousness of what we are dealing with, namely, the lives of 3,000 staff members and their families and more than 1 million customers.  We met the Minister for Finance yesterday and had a very productive discussion.  He shares all the concerns of colleagues here today.  We went through our point of view, as we are doing today, outlining the concerns and the urgency around this.  We seek that the Minister makes known to his counterpart in the UK an absolute opposition to any suggestion that vulture funds be involved in anything to do with the Ulster Bank situation.  Equally, he should make clear to NatWest that it needs to commit to the future of Ulster Bank, which has been in existence for 200 years.  It must commit to the future of Ulster Bank and engage on what is required to have a sustainable bank, which we believe it is, in the Republic of Ireland.</p></speech>

Reaching out to NatWest is also extremely important because 3,000 livelihoods, families and communities will be affected by this.  Mr. O'Connell outlined that very well in his opening statement.  It has also been reported that Cerberus, one of the most aggressive vulture funds in this State, is considering buying up Ulster Bank's entire &euro;20.5 billion loan book.  This is extremely worrying for customers because of the amount of pressure and anxiety that puts on them.  What impact would this have on Ulster Bank borrowers, its customers and mortgage holders?</p></speech>

For those people unfortunate enough to be in that category, they will be dealing with something with which everyone in these Houses is familiar, and how they operate in their dealings with customers.  The other entities would be moved to whoever purchases the performing loans from the vulture fund and, presumably if that was an existing entity in the State, it would deal with those customers but the staff would not survive that situation.  The staff would not transfer with the work.  That is the real concern of breaking it up when we believe there is no need to break it up.  It is a successful entity and well capable of standing on its own feet for another 200 years.</p></speech>

He received quite an interesting response from deputy governor, Ed Sibley.  In that letter, he said he could confirm that the Central Bank has &quot;regular and intensive engagement with Ulster Bank on a broad range of matters, including the NatWest Group Strategic Review, and is in contact with the NatWest Group and the UK regulatory authorities, as appropriate&quot;.  He also stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The Central Bank has regular and comprehensive supervisory engagement with the senior management of regulated firms on a wide range of topics including their business model, future strategy and the protection of consumers &hellip; The Irish retail banking system is concentrated by international standards, with five retail banks accounting for the majority &hellip; The exit of one entity from such a system, all other things equal, could contribute to upward pressure to lending interest rates and potentially lead to weaker credit availability. </blockquote> <p>What would the withdrawal of Ulster Bank mean for the banking sector and consumers?</p></speech>

We would also see the effects of a reduction in competition.  It is a pity the Central Bank did not take the opportunity to turn up to address the committee today and explain this.  Its core purposes are to protect consumers and to ensure a stable banking system.  I cannot understand why the Central Bank's officials would not come here today and demonstrate what they are doing to protect Irish consumers and thereby protect Irish jobs.  Protecting consumers is the Central Bank's core purpose.</p></speech>

I echo the Chairman's comments on Ulster Bank declining our invitation to be present here.  It speaks volumes about that bank's willingness to engage.  This seems to be confirmed by Mr. O'Connell's reports of how Ulster Bank has engaged with the Irish Financial Services Union in the process of cutting jobs and costs.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. O'Connell's comments on the future direction of banking in Ireland.  He noted that the Irish Financial Services Union will shortly publish a discussion paper on the establishment of a national banking forum.  That would be very welcome.  Does Mr. O'Connell have particular consumer protection powers in mind for the Central Bank?  I am particularly thinking of Ulster Bank, which accounts for one eighth of all mortgages and one fifth of all loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in this country.  If that loan book is sold to a vulture fund and Ulster Bank ends operations in this country, there will be a massive competition and consumer protection implications.  Does Mr. O'Connell have specific ideas about consumer protection powers the Central Bank should have?</p></speech>

The current consumer protection code has been in place since 2012.  It is still in draft form on the Central Bank's website.  It has not kept pace with modern banking, including the development of digitisation, apps and so on.  Any consumer protection code needs to be adapted to these areas.</p> <p>  I also refer to the importance of protecting what we have.  We have a branch network that has served communities in this country well.  Members will hear a lot of talk about reduced footfall.  We are in a pandemic.  We have advised people not to make unnecessary journeys.  A dip in footfall is not surprising.  However, a recent survey carried out by the banks themselves showed that the vast majority of people will return to branch banking after the pandemic, including greater numbers of young people.  There is a bright future for banking if people invest in it.</p> <p>  We argue that a consumer protection code should be driven by what consumers and customers want and what small businesses need, not what banks feel is to their advantage.  Customer service is being chipped away, whether the reduction takes the form of an ATM being removed or a reduction in the level at which a bank draft can be drawn.  Those things should be defended by the Central Bank to protect the core functions of branch banking.  This can be blended with a digital model that serves everybody.  People need and want branch banking.  If there was a cyber attack in the morning, people would be very glad to be able to access their funds through branch banking.  We should act before it is taken away, because it will never be replaced.  We need to have a proper debate about the level of banking we need and want in this country.  It cannot be simply left to the banks.</p></speech>

My next question was going to be about branch banking.  The example Mr. O'Connell has given eloquently sets out the stress felt by branch workers at the moment, especially Ulster Bank employees.  Mr. O'Connell has articulated a vision for the combination of branch banking with online digital banking.  Are there good international examples of banks that have got this right without needing to cut thousands of jobs?  This could involve internal redeployment or some other model of change.  We need to know what the good examples are.  Banking is being revolutionised in front of our eyes.</p></speech>

We are not Luddites or opposed to change.  We recognise the benefits of change.  We are concerned about how change comes about for us, for consumers and for staff.  Ireland is not at the level of digital maturity other countries have reached.  We are on that curve and we are developing.  However, the side effects of very advanced digitisation are being applied to us.  As such, branch services are being withdrawn.  Rural Ireland is a good example.  Those communities do not have the broadband coverage they would like but they are at risk of losing their branch networks.  The option of going digital is not really available.  We are not saying change cannot be allowed in banking.  However, we all need to get on that train together and get off at the right destination.  We do not want communities to have their services withdrawn and be told they have the option of going online when they really do not.  People cannot run their SMEs or businesses without that access.</p></speech>

Ulster Bank has more than 1 million customers and 3,000 employees.  It is very poor form not to come in to answer parliamentarians' questions.  What about the 1 million customers and the 3,000 workers?  They have questions they want answered.  Not only are their questions unanswered, the entity of which they are to be asked has not even shown up.  It is a disgrace.  I am not personally insulted but I think the customers and the workers have every right to feel that way.</p> <p>  This is a bank which has done very well from ordinary people in this country and the efforts of its workforce.  The figures Mr. O'Connell has given for dividends returned to NatWest from the Ulster Bank operation in the Republic are staggering.  Some &euro;1.5 billion was paid in dividends in 2016.  A further &euro;1.5 billion was paid in 2018 and &euro;500 million was paid in 2019.  Some &euro;3.5 billion has been sent to NatWest.  It has done very well from this country.  It is disgraceful that NatWest would even consider axing its operation, which consists of 88 branches, serves 1 million customers and employs 3,000 workers. </p> <p>  There is a powerful case for State intervention and for the nationalisation of Ulster Bank.  We have seen nationalisation of banks in the past, when ordinary people had to pay the price.</p><p>Why can we not nationalise a banking chain to defend the interests of ordinary people, that is, of 1 million customers, of 3,000 workers and of mortgage holders who must worry every day about the possibility that vulture funds will get their claws into their homes?  Under no circumstances should that be allowed to happen.  Were the Irish State to nationalise Ulster Bank here, it would be a sure and certain way to prevent those eventualities.  </p><p> We see a white-collar jobs massacre in banking and a massacre in retail and 2021 will see that threatened in other sectors.  I believe the time is coming when the trade union movement in this country, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, will have to initiate a serious discussion in its ranks about something such as a one-day national strike to defend jobs and workers' rights when jobs are threatened and to increase the pressure and mobilise support within society to put pressure on the Government for further, stronger, real action on these issues.</p><p> Mr. O'Connell's opening statement drew attention to the fact that a Central Bank policy is in place whereby a bank has to give two months' notice of a closure.  That is completely insufficient.  How would the FSU like that policy to change?  What is its view on state intervention along the lines of nationalisation to defend and protect jobs and services? </p></speech>

The future of the branch network has to be weighed up in the round, including the social impact of removing the branch and issues such as whether it is the last branch in town and so forth.  Different factors would then come in to play such as what options were being put to customers or whether they were in an area with broadband or a rural area with very limited opinions.  The first point of any proposal would be to assess the impact on the community of what was being proposed and then it would go from there.  If closure was an option, there would have to be a lead-in time to give communities to come up with alternatives.  Were it the last bank in town, that would require very serious consideration before such a closure was authorised.</p> <p>  We have submitted freedom of information requests to the Central Bank on branch closures and all the banks have closed branches.  It is astonishing and breathtaking to see that it is effectively a tick-box exercise in that the bank alerts the Central Bank of its intention to close a branch and the Central Bank notes this intention.  There does not appear to be further interaction on the withdrawal of services from communities.  We were very surprised.  We thought there would be a robust debate with the Central Bank before a service would be reduced or eliminated but that is not the case according to the evidence we have seen through freedom of information requests.</p></speech>

This is a very interesting piece of information that has been put before the committee.  I would like to tease out a little more information about what has been revealed by the freedom of information requests.</p> <p>  In the case of a town which has one bank - the only one for miles - and the bank's head office informs the Central Bank that the branch will close in two months, will that be the only correspondence?  Is the Central Bank's only engagement to note it?  I am interested to know precisely what is meant by a tick-box exercise.  Have there been examples in recent years in which the Central Bank has resisted a proposed branch closure or even has sharply questioned the decision?  </p></speech>

There a couple of things the committee needs to deal with.  I was unable to attend the earlier meeting as I had two meetings at the same time.  The non-attendance of representatives of the Ulster Bank and the Central Bank on foot of the committee's request is unacceptable.  Presumably it is based on its view that it is none of the committee's business and it will do whatever it is intent on doing regardless and will consult afterwards.  Unfortunately, the recent history of the banking system in this country would lead us to have serious questions about that kind of attitude.  Many times before the financial crash, the House raised questions about the direction in which the country, and particularly the banking system, was going.  We were reassured our fears were groundless, there was no need to worry, we were in safe hands and the banks knew what they were doing.  They did not, however, that is the bottom line on it, and it appears they still do not know what they are doing.  To treat Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, those elected by the people of this country to be their messengers, with an offhand attitude is absolutely unacceptable.  Legislation may have to be considered to deal with this because the move is of such magnitude and will have such an impact on the banking system, as well as businesses, domestic customers and mortgage holders.  Everyone in the country is affected by this kind of attitude, especially when it is a bank with a large portion of the market.  I know the Chairman has written to the bank again expressing dissatisfaction.  It says it does not want to discuss commercially sensitive issues.</p><p>We do not want it to discuss business sensitive issues.  We want to tell it what we think as the elected representatives of the public in this country, representing business, industry, agriculture and the banking system.  It is not just one sector.  It is everybody.  It behoves it to come before the committee at the earliest opportunity and give us an indication that it is listening to what we have to say.  I emphasise I do not want it to divulge any secrets but I want to know if its intention is to sink part of the banking system into oblivion and to do so at its leisure without reference to anybody.  That would not be acceptable, particularly in the aftermath of the banking issues we have come through in the past ten years.</p><p> The Governor of the Central Bank has a role and should be here in this context, as should a representative of Ulster Bank.  A representative of NatWest should also be here, particularly given that we are now talking about an entity that will be outside the European Union, and controlled from outside it, shortly.  It is totally unacceptable that people in that situation do not respond to what is a genuine call.  The Financial Regulator also has a role.  The regulatory system is affected by changes in the format of the banking system in the country and by changes in polices, including lending policies and staff relations policies, the latter being a simple aspect.</p><p> All members have spoken with the relevant Ministers since we spoke last.  The Minister for Finance is very concerned about what is happening.  He is monitoring it on a daily basis and continues to be ready to respond to whatever might happen when it might happen.  The most important aspect is that it cannot be allowed to become established in this kind of situation that the banking system, or the controllers of part of the banking system, have it within their gift to determine what they will do regardless of what anybody else, or the people of the country, think or how the people and their lives will be affected by it.</p></speech>

The Central Bank's arrogance towards this committee is disgraceful.  It has no sound or track record, as alluded to by Deputy Durkan.  It has anything but that.  During the last crisis, when all the money was pumped into most of the banks, Ulster Bank was with the Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, and stayed outside that particular scheme.  The total arrogance of the Central Bank beggars belief.  Ulster Bank appointed a new chief executive officer not that long ago and such a change brings reviews to explore where the business might be going or what might be best for it.  I was not that shocked when I saw what was going on at first but the longer it has been going on and the more I have seen from this committee, the more I am concerned.  If Ulster Bank had very little to hide and was being honest with us, it would come before us at this meeting and forum but, evidently, it is hiding something.  That is why it does not want to come before us to answer questions.  It is very evident it is hiding what its plans are.  I would have given it a fair kick of the ball but the way this has gone on, and the way it has avoided and eluded this committee, means there is no doubt it is in negotiations with somebody who is probably not going to be too palatable to the Irish people.  I would have serious concerns.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. O&rsquo;Connell or Mr. McDowell.  I would have strong concerns about AIB given there is considerable talk in the media about closures and staff losses.  AIB is one of the banks that received massive amounts of money to keep it afloat.  It nearly put our State to the edge at that stage in trying to keep our banks afloat.  If AIB, which has already had a massive cost-cutting programme, sees that we have come through the pandemic with many branches and sub-branches having closed, and with staff having been put working from home and on short-time working and all sorts of different mechanisms to cut costs, it might believe this has worked and could be a way for it to get a greater return for its investors and help its stock price.  I would be concerned about that.  AIB has a duty of care and a debt to pay to this country, and it cannot be steered alone by what its stock price is.  It owes more to this country than that.  I would have serious concerns about what it intends to do next.  Mr. O'Connell might shed light on that.  What has been the experience of his members?  What is he seeing on the ground?</p></speech>

It acted responsibly earlier in the pandemic.  It had plans to reduce the head count but it paused that.  It acted responsibly in pausing it and saying it would re-engage in that respect.  It has re-engaged and has indicated it will fully engage with us on our proposals.  It outlined its proposals in the public domain and indicated that the model it wishes to follow is to reach agreement with us.  Change is inevitable but, as I said at the start of my presentation, how change comes about is the key for staff and customers alike.  AIB indicated it will engage with us and we believe it will.  We also have an agenda of matters that are important to us.  For instance, the staff in AIB work the longest hours.  People want job security, certainty and a commitment around branch networks.  We tabled all these issues with AIB in the past few days and will engage with it.  It did not come to us with a baked cake and said this is what is happening.  It came to us and said what it wants to do on the basis that it believes it is the right thing for the bank.  It now wants to sit down, discuss and negotiate with us on it.  That is what we believe is the appropriate method of bringing about change in any sector but particularly in banking.</p> <p>  In terms of Ulster Bank, we are hoping that the Minister will meet NatWest, as he indicated to us, and out of that we hope it will provide clarity and we can return to where we were with Ulster Bank last July when we met it and it shared with us financial details around the bank and what it wanted to achieve.  That would not be without pain for some of our colleagues but we believed we could sit down and negotiate with it.  However, while we were doing that it was engaged in a review elsewhere that has obviously pulled a rug underneath those discussions.  We hope the Minister will meet NatWest, get us back on track and get us back to a position where we can sit down and discuss the future of Ulster Bank and what has to happen, just as we are doing with the other banks.  We hope we can come to a position that retains the bank but also brings about the kind of change with which we can all live.</p></speech>

As everyone has said, it is unacceptable that Ulster Bank has again declined to meet the committee today.</p><p>It is clear that many of these processes cut across the Central Bank's duties in the context of consumer protection and, as a result, it is extremely disappointing - and a real problem - that its representatives are not here to answer questions.</p><p>The importance of Ulster Bank's 3,000 staff and 1 million customers has been mentioned.  Reference was also made to its loan book, worth approximately &euro;20 billion, and the fact that 25% of SMEs here are involved with the bank.  This is clearly a matter of national interest.  As has been articulated, in terms of different banks and different ways of operating, the main banks have been accorded considerable political and policy engagement, be it in the context of slightly different measures for AIB and others.  We saw that even this summer when we passed yet another credit guarantee in terms of the State underwriting small loans for banks.  It is also apparent in our policies, which I personally do not support, on deferred assets and the fact that, effectively, many banks are not even paying taxation because of their previous losses.  The banks clearly believe that these issues are our business when it suits them.</p><p> I agree that it is not credible that this is an open-ended review.  I do not know of any consultancy agency, whether it is Goldman Sachs or whatever, which signs up to an open-ended general review.  There is a timeline.  There are terms of reference.  One of the key asks from the Minister and, I suggest, from this committee and other interested parties should be that there be some engagement and clarity regarding the timeline and the terms of reference.  I am not referring to commercially sensitive financial matters.  What is already in the public domain about the finances tells us that they are very healthy.  I understand that dividends of &euro;3.5 billion have been paid by Ulster Bank in recent years.  I note- Mr. O&rsquo;Connell might want to elaborate on it - the comment to the effect that, separate from the dividend, Ulster Bank pays for things like sponsorship of local teams in the UK.  There is a good deal of direct cash transfer between Ulster Bank and its parent company, NatWest, even aside from dividends.  It is important that the terms of reference address those issues of national duty of care and responsibility, workers' security, consumer protection and local impact.  We have seen, at least in the case of AIB, that it is giving us a sense that those are the issues it is examining and this is the way that it is examining them.  That then gives a basis for appropriate engagement.</p><p> I was very interested in Mr. O'Connell's comments on the importance of branch services, although it may be a slightly wider discussion.  While Covid-19 has moved people online in some cases, it has also been important, given the restrictions in terms of county boundaries and so forth, for people to have local branches for important banking provisions and actions.  That has been shown to be the case for many people in the Covid-19 crisis.</p><p> I concur with Mr. O&rsquo;Connell's assertion that digitisation is not simply a matter for the companies.  It is a matter for the customers also.  More than 50% of people in Ireland lack basic digital skills, according to EU sources.  The facts and figures are that Ireland is not at a point of digital literacy.</p><p> Those are important points but the key issue, and it was picked up by Deputy Barry, is the two months notice.  In terms of what it means, it clearly points to a flaw in the Central Bank&rsquo;s 2012 consumer protections.  Mr. O&rsquo;Connell might point out how that should be addressed and what he believes should replace that two months notice in terms of customers and consumer protection but also what it means for workers?  What would a two-month notification mean for workers and, to use the example of a temporary closure with one day's notice, the impact of that on financial services workers?  That is very important.</p><p> A huge number of homeowners have their mortgages with Ulster Bank and 25% of SMEs have their business with it.  Mr. O&rsquo;Connell mentioned performing loans.  We are having a separate but related debate here on the question of securitisation and the way non-performing loans are categorised.  What are Mr. O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s thoughts or concerns about the potential dangers in terms of securitisation if a large number of loans are being categorised as non-performing?  What would be the implications for people of the exit of Ulster Bank from the market here?</p><p> Mr. O&rsquo;Connell specifically mentioned the duopoly.  Again, this is not about one bank or the other, but what are the known risks in having such narrowed competition in terms of a duopoly?  What should we be looking for in terms of having a diverse or healthy financial eco-system?</p></speech>

We approach all the points she raised from the point of view of competition, consumers and colleagues.  In terms of any of the issues she highlighted, whether that is branch closures, non-performing loans or how to categorise the impact of these on people and so forth, they have to be approached from the point of view of the purpose of the regulator and what we are asking the regulator to do.  I do not believe we are being unreasonable in expecting that the approach to any of those issues would be that the consumer and jobs are protected.  That is not to say that things cannot change.  That is not our track record but if we have a situation where the regulator is asking for two months notice, the impact of that on the community will be felt for a long time.  For instance, a research paper which I can share with the committee shows that if a branch closes lending to the SME sector drops by 64%.  If that is the last branch in town, that figure is significantly higher for obvious reasons.  The impact we are talking about will be on real people.  These are people who rely on the manager in their local bank branch to support them in good times and in bad.  That is the impact that studies have shown in that regard.</p> <p>  In terms of the national broadband system, we are not quite there yet so many of the communities that are impacted by closures are communities that do not have the support of a good broadband network.  I was in north Mayo on holidays during the summer and I could hardly get a phone signal, let alone a broadband connection.  We are telling the communities that if they set up SMEs in these areas it will drive business and so forth but if there is not the infrastructure in those areas they do not have a hope to do that, and a banking infrastructure is a key part of any community.</p></speech>

In even identifying the loans that are likely to perform, especially after Covid-19, when many very healthy businesses will be in limbo, I would imagine that that the loss of that kind of local bank knowledge is a concern.  If we have a very blunt and rushed process, which seems to be coming down the line, that will have major implications in terms of identifying potential performing and non-performing loans and how they are treated.  Mr. O'Connell might comment on that.</p></speech>

If they are not there we are then into a situation where a decision is being taken remotely by somebody who does not understand the implications and that every couple of years this particular farmer or business has a downturn but that it is cyclical and will come back.  That is the type of knowledge that determines the categorisation of loans and so forth that it is important to retain.</p></speech>

I am aware the Minister will meet with NatWest and we have asked that a timeline and terms of reference would be requested but also the opportunity, and I felt it was important that Ulster Bank would be before the committee today, to have a debate before a decision is taken.  It is pointless having us there at the end stage and being told that that is the outcome, live with it or whatever.  People have to be listened to as part of debate.  The bank says that it consistently brings its values to act in the best interests of its customers, colleagues and stakeholders.</p><p>That is what the bank says it operates under.  That is not very visible to me or the Senator and her colleagues here today.  We are asking that it engage with us, stakeholders and the committee and give us the opportunity to debate these issues.  </p></speech>

We have seen considerable withdrawal of post office and bank services from towns and villages.  It is obviously driven by profitability.  They want to withdraw that shopfront service, which is very important to people, and go online.  Online is fine when it works well but when it does not work well, people need that customer interface, which is lacking in many situations.  We do not seem to have much control over that.  It is very much down to these entities to decide whether they will withdraw or withdraw completely.  We could not even get one such entity to attend here today.  In light of that and looking at the pattern of how things have been going, does Mr. O'Connell think there is any role for a community banking system in this country?  Could a community banking system offer that alternative that would offer people something different from that offered by established banking systems, which might make those established banking systems up their game a bit and say "there is some competition in the town"?  Mr. O'Connell spoke of that local branch knowledge that is out there.  I would like to hear his comments on community banking system like the Sparkasse model in Germany.  I know it was discussed in 2018.</p></speech>

It is so we can have a debate on what type of banking model we want.  Regulation and legislation should follow where the debate takes us.  If we went to any community and asked whether it wanted to lose a service, we know what the answer would be.  We need to have a mature and broader debate.  Digitisation is here.  Its impact is being felt.  How can we end up with the best of both worlds in terms of our banking system where we have all the upsides of digitisation but do not lose any of the good aspects of local branch banking that exist?  We are on that cusp.  We see where Ulster Bank is.  Other banks have made or have indicated decisions.  We think it is an opportune time to have an open debate with all the key stakeholders at the table to outline their vision of banking for the next ten years.  This would be a reasonable step.  Our big concern is that at the end of Covid, people ask what happened to our banking system, why it changed so rapidly and how we missed it.  There is a missed opportunity for Ulster Bank today but this committee and the Houses of the Oireachtas have an opportunity to endorse such a forum.  We spoke to the Minister about it yesterday in terms of outlining where we want banking to go in order that we do not end up being told that a service or a certain type of banking model is no longer available.  Who decided that?  We must have an input into this.</p></speech>

I met with Irish Rural Link a couple of months ago.  It has been pushing that idea for quite some time.  It is an idea we might include in that consideration of the entire banking system.  Do most banks in this country own their premises or are they mostly leased or rented?</p></speech>

Much of it is physically owned but the Deputy will have seen in the past few days how all of the banks are reducing their footprint, particularly in the capital with regard to head offices, because much of their workforce is working remotely and they are rationalising their footprint.  I think AIB envisaged going from eight to three offices with support staff over a number of years.  This is assisted by home working, in which many of our colleagues are engaged.  To their credit, it is not just the people who have worked in branch banking during Covid but people who have worked at their kitchen tables and in their bedrooms who have kept the banking system open.  This is why people in Ulster Bank, who have really been successful in supporting the bank, are as upset as they are to find themselves in the current situation.</p></speech>

I will reiterate what Mr. O'Connell said.  The three main banks are undertaking reviews across the country.  We know this is happening with Ulster Bank, AIB with its announcement during the week and Bank Ireland, which is undertaking a review in Northern Ireland.  KBC is closing hubs.  We have a consumer code of practice that is written by the Central Bank for the Central Bank to implement.  Banks are now writing the future of banking in front of our eyes, which is why we are making a strong case for a debate on the future of banking in this country as soon as possible and why we met the Minister yesterday regarding the establishment of a banking forum.  We would really appreciate it if this committee took a leading role in that because this is where legislation is passed.  We will shortly publish a discussion paper that we will forward to every member of this committee.  We really look forward to the committee's input.  As my colleague said, what we do not want to happen is for us to look around for our local branch once we have exited the pandemic and find it is nowhere to be seen and that we have moved online across the country without anyone taking any notice of it.  The National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, produced a report that said that up to 18% of people did not have sufficient literacy levels to access online banking so we are leaving a lot of people behind at present through the closure of branches and so on.  A real discussion is needed.  We will publish a report very shortly and will forward it to members of the committee.  We would really appreciate it if the committee could have a discussion on the future of banking as soon as possible.</p></speech>

What was very interesting and stark was the fact that if a branch closes, lending to the SME sector falls by 64%.  This will obviously affect rural, more isolated and smaller places.  I represent Galway West, which houses the likes of Connemara.  I can see the impact this would have on the likes of Clifden.  If Ulster Bank does withdraw from the market, has the FSU worked through a scenario regarding what could happen to branches and the loan book?  What remedies would it suggest?  Obviously, the SMEs are hugely reliant on it.</p></speech>

It outlined to us in July in quite an amount of detail what it would take back to reset the bank and deal with the challenges it said it was facing.  We got to the exploratory stage of that discussion when the rug was pulled so for us, it is really about resetting the clock and Ulster Bank coming back to the table, acting responsibly, committing to the Irish market of which it has been a part for 200 years and engaging again with us.  As I said, we have a good track record.  We fight our own corner and make no apologies for that but we have a good track record of working out change.  We believe the bank has a future - a bright future - if it engages with us like that.</p></speech>

The key thing here is responsibility.  The bank has a responsibility to the 3,000 people who work for it.  It has a responsibility based on the fact that it has been around for 200 years.  It is outrageous that it has refused to come before us time and again despite numerous requests.</p><p>It is good that the message coming out of this committee meeting loud and clear is that Ulster Bank has a responsibility to those people and it must come and speak to us.</p></speech>

I chaired the committee for the entirety of the previous D&aacute;il.  We discussed vulture funds and their activities throughout the country at length.  We discussed community banking and the issues around the pillar banks and other banks, issued some final reports and had the report on vulture funds debated in the House.</p> <p>  When I look back, I find nothing much has changed.  In fact, the situation has got worse.  If we leave here without doing something definitive, it will show that we are just a talking shop that does not take real action.  It is time for the Government to acknowledge that we had two specialists before us who told us the banking inquiry was a whitewash and waste of time, a point of view to which I subscribe.  Mr. Jonathan Sugarman came before the committee and opened our eyes about a whistleblower in the banks.  That issue is still unresolved.  The Central Bank is making a choice to turn its back on his actions.  </p> <p>  Since then, vulture funds have run roughshod over the country.  They have stolen from the people we are here to represent and the people have had little or no representation in the courts because they are almost as bad as the vulture funds when it comes down it.  We have no real understanding of where banking is going.  A political intervention is required.</p> <p>  The forum is a medium to long-term proposition politically.  We need action.  Writing to Ulster Bank after the witnesses' contribution today is one action the committee can take.  We can write to the Central Bank and NatWest, regardless of what the Minister is doing.  We should express not just our deep concern but also our anger about the fact that they have not come before us and insist that they do so.  Whether they sit and listen to what we have to say or are willing to contribute is entirely up to them.  They should be invited in the strongest possible terms.  Likewise, the Minister for Finance should be informed of our actions and what we are doing.</p> <p>  There is a mechanism for debate in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  If the committee is of a mind to draw up a short report to bring to the D&aacute;il Chamber for debate on this issue, perhaps that is something we should consider.  Members can take from what was said here, take it to the floor of the D&aacute;il and publicly challenge the banks, the Minister and the Government to respond to what I believe is a crisis in banking.  There is no doubt but that there is a crisis in banking.  This involves 1,500 jobs in AIB, the possibility of further actions in Bank of Ireland-----</p></speech>

That is before we include the workers, customers and all of the rest.</p> <p>  Quite frankly, I saw enough of the banks for five years to understand that one simply does not believe them.  Whatever they might say in regard to re-engaging, all it is is soft talk.  We have to be very strong politically and demand some action on this; otherwise we are not serving the purpose for which we are here.  I have seen enough social devastation wreaked upon the people of this country by vulture funds to want the Government to intervene and ensure there is no place for them. </p> <p>  To think that there is the possibility that they will be reintroduced, through the reformation or whatever it might be of Ulster Bank, is something that I could not bear.  I ask the clerk to carry out all of the actions we set out, consider the possibility of drawing up a report and engaging with the D&aacute;il and brief the Minister on exactly how we feel about this.</p></speech>

I know the time for that is short, but it could be helpful.</p> <p>  I refer to the reluctance of the Central Bank or any banking entity to come before the committee to hear what it has to say.  In the not-too-distant past, there was a period during which one could only describe what went on as reckless trading.  That is a serious offence in the financial services area.  Raiders came into Ireland from outside of the country and proceeded to undermine the Irish banking system through the medium of alleged competition.  That created a vacuum in the banking system that was not filled by anybody.  It created huge inflationary problems.  They then generally walked away and escaped from the country.  That happened in financial services, banking and insurance.  There is no reason in the wide earthly world why we should have to tolerate that.</p></speech>

Senator Emer Currie will be late as she has a Commencement matter in the Seanad.</p> <p>  I request members to sit only in the permitted seats and in front of the available microphones to ensure that they are heard.  This is important as not doing so causes serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  I remind them to please maintain social distancing at all time during and following the meeting.  Members are requested to use the wipes and hand sanitizers provided to clean seats and desks to supplement regular sanitation in the breaks between meetings.  Members are requested to turn off their mobile phones completely or switch them to flight mode.</p> <p>  As this time slot is limited to an hour and a half, I will call each group for a maximum of eight minutes.  Is the rota for questioning agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee I particularly welcome Professor John FitzGerald, adjunct professor at the department of economics, UCD, and Professor Edgar Morgenroth, professor of economics, DCU business school.  I thank them for attending in the short notice we had to give for this meeting.  We look forward to their address and the subsequent questioning.</p> <p>  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person's or entity's good name.  I invite Professor FitzGerald to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

We thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  We are not taking a position on the desirability or feasibility of a united Ireland.  What we are doing is summarising some of the key points from research published in three papers in academic journals that we have already sent to the members.</p> <p>  On the results of the research, the productivity of the Northern Ireland economy is the lowest in these islands, and as a result of this low productivity, Northern Ireland needs a substantial subvention from outside to maintain its current standard of living.  There are a number of factors underlying the low level of productivity, including the low educational attainment of the population, which is the lowest of any UK region or Ireland, the failure to invest in adequate productive infrastructure, and, of course, the legacy effect of the Troubles.</p> <p>  There are two factors behind the low educational attainment.  The educational system has always selected the pupils into different schools at a young age based on academic achievement.</p><p>This severely disadvantages pupils from a disadvantaged background, but is a key factor in Northern Ireland having the highest proportion of early school leavers on these islands. <br/><br/>A high proportion of students in Northern Ireland who graduate from university emigrate and never return, which contributes to the very low share of the population with third level qualifications.  As we have discovered in the past in Ireland, addressing such a deficit in educational attainment, if tackled urgently, takes more than a generation.  Thus, even if urgent action is taken to address the causes of the low human capital in Northern Ireland, the problem of low productivity will remain acute for at least the next 25 years.  We began on this journey very intensively in the 1980s and the process matured around 2000. <br/><br/>As a result of its low productivity, Northern Ireland is dependent on a transfer from London of around 20% of GDP to maintain its standard of living.  Northern Ireland is treated quite generously within the UK context so the public expenditure per head is 120% of the UK average, whereas the figure for the north-east of England, the next poorest region, is 106%.<br/><br/>Northern Ireland is at risk from rising English nationalism.  Brexit and the possible fracturing of the UK could see a redirection of resources to poorer British regions, which would be a major concern.<br/><br/>A note we have supplied updates our previous estimates of a subvention to Northern Ireland from the UK central government and estimates what subvention would be needed in the context of a united Ireland to maintain Northern Ireland's current level of services.  If this transfer had to come from central government in Dublin, it would be a very substantial long-term burden on the standard of living of those in Ireland.<br/><br/>This is a very partial examination of the economics of a united Ireland focusing purely on direct fiscal issues, assuming the underlying systems are unchanged.  A full analysis would need to specify to what extent social welfare rates might be harmonised and how health and social housing would be delivered.  A wider consideration would, <i>inter alia</i>, examine the impact on Northern Ireland of losing access to the British market and gaining improved access to the Irish and EU markets.  It would also examine the impact on Ireland of shouldering the considerable burden of the ongoing transfer needed to maintain living standards in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if Northern Ireland effectively addresses its productivity gap, it would provide for a much more secure future within the UK, if that is what the population desires, and greatly reduce the economic cost of a united Ireland, if that was the long-term option chosen.  Thus, addressing the root causes of Northern Ireland's economic problems would benefit the population of Northern Ireland, whatever their particular preferences, and would also have long-term benefits for everyone on this island through increased trade.</p></speech>

I sincerely thank the witnesses for their valuable contributions to the all-Ireland economic discussion that must form the essential part of reshaping our island.  The papers they have written facilitate and inform a discussion that is currently being held in households and businesses throughout the country and beyond.  I propose that all of the people who have taken time to do some analysis and to write papers on this, whether national or international, be invited to appear before the committee.  We are doing a service to people today who have genuine questions around what an all-island economy would look like.</p> <p>  Obviously, Brexit and Covid have changed the economic landscape of the islands we are talking about.  Among the largest untapped avenues for growth potential in the Irish economy are the green economy and the opportunity cost of partition, in terms of the significant potential of the green economy and the transition to a zero carbon economy.</p> <p>  I want to focus on the subvention and acknowledge that a deficit requiring subvention exists.  We need to put that on the table.  However, the &euro;10 billion headline figure, or the &euro;13 billion figure I heard mentioned by, I understand, Mr. Ian Paisley Jr. a couple of weeks ago, need further analysis.  My first question for Professor Fitzgerald concerns the revenue raised in the North.  Would he agree that it is &euro;18.5 billion?  I will ask a number of short questions, if that is okay.</p></speech>

The figure for 2018 is &euro;18.5 billion, including corporation tax receipts.  The true revenue from corporation tax receipts should be somewhat higher.</p></speech>

For the purposes of this meeting, the total managed expenditure is &euro;27.88 billion.  That is the sum total of the services with the accounting adjustments.  When that is subtracted from the revenue raised in the North which is, as we agreed, &euro;18.5 billion, a subvention figure of between &euro;9 billion and &euro;10 billion is often bandied about.  Analysis of the total expenditure on services in terms of the identifiable spending, that is, spending that takes place in the North, and the non-identifiable spending, that is, British priorities is needed.</p> <p>  Unidentifiable spending includes things like the British military which, as we know, is one of the most expensive in the world.  That share is &euro;1.12 billion.  Some &euro;1.6 billion is paid down on British debt.  The pension situation, which is often left out, comprises &euro;3.5 billion.  We know that pensions and pension rights are not subject to one's citizenship but, rather, the amount of national contributions made.  That was established in the discussion around the Scottish referendum on unity, during which Mr. Steve Webb said that the cumulative rights would rest with the person.  In the case of Irish unity, the payments that would need to be made on pensions would be made from the British Exchequer.  Is that correct?  I ask Professor FitzGerald to speak to the non-identifiable spending. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.437" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2020120800002#B01200"><p>I gave the committee a paper yesterday in which I updated the figures in detail.  On non-identifiable spending, &euro;2.4 billion is depreciation but it is also included under revenue.  That can be written off as irrelevant.  The rest of the non-identifiable expenditure is what we are examining.</p> <p>  The contribution to defence is about &euro;1.1 billion.  The contribution to defence of a united Ireland would be about &euro;200 million, a substantially lower figure.  The contribution to the EU budget in 2018 was &euro;217 million.  That figure would be significantly higher, at &euro;470 million, in a united Ireland.  The figure I have for pensions is somewhat lower.</p><p>I have a figure which is probably closer to the &euro;2.4 billion than &euro;3.4 billion.  The Deputy can probably clarify that with the relevant Minister in the North.  Leaving that aside, it could well be that in the negotiations for a united Ireland the UK would accept continuing liability for the &euro;2.5 billion or &euro;3.5 billion in pensions.  However, using the experience of the deal done in 1921 when Ireland left or the deal which was to have been done if Scotland left in 2014, in the Scottish case, they would have had to pay the continuing debt interest but offset against that would be the pensions.  The Deputy could count one or other of those but not both as being something that would not be payable in a united Ireland.  Assuming that the UK would continue to pay the pensions, I have provided the committee with different estimates of what the contribution would be in the event of a united Ireland.  The base case would be &euro;8.2 billion.  If the pensions are excluded, it would be approximately &euro;6 billion.  If social welfare payments and pay rates in the public sector were to be rerated to match those the Republic, the budgetary contribution would rise to &euro;11.5 billion in a united Ireland.</p></speech>

Putting aside whether one believes in a united Ireland, unless one can get educational attainment and productivity levels up in Northern Ireland, people will never achieve their highest potential.  The key question is how to do that if the choice between grammar school and other schools is divisive in that children coming from disadvantaged communities will attain less.  Should that not be at the heart of the effort?  If we can encourage, support and concentrate on that, North and South and in the UK, under the best possible acceptable regime and putting aside the party politics, and invest in the young people to allow all of them reach their greatest status in life, is that not what we have to do?</p> <p>  In that context, if it is a fair question, and I do not want to be long-winded, in the South, until the mid-1960s, effectively only two people in any county could go into third level education because the only grants available were given to those who were the highest achievers in a particular county council area.  If one got four honours in the leaving certificate, one got into college.  The grant system transformed educational attainment and access to third level.  What is needed in the North to kick-start that process and accelerate equality and access and the capacity of young people to achieve their best possible potential?</p></speech>

Knox.  He would be the highest ranked in the past decade in terms of academic rankings.  His work has guided us in our work.  Grammar schools are very successful.  The bulk of the children who attend such schools go on to university, albeit many of them in Great Britain, but the problem is that the children who are selected into the secondary schools have very poor prospects, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Vani Borooah's research in that regard is very convincing.  There has been much debate on integrating Catholic and Protestant schools but he argues strongly that until we have a system where children from disadvantaged Protestant or Catholic backgrounds have equal access to education, we will have this continuing major problem of early school leavers in Northern Ireland.  It is striking that Northern Ireland stands out in that regard against any other British region.  We can forget London because of the immigration.  The other very good British region is Scotland, which has the lowest proportion of early school leavers and the highest proportion of graduates after London.  It is about looking at models elsewhere to improve the educational system.  The eleven-plus was got rid of but the problem was that there was no follow through on that so there is still selection into schools and that determines the outcome for children.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.445" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2020120800002#C00800"><p>No.  A huge amount of research has been done which has influenced the development of education in Ireland, going back to Damian Hannan and Emer Smyth in the early 1980s, who showed that selection within schools into classes - streaming in schools - is bad for the bottom half of the distribution and makes little or no difference to the top half.  We have moved to gradually reduce streaming within schools but we are fortunate that, by accident, we did not end up with the English model of secondary, modern and grammar schools.  We have integrated schools so if one lives in Bandon or wherever, one goes to the local school.  Children are not streamed.  It is the streaming of children which is the problem.  That is not necessarily a reflection on second level schools.  Vani Borooah has analysed this and estimates a Catholic ethos advantage in secondary schools in Northern Ireland of approximately ten percentage points.  It is significant but that may not be due to the schools; it may be due to parental expectations.  He has not done the research, and we certainly have not done the research, on this but there is a big problem in Northern Ireland which we have managed to address in the Republic.  Twenty years ago we had 20% of early school leavers.  The major success during the years of the financial crisis was a major improvement in educational participation.  Education was protected and we went from a figure of 15% to 5% in respect of early school leavers, while everything else was in crisis.  How that is dealt with is an issue for politicians in Northern Ireland.  It is not for somebody from the Republic to come up with the answer but the research done by Vani Borooah shows that there is a major problem in that regard.</p></speech>

Would he define that?</p></speech>

Once we have people who leave school early, their labour market outcomes are particularly bad.  Often, they do not ever work.  That is a matter I studied in the Republic of Ireland about 20 years ago and it was quite stark.  It is a very big issue.<br/><br/>The other issue we point to in the paper is the outmigration of highly skilled people with university degrees.  The Northern Ireland economy is leaking those individuals.<br/><br/>In terms of productive investment, there was a time when the infrastructure in Northern Ireland was considerably better than that of the Republic but that is a time in history now.  Investment in Northern Ireland in general has been very low.  That is another aspect one would need to account for if one looked at the Northern economy and in terms of trying to push this forward.  Human capital in education is the most important investment we can make.  The second most important would be various kinds of infrastructure.  We would need to increase that level of investment and that, <i>de facto</i>, would mean that subvention would have to increase to address the shortfall.  That goes into various types of infrastructure such as roads.  There are some major issues in Northern Ireland.</p><p>For example, if one tries to get from the second largest city to the largest, the infrastructure is not very good, and one could point to lots of other examples.  Making up that shortfall will take a long time and a lot of money.</p></speech>

Is it not the case that the road infrastructure is particularly poor in respect of the links between the Belfast to Dublin corridor and Derry and Tyrone?  Is he, therefore, saying that significant further investment in that infrastructure will be hugely important to those regions?</p></speech>

I am a great believer in progression in education and I have seen the value of it, whether through reducing the number of early school leavers through youth reach, and also through our colleges of further education.  I have seen many young people, from families with no big attachment or emphasis within the household on education, go on to further education, third level education, and subsequently graduate, and complete masters degrees.  I have seen these people make a very valuable contribution to society and to their local economy.</p> <p>  To my knowledge, the further education sector was developed in Northern Ireland before it was developed in the Republic.  As a Deputy representing Cavan-Monaghan, over the years I have had some engagement with the colleges of further education in Enniskillen and Omagh, particularly when Mr. McAleer was principal of those colleges.  Does Professor Morgenroth see the need for a greater emphasis on trying to ensure that young people remain in education beyond second level, perhaps through colleges of further education, and then go on to third level education?</p> <p>  With regard to the productive economy, Brexit is very much in the news.  I listened Professor Morgenroth two years ago, when he outlined the adverse regional effects that would arise from Brexit.  The cental Border area, both North and South, which is the least developed area both in Northern Ireland and in our State, would be most impacted by Brexit because of our dependence on the agri-food industry, construction products and the engineering sector.  Will Brexit add immeasurably to the difficulties that we have in an economy that is not well developed enough, or that faces its own particular challenges? </p></speech>

On the southern side of the Border, Cavan-Monaghan is particularly vulnerable to a no-trade-deal Brexit.  In fact, I have just redone the analysis and have reconfirmed it using the UK tariff schedule.  Likewise, north of the Border, the weaker regions would be most susceptible, and that is something that researchers throughout the UK have found.  The least developed regions would experience the worst effects from Brexit in a no trade deal situation.  It would compound the already poor industrial structure and the performance of the economy in those areas.  In that sense, this could be tackled through a focus on education, training, skills, infrastructure to a lesser extent, and also a shift in some sectors, because ultimately the Brexit effect will be a sectoral effect.  The agri-food sector in particular would be the hardest hit if no trade deal were done, and presumably we will find out if that is going to be the case this week.  If there were to be no-deal, a shift away from those sectors would be something that could be done to lessen the blow, and that is not easily done without a skilled workforce.</p></speech>

However, there is something that strikes me about the language used that is really important.  The Good Friday Agreement was brought about through dialogue and cross-party agreement.  In light of that fact, authors of reports like this - and I do not wish to sound like a dictator - should be careful in their use of language.  Given that we do not have an agreement on a shared future or a united Ireland, the other element of society in Northern Ireland will take offence at the talk of a united Ireland.  I, as much as anyone in this room, would love to see it happen, but we should change our language until we get that shared consensus.  We should be talking about a shared consensus, shared future and a shared Island.  All the other things can be agreed around it.  In the meantime, we need to be careful, because there are many doors which have yet to be opened, before we get to where we would like to.  Language is, therefore, really important and this should be recognised.  There are many elements in the report that are very useful and will be so in future.  Professor Morgenroth referred to the most important infrastructure, and I am glad he mentioned the Derry-Belfast element but the entire north-west, and not just the part within Northern Ireland, has been very badly affected by a lack of infrastructure over the years.  Derry, Strabane, Tryrone and Donegal are now recognised as being part a north-west city region, and it is really great to achieve that, but the link to Dublin is as important as the link to Belfast.  One is as important as the other, and both are needed, because they are essential infrastructure.  This includes the road that is being planned from Derry to Dublin and the road being built from Derry to Belfast, but equally, it includes the rail infrastructure, and the upgrading to speed rail on the line from Derry to Belfast, and from Belfast to Dublin.</p> <p>  As part of his research, has Professor Morgenroth looked into social welfare attainment in Northern Ireland?  People in Northern Ireland hold dear the access they have to free heatlhcare, but, on the other hand, they do not have access to the same welfare payments as we do in the South.  Many people feel that the South would not be able to cater for the needs of those in the North in the longer term.  Has the Professor done any research on that issue, and what is his opinion on the matter?  </p> <p>  Overall, I welcome the report and any further similar reports.  I agree with the Chairman that the more voices we have around us, and the more discussion we have, the better.  </p></speech>

I am not an expert on health or on the social welfare system.  However, I did calculate the recalibration of social welfare benefits, which are not very generous in the UK, to the more generous system in the Republic.  In the note that I sent yesterday, I estimated how much that might cost, but it was a crude estimate, so I would advise the committee to get experts in that area to look at the issue.</p></speech>

There are two issues I wish to ask them about.  They referred to Northern Ireland's heavy reliance on UK subventions.  Do they have any thoughts, as we try to manage convergence, on the process of ideally synchronising economies, North and South?</p><p>What sort of further devolution of fiscal powers should Northern Ireland consider trying to get and make best use of?  Do the witnesses have any thoughts on the loss of Structural Funds?  It is still a little up in the air in terms of the shared prosperity fund that is proposed to replace Structural Funds.  Have the witnesses any thoughts on the loss of the previous funding stream in terms of infrastructure?  </p><p> I was struck by how highly the witnesses rank the challenges.  I agree about the inadequacies in Northern Ireland's education system.  I was struck by how firmly they linked academic selection and streaming to those economic challenges.  There is probably no such thing as a quick fix but do the witnesses agree with the kind of proposals in New Decade, New Approach for a Bengoa review of education?  Is there anything specific the witnesses would point to in respect of that?  </p></speech>

Education is a matter for Northern Ireland to work out.  When I have presented the results in the North, there has been huge resistance because generally the people to whom I speak are parents who have children in grammar schools and they say the grammar schools are great.  They are right; they are great.  The one area where there is a possible win - a quick win - in education in Northern Ireland is the fact that there are a huge number of graduates of working age born in Northern Ireland in Great Britain.  If one could attract back a substantial portion of them, that would transform the economy.  Another paper published for the Department for the Economy by Iulia Siedschlag and colleagues in the ESRI looking at foreign direct investment across the EU with a particular focus on Northern Ireland shows that third-level education graduates are key.  How does one attract them back?  I am old enough to have been around in the 1970s and 1980s.  We would have been very pessimistic in the 1980s.  Irish people were emigrating and saying that they would never come back.  They turned out to be homing pigeons and came back.  Research done by Alan Barrett of the ESRI and others shows that they are 10% more productive having learned how to do things differently abroad.  If Northern Ireland got a lot of graduates back from Great Britain, they could change the culture and economy.  That is what happened with the Republic of Ireland.  We have not paid enough attention to the fact that people coming to Ireland with experience from outside - generally Irish people - have transformed this economy and society.  That is a potential quick win for Northern Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.458" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Edgar Morgenroth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2020120800002#E00300"><p>I have also written about this.  I call it "brain gain" rather than a brain drain, which is what we normally have.  Obviously, the loss of the Structural Funds is a big issue.  We will have to wait and see how big that will be.  One thing that is always good is if one is able to get money from external sources that one does not have to raise locally.  That gives an opportunity to fund things that one would not otherwise be able to afford.  When that is gone, one is going to have to think about how to prioritise the limited resources that are there.  I spent a year at the Strategic Investment Board in Belfast looking at the Irish Society for New Economists, ISNE, 3, where we were expecting big cuts in capital expenditure.  The more limited one's resources are, the tougher the choices one is going to end up having to make.  Loss of Structural Funds is a really significant issue.</p> <p>  In terms of convergence, this is one of those very interesting things and is the reason we raised the issue of East Germany.  East Germany is a very interesting case in that it has managed to converge slowly and steadily, not like a rocket.  It will take at least another 20 years to properly converge.  It is a long-term issue even for things that one might think would integrate very quickly such as trade.  Trade within Germany has still not properly converged and it is expected to take another 25 years so one is looking essentially at a 50-year project to properly integrate east and west Germany.  Obviously, it is a different situation with different starting positions and so on but it just shows that this is not something that happens overnight.  In terms of the resources required, so far, German reunification has cost trillions of euro - somewhere between &euro;1 trillion and &euro;3 trillion.  It is hard to put an exact finger on it.  It has also come with very significant disruption.  East Germany now has 12% less population than it had in 1989.  There has been very significant outward migration because it did what we call a sharp shock policy, which did kickstart that convergence process but was very painful.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.459" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Farry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2020120800002#E00400"><p>I thank our guests.  I will make a few observations and invite the witnesses to respond to them.  It was interesting to hear the comments about there being some parallel with Germany.  Obviously, the island of Ireland has seen major economic change over the century where historically Northern Ireland or what was previously the north of the island was the economic and industrial powerhouse; it has gone through very significant industrial decline alongside many other economies.  To what extent has Northern Ireland perhaps not had the same opportunity to transform in the way some of the other modern economies in Europe have due to the legacy of violence and division?  To what extent has this been a drain on our situation?</p> <p>  Another aspect that might be worth commenting on is the different approach to inward investment in the two parts of the island.  In a very crude sense, it could be differentiated in the sense that the south of the island benefits from what one would call the attraction of profit centres due to the lower level of corporation tax.  That tends to bring in the more productive economic activities whereas due to the more limited fiscal levers, Northern Ireland is more dependent on bringing in what are effectively cost centres.  The model in Northern Ireland is based upon providing skilled labour at a low cost and a more competitive rate than would be the situation in other places.  It is a combination of quality and comparatively lower costs than one would find in places like the US.  </p> <p>  Regarding some of the other structural aspects of the Northern Ireland economy in addition to the points around division in terms of education and the lack of higher education graduates, difficulties also lie in terms of lower levels of exports and a much higher level of economic inactivity.  Between that and unemployment, we have a relatively low percentage of labour force participation.  The real pressure point in terms of skills is not necessarily at the graduate level but just below graduate level in terms of levels four and five involving the higher-level technical skills.  We have a good further education offering but that is where the real pressure lies in terms of investment in skills.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.460" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2020120800002#E00500"><p>When I looked at the history, I was amazed that Northern Ireland had an awful 1920s and 1930s and that the Republic of Ireland grew faster than the North during that period.  It was the Second World War that transformed the Northern economy.  Regarding where Northern Ireland really missed out, it was doing reasonably well in the 1960s and then along came the Troubles and EU membership.  The Republic of Ireland embraced EU membership.  The adjustment was difficult but it built an economy round that where Northern Ireland missed out on 20 years.  It is very difficult to replace those 20 years.</p> <p>  On inward investment, corporation tax was important in terms of growth up to 2000.</p><p>However, since then, it is education that counts.  If the corporation tax rate disappeared, we would lose much tax revenue but we would lose very few jobs.  George Quigley, whom I really respected and who was the Northern Ireland equivalent of  T.K. Whitaker, was very much of the view that corporation tax was the answer for Northern Ireland.  It might have been an answer 30 years ago but it is not today.  Today, it is education.  A paper for the Department for the Economy by Iulia Siedschlag on how one will not get valuable foreign direct investment unless one has the third level graduates is important.  </p><p> Finally, on labour force participation, that is also related to education.  Research I have done on the Republic shows that one third of the Celtic tiger was generated by women.  Women, on average, were better educated than men traditionally in Ireland.  My wife says they were clever.  They were better educated but they were not in the labour force.  Suddenly the economy woke up and said we need them.  One third of the Celtic tiger resulted from women participating in the labour force who had good skills and good education and were not being exploited.  Perhaps that is an issue for Northern Ireland, though I am not sure.</p></speech>

We found that education, having a highly skilled workforce, was ten times more important that the most important infrastructure one could invest in, which is broadband.  Even broadband was three or four times more important than roads.  There is a hierarchy and at the top of that is human capital.  One cannot make a mistake by investing in people.  That seems to be a no regrets policy, nothing to do with a united Ireland or otherwise.  That is something that will be good for Northern Ireland regardless.</p></speech>

I thank Professors FitzGerald and Morgenroth.  Like everybody else, I echo my thanks to them for attending and adding to this debate.It shows that what we need is informed debate.  We have said for a long time that informed debate is an essential component of planning.  People need to be very clear what it is they are discussing when they talk about the constitutional future and economics goes to the heart of that.<br/><br/>I have two observations to make with brief questions and I will not take up too much time.  The first deals with the focus on the North as the region.  Research conducted by NERI on the productivity of Ireland&rsquo;s various regions shows that all regions are behind the EU average by their measure of productivity with the notable exceptions of Dublin, greater Cork and Belfast.  A peer review paper by Seamus McGuinness and Adele Bergin of the ESRI, which was referenced earlier and which I believe is from last year, found that the growth rate in GDP <i>per capita</i>in the North, and its relative ranking over the period from the beginning of the century up to 2014, is very close to that observed in the Border, midlands and western region in the southern jurisdiction.  In that area, is it not, therefore, fair to conclude that this overall context is fundamental to any discussion such as this?  <br/><br/>The second observation I wish to make is that in the witnesses' papers they examine the fiscal impact of Irish reunification and present three possible scenarios: one, the North instantly loses subvention from Britain and it essentially self-funds; two, the Irish Government instantly assumes the fiscal deficit of the North; and, three, a gradual transfer.  I do not couch this in any critical terms but I note only one paragraph is afforded to the third scenario of a gradual transfer.  Would it not be more realistic to say that the third scenario was the most likely and, therefore, possibly the one most deserving of a detailed analysis and discussion?  That is something I also noted in the McGuinness and Bergin paper.  I thank the witnesses once again for their attendance today.</p></speech>

The gradual scenario is probably the more realistic.  I would have concerns in dealing with the UK Government in that it might sign up to something but would they deliver on it afterwards?  I may be too guided by the current circumstances.  The point about the BMW region is an interesting one, to which Professor Morgenroth might respond.</p></speech>

On the unification issue and the graduate transfer, I guess if one wanted to properly look at this, one would need to do a much more detailed analysis.  We were just looking at relatively hypothetical examples that are instructive in some ways but certainly not realistic.</p> <p>  On the regional conversion issue, we know that peripheral regions more generally in the EU have struggled and Northern Ireland would be within that mix as well as other parts of Ireland.  There have been some movements.  We often assume the west is the poorest but it is nowhere near the poorest region.  Within the west, there are aspects that are much more like Dublin than, for example, most of the midlands.  There have been shifts and shifts are possible.  They require substantial policy interventions and also sometimes a bit of good luck.  In the case of the west, basically focused on Galway and the quality of life aspects of Galway, they have managed to build clusters around pharmaceuticals and medical devices that are doing extremely well.  There are ways of turning around some of these lagging regions but, as Mr. Finucane said, there are more structural issues in regions such as Northern Ireland that are very similar in other parts.</p></speech>

It is important for us to get the views of the economic experts when we are considering the future of this island.  I have a few general questions.  The first concerns the economic impact of Brexit.  What economic impact will Brexit have on Northern Ireland over the next five years?  Many believe that partition remains economically disastrous for the North.  What are their thoughts on that?  Do they agree?  Much analysis of possible constitutional change on the island neglects the reality that any transition will happen over time and include EU and international assistance and support.  What role do the witnesses believe the EU could play in a transition to a united Ireland?  I hope that was not too many questions and I look forward to hearing their replies.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.472" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Edgar Morgenroth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2020120800002#F01200"><p>Yes.  On the impact of Brexit, obviously it depends very much on the nature of Brexit.  Brexit has happened but will we have a trade deal or not?   That will make a very big difference.  I note earlier that the Commission and the UK agreed on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol, which is a good thing.  If there is a trade deal, the unique status Northern Ireland would have in those circumstances would be a platform from which to build because having access to both the Great Britain market and the wider EU market in a relatively unencumbered way would give Northern Ireland an advantage that certainly no other part of the UK would have and, likewise, no other part of the EU has.  That is a platform form which to build.  If, on the other hand, we end up with a situation where there is no trade deal, the Northern Ireland protocol will come into play and how that will be implemented matters hugely both in terms of east-west as well as North-South trade.  In that circumstance, there is a possibility Northern Ireland would be the most negatively affected of all parts of Europe from Brexit.</p><p>On one hand is this binary possibility of having a relatively benign and positive outlook to one that is pretty negative.  I will not use the word "catastrophic" but "negative".  That is one thing.</p><p> The EU support is an interesting question.  There is no doubt EU support is important.  Consider, for example, the situation in East Germany.  EU support was there but the bulk of the heavy lifting was done, and is done to this day, by the West Germans.  An extra percentage, a so-called solidarity contribution, was put on income tax and that still exists.  It is an ongoing thorny issue in politics in Germany.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses agree that the island of Ireland would be better off in the longer term as one fully integrated economic unit within the EU?  I would like to hear their thoughts on that.</p></speech>

As Professor Morgenroth said, we looked at a partial analysis of what a united Ireland would look like in terms of an economy.  One would have to look at the cost to Northern Ireland of losing access to the GB market.  The Northern Ireland economy is totally integrated into the GB market and the loss of that would be extremely serious.  One must then think about what Northern Ireland would get in terms of increased access to the Irish and EU markets.  The point made by Professor Morgenroth is that there is a possibility of a major opportunity for Northern Ireland if the UK honours the deals it has already signed up to.  The benefits in terms of increased access to the EU and Irish markets would probably not offset the loss of the GB market.  There are many other things we have not looked at.  As Professor Morgenroth said earlier, we have looked at a partial analysis here.  One needs to take account of many other things.</p></speech>

The German example is positive but it is easy to pick other regional policy experiments that have not gone well.  The Italian <i>Mezzogiorno</i>has been in receipt of substantial attention and investment for more than 60 years and it has not at all converged.  It is not therefore a given that a change of regime will suddenly result in a positive outcome.  It could also easily result in a bad or negative outcome.  That is all dependent on the right policies being adopted and those are not guaranteed.</p></speech>

It is great to see Professor FitzGerald again.  I heard his presentation to the Joint Committee on Climate Action a few weeks ago.  It is always enjoyable to hear him speak.</p> <p>  I was reading over the weekend and it is amazing how the history of the economy on this island changes.  At the turn of the 20th century, Belfast was the economic powerhouse on the island of Ireland.  Dublin was a backwater economy in comparison.  Professor FitzGerald mentioned how Northern Ireland picked up again in the 1960s and then, perhaps, another real difference is that it did not avail of the European Union funding as quickly as we did.  It is fascinating to see, when one looks over the history of the last 100 years, how the economy fluctuated between the two parts of this island.</p> <p>  I will ask a couple of questions about the low educational attainment.  For me, education is very much the silver bullet to fix most of society's ills.  It is a way for people from tough backgrounds to do well.  It really is a great way to go about it.  When I was thinking about this, it struck me that four of my cousins, funnily enough, are from just across the Border from me in south Armagh.  All four went to university in the UK and ended up working there for a long time.  None of those four are actually in Northern Ireland now.  That really struck me.  One looks at that and asks what we must do to try to get those people back into Northern Ireland.  Is it a case where the Northern Ireland Executive or societal sectors in Northern Ireland, must ask people to come back to help rebuild Northern Ireland, a bit like we did here in the Celtic Tiger years?  We saw it was really taking off and everyone who had emigrated in the 1980s wanted to come back and play a part.  We need a clear message around why it is important for graduates to come back to Northern Ireland and play a part.</p> <p>  I wish to discuss two final points.  In their conclusions, Professors FitzGerald and Morgenroth asked how Northern Ireland can effectively address its productivity gaps.  That is my question on the issue.  They said in their opening statement that Northern Ireland's expenditure per head is 120%, which is actually much higher than the rest of the UK.  They estimate that subvention would still be needed in the context of a united Ireland.  At the same time, they said that if the transfer had to come from central government in Dublin, it would to be a substantial long-term burden on the standard of living of those in the Republic of Ireland.</p> <p>  For want of a better question, what can Northern Ireland do to get itself into that kind of position where it can address its productivity gap?  I do not mean to say this in a simplistic manner.  My simplistic view from looking at the witnesses' statement, however, it is that on one hand, it relies massively on funding coming from London and on the other hand, if that were to continue, it would rely on funding from the Republic of Ireland.  Essentially, what can Northern Ireland do to address that productivity gap?</p> <p>  I will return briefly to the issue of what we are doing in my part of the world with the M1 corridor, which is something the Chairman will also know much about.  The concept of the M1 corridor is to promote the entire region from Dublin right up to Belfast.  It is an investment-ready region with 35% of Ireland's workforce and one third of the population.  It is a really good area to attract jobs and investment.  Perhaps, however, it does not have the same level of promotion it should be getting from both the Government here and in Northern Ireland.  Do the witnesses believe a real way forward to advance the economic integration of this island is by promoting such types of regions right across the world to bring businesses here?</p></speech>

We must be out of here by 3.30 p.m.  We have no choice as the room must be sanitised in an appropriate way before the next group comes in.  We have very little time left.  I hope to take the next speakers in the order of Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, SDLP, Alliance and Fine Gael.   We might squeeze them all into ten minutes or less and allow our speakers then our guests to come back in.  I appreciate I am asking a lot.

I welcome Professors FitzGerald and Morgenroth.  Today's discussion has been a useful and informative and we must take cognisance of what they have said.  I accept it is a partial analysis.  There are differences, certainly, between the experiences in West and East Germany, for example, and here.  We already have an integrated economy in Ireland.  There are two ex-agriculture Ministers in the room and we know how fully integrated the agriculture and agri-food sectors are but this also is the case in terms of manufacturing and other things.  It is also helpful that we now have a higher education alliance which will help to be transformative across the island.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the issues around higher and further education.  We recognise that County Fermanagh has a high level of students with A levels but a low level of graduates who work there.  Notwithstanding the huge issues in attracting foreign direct investment, FDI, namely, our local broadband and roads infrastructure, we do not manage to hold onto all those graduates.  That is certainly a problem for the economy.</p> <p>  I particularly want to ask, however, the witnesses' thoughts on the views of Mr. David McWilliams, who recently spoke about how the combined GDP of the Southern and Northern economies could absorb the subvention.  Obviously, we would have priorities that would not necessarily be in parallel with those in Britain.</p><p>One of the things that the subvention does not do is to look into the tax take, etc., that big multinationals enjoy in the North.  The revenues of the likes of Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's supermarkets are not counted as part of our overall revenue; those moneys are counted where the companies are headquartered.  The point I want to make is that the economies in the North and the South could absorb the subvention even "before the commercial dynamism of unification kicks in", to quote from David McWilliams.  What are the witnesses thoughts on that?  I am going to leave time for Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile to ask his question.  I appreciate the witnesses being here.</p></speech>

I will bring in Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile later but I must take representatives from Fianna F&aacute;il now.  The time allocated for our meeting has run down.  Every party must be treated fairly and equally.  If Fianna F&aacute;il wants to make a contribution, followed by the SDLP and the Alliance Party, then Sinn F&eacute;in followed by Fine Gael, if we can fit them all in.</p></speech>

We have seen the all-Ireland economy grow, thankfully, due to the Good Friday Agreement and the new structures that were put in place.  With the fallout that there will be from the Covid-19 pandemic and, in particular, Brexit - no matter what type of Brexit occurs - what would our guests advise the Government about making investments in the economy on an all-Ireland basis?  What would they recommend as a major type of investment in human capital and in physical infrastructure that could help to mitigate the effects of the pandemic and Brexit, particularly in the less developed regions of our country, such as the central Border area?</p></speech>

I thank my fellow "Nordies" for their assistance.  I will also be brief and will just make a couple of points and observations.  The primary point is to welcome this discussion at the committee because it gives it the authority and wherewithal that it needs.  That is warranted because of the live and numerous discussions that are taking place on this issue all around us and within our society.</p> <p>  I take the point that Senator Blaney made earlier but there will always be disagreement about some of the language because there are divergences of opinions on this matter.  I always like to remind people that when we are talking about the economics of constitutional change down the line that, if we treat the Good Friday Agreement as our bedrock, as I believe we always should, the agreement did not settle the constitutional question, it asks us the question.  That is an important point to remember.</p> <p>  Our witnesses' submission refers to research carried out and published in the paper The Northern Ireland Economy: Problems and Prospects.  I understand that the paper was first published in a Trinity economics working paper in July last year.  I wonder whether it was peer reviewed.</p> <p>  Our witnesses's submission refers to research carried out and published in the paper The Northern Ireland Economy: Problems and Prospects.

It has been an interesting conversation and I could literally listen to them all day.  I am reflecting on what Professor FitzGerald said about changing dynamics.  When I grew up in Tyrone, we felt our roads were much better than the ones in the South of Ireland.  I am showing my age in saying that.  There have been shifting fortunes.  I am also thinking about the Butler Act and the impact it had on the Catholic community in the 1950s with access to secondary and third-level education.  Here we are now talking about the legacy of the eleven-plus that I did and having to fix secondary schools in order to offer equal opportunities.  I very much welcome the focus on that today.</p> <p>  I find the report incredibly interesting in terms of a united Ireland.  I am wondering about the costs of not prioritising reconciliation, duplication, as the professors have pointed out, and the brain drain.  I also wonder about thing such as mental health.  It is great that we have the paper and research into the cost of a united Ireland, but I am wondering about the cost of not prioritising reconciliation.  We have not had a great couple of weeks in that regard.  I would not mind hearing the professors' thoughts on that.</p> <p>  I have two other quick questions about women's participation.  How does it differ between North and South at the moment in terms of the labour force?  There is, at the moment, double taxation on remote working.  It has been removed for the pandemic, but there is a double taxation if one works in the North but lives in the South and has to work remotely.  The professors have talked about the opportunity for an all-island economy.  How do they think that could work?  Might people be able to work in Belfast, for example, but live in Bantry, if more companies go further in terms of remote working?  Would that have a positive effect on the all-Ireland economy?</p></speech>

It is now being published and has been peer reviewed.  That is a part of the process.  We felt it was worthwhile getting it out there to get comments and that is normal in the academic world.  It has now been extensively reviewed and will appear in a journal this winter.</p> <p>  The first question related to third level education and graduates leaving the country.  The proportion of A-level students in Northern Ireland who go to university in Britain has increased because of constraints on third level funding in Northern Ireland.  That is lethal.  People form their social networks and expectations when they are doing an undergraduate degree and the chances of getting them back are far slimmer once they have gone to Liverpool Brookes University, formed their friendships and whatever.  That is why two thirds of the people who go to Great Britain for university never come back.  The problem with putting more resources into third level in the North is where are they going to come from?  That may be a priority.</p> <p>  Education is the key to addressing productivity.  Ms Gildernew, raised the question about absorption of the cost of funding Northern Ireland and we looked at that in the paper.  It would be the equivalent of the financial shock to Ireland in the 2008 to 2010 period.  That is the kind of magnitude we are talking about.  It is very large.  That is why it is so important to deal with the productivity problem in Northern Ireland which gives one the choice.  I will leave the politicians to ask what the reaction would be to that.</p><p> Deputy Brendan Smith asked about investment post Covid.  Wearing my climate change hat, I would like to see significant State investment in retrofitting.  In particular, we said that this should begin in rural areas or outside of Dublin where people are using oil or coal.  The case is similar for Northern Ireland.  We could learn from the Housing Executive.  We have been saying all of these things and indicating where Northern Ireland could do better.  Where the Republic could do better is on  social housing and management.  We could learn from the Housing Executive.  In terms of the green deal, jobs and regional balance, investment would help.</p><p> Senator Currie asked about reconciliation.  It is the soft things that make economies successful.  Twenty years ago I had to talk with the then Tasmanian Prime Minister about the Celtic Tiger.  I gave him the usual spiel about education, corporation tax and so on.  At the end, he asked a very good question regarding what role Irish music played in the Irish success story.  I was stumped.  Professor Morgenroth touched on this in terms of Galway.  Why is Galway the success story in Ireland and Waterford the failure?  Galway has two successful theatre groups.  Belfast City has picked itself up in the past 20 years.  Making somewhere an attractive place in which to live is at least as important as anything else.  I am not an expert on that.  I stick to discussing the economy.</p></speech>

Westport is one of the most remote towns on the island yet it is a thriving place and not just because of tourism.  Westport does not have a motorway or anything like it so it is not the infrastructure.  It is the quality of life.  Graduates like a good quality of life.  That is something Northern Ireland can really look to.  Northern Ireland is a fantastic place.  I live in south County Monaghan, which Deputy Brendan Smith knows, and I can see south Armagh from my house.  I regularly, when allowed, cross the Border to visit the Mountains of Mourne, etc.  There are some fantastic places in Northern Ireland.  That is something to actually use.  It is something Northern Ireland has and nobody can take it away.  It is there - make the best of it.  That is one investment that people in Northern Ireland will not regret either.  I have already mention education and good quality of life.  If it is going to have to be physical infrastructure, then, as Professor FitzGerald quite rightly pointed out, there must be a focus on retrofitting and environmental infrastructures.  If it is going to have to be something more conventional, then broadband is where I put the money.</p></speech>

They should remember to confine their questions to five minutes, if possible.</p> <p>  Witnesses attending in the committee room are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, therefore, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  For witnesses and members attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons, or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against persons outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website following the meeting.</p> <p>  I now call Mr. Kelly to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

By way of introduction, I am a principal officer in the EU and international planning regulation section within the planning division of the Department.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Paul Lemass, assistant secretary of the housing policy legislation and governance division, and Mr. Paul Hogan, principal planning adviser in the Department, who is visible on the video link.  Mr. Lemass will give a short opening statement on the proposed amendments relating to the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2020, and Mr. Hogan will also be available, if required, to answer questions on the practical operation of section 11(3)(b) provisions.<br/><br/>I will briefly outline the two main elements of the Planning and Development Bill 2020, as passed by the Seanad last week, as well as referencing the two further amendments to be introduced on Committee Stage.  One of those relates to planning legislation and amendments to substitute consent provisions, which I will address, and the other relates to residential tenancy provisions, which will be addressed in Mr. Lemass&rsquo;s opening statement.  These amendments will also require a modification to the Long Title of the Bill.<br/><br/>As per the supplementary briefing note circulated to the committee, the Planning and Development Bill 2020 has been brought forward as a matter of urgency in light of the present Covid-19 pandemic to ensure the necessary protections are in place to safeguard the operation of the planning and building control systems.  The purpose of the Planning and Development Bill 2020, as passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann, was twofold.  First, it amended section 11(3)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which is the principal Act, in respect of the mandatory requirement to hold public meetings on a proposed development plan at the early issue stage.  Second, the Bill allows the Government to make orders during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic to extend certain statutory periods applying under the Planning and Development Acts and Building Control Acts.<br/><br/>The Bill will amend section 11(3)(<i>b</i>) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to replace the mandatory requirement to hold public meetings on a proposed development plan at the &quot;issues stage&quot; of the process, which is before any draft plan has been produced, with the positive obligation for planning authorities to consult with members of the public, in such manner as they consider appropriate, and to invite submissions in writing from members of the public on a proposed development plan.  Following a Government Committee Stage amendment in the Seanad, which was made for the avoidance of doubt, this public consultation by the planning authority shall include the public holding of a meeting or an online public meeting.  In other words, as part of a planning authority&rsquo;s statutory obligation to consult with the public in respect of the commencement of the two-year draft development plan process, some format of public meeting will always be required under section 11(3)(<i>b</i>) at the initial pre-draft stage of the development plan process, by way of either a public meeting attended by the public in person or an online public meeting.</p><p>Once the Covid-19-related public meeting restrictions have passed, a planning authority could hold both an online meeting as well as an in-person meeting if it wished.<br/><br/>This amendment is immediately required to address present restrictions on public gatherings during the pandemic, which may impact on the progression of development plans during the pandemic.  It is also in line with the modernisation agenda for the planning system, to improve accessibility and inclusiveness through increased online activity and to ensure continued flexibility in communicating with the public at the initial pre-draft stage of the development plan process, and will therefore be a permanent amendment.<br/><br/>I now move to emergency periods in section 3, as passed by the Seanad.  The purpose of this provision is to allow the Government to make orders, during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, which would extend certain statutory periods applying under the Planning and Development Acts and Building Control Acts.  This contingency measure is urgently required so that public participation elements of the planning regime, and certain decision making and enforcement systems of the building control regime, are not compromised in the event that further waves of Covid-19 infections may necessitate a further period of stay at home travel restrictions, or indeed may critically impact on the operation of individual planning authorities.This measure broadly mirrors the recently expended section 251A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as inserted by section 9 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, which was in turn modelled on similar provisions in section 251 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 that covers the Christmas period.  That extends the timelines of the planning Act from Christmas day through to new year&rsquo;s day.  That happens every year.  <br/><br/>However, the present provision includes new flexibilities as follows.  More than one extension period order may be made within the confined operative period for this general scheme, which is due to end on 9 June 2021, by virtue of it being linked to the operation of Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020; extension orders can now be applied not only to the whole country, but to specific administrative areas as required; and the Government, at the request of the Minister, may choose which statutory periods, in which specific legislative provision, they require to extend rather than applying the extension to all periods under the Planning Acts and the specified provisions of the Building Control Acts.<br/><br/>In terms of which legislative periods might be extended, an order could, for example, apply to the Planning Acts and not the Building Control Acts, or <i>vice versa</i>, or, if required, an order might apply to specific periods within Acts, particularly those with public participation objectives, such as the public consultation periods in planning applications, planning appeals, or in the adoption of statutory plans, such as city or county development plans, local area plans or variations to those plans.  That would have to be decided at the time a decision would be made, assuming the legislation is passed.  <br/><br/>The recently expended section 251A of the Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced a similar disregard provision for statutory periods during the first lockdown earlier this year, in which case the Government Order made under section 251A lasted for 8 weeks, from the end of March until 23 May 2020 and applied to all relevant statutory periods in the Planning Acts as well as to specified provisions in the Building Control Act.<br/><br/>It is important to note that while this proposed legislation may never be used, it is still an essential temporary safeguard that is urgently needed for as long as the pandemic persists, to provide an agile and flexible process to ensure that the integrity of the planning and building control systems are maintained in the event of further waves of infection.<br/><br/>I will conclude on the proposed Committee Stage amendments relating to substitute consent provisions in the Planning and Development Acts.  As I set out last week at a session with the committee online, in order to the comply with the findings of the Supreme Court judgment of 1 July 2020, it is necessary to amend the substitute consent provisions at Part XA of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide for &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; to be considered in an application for substitute consent at section 177K of the Planning Act, along with the necessary ancillary provisions to ensure additional public participation, where required, is facilitated with respect to the consideration of exceptional circumstances at the leave to apply stage, as well as on the wider application.<br/><br/>Therefore, following the introduction of these highly technical proposed amendments, any new applications for substitute consent which are made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la must demonstrate exceptional circumstances and, in turn, the board must be satisfied that such circumstances exist, while also complying with the existing public participation requirements of sections 177K and 177H of the Planning Act and prescribed by regulations under section 177N.</p><p>Section 177K of the Act, which relates to the decision of the board on substitute consent, will also be amended to provide for additional public participation where required on exceptional circumstances and on the wider application where an application for substitute consent is currently pending before the board.  This legislation will deal not only with new applications but applications currently before the board upon the enactment of these amendments.  This is to ensure that applications for substitute consent which have already been submitted to the board but not yet decided are subject to a requirement to satisfy that exceptional circumstances exist so that applicants are given the opportunity to provide any further information to this effect and so that the public, prescribed bodies and those who have already made submissions on the application are notified of, and can make submissions on, the application, including on whether exceptional circumstances exist in this regard. <br/><br/>The introduction of these technical amendments to existing substitute consent provisions is a matter of urgency, noting that these provisions will facilitate the earlier resolution of the terms of the EU Court of Justice judgment in case C-261/18, the Commission <i>v.</i>Ireland, which found against Ireland.  This case followed on from case C-215/06, also known as the Derrybrien Wind Farm case.  In this regard, it is noted that the power of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to issue a decision on the Derrybrien Wind Farm substitute consent application currently before it has been called into question following the Supreme Court judgment.  It is further noted that the State must pay fines of &euro;15,000 per day to the European Commission as a result of the judgment in case C-261/18, which effectively is the follow-on Derrybrien case, which judgment was published in November 2019, until the terms of that judgment are met.  For information, since the judgment was issued the State has paid a lump sum fine of &euro;5 million to the Commission in respect of this case, as well as a further &euro;2.745 million in daily fines relating the first six month period since the judgment date.<br/><br/>The introduction of these technical amendments to substitute consent provisions is a matter of urgency for the planning system in general and is not just to do with Derrybrien as it as a vital element of a functioning economy which needs to have measures in place as soon as possible that are legally compliant with the EIA directive to facilitate applications to seek to regularise the planning status of large scale developments, which are subject to EIA, in exceptional circumstances, if required. <br/><br/>Mr. Paul Hogan and I will endeavour to answer any questions that the Chairman or committee members might have with respect to the three planning elements of the proposed Bill and Mr. Paul Lemass will endeavour to answer questions on the residential tenancies element of the Bill. </p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Liam Smyth, assistant principal, from the rental market policy unit, who is connecting remotely to this session.  I would like also to recognise the tremendous support and forbearance that this committee, and its predecessor, has afforded the Department since March in introducing urgent, complex and significantly enhanced tenancy protections during the pandemic.  This will be the fourth time in 2020 that the Oireachtas has been asked to make legislative changes relating to the Residential Tenancies Acts, namely, Part 2 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 in March providing a moratorium on evictions and rent increases during Covid-19 to 1 August; the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 in July providing more targeted tenancy protections for those in rent arrears due to Covid-19 to 10 January - up to end November 2020 - 348 tenant declaration have been made to gain the protections under this Act; the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 in October to protect tenants from evictions when people&rsquo;s movement is restricted to within 5 km of their homes; and the proposed Part 3 of the Planning and Development Bill 2020 in December to again, provide targeted tenancy protections, subject to certain conditions, for those in rent arrears due to Covid-19 to 12 April.</p> <p>  The proposed new provisions will operate, subject to certain conditions, from 11 January 2021 to 12 April 2021 to provide enhanced protections for those tenants who are facing rent arrears due to Covid-19 and, as a result, are at risk of losing their tenancy.  Similar to the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020, if a tenant&rsquo;s ability to pay rent has been impacted by Covid-19 and the tenant meets specific criteria, new procedures and protections apply under these new provisions.  Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 13 April 2021 and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 12 April 2021.  Where a tenant makes the required written declaration to the RTB and his or her landlord to avail of the enhanced tenancy protections from 11 January 2021 to 12 April 2021, he or she will be required at the same time to serve a notice on the RTB requesting it to assist him or her to obtain advice from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS; and within five days of making the declaration, the tenant will also be required to serve a notice on their landlord requesting a consultation to agree rent payment arrangements.</p><p> New conditions apply to these new tenancy protections that are designed to better balance the legal rights of tenants and landlords, taking account of the Constitution.  The opportunity is being provided in this Bill to allow a landlord to make a counterdeclaration to disapply the new protections on foot of the financial hardship that they would cause for the landlord.</p><p> I thank the committee for facilitating this briefing and both Mr. Smyth and I will answer any questions that members might have.</p></speech>

There is quite a lot going on in this Bill at this point.  Talk about project creep.  It is racing away from us a little, but we have had the benefit in the Seanad of having had the Bill come through, so I appreciate the time and support that the Department officials have given us in the Seanad.</p> <p>  I am concluding that, at heart, these amendments are looking to assert a couple of values for the public, one being the value of public participation, public information, and protecting their rights and participation in the planning process, which is all very valuable.  On the requirement around the county and city development plans, it is important that the legislation would assert at a very early stage in the statutory process, in fact at the pre-draft stage in the process, the requirement on every local authority to have a public meeting to consult the public.  The Bill, in this instance, reflects our evolving environment and asserts the facility of an online meeting.  It is important that we recognise that a development plan process lasts two years.  There is a pre-draft consultation and a report on that, there is a draft plan and consultation on that, and there is a plan and there is consultation on that.  It is very important that we do not ignore all of the other elements of consultation that take place and that are conducted, both formally and informally, by the elected members with the support of the executive functions of the local authorities.  The extension of the Covid periods for the planning and building regulations process is practical and valid.</p> <p>  On the third element, the substitute consent, this has gone on since July.  Is it purely down to the fact that a Government had not been formed that this matter has not been dealt with?  It is coming up to &euro;10 million of a cost for the State.  Will the witnesses clarify whether there was no earlier opportunity for the State to deal with this matter?</p> <p>  I support the contention that anybody applying for retrospective permission for a project that required an environmental impact assessment has acted with a level of disregard and negligence that needs to be criticised and called out.  It is welcome that it will have to be demonstrated that there is an exceptional need and qualification for the project to be considered.  Will the witnesses also talk through how the public will engage in having their say?  In those instances the public good will have been largely ignored if the project has gone ahead without an environmental impact assessment that should have been a requirement.</p> <p>  In terms of the residential tenancies amendments, the extension to 3 April of the ban on evictions and the ban on rent increases is very welcome.  It was mentioned that there had been 340 tenant declarations under the previous legislation.  Is that the latest number to date?  Will the witnesses confirm that for the tenants who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in these circumstances and who want or need to make a declaration, they will be able to do that via email using plain English and will not need to engage the services of a legal professional, be it a solicitor, public notary or anybody like that?</p></speech>

The judgment was issued by the Supreme Court in July.  We engaged immediately with the Office of the Attorney General.  We have been working with it in terms of drafting and getting legal advice and we continue to do so.  Off the top of my head, 11, 12 or 13 other judicial reviews followed immediately after that case, so we were addressing those issues.  As I mentioned, it had been our understanding from the Attorney General that because this was directly implementing the provisions of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive, we would be using a regulation under the 1972 Act to which I referred that is used to transpose directives.  It was not until Thursday of the week before last that the Attorney General advised us to go into primary legislation.  To answer the Senator's question, it was following much the same course.  If it had gone through the 1972 regulations, it would have been done around now anyway.  We are conscious of it every day that goes by in terms of fines we have to pay.  I do not know whether that answers the Senator's question.  In effect, it was moved into this legislative process on legal advice.</p> <p>  On the issue of how the public can engage in substitute consent generally, the best way of explaining it is that it is effectively a form of planning application, for want of a better comparison.  It is where the developer has to put forward a remedial environmental impact assessment report which, in effect, takes into account what went before.  The developer submits it to the competent authority, namely, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is like a normal application in that there are site notices and newspaper notices and members of the public get to engage.  That is what we were building into the provisions.</p> <p>  It is very complicated to read, but even for applications that are currently in the system there are two steps or stages as it currently stands in the context of substitute consent.  One is that there first has to be an assessment of whether the circumstances are exceptional.  If the board agrees they are exceptional, it goes to the next stage, which is the substantive piece.  We are now retrofitting back into the first step that there has to be public participation and it would bring it forward into the second step that there has to be consideration of exceptional circumstances.  In effect, if a member of the public already submitted information on an application that is currently before the board, they will get a second chance when this legislation goes through.  The best way of describing it is that it is like a normal planning application, for want of a better comparison, in terms of public participation rights and the fact that people can write to the board and the board must take account of their views.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

The RTB provides a template which includes both the declaration and the request for further support from the RTB.  A person does not have to fill in two separate pieces of paper; it will all be on one piece of paper.  The person will have to sign to indicate that he or she wants both the declaration and the engagement with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, but it will all be set out on the one piece of paper.  That seems to have been working well thus far.</p></speech>

This is the fifth year in a row in which, in the final two weeks before the summer recess, very substantial planning and residential tenancies amendment legislation has been dropped into existing Bills that are before the D&aacute;il.  There are several problems with that.  None of the points I will make are a criticism of either of the officials who are present.  They are experiencing these problems in as acute a way as members of the committee are experiencing them.  These are incredibly technical matters.  The job of the committee is meant to be to scrutinise this legislation in the public interest to make sure it does what the witnesses are telling us it does and that it does not have unintended consequences.</p><p>The lesson of the Derrybrien case is that if proper scrutiny had been introduced when the original legislation was being passed by this House, we would not have paid possibly &euro;10 million in fines so far.  I will come to it in questions, but I expect that the fines will reach many multiples of that figure by the time the matter is resolved.  In my view, it is really unacceptable for members of the committee to be given very detailed technical amendments.  I have been told in an email that I have just received that we must submit our amendments to this Bill on Thursday of this week, and we are going to be asked to complete all Stages of the Bill - Second and Subsequent Stages - in a single day, on Wednesday of next week, which means that the guillotine procedure will be used and we will have a very small amount of time available to us.  We have been denied the opportunity to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny or even time to inform ourselves by engaging with others, so I want to state my extreme dissatisfaction at this situation.  </p><p> This may also be a lesson to us in respect of two Bills that we are currently considering, namely, the water environment (abstractions) Bill 2020 and the marine planning and development management Bill 2020, because with both of those Bills, sectoral opinion have raised significant concerns about potential non-compliance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and the Water Framework Directive itself, and the issues are very similar to those we are dealing with here - public participation and compliance.  We are being asked to assist in fixing a problem and we are being given a tiny amount of time to do it.  If we make a mess of this, millions more euro of taxpayers' money will be paid out in fines on this or future cases, so the stakes are exceptionally high.  My specific questions relate to substitute consent because my colleague, Deputy Gould, will deal with the other sections of the Bill.</p><p> I ask the witnesses to provide greater clarity as to why the Attorney General only suggested at the last moment that this needed to be done by way of primary legislation and not through a statutory instrument.  Was the Attorney General consulted earlier, and was there originally Attorney General support for a statutory instrument and what changed?  If we pass this Bill in the next two weeks, can the witnesses tell us when will the board be expected to make a decision on the Derrybrien case, and what is the anticipated total amount of fines that will be incurred by the State between last October when the fines kicked in at &euro;15,000 per day, and when a decision is made?  Can they tell us how many other substitute consent applications are currently in the process and will be affected by this?  Also, what happens with the substitute consent applications that were approved under the old regime?  Are they now open to legal challenge or in any way undermined because of the Supreme Court judgment?  </p><p> I want to be very clear on the issue of public consultation.  If this Bill is passed, does that mean that for all of the current pending substitute consent applications with the board, there will now be a new round of public consultation in all of those, and will all documentation and information that has been submitted, whether in public or private session today to the board, be available in respect of them?</p><p> I am still trying to understand the exceptionality test, therefore, I ask the witnesses to explain that to me in plain English.  Is it now that there is public participation in the first phase, and will public participation continue in the second phase in the exceptionality test?  I ask the witnesses to talk us through that in more detail.</p></speech>

Our focus was on drafting, and my understanding is that a legal decision was made as a matter of prudence, to reduce the potential for future judicial reviews.  The original legislation was introduced by way of primary legislation, so my understanding is that was the thinking behind the decision.</p> <p>  On the question of how long the Derrybrien case will take, as it currently stands, there are no specific timelines for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and there are no statutory timelines.  There are statutory objective periods in all cases for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, generally of 18 weeks.  Our Minister is prohibited from getting involved in any case under section 30, but in terms of information, my understanding is that in the Derrybrien case the application was lodged by a company owned by ESB in August, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la had indicated it on its website that it was due to decide on the case in January, so that is a timeframe of around about six months.  It is not for me to anticipate how long the board is going to take, but given that there would have to be a further public participation element to it, one might extrapolate from that, that it might be the middle of next year before a decision is made.</p><p>As I set out in the briefing note there are in and around 15 applications that have not yet been decided at the leave stage, and there are some 20 applications that are pending in the second, substantive stage.  If this legislation goes through then the new legislation will apply to all of those, requiring a further round of public participation, and certainly for those who have already gone through their own public participation stage in the substantive stage, if that makes sense.</p></speech>

We have paid &euro;5 million for the lump, and with the daily fines we have probably already accrued in the ballpark of about &euro;5 million to &euro;6 million, although I do not have it worked out.

To be honest, that is a legal question to be answered.  Effectively, under the Irish legal system and development there is an eight week period within which to take a judicial review.  This legislation has been in existence for ten years and has operated well.  There are not too many applicants that go through it.  If something has already been through the process and is beyond the judicial review period it is my understanding that it is not possible to take a collateral attack to something that has been decided a number of years ago.</p></speech>

It is everything again.  The first stage did not have public participation.  It focused exclusively on the first step.  The developer had to prove or show how it was exceptional.  Assuming the developer got through that step, then it had to go to the public participation element.  This is one of the faults that was found in the recent Supreme Court case where it was said that the members of the public were not given the opportunity to consider the issue of exceptionality in itself rather than the substance of the application.  That is going to be reintroduced.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding cases already decided as being exceptional, we are mandating that the board does not take into account any decision it made previously and it will be accepting submissions from members of the public, which will now mention exceptionality.  The board must make a further decision.  Would the Deputy like me to go through the exceptionality and how and what it is?</p></speech>

I do not want to rehash the debate from the Seanad on the public participation element, but it certainly is my belief that this Bill does not prevent in-person meetings.  I see it as an addition to a pre-draft of the plan.  In Waterford we had a very successful online consultation process as part of the pre-draft development plan, with 298 submissions.  They engaged in webinars and videos.  Importantly, they also offered the opportunity for in-person one-to-one meetings.  It was not a case of either-or.  I believe that local authorities would not use either-or.  To engage our younger people in the planning process we do need to move with the times with technology, while also appreciating and recognising those people who are not tech savvy.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the last part of the briefing on the residential tenancy amendments.</p><p>I would like to tease out the implications of counterdeclaration on the part of the landlord.  I appreciate that a balance must be struck between a tenant's rights and a landlord's rights.  Who makes the determination, when is it determined and what happens in the intervening period?  Under the previous legislation, the tenant was immediately protected when a declaration was made.  Is the tenant still protected pending a counterdeclaration on the part of the landlord?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.546" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Lemass" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120800002#J00200"><p>I will respond to the question on residential tenancies.  I think the matter relating to planning is clear.</p> <p>  There are two stand-alone processes.  In a situation where a tenant makes a declaration and a landlord makes a counterdeclaration, the tenant has applied for certain protections and the landlord, who also claims to be suffering from hardship, wants to resist the granting of this protection.  It does not go any further than that.  The landlord can pursue an eviction through a separate process called a "notice of termination".  The notice periods for that process are prescribed.  If a landlord does not subsequently make a notice of termination, the tenancy is not terminated.  The protection for the tenant, the notice periods and the ability to raise a dispute as part of a termination process continue to apply.  If a declaration is made by a tenant and a counterdeclaration is made by a landlord, the landlord may then wish to pursue a notice of termination.  He or she would then have to give the required notice period.  If the tenant feels the landlord is not being fair, he or she can, for this or any other reason, raise a dispute relating to the notice of termination.  That dispute then goes to arbitration through the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, which has been hearing disputes on a range of matters for years.  There is a safety net in place for a tenant whose landlord chooses to block any declaration.  The dispute process also provides a safeguard for the landlord by determining whether a declaration has been made in the correct manner.</p></speech>

As the witnesses have noted, in-person public consultations will be possible again when Covid-19 restrictions are lifted.  Does the wording of this amendment allow local authorities to choose between holding public meetings and continuing with the online option, thereby potentially ending in-person public consultations if a council executive wishes to do so?</p><p>While many of us have become familiar with online meetings some may not have, so this could preclude them from the process.</p></speech>

Just to be specific, this is the very initial stage.  It is before the councillors are engaged in creating the actual draft.

It is prior to even the direction stage.  The improvement for the future is the fact that it can be either an in-person or an online format.  Generally speaking, these things are discussed and negotiated at council level.  The problem, as it stands, is that the only option is a public meeting and that format is not particularly suitable to a stage of the process where no proposals are being put forward.  In addition, it tends to give rise to two groups of people.  One group are people looking for something, typically landowners, who may wish to have a rezoning and that cannot even be considered at this stage of the process.  Also, there tend to be people who may be engaged by a planning issue that may have nothing to do with the development plan and, again, they can be frustrated by this stage of the process too.  The public meeting format does not necessarily focus on the issues at hand.  As has been said, things like webinars and online interactive information, such as videos, that people can look at online in their own time, are often as effective and can engage people, particularly younger people or people who for whatever reason cannot make a particular meeting at a particular time.</p> <p>  We are due to issue updated guidelines on development plans very shortly.  We will make it very clear in that guidance that it is expected that these matters will be discussed at council level with the elected members as to what the best format is.  It will probably be combination where there are no constraints and restrictions.  We do not want to box the process into a public meeting that is inappropriate at the very early stage.</p></speech>

There are some people who have difficulty engaging online so to give the option to completely stop that physical thing is problematic as it gives people a choice.  I am not 100% sure, but do the councillors make that call or is it the executive?  It is the executive.</p></speech>

This is the initial stage and it is for the council to engage.  As it currently stands, this is not a reserved function and it is not for the councillors to call but that is not to say that councillors are not involved.  It is an unusual provision in the sense that there is no mention of the term "public meeting" anywhere else in the development plan process and yet meetings happen.</p></speech>

I have been involved in three county development plans.  I am sure most of those present have been involved in a development plan at some point.  I am very unhappy with this amendment.  I will focus on section 2 of the Bill which relates to section 11 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the county development plans issue because although there has been reference today to this being done by consensus, these things do not happen by consensus.  The reality of my experience tells me otherwise.  One must remember this is the earliest stage of a development plan and is exclusively an executive function.  It is not a reserved function at that point of a county development plan.  There is no reserved function at that stage.  I have engaged with councillors across the 31 councils in the past two weeks and I heard the same story from them.</p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge the enormous work of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  It prepared an amazing digest of the Bill that clearly sets out and addresses this issue.  I will be asking the officials to confirm that analysis.  The Bill has not been passed through the Houses, so, as of today, it is obligatory to have a public meeting.  One could call them town hall meetings for these purposes.  I do not have any difficulty embracing technology, which is marvellous.  I think we can have both.  That is where we are losing this argument slightly.  One can have the public town-hall type meetings.  While I would argue that they are beneficial, this should be a matter of negotiation.  That is what happened in the past on numerous occasions.  The public arrive at meetings and the council officials go through the various plans and infographics and tease out the issues.  That is good and positive.  I think online meetings are also good.  It is possible to have both.  However, I am advised that the situation as of today is that under the currently operating legislation it is obligatory to have a public meeting.  I ask the officials to confirm whether that is the case.  Let us have no ambiguity about this issue.</p> <p>  Mr. Kelly made the valid point that nowhere else in the legislation is there reference to a public meeting.  There is reference to it in this section, although I see that it relates to the reserved aspects of the matter in terms of the early stage of development.  Could a reference to an obligatory public meeting be inserted elsewhere in the legislation, possibly that relating to another part of the development plan process?  It is an important issue.</p> <p>  We want ownership of this plan and for people to engage with it.  We do not want a situation whereby the decision to hold a public meeting is made at the discretion of the unelected chief executives of local authorities.  Many committee members have spoken for years about giving greater powers to local people and local communities, yet this provision is going to be taken out of the legislation and that will make it the right solely of chief executives and their executive in each local authority to decide whether to hold a public meeting.  I do not have a difficulty with any other aspect of the Bill.  It is important that we have public participation and engagement and that people are encouraged to take part in the process.</p> <p>  I do not like terms such as "troublemakers" or "difficult people".  There was a suggestion in the Seanad during the passage of the Bill through that House that some difficult people were turning up at public meetings.  So what if they are?  Most Oireachtas Members are difficult people.  We were politicised by issues and we became difficult and challenged people and got ourselves in here.  Are we going to shut it down now?  I want to facilitate people in engagement.  I am old enough to have been involved in the Wood Quay protests.  People, particularly young people, mobilised on that issue, as did environmentalists.  Why should people not be mobilised and have public rallies or robust debates about our towns, communities, future, the planning of our future, challenging environmental issues such as water, and all the diverse elements that form part of a county development plan?  </p> <p>  I thank Mr. Lemass, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Hogan for their engagement.  I feel strongly on this point.  I am not hung up on the point in the process at which a public meeting is facilitated, but it should take place at a point when it is important that it be held.</p><p>There is no point having public meetings if people cannot effect change.  They must be held according to a timeline where people can feed into it.</p><p> It has come to my attention that some of the sitting county managers lobbied strongly to have this element changed.  I have prepared a series of detailed freedom of information requests which will go into the Department tomorrow.  It is important to flush that out.  It only makes me more concerned if chief executives have been lobbying for its removal.  That is the kernel of the problem.  There has to be shift to empower the elected members.  I do not want it to be a choice between political members and the executive.  It should be in legislation that there must be a public town hall type meeting.  I am interested in the officials' response.</p></speech>

What is much more useful is what already happens, namely, the provision of information on what the issues for the future might be.  People do not find that is something they can easily relate to in a public meeting format.  It is much more effective as a one-to-one exhibition or engagement.  That is what happens and is what is also used at later stages when there is a draft plan.  When there is no draft to discuss and it is just issues and what might happen in the future, it can be very difficult to mobilise interest from the public over the course of different evenings or weekends, as must be the case when there is a sole reliance on public meetings.  To catch as many people as possible, there must be quite a wide spread of times, formats and locations.  It does not work as effectively as intended in the legislation.  Having an element of choice is the way forward.</p> <p>  I am not aware of lobbying.  That did not come to me.  The matter was discussed in the context of engagement with the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, over a response to Covid and the fact that the provision was effectively holding up progress on a plan which had a ticking timeline, where people could not gather to meet, and therefore this had to be addressed.  It is an opportunity to widen the scope of the engagement at the early stage.  I do not share the view that there is an "us and them" situation between the elected members and the county and city managers at this stage of the process.  It is a very open and non-controversial stage in the process, or at least it should be, because people are just trying to understand the issues.  It is in everyone's interest to get the information out there, both publicly and online, and that will continue.</p></speech>

Will the exceptional circumstances grounds be available to access electronically as part of public participation?  It is one of my concerns.  The officials have spoken of the benefits of online meetings, but the planning process is generally not online, particularly as it relates to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I have other concerns around applications for strategic housing development, SHD, applications and websites being taken down, making it impossible to go back and trawl through things electronically.</p> <p>  Will the substitute consent be enough to satisfy the Commission?  Is that the Attorney General's advice?  Is that why we have decided to do this in primary legislation?</p> <p>  Returning to online public meetings, it is very clear in the Bill and the debate in the Seanad that the question is about the use of the word "or".  It is not online and a public meeting, and the change is permanent.  The Bill clearly says "or".  I understand the issue around the early pre-draft stages of the issues paper when it comes to a development plan.</p><p>I am also concerned about how the witnesses are speaking about public meetings and the driver of this change.  I was particularly concerned to hear the comment about cranks or people with vested interests attending public meetings.  I am concerned about the motivation for this change as opposed to the operation of it.</p><p> At the pre-draft stage, new issues are allowed to be introduced as part of the public consultation.  Executives and city and county managers are quick to quote legislation, the powers of same and what is required under that legislation.  This legislation references the term "online or".  I ask the witnesses to clarify if new issues can be introduced by people at the pre-draft stage of the development plan process.  Most of my amendments to a development plan were ruled out of order because they had not been introduced at the pre-draft or issue stages.  I would like clarification on that issue.</p><p> On the ban on evictions, my understanding from the witness's response to Senator Cummins's questions is that one disapplies the other in the case of a registration.  This is not actually a ban on evictions.  It is a dispute resolution mechanism to allow for address of disputes around arrears as opposed to it being a ban on evictions.  If that is the case, we should probably stop using the language of "ending a ban on evictions".</p></speech>

I will begin by finishing my response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question in terms of how exceptionality is considered.  It is set out in the existing provisions at section 177D(2), which states that in considering whether exceptional circumstances exist, the board shall have regard to (a) whether regularisation of the development concerned would circumvent the purpose and objectives of the environmental impact assessment directive or the habitats directive; (b) whether the applicant had or could reasonably have had a belief that the development was not unauthorised, which goes to the intent of the applicant; (c) whether the ability to carry out an assessment of the environmental aspects of the development for the purpose of an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment and to provide for public participation in such an assessment has been substantially impaired; (d) the actual or likely significant effects on the environment or adverse effects on the integrity of a European site resulting from the carrying out or continuation of the development; (e) the extent to which significant effects on the environment or adverse effects on the integrity of a European site can be remediated; (f) whether the applicant has complied with previous planning permissions granted or has previously carried out an unauthorised development; and (g) such matters as the board considers relevant.  Those considerations have been in existence since this legislation was first introduced in 2011 and they will continue in operation.</p> <p>  I have had a look back at my notes and I think I may have given an incorrect response earlier in regard to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question on public participation.  There is no public participation in the first stage.  The key change is the introduction of the exceptionality at the second stage where there is public participation.  It is important to make that clear.</p> <p>  On engagement with the Commission, we have been engaging with it on these changes.  It is important to note that European law is implemented at national level.  This change is further to a Supreme Court case and not a European Court of Justice case.  This is about the Irish national Supreme Court judgment and that court's interpretation of this legislation.  We are, through the Attorney General, responding to that judgment.  We are very aware of where it arose from, namely, the original Derrybrien judgment.  I am not sure if I have answered the Deputy's question.  We are very aware of the genesis of this process.  There have been numerous engagements with the Attorney General on this particular point.</p> <p>  Senator Moynihan asked if the substitute consent will be online.  The answer is "Yes".  It is addressed in one of the amendments we have proposed but I do not think it is referenced in the draft we sent last week.  It is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  In the version that comes through to the D&aacute;il there will be a proposal to mandate that these proposals be available online in addition to being available at the offices of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I think I have answered most of the questions.  With regard to the substitute consent element, I will pass over to my colleague, Mr. Lemass to respond further if Senator Moynihan is satisfied that I have answered all of her questions.</p></speech>

One of the reasons the public meeting format does not always work is because very often well engaged or well mobilised people who have an interest in land or a particular agenda may seek to dominate the process.  It is very useful to have other outlets and avenues such as online, as we propose.</p> <p>  There is also the fact that it is not a stage of the process where elected members' views are sought because they have a very particular role at the direction stage, which is the stage after that.  I do not see how raising or not raising any issues at this stage is relevant.  To be honest, for members of the public, for whom this stage is targeted, any valid issue can be raised but it is explicit in the legislation that zoning matters cannot be considered.  Unfortunately, that is not understood by a lot of people, including landowners who will often seek to pursue their aims at this stage. </p></speech>

It is clear that if they do not, if it has not been previously discussed or raised or raised by members, management rules it out of order.  Can new issues be introduced at the issues stage?  That is my understanding.  I do not think that the officials understand or know that is a thing.</p></speech>

I cannot comment on a specific post-draft situation where a plan is already under way and is in a process.  The elected members legislatively become involved in the process where they give direction to the executive but that happens after the report on public consultation.  It is a fairly broad and general stage of the process so it is generally possible to bring most things to bear at that point.</p></speech>

Part of the informing of this consideration was the need to balance rights; the fact that there are landlords experiencing financial hardship; there are 16,000 buy-to-let mortgages in arrears; and, frankly, the fact that the bar for the declaration is as high as for a tenant.  It is an offence for a landlord to make a false declaration and all of the same protections apply in that respect.</p></speech>

We all have a lot of responsibilities but even if we did not the timeframe is insufficient for us.  I appreciate the huge work that has gone into the legislation and appreciate the need for it.</p><p>On section 3 and code provisions, section 3(3) allows the Government very individual statutory prescribed timeframes and limits in something like the Planning Act.  What safeguards exist to ensure that when the Government does this that it will, as required by the Aarhus Convention, provide reasonable timeframes to ensure the provision of effective participation rights as well as wide access?  Given the practical obstacles the public will face during the pandemic, how can the provisions in section 3(3)(<i>b</i>), which allows a further variation in timeframes based on an administrative area such as the board or local authority, be justified given that people limited by a lockdown in one area may be impacted and have an interest in applications in another area?  In addition to the risk to participatory rights and hence the legality of decisions compromising clarity and certainty for all concerned, is there not a serious risk of confusion about what time limits pertain, where and when?</p><p> Second, what provisions are there to ensure really robust communications from the Government in order to make sure the public is properly apprised of what the timeframes are?  There should be more than just a notice on the website of the Department or a planning authority.</p><p> Third, what further requirements are there to ensure people can make electronic payments and submissions for all types of consents, including strategic infrastructure planning appeals and ordinary local authority decisions, for example?</p><p> Fourth, when will the file of the board be electronically available?  It is significant for anyone who is considering taking a judicial review.</p></speech>

On the issue of safeguards and timeframes, by its definition, the Bill extends existing timeframes.  The whole point of it is that if there is a set period, the Bill extends that period in parallel to the point that there is a new lockdown.  By definition, the extending period relates to the lockdown period.  Its very nature is to ensure that public consultation is preserved.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question on timeframes.</p> <p>  On the issue of the specificity of various areas, it is absolutely the case that confusion could arise.  As I stated, the provision was not just included to cater for situations where there is a prohibition on members of the public moving freely, there is also the potential of individual authority members being struck down by Covid infection such that they cannot comply with the process.  That is one example we would envisage.  For example, a planning authority may not be able to work through its statutory objectives because its members are infected or have to stay at home or whatever.  As members are aware, in the previous lockdown it was used for the entire country.  I would argue it worked well because it was widely known about by all elements of the planning sector.  We had wide engagement with environmental NGOs and through planning institutes and local authorities.  It was widely publicised not only on our own websites, but also through sectors that are involved in planning generally.  In terms of communication, we will be doing that again.  I do not know whether the Deputy is familiar with what happened on the last occasion.  We do have the good experience of having done this before.  Circulars were sent to all local authorities.  The main point of information was on our public website.  We have a large Covid section for members of the public.  Local authorities also took it upon themselves to put it on their websites.  In some cases, local authorities put notices on their doors.  Mr. Hogan and his team drafted frequently asked questions that were also put online.  To answer the Deputy's question, we will do what we did before, which is to ensure that as wide a populace as possible understands this issue.  The key point in terms of interaction with members of the public is that they are not being restricted.  Their engagement is being elongated.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about e-payments.  That is a different issue.  Other amendments to the planning Acts are being progressed in terms of e-planning.  That is coming in due course.  On e-payments, the whole point is that the Bill allows for the extension of the public participation period when there is a lockdown.  If a person needs to pay &euro;20 to lodge an objection but there is a lockdown, that period is extended such that they can do so when the lockdown ends.  I hope I am explaining it clearly.  I again point out that we used this process before.  All statutory provisions in the planning Acts were extended by eight weeks this year and that will work its way through the system.  It is widely known about by those involved and certainly by all the local authorities.  As I stated, the information is available on all the relevant websites, including local authority websites.  Does that answer all of the Deputy's questions?</p></speech>

The first concerns substitute consent.  How can we be 100% sure that in all cases, all the information the board will be considering on the issue of exceptional circumstances at the substantive stage will be available to the public so that it has an effective opportunity to comment on it, both for pending cases and when new consideration is to be undertaken?  I refer also to new cases where some of the information pertaining to exceptional circumstances may have been considered in the closed notice or leave stages, which are not open to the public.  Will that information be made available when the application is made?</p> <p>  Second, what will happen with substitute consent cases that went through under the old provisions which the Supreme Court has ruled against?  The judgment has implications for other gateways to substitute consent, such as section 177B.</p> <p>  Third, if substitute consent is granted under the Planning and Development Act 2000, what happens to the other assessments and conditions which may also be compromised under other sectoral environmental impact assessments?  These might also be required for development under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 or the Gas Act 1976.</p> <p>  Finally, does the wording "considering whether exceptional circumstances exist" in section 177D(2) conform to the high bar required by the European Court of Justice for regularising consents granted in breach of the EIA directive?</p></speech>

One concerns the balance of rights between the landlord and the tenant.  The second concerns the public consultation issue, which we have been discussing for the last while.  If the landlord and the tenant are both experiencing hardship, who loses out?  How is that determined?  Mr. Lemass gave an explanation when Senator John Cummins asked whether a tenancy is protected when a counter-declaration is made.  I understand that if a landlord makes a counter-declaration and then issues a notice of termination, it is up to the tenant to raise a dispute.  How is that determined?  If a tenant's rights are protected under legislation, how do we see him or her through this process?  It can become quite technical and cumbersome.</p> <p>  My second question concerns public consultation.  I do not believe there is anything sinister in this proposal.  I think it is a reaction to Covid-19 and the need for public safety.  However, in any situation we must avoid unintended consequences.  We do not want to give the impression, rightly or wrongly, that we are limiting public engagement or the autonomy of elected councillors.  It is quite clear from the contributions made today and in the previous debate in the Seanad that there are serious concerns around this.  We should reflect those concerns in the language.  A sunset clause should be attached to the either-or provision in this Bill.  That provision is there to get us through Covid-19.  When we are living in a Covid-free world - soon enough, please God - it should be allowed to lapse.  Failing that, we should add a caveat to make it clear that it is a decision presented by the executive and approved by the members of the council.  We should trust them to get this over the line and to determine what is in the best interests of their electorate and how best to consult them.  </p> <p>  A previous speaker noted that this is the only part of the public consultation process that is prescribed by legislation.  I worry that this might create a precedent for public consultation throughout the development plan.  Mr. Lemass and I worked on the development plan previously.  I know he would never do anything like that, and I am not suggesting that any county manager or executive would.  I simply want to make sure that no unintended consequences are hidden in the Bill.</p></speech>

She accurately summarised the operation of the declaration and the counter-declaration.  The Bill states that this part shall not apply to that.  In the event that a landlord proceeds with a termination, the tenant can raise a dispute.  As part of that process, the tenant can demonstrate that he or she has made a declaration and query the validity of the landlord's declaration.</p> <p>  Separate from the notice of termination, the tenant could take a dispute to the RTB claiming that his or her declaration is valid but the landlord's is not.</p></speech>

That is not, however, to prejudge any other protections from which the tenant might benefit through the normal notice of termination procedures, and the extended notice periods which have been provided in that regard.  If a tenant and a landlord are both in difficult circumstances, however, and the landlord makes a valid declaration, that counters the protection which a tenant may have sought through this particular provision.  It does not prejudice recourse to any other provision which the tenant may wish to avail of through the RTB.</p></speech>

It is important to understand that aspect, and that it remains in place, as does the facility for oral submissions on an individual meeting basis.  All we are saying is that, in taking those steps, there shall be at least a public or online meeting.  I reiterate, and this will be further set out in firm guidance, that generally a consultation procedure or programme is required at this point in the process.  It is the same in that regard as it is at a later stage, which is not set out in legislation but happens everywhere and always.  Not everything, therefore, must be set out to the nth degree in legislation, as long it is in the context of taking those necessary steps to consult the public.  That is what matters.</p></speech>

In 2016, some 470,000 people were renting.  On 23 November, there were 352,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  Why do the witnesses think that only 348 tenant declarations have been made?  Does someone whose income has been affected by Covid-19, and who can prove it, need to be in rent arrears to avail of a freeze on rent increases?  Must people in that situation consult with the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and follow the other steps?  Are we essentially forcing people into rent arrears and putting their tenancies at risk, when these provisions could instead be made available without those requirements?</p> <p>  The planning consultation provisions of the Bill are due to last until June 2021.  Why are the tenancy protections to end in April, and why is provision not given to the Minister to extend those protections, if necessary?  Why was the five-month exemption from rent arrears chosen?  How was this timeframe reached?  Unlike tenants, who must provide evidence of rent arrears, why are landlords automatically considered to be relevant persons if they are receiving any Covid-19-related social welfare payments?  Employers can also subsidise the EWSS up to people's full incomes, yet no provision deals with landlords receiving payment under this scheme, but who have suffered no loss of income.  </p> <p>  On the balancing of rights regarding a ban on evictions, I believe this Bill will give the landlord more rights than the tenant in respect of situations where the landlord is receiving any Covid-19-related payment.  This will deter tenants from making declarations, therefore, because they will feel that protections are not in place to support them.  Putting these provisions in for the landlord is, therefore, detrimental to tenants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.604" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Lemass" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120800002#R00800"><p>I will happily take the questions concerning tenancies, and my colleagues can address those on planning.  On the question regarding why there have been only 348 self-declarations by tenants, all I can tell the Deputy is that we asked, and funded, the RTB to write to all landlords and tenants to make them aware of these protections.</p><p>We sent out in the neighbourhood of 400,000 notices because there were 300,000 tenancies but about 100,000 landlords involved.  We wrote to all of the people involved to make them aware of these protections.  That is out there.  We publicise it quite heavily through the RTB, online and in the media but also by writing to registered tenants and landlords and making them aware of it.</p><p> The Deputy asked why more people are not availing of the protection.  I can only refer him back to the research the ESRI conducted for us in the middle of this year which pointed to the fact that the temporary payments, plus the decline in consumption patterns because of the lockdown, would have affected the build-up of arrears in the short term.  We then came out of lockdown but later went back into lockdown.  It is borne out by figures that suggest average national savings have gone up and people's wealth has gone up that little bit.  There may be something in all of that because the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and other payments are helping people get through this period.  I cannot say definitively.  I can only speculate based on that evidence.</p><p> As regards when the tenant can declare, this part applies to a situation where there is a significant risk of the tenancy of the dwelling being terminated by the landlord.  It is not any more specific than that.  It applies if a tenant feels at risk of arrears and at risk of a tenancy being terminated as a result of them.  The arrears may not have occurred yet but the tenant may know that in the weeks and months to come, because he or she is not working or because of certain financial challenges, he or she is at risk.  That is the situation.  It is a self-declaration but the person has to be accurate in what he or she says in the assessment and it is an offence to make a false declaration.  It is up to the tenant to make that declaration.</p><p> Regarding why tenants have to have recourse to MABS, the new provisions require them to request the RTB to facilitate engagement with MABS.  One of our concerns is that there were 348 declarations at the end of November but only seven people had recourse to MABS.  MABS is there to help people.  We want to be sure that people put together workable arrangements with landlords that will endure well beyond these protections.  Someone may have a problem now and may need protection until 11 January, or 12 April, as it is hoped the date will soon be, but that will not be long coming around.  We are keen for people to engage with MABS so they can put in place longer term and more sustainable arrangements.</p><p> The Deputy asked about landlords who might have no loss of income and landlords in receipt of the PUP.  If a tenant feels that a landlord's declaration is unfair and the landlord is proceeding to terminate the tenancy, the tenant can raise a dispute.</p></speech>

To clarify, the question is about landlords who are in receipt of full income and can still terminate the tenancy.  How is the tenant to know if the landlord is in receipt of full income?  All the tenant will know is that the landlord is in receipt of a payment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-08a.607" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Lemass" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120800002#S00300"><p>If the landlord tries to terminate the tenancy, the tenant can raise a dispute.  In such a dispute, tenants can say they made a declaration to get protections and their landlord countered on the basis of hardship, but they can point to evidence that the landlord is not suffering hardship.  The RTB can request data from the landlord in these circumstances.  I direct the Deputy to the judgment of the RTB in one of the Tyrrelstown cases where it overruled an eviction because it was able to demonstrate that the landlord was still in receipt of rent and would not, therefore, be suffering hardship.  We have consulted the RTB on these protections and they are intended precisely for situations like the Tyrrelstown case where the landlord was prevented from proceeding with the termination because it was demonstrated that the landlord had adequate income and was not suffering the hardship claimed in the declaration.  That is on the record of the RTB as a judgment in the case of what is known as the Tyrrelstown amendment.  We envisage a similar approach here.  If a dispute is raised and the landlord claims hardship, he or she has to demonstrate that hardship.  The bar is quite high for the landlord in that regard.</p></speech>

Why was 1 August chosen rather than 1 April?  People might have been in receipt of the PUP between April and August and built up arrears but are not now covered by the Bill.</p><p> The question of why landlords and tenants were covered by the same penalty for false declarations has been covered.</p><p> The five-day period in which the tenant must respond to a notice to quit is far too short.  Then they are expected to notify the RTB and pass on the data to MABS.  I imagine there are general data protection regulation, GDPR, issues on this and I query that measure.  Has there been consultation with MABS about the additional work it would be required to undertake?  MABS is already very oversubscribed.</p><p> There is an attempt to balance landlord and tenant rights.  I would accept that if there was more work around tenants' rights, but the Bill's purpose is about preventing people from having to move during periods of restriction.  I cannot visit my mother in her home today.  That is the environment we are in.  It is not a project about balancing landlord and tenant rights.  We really have not thought out the details of some of the requirements.  Take the expected enactment of legislation on 19 December.  The RTB will write to all those impacted to alert them of their need to lodge an application with the RTB and then MABS, which they must do in five days.  This would mean the RTB sending letters to tenants between 19 December and Christmas Eve.  That is bizarre timing, if nothing else.</p><p> Actions are to be taken within five days of the commencement of the Bill on 11 January, that is 16 January, is a short period.  Most places reopen on 2 or 3 January.  It gives a very short time for people who have previously applied for an exemption and who might get a letter from the RTB before Christmas telling them to contact the RTB and apply to MABS by 16 January.  The timing has not been thought out.</p><p> I am very concerned by the answers given to Senator Cummins about the measures being disapplied.  The Bill is about giving tenants certainty that they will not have to move around during periods of restriction.  It appears that certainty can be extinguished simply by a landlord making an application.  If a landlord makes a submission to the effect that the rent is his or her sole income, then the tenant no longer has the certainty that he or she cannot be evicted.  I accept that other recourse is given under the normal notice period, but the main provision there is time.  There are no additional rights.</p><p> I have no issue with the balancing landlord and tenant rights but that is a longer term project and what is needed here is certainty for tenants.  The five-day period is too short, as are the timelines for the Christmas period, which do not take account of the holiday season.  Data transparency is an issue.  Where a tenant fails to provide the RTB and MABS with the required information and the landlord submits that is the case, then the new protections disapplies.  How does the landlord know?  This Bill is trying to do things that are part of a bigger project.  It will have to be amended.  I am the third Government representative to express concern about the Bill and I expect other committee members will be louder.</p></speech>

The previous Residential and Tenancies Valuation Act 2020 looked back to 30 March.  The view is that that Act protected people who were in receipt of payments during that period.</p><p>A person in receipt of payments between March and August and beyond until 11 January is covered by the Residential and Tenancies Valuation Act 2020 and can still make a declaration today and up to 10 January under that Act.  That Act came into effect on 1 August so that is the timeframe we are looking back to in this regard because the previous period was covered by the Residential Tenancies Board.  That is the logic behind the timing.</p><p> On the five days to respond requirement, when a declaration is made there are two actions, namely, a declaration is made to the RTB and also a request to the RTB to put the person in touch with MABS.  This happens immediately.  The RTB on receipt of the declaration puts the applicant in touch with MABS.  Separately, the board requests that the applicant engage with the landlord within five days to consult on an arrangement.  The purpose of this is to put an obligation on people to make that happen.  It is not that the agreement has to happen within the five days but a person must engage within five days.  Part of the concern is that with 348 declarations we have only had recourse to seven people going to MABS.  There is an uncertainty as to what others are doing.  We do not know if they have reached agreement or not.  The GDPR issues will be addressed because the applicant, as the tenant, makes the request.  I think that is correct but I will double check it.</p><p> On the issue of additional work for MABS, in the context of the overall numbers presenting at the moment, we do not believe this is an issue.  We consulted with the Department of Social Protection at the time of the original Act.  We do not believe that additional work is an issue.  There is an important point that I would like to make.  The genesis of this amendment is not public health.  The genesis of it is the economic fall-out as a consequence of public health.  It is for this reason the interests of the landlord have are being given a weighting.  </p></speech>

The legislation enacted in August last, known as the Residential Tenancies Act 2020, provides separate protections.  Anyone in a situation where their movement is restricted by 5 km cannot be evicted from their tenancy.  This applies any time that restriction is in place.  If that restriction was reintroduced tomorrow there would be a moratorium on evictions for everyone for that period of time.  The two provisions exist in parallel.  This is purely an economic fall-out as distinct from the public health one.</p> <p>  On the point regarding 19 December, because we know there are 348 applications, assuming this legislation passes through the Houses the RTB will write to those 348 applicants.  As things stand, they are protected until 11 January based on the declaration they have made under the Residential Tenancies Act, which was enacted last July.  It is in regard to post 11 January we want to ensure they are protected.  They do not need to make a declaration but they do need to engage regarding an arrangement with their landlord and MABS protection.  They do not need to do that if they have already done so.  If they have already engaged with their landlord and they have an agreement and it is working there is a disapplication process for those particular requirements.  </p> <p>  The Deputy also asked what happens where the landlord can demonstrate that the tenant has not provided the required information.  In reality, that type of situation would only be exposed at dispute stage.  The dispute is raised if a landlord takes a case because the tenant has not provided the required information and, therefore, is in breach of his or her part of the declaration.</p></speech>

It should be remembered that a declaration from a landlord to a tenant and<i>vice versa</i>in and of itself does not terminate a tenancy.</p><p>That simply tries to avail of protections, and then it disapplies that attempt because the landlord is in hardship or whatever it may be.  Separately, the landlord will then have to go through a process to terminate the tenancy, and as part of that process, the tenant could legitimately put their hand up and seek to raise a dispute, claiming that despite a declaration being made which was countered by the landlord, they do not believe that the landlord meets the requirements for his or her half of the declaration.</p></speech>

I know many good tenants and landlords, and also some rogue tenants and landlords.  When the level 5 restrictions were put in place, it was announced that there would be a rent freeze.  Some people thought, on the basis of the information that went out there, that they did not have to pay rent during this period, and subsequently got themselves into difficulty.  Currently, if notice is given for a tenant to leave a property, they have five days from that date in which to raise a dispute.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

If a landlord serves a notice of termination, the tenant has the full duration of the notice period in which to raise a dispute, whatever the duration of that period, and it could be as much as 224 days.  Indeed, the use of notices of termination was suspended during lockdown.  So, the tenant has the duration of that full notice period in which to raise a dispute.</p></speech>

The intention of this legislation is that a tenant should be able to declare that they are at risk of having their lease terminated.  If they make that declaration - it is not a dispute; it is just a declaration at that point - they must contact the landlord within the five-day time period and request that some arrangement is worked out.  That is the five-day period to which I have referred.  The arrangement can happen thereafter.</p></speech>

It has often happened that two or three weeks have passed before someone has been able to meet with them.  In different counties, MABS is under different pressures.  This is where I am going with my question.  Mr. Lemass mentioned that only seven tenants have been referred to MABS.  I refer people to MABS on a weekly basis, and it could take two or three weeks for them to get a meeting, with the process in place.  MABS does fantastic work, but the problem is that people are waiting two or three weeks at the moment to get a meeting, and more people will be using MABS under the protections provided in this legislation.  It is going to put more pressure on MABS, particularly when it comes to getting the information back to tenants in the case of a dispute.  Again, it comes back to the rental issue that we have here.  What supports are available for MABS?  I believe that there is going to be a bigger uptake in this regard as we go forward, because we have not got to the end what is happening at the moment.  This legislation is going to open the floodgates and more people will be going to MABS.  There is a lack of understanding on the part of tenants of where they can go for help and what they have to do.  It will put more pressure on organisations such as MABS.  I want to know what support is going to be there for the likes of MABS, to help both tenants and landlords so that this issue can be resolved.</p></speech>

Both the Department and MABS were very supportive of this and the ongoing engagement between them.  The RTB has a memorandum of understanding with MABS, so it is a managed process.  I accept the Deputy's point that there may be a two to three week delay, which may not be unreasonable in some circumstances.  However, the point of this legislation is that a tenant would have to contact the landlord with a view to working out an arrangement.  As part of that contact, it would be entirely reasonable for the tenant to say that he or she is engaging with MABS as part of that process, and that he or she will conclude the arrangement with the landlord after he or she has engaged with MABS.  MABS could point a tenant in this situation towards rent supplements, for example, and uptake in this support has increased by around 10,000 - I do not have the exact figure, but it is of that order - since the Covid pandemic began.</p></speech>

I have been told by MABS that in the past two to three weeks, there has been an increase in the number of people contacting it, because of the misinterpretation of the information issued to tenants in respect of a rent freeze.  Now that we have moved to level 3 restrictions and people are going back to work, they have realised that they have made a mistake and they have a problem.  MABS has told me - and I have found the same in my office - that it is getting three or four cases a week, when it was previously getting one, so the pressure is starting to build up.  I am sure Mr. Lemass's statistics are correct, but I am talking about the here and now, and I know that people are contacting MABS more frequently.  There are people who are only now realising that they are in difficulty.</p></speech>

On the public consultation, it should be noted that public participation and attendance feature in all stages of county development plan sessions in local authority chambers and in submissions, and access is available online.  I have always defended the importance of public access and participation in respect of all planning matters.  The greater the public participation, the greater the likelihood that the outcome from that process is going to be more acceptable and better for all involved.  It does not unduly concern me that a public meeting may now be online or in a town hall, church hall, or wherever it may be.  In fact, I know from working with my own forward planning section in Wicklow, that it may now be possible to have four public meetings in one day, whereas before, it may have taken a week for planners to do this.  Therefore, we must consider the balance between the positives it brings and the perceptions of the negatives it brings, including that some people may not have access to online meetings, although I believe Internet access has improved during lockdown.</p> <p>  Mr. Hogan referred to the guidelines for local authorities in development plan processes.  Will that also include guidance on how to conduct a public meeting, and will the facilities, the technical resources and supports be there for local authorities to embrace this straight away?  In general, the move to e-planning is a very positive one, because the planning and development consent processes generate so much paperwork and many files.  The online and e-planning approach is the way to go, provided that each local authority can provide the same standard.  On some local authority websites, the planning system is very hard to navigate, whereas with others, it is much easier to read, and some people prefer to have those paper files in their hands.  Will the guidelines for the local authorities cover the public meeting at the issue stage of the development plan process?</p></speech>

We have never characterised this as being about officials' or planners' time.</p><p>There is a reality where it can be far more efficient to allow online meetings as well as in-person ones.  It takes the pressure off having to exclusively have meetings in person.  It is very difficult at times when there is an event on.  Often, people have asked me if I did not know there was a match on the night of a meeting, which might seem like a very small thing but can happen regularly on a Tuesday or Wednesday night when one is trying to hold consultation meetings.  It can be very disheartening for people who turn up and find there are very few people there to discuss the issues.  We think the "either or" option is a good idea.  It does not limit it to one or the other.  It does not make that leap from the current system to e-planning without considering the ability to do both.  We will encourage that in the guidance we prepare. </p></speech>

Can local authorities make requests as regards the decision to set the extended timeframes for statutory processes in the planning process?  The Government will decide on extending statutory timeframes.  However, if many of the planners in a local authority came down with Covid, as in a situation that was described to me, how would that local authority proceed?  Would it apply to the Government or the Department for that?</p></speech>

The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage initiates the process.  As he is the line Minister for local authorities, they can engage through him.  That is how we envisage it happening but it is ultimately a decision of the Government.  The local authorities would not engage with the Government.  They would engage with the Minister and the Minister would then have to make a case and there is lots of oversight in the steps.  He would have to engage with both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and then make the recommendation to the Government.  It would then have to decide whether to do it on every individual order.  The answer to the Chairman's question is "Yes".  If a local authority wants to engage with the Minister, that is how it would happen.  The previous lockdown was a reaction to the initial health restrictions that were issued.  We have specifically put in the flexibility to allow for that and it is clearly stated that if there were an issue with a specific local authority or building control authority, they could bring it to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

All the information will be available online and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is the competent authority, will have it so even if a person was not involved before he or she can get involved at the second stage.  It is akin to a request for further information.  When applications are in planning or when there is a new public notice up, anybody can come along and participate.  It is not only those who were involved previously.  It is as wide a net as possible.</p></speech>

I am repeating some questions but during Covid, planners were working from home and local authorities were told to keep as few people as possible in buildings.  That was part of what Covid was but it had a huge knock-on effect on pre-planning meetings and people going in to local authorities to get information.  That is a huge issue, even for development plans.  In Carlow, our development plan will be extended to the middle of next year or longer.  There are major issues with communication but also with going in for pre-planning or to talk about a development plan.  These are life-changing issues.  Local authorities are dealing with people's livelihoods, whether through businesses or housing or so on.  It is so important that we get this right and I have a huge fear about going online.  Many people I know, particularly elderly people, do not want to do online meetings.  We should not be encouraging that.</p><p>It important to sit in front of a planner or someone in a local authority to get information, whether about a development plan or a house someone is building.  We need to look at that and we should not encourage online meetings.  I am not a firm believer in those.</p><p> I want to talk about the issue of landlords and tenants.  Like previous speakers, I work very closely with MABS.  We have an excellent MABS branch in Carlow, as well as the RTB, to which the witnesses say they give funding.  There, again, is another issue.  Many of the staff, in fairness, are working from home due to Covid and they are doing their best.  They are excellent.  I could not fault any of the staff.  Is there an issue with information coming from the Department and letting tenants know their rights?  I think there is.  I am concerned that there have only been seven referrals to MABS.  That is a worry and a concern in the sense that we need to make sure tenants know their entitlements.  As regards the five days' notice, it is coming up to Christmas and local authorities, MABS and the RTB will be closed.  I always find, as I am sure others do too, that when something happens it always happens around Christmas and it is so hard to contact someone about it.  We need to be very aware of giving timescales and a date for people.  The Department needs to look at that.</p><p> Is there a ban on evictions for local authorities?  This issue came to my attention recently.  I am sure there is when we are in a situation with Covid-19 but it is something with which I was dealing and it is important that local authority tenants know that too.  It has not been communicated.  It is so important that there is information and awareness and we work through MABS, the RTB and our local authorities, which are all under pressure with Covid-19 and trying to do their best.  We need to make sure we get this right because it is so important.  There is such a short timescale for this and it would make a huge difference.  I have repeated some of the questions but I just wanted to thank the witnesses. </p></speech>

I should have made the point that the seven referrals to MABS were via the RTB.  Deputy O'Donoghue made the legitimate point earlier that people might have gone to MABS of their own volition or were referred by others.  I cannot say definitively but under the new legislation, in order to avail of the protections, tenants will be obliged to go through the RTB to get to MABS so we will know exactly what the numbers are at that time.  That might help with the demand planning-----</p></speech>

I am sorry to cut in but people in every organisation are put to the pin of their collar and the RTB and MABS will play a huge part in this.  We have to make sure there are enough staff and funding.  The Department gave funding to the RTB but it is important that MABS, which does an excellent job, is also resourced and staffed.</p></speech>

The numbers thus far have been on the low side.  We will, of course, monitor them and we will know more because every single declaration will have to have a referral to MABS.  We will know exactly what the number is.</p> <p>  I will look into the question of RTB access over the Christmas period.</p> <p>  As regards local authority bans on evictions, we send out a circular around lockdowns to encourage local authorities to exercise forbearance and a similar approach is taken-----</p></speech>

How are we deciding which of those cases wins out?</p></speech>

The landlord also has to act in a bona fide way and if he or she just got a few weeks of PUP I do not think that would stack up.</p><p>I could not adjudicate on that.  It would only come to an adjudication in the context of a dispute over a termination, where I believe the board would be very well placed to make a judgment on that.</p></speech>

Our difficulty is that we must table amendments at 11 a.m. on Thursday and we have not yet seen the final text of the Department's amendments because it has not been published.  We will have to consider amending things that have yet to be published.  Without in any way wanting to burden the witnesses with unnecessary work if, through our Chairman, there was a small number of specific questions we wanted written clarification on, could we submit them to the officials by the end of business today with an expectation they would endeavour to give us a response tomorrow?  Can the officials also tell us when they expect the publication of their final substitute consent amendments?</p></speech>

I understand that it is very technical and I more than happy to answer questions on it.  We are engaging and ultimately it is the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that are finalising it at the moment.  We understand they would normally tend to use the same deadline.  I believe they are also proposing to submit on Thursday.  That is my understanding.</p></speech>

Other than us giving an opinion on it while on Second Stage, Members of the D&aacute;il will have no ability to seek to amend any of that because of the way this is being set up.
