He is joined by Ms Mahin Fitzpatrick, senior auditor.  We will meet the Revenue Commissioners today and a number of chapters in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General relate to Revenue.  We will also have a private meeting in the afternoon.  I suggest, therefore, that for reasons of time we confine our discussion on the business of the committee to one hour.  We will go as far as we can and commence our meeting with the Revenue at 10 a.m.  That is agreed.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputies Pat Deering and Peter Burke.  I will hold over the minutes of the previous meeting for the moment.  Arising from the previous meeting, the clerk will circulate wording tomorrow, for consideration next week, regarding our recommendation for a D&aacute;il debate on the winding down of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  We agreed last week that there should be a D&aacute;il debate on the issue but we have to table a formal motion, which must be circulated to members for their consideration in advance before it can be agreed.  We can agree the motion for a D&aacute;il debate on NAMA's expected surplus next week.</p> <p>  No. 3 is correspondence.  The first category is category A, briefing documents and the opening statement for today's meeting.  No. 1709A is from Mr. Niall Cody and encloses a briefing document.  No. 1723A is the opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish these documents.</p> <p>  The next category of correspondence is category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers in follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and other correspondence for publishing.  We will hold over a number of matters from the previous meeting.  We got through a significant number of items last week.  I hope we will deal with all of them next week.</p> <p>  No. 1677B is from Chief Superintendent Dermot Mann of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is dated 31 October 2018.  It provides information requested by the committee on the operation of CCTV by local authorities.  It sets out the relevant legislation and statutory instruments and refers to the CCTV advisory committee and community CCTV schemes.  I know of a number of local authorities where CCTV schemes have not yet been finalised.  Given that the letter will be of interest to many people, we will note and publish it.</p> <p>  No. 1693B is from Ms Orlaith McBride, director of the Arts Council, dated 1 November 2018, enclosing an information note requested by the committee providing details in respect of matters raised in the audit opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the 2017 financial statements.  Significant issues arise in this regard and the one which attracted our attention in the first instance was the circumstances that gave rise to &euro;196,000 in funding being provided to an outside agency that went into liquidation.  The Arts Council has provided a detailed and comprehensive response.  I note that it dealt with the organisation in question, Filmbase, for 30 years.  We can understand, therefore, why the money continued to be paid each year.  The council did not get the audited accounts it sought for 2016.  It wanted the matter examined by its internal auditors but shortly afterwards Filmbase into liquidation.  The Arts Council is dealing with the liquidator to try to recover the moneys but it is listed as a trade creditor.  It made payments to some of those who should have been paid by Filmbase to avoid them being left high and dry.  It is doing all it can at this stage to recover the money.  When dealing with liquidators, people have to wait and see, as we all know.</p> <p>  No. 1698B is from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General of the Department of Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht, dated 6 November 2018, providing details requested by the committee on the performance delivery agreement between the Department and Galway 2020.  I propose we note and publish that correspondence.</p></speech>

We will place it in the public arena, rather than sitting on it, in order that people can see the significant costs involved.</p> <p>  No. 1703B is from Mr. Paul Dunne, CEO of the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, dated 2 November 2018 in respect of a request from the committee for a copy of a report arising from a value for money review of Irish Public Bodies, IPB, insurance.  Mr. Dunne advises that the report is subject to a non-disclosure agreement between the LGMA, Irish Public Bodies and PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, dated 2 September 2015.  Mr Dunne has written to IPB and PwC to request their consent for the LGMA to release the report to the committee and is waiting for a response.  It is important to point out that this was a report on insurance claims.  It became clear during our discussion with the State Claims Agency that the section 38 organisations come under the State Claims Agency and account for between &euro;3 billion and &euro;4 billion of activity each year.  I asked whether the local authorities could come within the remit of the State Claims Agency.  The local authorities currently obtain cover through IPB insurance and we asked for a copy of the value for money report.  We have been told it is very difficult to obtain a copy.  In addition, Mr. Dunne of the LGMA confirms that "there are currently legal proceedings in being in relation to the release of the Report bearing Reference - High Court Record No. 2017 /321MCA."  In addition, he notes that the case "is an appeal by IPB of a decision of the Information Commissioner with regard to the release of the Report under the Freedom of Information Act, 2014."</p><p>The Information Commissioner has said that this is to be released but Irish Public Bodies has gone to the High Court to prevent it.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I will watch this closely but the proper procedure is that, if the report has been carried out on the question of public bodies, which are funded substantially by a Vote of the Oireachtas even if they are not directly accountable to this Oireachtas, having insurance policies for claims made against them by members of the public, it should be published.  It is very disappointing to hear that Irish Public Bodies is going to the High Court to prevent such an important report being published when the Information Commissioner has said it should be published.  We will come back to this because there is a big insurance issue here.  We are also dealing with matters relating to the State Claims Agency.  Claims to local authorities might not specifically be under our remit but they are in the same space as far as the public are concerned.  It is disappointing that IPB is trying to block the release of this report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018111500002#C00200"><p>There is a cost associated with doing it too, in the form of legal costs at High Court level.  Different arms of the State are doing different things.  There is supposed to be an open Government approach which, in theory, would give a much clearer view of how decisions are made and should reduce the need for freedom of information requests, as well as the costs of administration and other things.  However, this approach does not seem to have permeated some arms of the State.  Its building on Usher's Quay is called Local Government House but the Local Government Management Agency seems to have an enclosed mindset, even in the context of engaging with us as we saw last week.</p></speech>

I will say something on behalf of the public.  We all talk about joined-up Government and this is an example of the issues.  Local government is seen as the local arm of the Government and if local governments go to the High Court to prevent the release of information they are preventing the release of information to other public bodies.  People can make multiple claims against different local authorities and State bodies and it is not in the public interest when people make sure that information is not shared.  There should be some information relating to the total number of claims against all State bodies.  People need to know because it involves billions of euro in liabilities.</p></speech>

Correspondence No. 1722, dated 13 November and which was received yesterday, is related and provides a copy of an internal report on the acquisition of Miesian Plaza on Baggot Street, which is the headquarters of the Department of Health.  There is an amount of documentation in both items and I propose to note and publish them.  There is a lot in them, much of which is technical, with one document of 204 pages.</p></speech>

There is a large amount of documentation on the agreement by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to proceed on the basis of value for money.  There is a valuation report from Jones Lang LaSalle, dated 31 March, which looked at the Central Bank complex on Dame Street, which we also inquired about.  There is also an appendix on rents and comparable lettings.  We have correspondence from a former valuer of the OPW, whom we will meet in due course and we will include this in the items of correspondence for that day.  There is no need for us to get into the specifics of these detailed reports at this stage, though I wish to highlight one item.</p> <p>  No. 1704B includes a chronological note from the OPW relating to the Eyre Square building and on the 50 flood protection schemes under CFRAM.  It also gave us a report on arbitration and a historical breakdown of the proportion of leased versus owned office accommodation.  In 2009, 51% of its overall portfolio was leased and 49% owned but in 2015 44%  was leased versus 56% owned, so the office has been in a position to let go of some of its leased buildings over a period of time.  This is on page 12 of the document, if members want to have a look at it.</p> <p>  Finally, No. 1704(xvi) is a letter with 17 or 18 appendices about the national children's science museum, which is an issue nobody had really heard of.  There is a detailed briefing note on that scheme and a three-page document.  It seems to be an orphan project and no Department seems to want to own it.</p><p>The last sentence states:</p><blockquote>The Chairman [that is obviously of ICML, the organisation involved in this]  believes that the relationship between the State and the ICML requires [further] redefinition, taking guidance from the views of the current Government.  In what might prove to be a positive development, the promoters have now indicated that they would be prepared to transfer the project to full State ownership on completion.</blockquote><p>That is a little step in the right direction because the matter had been bogged down in terms of the ownership and management of it.  We will certainly note and publish that because most other capital cities have a children's science museum and we should have one.  Perhaps there has been some progress in that regard.  We will note and publish it and if anyone wants to come back to it at a later do, they may do so.<br/><br/>The next item is 1705B<b></b>from Ms Pamela Carter, parliamentary affairs division, Department of Health, responding to the following matters raised at our meeting last week: CervicalCheck helpline; and terms of reference of the expert group on tort and management of clinical negligence claims.  We will note and publish that, but hold it over.  I am sure we will come back to the clinical negligence issue because of the State Claims Agency, and also, in due course, the CervicalCheck issue.</p></speech>

I have had contact, as I am sure have other members, with people following the meeting last week about other strands of liability.  A broad range of issues make up that liability and we almost have to decouple them from where the liability lies if we are to get to an approach that involves a different system.  Despite what the State Claims Agency says, one has to go legal.  What we heard about the way claims occur nearly always has to be legal.  It is not about mediation in the way we understand mediation.  If a couple are getting divorced, the two parties sit in different rooms with another person to try to work things out, and they never end up anywhere near the court.  That is now how it is in this case; one almost has to make a statement of claim.  We will never get beyond that to a different system unless the system itself is challenged.  That is not to say that the State Claims Agency should not robustly go through claims.  Obviously, people will make claims that are overstated and so on but I do not believe we have got to the point where we are looking at the process in the kind of detail necessary to address that.</p> <p>  On the second issue, CervicalCheck, we were spun a yarn last week about the length of time it is taking to release the slides.  I continue to have conversations with seven families and a solicitor on the practical side of things.  I restate that people are waiting for slides from April, May and June, which are not being released.  We were told that the average waiting time was 22 weeks but that is a fib, and we should not accept that from the HSE.</p></speech>

The reason that is occurring is because people have not been able to get their slides to make a judgment call as to whether they will sign up.  The release of the slides is an impediment to a range of different aspects.  We are being told certain points that do not match with the experience of people who have had a failure on the State side in terms of the way information was relayed to them, at the very least.</p></speech>

We will request the figure per month in terms of when the requests started, from October going back to March.  We need to find out the number still outstanding from last April, May, June and so on and if they do not know it, that says it all.  They should be able to give that information promptly.</p></speech>

They may be measuring two different things.  An approach may have been made in April or May but, in clarifying the information the applicant needed to supply, they were not in a position to supply the slides until they got all the information.  It may be down to a definition of what is being measured that may be the explanation.  I understand the difficulty.  If somebody makes a request, that should be the starting point of the clock.  That would be my argument.</p></speech>

For example, one of the solicitors involved told me that Quest Diagnostics had been releasing the slides in June and July but it was told to cease releasing them until a protocol was put in place.  That was put in place in August.  I accept there needs to be security around the slides-----</p></speech>

It is tying this up in a hugely administrative approach.  I do not believe any of us expected that releasing slides to 221 individuals or families would be tied up in that.

We have begun to break it down and we asked for very detailed specific information, not down to identifying people.  Quite a bit of information will come to us, more than anybody in the public arena has seen previously, which is very important.  That is an issue to which we will certainly return and deal with in depth.</p><p>The next item is 1706B<b></b>from Mr. Paddy O'Keeffe, Tax Appeals Commission, dated 7 November 2018, providing an update requested by the committee on high value appeals.  We mentioned the large number of high value appeals.  If people want to raise it with the Revenue witnesses today, they are free to do so.  We will note and publish that.</p><p>No. 1707B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell, dated 8 November 2018, providing a briefing note in regard to circulars in the context of the regularisation process provided for in a HSE circular regarding the regularisation of acting posts in conjunction with the new arrangements for the filling of short-term posts and the reintroduction of senior staff nurse positions.  Essentially, some people felt that while the HSE said it sent out the circular and the information to the different heads of the organisation, many people on the ground are saying that it never worked its way down to that level.  This letter makes that clear and we note and publish this and send it back to the correspondent who raised this matter with us in the first place and to let staff who are still aggrieved in relation to the process know that there is no cost to putting in a claim and there is a grievance procedure in this matter which is outlined in section 4 of that briefing note.<br/><br/>No. 1711B is from Ms Mary Lawlor, communications and public affairs manager with NAMA, providing further details requested by the committee on Project Nantes.  I propose we send a copy of this to Deputy Wallace who raised the matter and on whose suggestion I also raised the matter here.  I will read that letter because it is interesting and gives a broader perspective on the matter.  I will skip a sentence or two because it is so big but because of the amount of money involved and the controversy I will respond on this because there was an article on this issue in the Sunday newspapers as well.  The letter reads as follows:</p><blockquote>I refer to your letter dated 23 October 2018 in which you requested additional information regarding Project Nantes.<br /><br />As regards the first and second queries raised in the letter, NAMA wishes to point out that Project Nantes was only one of a number of separate transactions involving the debtor connection.  Overall, the connection&rsquo;s par debt was &euro;489 million on acquisition by NAMA.  This included some &euro;260 million of debt categorised as equity-backed loans which had been advanced to the connection by the participating institutions i.e. these loans were secured not by property collateral but by intangible assets (such as personal guarantees) which had no tangible value.  NAMA did not pay the participating institutions any consideration for these &euro;260 million equity-backed loans.  Thus, only &euro;229 million of the &euro;489 million par debt acquired was secured by tangible property assets with a realisable market value.</blockquote><p>That is important because it means that in relation to this particular person, the amount of loans that NAMA took over was &euro;489 million - &euro;229 million of that amount was secured by property and the other &euro;260 million was only secured by way of a personal guarantee and because the personal guarantee was not tangible, NAMA paid zero for that &euro;260 million.  It is important to put it out there that NAMA did not pay for a considerable amount of the &euro;489 million because it only effectively paid for a portion of the &euro;229 million.  That said, the taxpayer was caught in the hoop for all of it because we bailed out the banks for the shortfall.  NAMA might say that its side of it is clear but the taxpayer was caught for 100% of that unsecured loan because the banks had to receive funding as a result of that.  The letter continues with the following:</p><blockquote>The debtor connection agreed to initiate a programme of asset sales and debt refinancing so as to maximise recovery for NAMA ... Ultimately, total proceeds of approximately &euro;200 million were realised from loan, property and other loan security realisations.  As part of the disposal programme, a loan sale of debt with a par value of &euro;352 million, designated Project Nantes, realised proceeds of &euro;26.6 million.  This transaction included &euro;241 million (&euro;260 million at acquisition) in equity-backed loans (for which NAMA had not paid consideration) and &euro;111 million par debt secured by assets.  Therefore, the &euro;26.6 million realised for Project Nantes related to par debt loans of &euro;111 million (part of the original acquired property-secured par debt of &euro;229 million).<br /><br />Thus, in total, proceeds of approximately &euro;200 million were realised from the asset sales and loan sale/refinancing, equating to a recovery of 87% of the original acquired property-secured par debt of &euro;229 million. The proceeds realised were well in excess of the recovery target set by NAMA for the connection and the acquisition value paid by NAMA to the participating institutions.<br /><br />As regards the third query raised in the Committee&rsquo;s letter, I can advise that NAMA has been investigating this matter.  As part of this, NAMA undertook a review of the written confirmations and warranties in respect of section 172(3) of the NAMA Act 2009, which were provided by the borrowers and purchaser at the time of the loan sale in 2012.  These confirm that the borrower and purchaser were compliant with the requirements of section 172(3) of the NAMA Act 2009.  Following enquiries raised by NAMA, it has been established that the party who has been identified as a director of the purchaser entity was not a NAMA debtor.</blockquote><p>Maybe there was another connection with a NAMA debtor but the letter says that the person was not a NAMA debtor so there is wiggle room there.  The letter continues with the following:</p><blockquote>NAMA wishes to be helpful to the Committee but is required by law to operate by reference to the prohibitions on disclosure of confidential debtor information.</blockquote><p>Essentially it cannot say more.  There is some information there but there is still some wiggle room in there.  Some people are interested in that and I read it into the record because it is big money, it is a matter people are concerned about and it has attracted much public comment.<br/><br/>We note and publish that letter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

We are not here to go through something minutely to try to find details.  The onus is on every organisation that comes in here to disclose to us that everything has been done properly.  It is being pushed the other way.</p></speech>

However, what we are asking is not an unreasonable question.  The Deputy is right.  We could have just noted and published it and moved on.  Serious issues are raised and people feel that we should follow matters through and of course we do so we will go back and ask for further clarification of that.</p></speech>

That is a bit like Revenue saying it is a self assessment system but that there is no audit in place.</p></speech>

We said that it was a concern that it was taking assurances at face value.  The same discussion can be had with Revenue.  That creates a significant declaration and it is a legally important declaration.  It is a control process that is not insignificant but verification or standing up of matters is obviously important.</p></speech>

While there is a prohibition on the disclosure of information under section 202, it is important that the committee note that subsection (5) reads: "Nothing in subsection (2) prevents the disclosure of information ... in the course of giving evidence before a House of the Oireachtas or a Committee of either or both such Houses".

We are not legal experts.  We cannot be expected to know the subsections of section 202.  I thank Mr. McCarthy for highlighting it.  How could we be expected to know the full details of that?  We will revert to NAMA on that basis.  We will note and publish the correspondence but will follow up on it.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1714 B from Dr. Des Fitzgerald, president of the University of Limerick, UL, providing an update on steps taken by him to ensure the conclusions of the Thorn report are fully and swiftly implemented.  Dr. Fitzgerald states that there is a sharp focus on ensuring that matters are dealt with fully and finally to restore the reputation of the university.</p> <p>  I will make a remark once we put the letter on screen.  There are multiple pages to it and I do not have the relevant part to hand.  The issue I wish to refer to is on page 3, step No. 8.  It reads: "At a hearing of the PAC, in the press and in communications to UL staff, I apologised on behalf of the university to the regulatory bodies, to current and former employees and to the people of the Mid West for what was revealed in the Thorn Reports."  It is all well and good apologising to staff and former staff, but what is the current position?  Saying "I am sorry" is fine, but has anything been done in practice?  I want to know the current status of the staff to which Dr. Fitzgerald referred.  They may have been whistleblowers.  Without identifying them by name, we need a note on their current employment status and how that apology was given practical effect.  If it has not been given proper legal effect, it is only words.</p></speech>

It is on our work programme.</p> <p>  Next, we held over No. 1595 C from our previous meeting.  We will revert to it.</p> <p>  Correspondence Nos. 1674 C, dated 22 October, and 1716 C, dated 7 November, are from an individual who made a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the OPW in terms of "Strengthening Civil Service Accountability and Performance".  We requested the relevant report at our meeting with the OPW.  Members will recall that the report reviewed five specific properties.  The individual also provides the details of other properties on which he believes value for money was not achieved, namely, the former Passport Office and the Garda offices on Harcourt Street.  The individual believes that an independent report should be commissioned by the OPW.</p> <p>  We have dealt with the correspondence from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman of the OPW, which provided considerable information, including background information, regarding recent developments in the property management division.  While we might have to return to this topic in the new year, I propose that we ask the chairman to provide a further update on developments to ensure effective property management and that we advise the correspondent accordingly.  We have agreed to invite in the former employee who wrote the report.  This is on our work programme.  We will deal with the matter as soon as we set a date.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 1697 C from an individual, forwarded to the committee, regarding a value for money query relating to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  The bank is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and I propose that, with the correspondent's permission and appropriate redactions, we forward the correspondence to the SBCI.  I understand that the clerk to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has been in correspondence with that organisation.  I propose that the two clerks liaise and seek an update on any intended action.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  This correspondence has gone to two committees.</p> <p>  No. 1710 C from an individual dated 8 November relates to property leases undertaken on behalf of the State by the OPW.  We will note this correspondence and take it into consideration during our meeting with the former OPW employee.</p> <p>  Nos. 1712 C and 1713 C, dated 7 November, are from an individual who has been in correspondence with us regarding Cork Education and Training Board, ETB.  The board has advised the committee that the individual agreed a full and final settlement with it of all outstanding complaints, including a provision that the individual would not apply for any further position within the ETB.  The Department of Education and Skills provided advice to the effect that the individual was free to accept or reject any or all of the settlement, and encouraging the individual to engage with the ETB, through the individual's legal advisers, to reach a settlement.  The responses from the ETB and the Department were forwarded to the correspondent.  I propose that we advise the correspondent that our consideration of the matter is now closed.  Has anyone a comment on this?  I think we taken it as far as we can?  While it sounds severe, the person, with the individual's legal advisers, signed the agreement.  We are not going to unravel an agreement into which someone entered freely, full stop.  That is all I can say.</p> <p>  That marks the end of today's correspondence.</p></speech>

This is one of those meetings where we need to signal well in advance what we want from them so that we do not find next week that they do not have what we are looking for and we get frustrated.

The financial relationship between the particular companies and the Department is not something they will share with us because they will tell us it is commercially sensitive.  That is at the heart of this.  We are told we are almost at zero unemployment and large amounts are being expended on companies and may continue to be.  If we cannot explore that, are we really getting under the bonnet at all?</p></speech>

Essentially in reaction to the committee's inquiries earlier in the year or at the end of last year, I decided to do this chapter to try to focus on the relevant performance issues.  We had to be careful about certain commercial information.  I think we have been and the Department was happy with that.</p> <p>  The committee's Standing Orders provide the option to hear certain information that is commercially sensitive in closed session.</p></speech>

When they appeared last time and the JobPath issue was raised, my recollection is that we got the figure for the overall spend.  Two companies roll this service out.  We got the overall figure but then we were told they could not give the breakdown for each company because then the other company would know.

The voluntary housing associations and the number of schemes that are in operation are very confusing, as is dealing with the amount of money being allocated to each scheme.

The 2017 Revenue account, which was certified in April 2018, was examined by the committee at a meeting last June.</p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s administration and operational expenses are charged to Vote 9, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, rather than the Revenue account.  The 2017 appropriation accounts show that the total spent by Revenue in the year was &euro;411 million. Taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;71 million, net expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;340 million.  The surrender for the year was &euro;3.4 million.</p> <p>  Chapter 17 examines the actions taken by Revenue in recent years to tackle the issue of tobacco smuggling, which represents a significant risk to tax receipts.  Revenue and the National Office for Tobacco Control commission an annual survey to estimate the extent of illicit tobacco related activity in Ireland.  Based on the survey, Revenue estimates that 13% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2017 were illegal, with an associated notional loss of revenue of approximately &euro;229 million.</p> <p>  Revenue seizures of cigarettes and tobacco in 2017 were worth in excess of &euro;20 million at normal prices, representing a potential loss to the Exchequer of &euro;16 million in taxes and duties.  Relative to the estimated overall loss of &euro;229 million, this implies a Revenue detection rate for illegal cigarettes of approximately 7%.  The value of any seizures that take place abroad with Revenue&rsquo;s assistance is not recorded as there is no formal mechanism in place to account for such events.</p> <p>  Figure 17.7 refers to expenditure of more than &euro;400,000 incurred by Revenue up to the end of August 2018 relating to the ongoing holding in Dublin Port of a ship that was seized in 2014 for carrying illegal cigarettes and tobacco.  Significant disposal costs may also arise.  This expenditure is charged to Vote 9.</p> <p>  Revenue published its first stand-alone strategy on combating the illicit tobacco trade covering the period 2011 to 2013.</p><p>A follow-on stand-alone strategy was not produced.  However, Revenue is finalising a national action plan to combat illicit tobacco, with a focus on increased international co-operation.</p><p> Chapter 18 outlines Revenue&rsquo;s approach to monitoring and managing the tax affairs of high wealth individuals.  These are managed by a dedicated unit within Revenue&rsquo;s large cases division.  A specific case manager is assigned to each individual.  As at June 2018, the unit was managing approximately 480 individuals.  The unit was also dealing with around 140 trusts, partnerships and other legal entities related to these individuals.  Revenue&rsquo;s criterion for someone to be considered a high wealth individual is that the person is known or believed to have net assets of more than &euro;50 million.  This is a high threshold compared with other jurisdictions.</p><p> High wealth individuals tend to operate in multiple business sectors.  Revenue's practice in that regard is to assign a sectoral code to each high wealth individual that reflects his or her primary activity.  On that basis, around one third of high wealth individuals operate primarily in the real estate sector.  High wealth individuals&rsquo; tax liabilities cover a range of tax categories.  At the time of the examination, the most recent data provided by Revenue on tax liabilities for high wealth individuals were for 2015.  In that year, high wealth individuals accounted for 3.4% of all net income tax due, 9.3% of capital gains tax receipts and 2% of all capital acquisitions tax receipts.</p><p> High wealth individuals filed 334 income tax returns in 2015.  The number of returns filed is lower than the number of individuals managed in the unit for a number of reasons. For example, a jointly assessed couple, both classed as high wealth individuals, would count as one taxpayer unit and file one income tax return.  The unit also monitors individuals known to have substantial economic interests in Ireland but who may not have a requirement to file an income tax return in Ireland.</p><p> The income tax due from high wealth individuals who made income tax returns in 2015 was highly concentrated, with very significant variations between the 334 returns.  Some 85% of the total income tax liability was due from just ten taxpayers.  Across the group, the average effective tax rate was 39.2%, more than double the average rate of 16.3% for all income taxpayers.  However, 90 high wealth individuals had an effective income tax rate less than the national average rate.</p><p> The examination reviewed a sample of 30 compliance interventions undertaken by Revenue which resulted in additional tax being collected from high wealth individuals.  Of these, 14 had availed of a qualifying avoidance disclosure programme, QAD, to settle their tax affairs.  A QAD allows a taxpayer who entered into a tax avoidance transaction to settle with Revenue by paying the full tax and interest due at the time of the disclosure.  Incentives for the taxpayer in such QAD cases are a 20% reduction in the amount of interest otherwise due and the avoidance of penalties and publication as defaulters.</p><p> For one of the intervention cases reviewed, Revenue had agreed to a phased payment arrangement on the basis of limited documentation.  Another 26 taxpayers involved in the same tax avoidance scheme were granted the same settlement arrangements without the specified evidence.  Revenue guidelines set out the evidence required but also state that some cases may fall outside the guidelines.  However, the guidelines do not explicitly state in what circumstances such an exception should be made.</p><p> Chapter 19 reviews recent trends in corporation tax losses and follows on from a report I presented last year on corporation tax.  Companies are liable for corporation tax in respect of all profits arising from income or gains.  Where a company reports a trading loss, that loss can be used to obtain relief from the payment of corporation tax.  Losses carried forward by companies can be made up of a combination of unused capital allowances and trading losses.  However, Revenue&rsquo;s systems do not identify unused capital allowances carried forward separately from the overall losses carried forward.  There is a high degree of concentration in companies that have accumulated losses.  In 2016, a total of &euro;231 billion of losses and unused capital allowances was available for offset against profits.  Those available losses and allowances could potentially result in the lowering, over a number of future years, of corporation tax receipts by the order of &euro;29 billion.  This overhang of losses is, consequently, a key variable in the outturn of corporation tax receipts.</p><p> As has been noted previously, corporation tax receipts have consistently outperformed forecasts in recent years, particularly since 2015.  Based on prior year trends, Revenue forecasts receipts on a net basis, that is, after the impact of losses.  Separate forecasting of gross receipts and of the usage of losses may offer some potential for improved forecasting accuracy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.204" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018111500002#K00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to make my opening statement.  Today's meeting is to focus on the Revenue Vote and three chapters of the 2017 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General published in September.  These are chapter 17 - Tackling Tobacco Smuggling, chapter 18 - Management of High Wealth Individuals' Tax Liabilities and chapter 19 - Corporation Tax Losses.  In welcoming this opportunity to address the findings of the report, I draw the committee's attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.</p> <p>  Revenue's role is to serve the community by fairly and efficiently collecting taxes and duties and implementing customs controls.  Our aim is to protect Exchequer funds and ensure that everyone meets their tax and duty obligations in accordance with the law.  Our strategy is consistent across all taxpayer segments.  We provide the service to make it as easy as possible for taxpayers to understand and meet their tax and duty obligations and we prioritise the protection of Exchequer funds and support compliant taxpayers by identifying, targeting, and tackling non-compliance on a risk basis.</p> <p>  Revenue's response to non-compliance in all its forms, from the more straightforward non-filing of tax returns to complex tax avoidance schemes and criminal tax and excise fraud, is risk based, proportionate and responsive to taxpayer behaviour.</p> <p>  In chapter 17, the Comptroller and Auditor General reviews Revenue's progress in tackling tobacco smuggling and acknowledges that this is a global problem.  The European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, estimates that cigarette smuggling costs national and EU budgets more than &euro;10 billion annually.  The illicit tobacco trade is known to be dominated by internationally organised criminal groups who are often also involved in other crime such as drug smuggling, money laundering and people trafficking.</p> <p>  In Ireland, tobacco taxation is a key policy instrument in reducing tobacco consumption.  In keeping with the Government's public health objectives, we have one of the highest rates of tobacco tax in Europe.  In the most popular price category of cigarettes, total tax, excise and VAT, now represents just over 79% of the retail price per pack in Ireland.  Tobacco tax is a significant source of revenue and generated &euro;1.4 billion in tax receipts in 2017.  While the high tax policy has resulted in progress in reducing tobacco consumption, the trade-off is that it incentivises illicit trade.  Tackling this is a key priority for Revenue.</p> <p>  Measurement of the illicit tobacco trade is known to be challenging.  In a report in 2014, the World Health Organization, WHO, Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, FCTC, recognised that all methods to estimate illicit tobacco trade have their limitations.  That report indicated the very wide variations between countries in the percentage of the national cigarette market constituted by illicit cigarettes, for example, Latvia at 41%, Sweden at 20%, and Italy at 3.5%, and estimated the market share for illicit cigarettes within the EU at 10.4%.</p> <p>  Revenue's best estimate of the scale of the illicit tobacco market in Ireland is provided by an annual survey conducted by Ipsos MRBI on behalf of Revenue and the national tobacco control office of the HSE.  The primary usefulness of this measure is to track the trend over time.  The 2017 survey found 13% of packs to be illegal, up from 10% in 2016 and 12% in 2015.  This follows the recognised trend Europe wide.  For comparative purposes, in the UK, where a high tobacco tax policy similarly applies, in 2016-2017 the illicit cigarette market was 15%, up from 13% in 2015-2016 and 8% in 2014-2015.</p><p>Based on 2017 survey results, the nominal loss to the Exchequer in 2017 is approximately &euro;229 million in excise and VAT.  While this provides an indication of the financial significance of the problem, it is based on the improbable assumption that if there were no illicit cheap cigarettes, those smokers would buy the same number of more expensive, taxed cigarettes using money they are currently not spending on any form of taxable consumption.  That aside, we know that the illicit tobacco trade represents a significant threat to Government health policy, Exchequer funds, legitimate trade and Revenue's strategy to maximise voluntary compliance.  We also know that it funds international organised crime.  Revenue devotes considerable resources to challenging all stages in the supply chain for illicit tobacco products.  We work to identify and target those involved in smuggling, supplying or selling illicit tobacco products, with a view to disrupting supply, seizing the illicit products and maximising our impact by prosecuting those involved, wherever possible.</p><p> In 2017 we seized more than 34.24 million cigarettes and 1,768 kg of tobacco with a combined retail value of &euro;20.34 million.  The comparative figures to the end of October this year are 58.9 million cigarettes and 1,685 kg of tobacco with a total retail value of &euro;36.5 million.  This includes tobacco products seized in March 2018, when a Revenue-led operation resulted in the discovery and closure of a counterfeit cigarette factory in County Louth, the first of its kind to be discovered in the State.  Up to the end of October this year, our prosecution cases for tobacco smuggling or selling offences have resulted in 60 summary convictions, five indictable convictions, fines totalling &euro;140,250, nine suspended sentences and one custodial sentence of six months' imprisonment.  Alongside this, Revenue has worked with the Department of Health over the past two years on a new "track and trace" system to regulate the legitimate tobacco supply chain across Europe.  Revenue was recently designated by the Government as the competent authority in Ireland for this new system, which is due to be introduced during 2019.</p><p> To summarise, we aim to contain and diminish the illicit tobacco market to the greatest extent possible.  Our performance is probably most appropriately measured by the outcomes of our efforts and changes in the size of the illicit tobacco market here relative to other countries with similar tobacco tax policies.  I assure the committee that tackling the illicit tobacco trade will continue to be a key Revenue priority as, in tandem with facilitating the free flow of legitimate trade, we work to identify, target and confront a diverse and agile smuggling trade operated at global level with significant involvement of both national and international organised crime groups.  We meet these challenges by prioritising national and international co-operation, investment in technology, and intelligence development.  We work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Criminal Assets Bureau, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the European Anti-Fraud Office, Europol and fellow customs administrations in the EU and beyond.  In the context of our structural realignment, our actions will be co-ordinated in a national operational plan to maximise our impact on those involved at every stage of the illegal supply chain and deliver the best possible outcome in protecting Exchequer funds.</p><p> Turning to chapter 18 on the management of high-wealth individuals' tax liabilities, the Comptroller and Auditor General reports that in 2015, 334 high-worth individuals, HWIs, paid a total &euro;545 million in income tax, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax.  In line with best international practice, and since 2003, Revenue has dealt with large corporates and HWIs in a dedicated large cases division.  In a further refinement to this model this year, we have divided the large cases division, LCD, into two: one division focuses on large corporates, and the other on HWIs, including family members and related entities.  A significant feature of the HWI segment is that HWIs' income derives largely from capital rather than earnings.  The IMF notes that globally, HWIs maintain more than half of their wealth portfolio in cash and equities, the balance in property and investments - for example, funds, derivatives, currency, and commodities.  A stock of wealth may be held personally, in trusts, and in legal entities effectively controlled by an individual or family group.  Flows of income may fluctuate and may be planned and managed.  From our experience, we also know that individuals who have a high level of accumulated net wealth are likely to be actively engaged in wealth management and personal tax planning and subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and, in the context of wealth preservation, pay attention to global and local tax policy and legislation.</p><p> There is no evidence, and Revenue does not assume, that wealthy individuals are more likely to be tax non-compliant.  As a result of the financial complexities and potential tax yield in the HWI segment, Revenue applies close individual attention, and considerable skill and expertise, to managing tax compliance across the sector.  Revenue case managers use their detailed case knowledge, together with our data analytics capabilities and the extensive available range of Revenue, third party and internationally exchanged information, to manage compliance, profile risk and identify cases for intervention.  In 2017, the total yield in tax, interest and penalties from our HWI compliance interventions was &euro;15.3 million.</p><p> This chapter also refers to tax avoidance, which occurs where transactions are undertaken primarily to give rise to a tax advantage.  The focus of Revenue anti-avoidance teams encompasses the entire case base because use of legislation other than as intended can present real risks to the tax base and the perceived fairness of the tax system.  Also, and in line with international best practice, our HWI and anti-avoidance units work closely together.  We identify and investigate schemes and oversee legal challenges up to the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court, as may be required, or negotiate a tax settlement, including interest and penalties, as appropriate.  We make any necessary recommendations for legislative amendments to prevent tax leakage.</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General goes on in chapter 19 to consider corporation tax trading losses, capital allowances and losses carried forward.  There are no recommendations for Revenue in this chapter.  Last month I wrote to the committee, as requested, setting out Revenue's work on the estimation of corporation tax receipts, operating as we do in a supporting role to the Department of Finance, which compiles and publishes forecasts of all taxes, including corporation tax.</p><p> In summary, the Comptroller and Auditor General makes five recommendations on tackling tobacco smuggling and three on the management of HWIs' tax liabilities, all of which are agreed.  Consistent with Revenue's focus on continuous improvement to achieve the best possible return on resources, our new national structure deploys staff across a broad geographical spread, our national operational plan will co-ordinate and integrate our anti-smuggling actions and we are engaged in a significant risk-based shift of resources towards our medium enterprise, HWI and large corporates divisions.  I have provided a separate note to the committee on our structural realignment under way.  The purpose of our realignment is to provide a greater match of resources to risk, to reflect the changes in the economic environment in which we operate and to maximise the use of our resources across the country.  Among the levers that make this possible are the digital dividends and efficiencies created by our ongoing investment in data analytics, our extended range of online services, and key projects such as PAYE modernisation.  Finally, and given the focus of chapter 18 on a very small, distinct group of taxpayers, I again draw the committee's attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.  Subject to this constraint, I am happy to answer any questions from the committee.</p></speech>

There is only one game in town today.  The news broke as we came in here this morning that Dominic Raab had resigned from the UK Cabinet, and by the time we were coming down the stairs the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Esther McVey, had followed him out the door.  These resignations have sent reverberations across the political world, especially in Europe.  The reality is that Theresa May probably expected someone to go overboard but, obviously, her Brexit Secretary is a significant loss.  To lose one Brexit Secretary is unfortunate but she has lost two.  We could be calling on Oscar Wilde to pen Mrs. May's obituary by the end of the day.</p><p>It brings the reality of a hard crash into sharper focus.  While one would not want to talk it up, it must be discussed.  </p><p> I remember on budget day this year, as the officials from the Department of Finance filed into the Chamber and sat to the right of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in the area reserved for them, Mr. Cody was in their midst.  In his Budget Statement, the Minister made fleeting reference to the Revenue Commissioners and the potential Border posts, but it was our finance spokesperson, Deputy Michael McGrath, who in his speech pressed the Minister on this and on the Government's plans to hire just 200 Brexit customs officials by the deadline next spring, even though it was reported in the press that Revenue estimated an extra 600 members of staff were needed for the transition period and the future EU-UK trade deal.  Will Mr. Cody confirm that just 200 officials will be trained and in place by 29 March next year?  Does Revenue need the 600 officials, as reported in the media on the day of the budget?  Was the contingency plan in the safe in Revenue headquarters adjusted down this morning before Mr. Cody came in here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.209" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018111500002#M00200"><p>I find this to be an interesting position to be in.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has invited me in to talk about Brexit next Tuesday.  I replied yesterday suggesting it might be more opportune to have the discussion some time later, given we are now in the midst of what is very much a political process.</p> <p>  In regard to the commentary about our requirement for Brexit, Government decisions that took place in July and September relating to the recruitment of additional staff and the case we have made, the Minister set out in an answer to a recent parliamentary question from Fianna F&aacute;il's finance spokesman that in September the Government approved our case for additional resources from now until January 2021.  The agreement was that we would require approximately 600 additional members of staff for the end of the transition period.  In the decision in September, which was picked up and analysed by the media, we set out a planned recruitment campaign, which has started, and approximately 40 people in this quarter will enter a dedicated training programme for customs.  In the first quarter of next year, we will hire an additional 230 officials, resulting in 270 being in place for 29 March to facilitate the ongoing engagement with industry on Brexit-related issues and the implications for customs because it tends to be the larger corporations that are engaged in importing and exporting outside the community.  We agreed that over the remainder of 2019 and through the start of 2020 we will continue our recruitment process to have the 600 officials in place by the end of the transition period.  </p> <p>  That was as it was set out at the time but when people hear the figures it is all added up together and they wonder where the new staff are, but that was the planned process.  In the event of no deal, we agreed, as the Minister stated in his reply to the parliamentary question, we would have to consider how we could speed up the process of recruitment.  We will not have everyone in place by April, but we will be able to speed up recruitment.  We did a recent recruitment process for staff for trade facilitation.  Advertisements closed in September and in excess of 3,000 people applied for the jobs.  We started the interview process and the top 40 will be hired from the panel.  We will continue the process of assessing, interviewing and hiring the new staff through the normal recruitment process.  </p> <p>  In the event of a change of plan, we would have to think about how more could be brought in more quickly, but we also have other resources.  One of the things we do in our organisation is redeploy, and we pride ourselves on having the flexibility to respond to events.  The key issue for our planning for whatever outcome of Brexit is to ensure the information and communications technology, ICT, infrastructure is in place to cope with multiples of customs entries if the UK becomes a third country.  </p> <p>  In budget 2017, following the Brexit referendum in June 2016, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, provided for an additional &euro;2 million to improve our ICT development and have it in place because it is the key.  We used that money well and we are satisfied that we have scaled up our ICT infrastructure.  It will be able to cope with significant multiples of what it could cope with in March this year.</p></speech>

Deputy Michael McGrath contended that Government and Revenue should have taken the opportunity afforded by the high number of applications to recruit the number that Revenue needs, although I appreciate Mr. Cody's point that the media put a spin on the figures.  I know everyone uses soft language in the D&aacute;il Chamber, conscious of the need to "de-dramatise", to use that popular word, but if one turns on the television, one will see Theresa May going through Cabinet members like Brian Cody goes through hurls on a training night in Kilkenny.  She is going down.  That is happening.  I would appreciate if Mr. Cody could be candid and tell us and, more important, the public the truth.  If this thing spirals out of control, will Revenue be able to react?  He said Revenue was asked about the possibility of speeding up the process, and that will probably be required.  I appreciate his point about investment in ICT infrastructure, but will Revenue have enough trained officials by March 2019 to deal with the doomsday scenario, or will a "Dad's Army" scenario be required?</p></speech>

I spoke here and in other committees about the UCC as adopted in 2015, which is to be implemented between 2015 and 2025 by EU member states.  There is a range of options contained in it and, in that context, we are accelerating the implementation of the provisions that can allow greater simplifications for trade.  I am satisfied that Revenue will be in a position to support trade in April next year.</p></speech>

I cannot stress enough that the key issue is that if someone makes a customs declaration, our system will be able to cope with it immediately.</p><p>Not coping with it immediately is what clogs up ports and airports.  We are working on the basis, and the Government has worked on the basis, of this central case scenario, which involves an orderly agreement and a transition period.  The type of organisation we are, however, means we always have to have regard to what can happen.  That is why we identified issues with Brexit early and had done some contingency work on it.  If everybody remembers, we had done some of it before the referendum.  </p><p> The key issue is to ensure the ICT framework.  We are also identifying the companies that will be engaged in import-export processes.  We are starting a process of one-to-one engagement with companies.  I refer to outreach looking at how we identify companies that should take advantage of the various different simplifications.  If there is a no deal Brexit, then physical infrastructure will not be in place.  We would then have to look at how we would operate our systems.  One of the advantages in customs is that the transaction takes place and the goods are then brought into the country or leave the country.  The company has books and records and some of the clearance work we do is post-clearance checks.</p><p> I have spoken previously about how 92% of imports are green routed so that there is no check at entry.  Of the 8% that have some level of checking, 6% are orange routed.  That is a documentary check.  Then 2% are red routed which means that there is a check of the physical goods.  What happens, but what will have to happen to a greater degree in the future, is checks at approved premises.  The goods can be brought to the logistics company's warehouse and the check takes place away from the physical border.  Some companies will be approved customs operators so we will do checks away from the border.  I do not want people to go away saying that everything will be all right.  If it happens, there will be big challenges and there will be much work involved.  That is, however, what we will have to deal with.  </p></speech>

I appreciate Mr. Cody answering those questions given the significance of the resignation of Mr. Dominic Raab.  One of the chapters the Comptroller and Auditor General has examined in-depth is that of tobacco smuggling and the impact it has on the revenues of the State.  If a hard border is in place, then the smuggling of fuel, tobacco and drink will become even more lucrative.  I recall being at an awards ceremony once and the former Armagh football captain joked in his speech that any decent smuggler in south Armagh would have had a couple of tankers of laundered fuel on the road before breakfast.</p> <p>  My party and Deputy Breathnach introduced a Private Members' Bill, the Sale of Illicit Goods Bill 2017, a few weeks ago in the D&aacute;il.  During that debate, the Government contested the figures being quoted for the revenue lost to the State.  It stated that it could not be quantified.  Will Mr. Cody hazard a guess as to the figure?  He has spoken of the 13% loss but the Comptroller and Auditor General has said it is a significant risk to tax receipts.  I presume Mr. Cody would agree with that?  What does he believe is the loss to the State? </p></speech>

We publish the estimate and we refer this time to 13%.  The Comptroller and Auditor General would like us to publish more tax gap analyses of various different products.  Tobacco is a controlled product, however, and it is a single line.  We know what is legitimately produced every year.  It all goes through the tax stamps and we have been doing this series of surveys.  Ipsos MRBI has carried out this survey for us and the Office of Tobacco Control since 2008 and we publish the results every year.  We also estimate a figure that would result if everybody stopped buying the 13% illicit cigarettes, and instead bought legal cigarettes.  That is unlikely.  People are surely spending some of that money but they would not be able to afford to spend all of it.  The figure comes out, however, at &euro;229 million.  We publish such a figure every year.  It is, however, difficult to measure any illegal activity and the scale of it.  That applies to drugs-----</p></speech>

A value of &euro;47.8 million was put on those, so there was a loss to the Exchequer of &euro;37 million.  When there are major hauls like that - and it involved much work - is there a reassessment of what is the loss to the State?</p></speech>

We sent a series of photographs to the committee because people do not realise what is involved in these operations.  We sent the photographs to the committee to show what the factory looked like.  It was a shed in a farmyard.  The committee can see those photographs now.</p></speech>

It was a sophisticated operation and on another level it looked like something else.  When I come here, I generally do all of the talking for my team but I specifically wanted to bring Mr. Gilligan with me today.  He has led the work on criminal operations and he led the operation on the tobacco factory in County Louth.  He also leads our liaison with international bodies.  I thought, if the committee was interested, that Mr. Gilligan could outline some of the facts, bearing in mind that there are court cases under way in respect of the seizure at Jenkinstown.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.225" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Gilligan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018111500002#N01200"><p>I thank the committee.  First, in the context of illicit cigarette production and smuggling, the idea that Ireland is a discrete or isolated location, within which the availability of smuggled or illicit tobacco is a result of local criminal activity, is not the reality.  The production and smuggling of illicit tobacco is transnational.  It is a significant area of organised crime.  It involves a range of activities coming together in the sense that it is complex, organised, multi-layered and is undertaken by professional criminal enterprises.  It is also definitely linked, directly or indirectly, to other criminal activities.</p> <p>  In this case, we had three internationally-organised crime gangs involved from Bulgaria, Lithuania and Ireland.  They had come together to put a factory in place.  It was a full end-to-end professional factory in Jenkinstown and was unusual in that, under normal circumstances in Europe, the experience has been that we do not get a fully commercial end-to-end illicit factory in one place.</p><p>It is normally sectioned and kept in different locations, primarily because if law enforcement came across it, they would only lose one piece at a time.  The volume of tobacco on-site was 77 tonnes and the number of cigarettes produced was 22 million or 23 million.  This gives an indication of the size of the operation that was undertaken.  Not only is there the production of cigarettes and their distribution, all the precursors, as we call them - the tobacco, paper, filters, glue, cardboard, cellophane and all the aspects which have to come together to produce the final product - had to be transported to this location.  There were 11 people on-site 24 hours a day for the period involved, which we believe was for periods of up to two weeks, and they had the operation running 24-7.  They had shower facilities, kitchen facilities and accommodation facilities on-site in what, when one looks at it, appears to be a normal farm shed.  However, behind bales of hay, it was a professional and commercial factory.  Some of the international cigarette manufacturers who came to the site to have a look at it were surprised at how sophisticated the operation was.</p></speech>

I will move on to another seizure within the chapter, namely, the case study by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the ship, <i>MV Shingle</i>, which may be appropriately named.  It was in Drogheda Port - also in County Louth - having travelled from Slovenia with 32 million illegal cigarettes on board.  What has been flagged is the fact costs incurred by Revenue up to the end of August this year of approximately &euro;410,000 are related to the continued holding of this vessel and the lay-up cost charged by Dublin Port Company.  What is the up-to-date position on the disposal of this ship and the costs incurred, which are significant if they are running at almost &euro;500,000 at this stage?</p></speech>

We have a ship that is not legally seaworthy, and it was not legally seaworthy when it managed to smuggle 30 million cigarettes into Drogheda Port.  Organised criminal gangs do not seem to have the same regard for health and safety that we have to have.  Ultimately, our powers allow us to seize conveyance.  We seize fuel, fuel tanks, lorries, cars and other vehicles, and ships.  We usually manage to dispose of everything we seize in a reasonably timely way.  It is not a money-making operation; it is to disrupt the criminal gangs that are involved in the operations.  Unfortunately, when we seized the <i>MV Shingle</i>, there was a three-year gap because it had to be retained for evidence until court proceedings were finished.  That is a standard process for much of the stuff we seize.</p></speech>

It would not be good if an asbestos hulk was sunk by mistake by somebody.  What is important is that the registered owners of this ship wanted it back and there was a court action about it.  I would be more worried if I was coming before the committee to say we had given it back and it then featured in a cigarette smuggling or drug smuggling operation here or in any other country.  We would then be legitimately asked, "Why did you?"  I was chatting to Mr. Gilligan about this.  We often find the containers and tankers that illicit fuel goes around in are not fit to be on the road, yet we end up seizing them when we know we would be better off without them.  The criminal entities tend not to use high quality product that costs a lot of money because they know the danger is that if we come across it, we will seize it.</p></speech>

When he looks at the map in figure 17.1, which deals with the cost of cigarettes throughout the continent, it is &euro;5 a pack in Spain, &euro;3 in Turkey, &euro;5 in Austria and &euro;2 in Albania and Russia, whereas it is &euro;12 in Ireland.  Although he said it is a key policy instrument, the question is whether the high price is fuelling the illegal tobacco trade in Ireland to such an extent that the battle is being lost.  Does he believe the Revenue Commissioners are fighting a losing battle and, as he said, just trying to disrupt this trade?  How much is slipping through without being detected?</p></speech>

Every year, in the context of the budget, the Minister has to weigh both those issues and every year the various NGOs, such as the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society, will strongly recommend a significant increase in excise duty on cigarettes.  I am sure committee members hear the same views.  On the opposite side, as I said, the industry wrote to give out to me because the various retail interests and tobacco manufacturers keep emphasising the challenge of smuggling.</p> <p>  The standard increase in recent years has been 50 cent per pack of 20 in excise duty, which puts us at the highest end of the price.  In the tax ready reckoner that we publish, it is the only area where we build in an elasticity and we give a range of possibilities, along the lines, "It could lead to..."  In recent years, the budget figures have been achieved but they have been achieved in a strange way in that there have been significant fluctuations in releases of legitimate tobacco because of various health packaging arrangements.  This year we are well below the tobacco tax figures compared to forecast.  Because Ireland is a relatively small market, none of the cigarettes is manufactured in Ireland and it is not like it used to be.  The production of legitimate cigarettes for Ireland can be done in some of the factories in a couple of weeks in a quantity that will last months, and the releases then follow.  However, over a four or five-year period, the tax receipts come in on target.  Obviously, it is a policy issue and a health issue, and there is a balance to be struck.</p><p>During the few years in which the duty was not increased the tobacco companies increased their prices.</p></speech>

In his opening remarks he also spoke about how people could plan their wages and so forth.   In the case of the 83 high wealth individuals with a taxable income less than the average wage in 2015, were there reasons for this in terms of planning to be evasive, etc?</p></speech>

It was indicated that they did not have a high enough income in their own right, but does Mr. Cody believe there was a motivation behind this?</p></speech>

Sometimes the only reason they are brought in is, essentially, there is a liability for capital acquisitions or capital gains tax.  They do not have an income in their own right, but they may be the beneficiary of a gift.  A total of 25 of the 83 individuals were family members who did not have an income but were included in the case base because they were part of the family group.  A total of 21 individuals were non-resident and non-domiciled; therefore, they were only subject to income tax on Irish sourced income or income remitted in Ireland.  They were included because they had significant links with Ireland, but they were not generating an income in Ireland.  A total of 22 high wealth individuals in taxpayer specific circumstances were impacted on significantly by the downturn.  This category would not have been significant if the crash had not happened in 2009 and 2010.  Some of them have ended up bankrupt and are no longer high wealth individuals.  However, some of them will recover.  A total of 15 high wealth individuals had a significant release of capital allowances or losses.  In the material we sent to the committee we included a copy of a recent report on the high income earner restriction.  There are reliefs that are restricted if an individual's income is in excess of &euro;400,000 and he or she must at least pay at a 30% effective rate.  If relief is restricted in one year, he or she can carry forward the part that is unused; therefore, it is pent up.  It is like the lost relief discussions we had on corporation tax.  People carry forward certain losses and reliefs which impacts on their income in the year in question.  The 83 individuals have valid reasons.  They are set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, but, again, in some way it becomes a much better headline.</p></speech>

I have one or two questions for Mr. Cody about that issue that will not take more than five minutes.  I will then move on to the particular chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report with which we are dealing.  </p> <p>  I assume that if Mr. Cody has not read the draft withdrawal agreement, he has been briefed on it.  All of this will matter post-2020 at the end of the implementation period and after something else replaces it.  In terms of what has been agreed, it seems that there will be a single EU-UK customs territory.  That will deal with the customs side of things, but there are deeper provisions for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the context of the Single Market.  That seems to suggest there will be unrestricted movement of goods north and south to Great Britain and the rest of Europe, but this does not apply to goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The draft withdrawal agreement talks about the necessity for additional checks but states they will be made in the least intrusive way possible.  What does that mean for the Revenue Commissioners and the Republic of Ireland?  Obviously, it will be an issue in Northern Ireland, but it will also be an issue in the Republic of Ireland.  When it is stated these checks must happen, that there will be additional checks, especially if there is any variation in standards, and that the rules of the Single Market must be protected, at least from the European Union's perspective, what is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners?  Have they examined what the increased checks will be and what would be the least intrusive options?</p></speech>

Obviously, there is a lot of detail in the agreement, but there will also be a lot of detail in giving effect to the agreement as is common in EU processes.  Deputy Cullinane is right - the customs union deals with certain parts of it.  Before the Single Market was introduced in 1992, there were border controls between all of the countries of the European Union.  It was the Single Market that allowed the free movement of goods.  I remember it well because I was involved in many of the discussions that took place at the time on VAT; therefore, I am being brought back to a previous time in my career.  I spoke about simplification in the context of the Single Market and the customs process.  The question will be about regulatory alignment.  It may well not be about the customs process and procedures, depending on what the agreement is.  We have the lead role for all of the agencies involved in regulatory control; therefore, our IT systems are used to support them, be it the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the HSE.  That infrastructure about which I spoke will provide the basis for the management of the process.</p></speech>

I accept what he is saying, but the Commission is stating that in making the additional checks, there will be a need for some compliance checks with EU standards consistent with the level of risk to protect consumers, economic traders and businesses in the Single Market.  The Commission is talking about additional checks and stating we can try to mitigate them but there will be additional compliance checks.  Have the Revenue Commissioners looked at what the additional compliance checks will be in practice?</p></speech>

Obviously, the majority want it to be implemented.</p><p>In the event that it is not implemented and there is a hard crash, what will be the immediate revenue consequences in this state?  We are hearing that World Trade Organization rules will apply automatically in the event that no political or legal arrangements are put in place between Britain and the European Union.  Let us suppose there is no deal and World Trade Organization rules apply.  No one wants to be in that situation, but let us suppose we are in that situation.  Are there automatic responses that will have to come into play or would something else evolve over time?  Will there be immediate obligations on this state and Revenue in the event that there is no deal and World Trade Organization rules apply?</p></speech>

One thing that is really noticeable in the entire process is how the European Union has put Ireland's interests first.  I cannot imagine that on 29 March next it will state to Ireland that a given position is completely unacceptable.  I have listened to a good deal of the discussion and debate in the media on how, ultimately, when it comes to it, Ireland will be left swinging.  What has happened in recent days has been singularly important for Ireland.  I really hope things will follow through.</p> <p>  At the start the Chairman talked about how officials would not become involved in the area of policy.  I reckon I am probably in the biggest policy area for the country.  Last June I was before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach talking about various aspects of Brexit.  I have been quoted and name-checked by various Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom.  A friend sent me a text message.  He was watching "The Late Late Show" when Brexit was being discussed and told me that I had been name-checked based on partial stuff I had said.  I do not think it would be helpful.  Seeing that I am a sad individual, I find myself watching the House of Commons public accounts committee where I am also mentioned.  That committee would like to have me over to talk to it about all of these things, but it would be better all round to let the process take its course in the context of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  I can understand perfectly each time I am attending anything the reason people want to know what will happen, but I think we would all be better off in letting the policy take its course.  I am willing to come back at any time to talk about it when we are in a better position to talk about it.</p></speech>

Without that level of information, the Revenue Commissioners perhaps have to use other sources.  There are obligations at certain points when declarations of assets have to be made, but they do not apply in the same way as when income returns are being made on a yearly basis.</p></speech>

Is there any benefit in looking at that?  I have no wish to stray into policy or the political sphere, but in recent times there has been debate about whether we should have a wealth tax.  One reason it is difficult to have that debate is we cannot get an answer to the question of how much could be generated from such a tax.  That is because we do not collect data for wealth.  Is this something at which Revenue has looked to try to find better ways to accumulate data and information on people's wealth, especially that of high wealth individuals?</p></speech>

In recent years there have been many helpful developments.  We obtain extensive third party information.  We receive various data from financial institutions.  Significant purchases of property are relevant because there are stamp duty implications and reporting requirements.  As there are requirements related to probate and inheritance, we have a picture of assets on inheritance.  One thing that has been changing considerably in recent years and that will continue to change is the level of information on international wealth and the international exchange of information.  The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act governs this aspect of the US financial reporting system.  With the common reporting standard of the OECD, it allows for the exchange of financial information held by financial institutions abroad for in the region of 120 countries and tax administrations.  It also adds to the process.</p></speech>

It would be difficult to forecast with the accuracy we would like.  It would really depend on how a wealth tax was designed and what it involved.</p><p>The CSO and the Central Bank produce a wealth survey that gives some basis for figures.  The ESRI and the Department of Finance compiled a report on how to model a wealth tax.  On a macro basis, it would be possible to approximate a figure.</p><p> On statements of assets, in certain circumstances we can look for a statement of affairs in individual cases but we have to have cause and a reason.  It is a bit like some of the discussion regarding corporation tax losses.  It would be helpful if Revenue had a breakdown of certain figures but there are requirements.  We can only have a breakdown of certain figures if we have the law in place to require the reporting of those figures.  That is this type of area.</p></speech>

Some of them come in under that threshold.  A common feature of an artificial loss is when someone has a significant gain of &euro;10 million, for example, and he or she would be liable to pay capital gains tax of 33% on that in the normal course of events.  Some people try to create a loss to shelter the gain and a series of very sophisticated financial transactions would take place over a small number of days.  This would create a significant loss.  It would create another gain that was not legally taxable under a particular provision.  The person would shelter the real gain by means of the artificial loss.  The artificial loss and the artificial gain would cancel each other out and the individual would end up with exactly the same amount of money but would try to get it tax free.  We have challenged this and are now before the courts with some of the cases.   I cannot talk about individual cases but it is on public record that we identified 28 cases where the amount of tax at risk was &euro;110 million.  We were successful in the High Court but our approach was judicially reviewed.  It was appealed to the Supreme Court as a result of the judicial review.  A lot of the detail was put on the record of the court.  We have been successful in the Supreme Court, but that was dealing with the judicial review.  A number of the people involved have gone to the High Court to challenge the constitutionality of the section on general anti-avoidance provision.  Those cases still have to go through the tax appeal process, but some have settled.  This was seven cases settled with a yield of &euro;27 million.  This is what we do and this is what the anti-avoidance teams do.</p> <p>  I am aware that the Chairman is very interested in the tax appeals process.  When we identify a tax avoidance scheme it could be ten years before the case is brought to fruition.  We might say it is tax avoidance but these people are very well resourced and very well advised.  They are quite happy to go through the courts process.  The prolonging of the payment may well be enough of an advantage for them.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the witnesses responses are lengthy because of the questions being put but perhaps this one is a bit more distinct.  If I am reading it right Mr. McCarthy raised the issue, or concern, about how high wealth individuals are classified in the State, which starts at &euro;50 million.  Is Mr. McCarthy saying this is outside the European norms and that &euro;50 million is perhaps too high?</p></speech>

It would be useful to go back a little on the history.  We were one of the first administrations to have a HWI large cases division, LCD.  We were leaders in that regard.  We reviewed it in 2007 and in 2015.  We are now in the process of reviewing and realigning our structure.  I want to emphasise the fact that just because a person is dealt with in the HWI unit, or not, does not mean that the same rules and legal basis do not apply.  I spoke about the anti-avoidance process.  The anti-avoidance teams in the HWI LCD take in the cases that engage in the avoidance process that we have identified, to tackle that process.  We have some 1,240 cases of taxpayers who are involved in avoidance schemes that we are challenging.  The vast majority of those people are not HWIs at all, but they are being dealt with for the transaction by the anti-avoidance teams in the LCD.</p> <p>  I referred earlier to the Revenue's realignment process that is currently under way.  We are trying to do a serious realignment of resources with risk.  We have now divided LCD into LCD corporates and LCD HWI.  We have also set up a medium enterprise division that deals with the cases under the HWI threshold.  This division deals with 15,000 individuals and their tax affairs.  I have asked the two assistant secretaries who lead the HWI unit and the medium enterprise divisions that once we have settled down a bit of our resources in this quarter that by the end of the first quarter of next year they would bring forward a proposal to the board on the threshold for the HWIs.  I am absolutely confident that we will be reducing that threshold.  I want to put more resources into that area.  Identifying the resources and freeing up the resources from what they are currently doing is a process.  We are going through our structural realignment, motivated by ourselves, which involves a significant change in the structure of the organisation.  This will take time to bed in.  We are revisiting the threshold.  We want to see what will be the implications of, for example, a &euro;20 million threshold and how many cases this would involve.  All of those cases are being dealt with by the medium enterprise division.  It is a question of how we balance those two.</p></speech>

It relates to what is stated on page 237 in the context of tax collection.  Basically, it breaks down as tax paid by HWIs, 57 of whom had taxable incomes of &euro;36,000 to &euro;125,000 and 88 of whom had taxable incomes of less than &euro;36,000.  There were 83 who had taxable incomes of less than the average industrial wage.  It is interesting that Mr. McCarthy made recommendations in his report in respect of various matters and then there are responses.  On the tax collection side, however, there is no recommendation that I can see.</p><p>Is that because the Comptroller and Auditor General is just reporting as fact that this is how it is and he does not see any difficulty with it?</p></speech>

Some 25 are family members who do not have an income.  They are in our HWI class because they may well be recipients of significant gifts and they are liable for capital acquisitions tax on gifts.  As the Deputy can imagine, with HWIs there are family groups so we look at the family group together.  They may not have an income.</p></speech>

However, some of them may not have income or capital in a year.  One - although neither of us - could get an inheritance and live off it for years.  The taxable event might happen this year and the person might have no tax for the next few years.  Some 25 were family members who were in that position, while 21 were non-residents or non-domiciled individuals.  Mostly their tax liability or tax position - maybe tax liability is the wrong word - their centre of tax is not Ireland.  A further 15 of them had specific reliefs and claims under legislation, capital allowances and losses that applied to their gross income to reduce their net income, and they were legitimate schemes provided by the Oireachtas.  Then 22 of them had various circumstances.  These are people who would have gone through the worst of the downturn and are no longer included in our HWIs.  Some of them may have ended up in bankruptcy or wherever.</p> <p>  When the Comptroller and Auditor General is doing his reports with us and we are going over and back with our comments, we probably all end up saying to ourselves that this is tax stuff and stats and everything is fine.  Then when 30 September or whenever the report is published comes up, and journalists see a heading, we say, oh, Lord, we should have written more when we wrote back to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

One of the most interesting things around the HWIs, as I said in my opening remarks, is that we do not assume that any of them does not pay their right share.  In fact, as I noted in preparation for today, the number of HWIs who are resident in Ireland and who pay effective rates when we include PRSI and USC of 50% is actually quite striking and reassuring.</p></speech>

On the last point in respect of the 83 individuals, 15 of them had legitimate claims to a significant level of reliefs, primarily losses.  Could we have an example of the types of reliefs that would enable somebody to pay less than the average industrial wage on their income?  I am not asking for any specifics on any individual but just the types of relief that would be availed of.</p></speech>

There are 14 - trading losses greater than &euro;100,000 - that is where someone has carried forward trading losses and can set that against total income.  Nearly half the number involved had trading losses in excess of &euro;100,000 carried forward.  Their income in the year would be in excess of &euro;100,000 or &euro;120,000 or whatever but they would have the &euro;100,000 set against it.  As for the rest of the reliefs, individuals had capital allowances, trading losses less than &euro;100,000, and participation in the employment incentive investment, EII, scheme, where a person invests in some small company and can get the relief on that.  There is a lot less, though, than we would have seen ten years ago because a lot of the reliefs have been abolished.  There were a lot of property based reliefs which are now abolished.  Then the issue of the high income earners restriction comes into play.  That brings back in, for last year, I think, &euro;32 million in liability in that some of the reliefs-----</p></speech>

I have a note and it might better if I read it out instead of talking off the top of my head.  Capital allowances are a form of depreciation.  That is essentially what they are for tax purposes.  They may be deducted from an individual's case 1 or case 2 tax adjusted profit in calculating the taxable profits of a trade or profession.  A profession would be a good example of somebody who might have capital allowances.</p></speech>

There are two principal forms of capital allowances paid by taxpayers against their trade profits, namely wear and tear allowances on the cost of acquiring plant and machinery, which would be mostly in corporation tax, and then some industrial buildings allowances where somebody has bought an industrial building and would be entitled to claim that amount over a period of depreciation.  Then they can claim case 5, which is rental capital allowances on the cost incurred on furniture and fittings for their rental properties.  As is highlighted in the chapter, a lot of the people in the HWI category have significant rental-----</p></speech>

I do not want to put Mr. Cody on the spot so if he does not have the information to hand he might be able to provide it to the committee.

I might have it by the end of the meeting.  Increasingly, in the context of HWIs, we probably look at profile interview type process.  They tend to be technical.  They tend not to be investigations because with investigations one has to have significant evidence of tax evasion.  It is certainly not a feature of HWIs.  They may engage in tax planning and tax management but tax evasion is not something that is in that sphere.  I have those figures now.  In 2017, there were five investigations, 17 audits and 13 profile interviews.  The target was 105 aspect queries but we closed 1,300 where we would look at some aspect of it such as their capital allowances.  We would have carried out 1,158 appraisals.  Appraisals are when we appraise the case but we do not make contact with the taxpayer or their agent.</p></speech>

I have those figures for 2016, 2017 and 2018.  So far in 2018, and this surprises me, we have 15 investigations, 17 audits, 17 profile interviews, 105 aspect queries, and 150 appraisals.

They tend to be the avoidance cases that are not the HWIs but are dealt with in our HWI unit.  In terms of some of the legislation around avoidance, I know the qualifying avoidance disclosure features in the chapter as well, which was a legislative provision to allow settlements to be made for avoidance before the changes.  We made some significant proposals to the Department for changes in our anti-avoidance provisions because some of the avoidance practices were so off the radar that they would certainly move across the line.  I was here last year talking about some of the medical consultants project.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did a chapter on the medical consultants, which ended up with approximately 28 of those settlements being published, which means they are in that space to which I referred.  Unfortunately, what happens in certain cases is that some practitioner comes up with a scheme and people sign up for it.  We always say that if it is too good to be true, it is too good to be true.  There is a load of litigation going on in that sphere, not involving the Revenue, where people have signed up for schemes that are just not right.</p></speech>

The testing of the constitutionality of charging provisions in excise law would not be unusual.  It goes back to some of the processes Mr. Gilligan would have spoken about earlier.  Some of our excise provisions will have to do with mineral oil, tobacco and alcohol and sometimes we seek to charge tax on people who have no wish to pay tax.</p></speech>

It is under Total Quantum per Tax Type, income tax.  The tax quantum per tax type is just in excess of &euro;19 million.  It states:</p><blockquote>This appeal relates to the taxation of certain monies found at the Appellant's dwelling during the course of an audit which the Respondent contends relates to untaxed self-employment income.  The Appellant submits the monies represent accumulated savings which are not taxable.</blockquote> <p>My reading of that is that some man or woman has tens of millions in cash in their attic.  The tax liability on that, including penalties or whatever, is now &euro;19 million.  To get to a point where the tax liability is &euro;19 million, what type of money would one be keeping in one's house to reach a tax liability of that amount?  It refers to certain moneys.  It does not refer to anything else so I presume it is cash, and it was found in the appellant's dwelling.</p></speech>

When a hearing is scheduled, there is an expectation that some cases will be determined before the end of the day.  What percentage are settled in this way?  How many go to court?

In other audits we identify what we see as undeclared income and we would seek to assess the tax liability.  If our evidence was good enough it may end up in a settlement process and tax, interest and penalties will be paid as part of the settlement.  Some go to appeal and there are various stages of the appeals process.  Some avoidance cases have gone through a process of judicial review in the High Court and the Supreme Court and then the appeal itself has to start.  That will involve the Tax Appeals Commission and then it may go to the High Court.  It could, potentially, go to the Supreme Court again and may even go to the ECJ.  Most of our cases are settled, however, and do not end up being appealed.  We publish our figures on this and we collect in the region of &euro;500 million in tax settlements.</p></speech>

It deals with businesses with a turnover in excess of &euro;3 million, businesses between &euro;1 million and &euro;3 million with over 100 employees or businesses, primarily in the construction industry, with relevant contracts tax where the contract values are in excess of &euro;3 million.  Partners of accountancy and legal partnerships whose turnover is greater than &euro;3 million are also in this category, as are proprietary directors associated with any of the above businesses, which brings in a lot of individuals.  The medium enterprise HWI unit brings in 622 individuals in addition to the proprietary directors of all those companies who have a total income in excess of &euro;500,000 and an effective tax rate of less than 30%.  It also brings in people whose total consideration from capital taxes exceeds &euro;700,000 or where total capital losses exceeds &euro;500,000, and those who have multiple property transactions over a three-year period exceeding &euro;3 million.</p></speech>

The process did not start at any one point because we are constantly looking at our structure.  In 2015, we were worried about the cases below the LCD threshold.  We were not worried about controlling them but about the fact that, depending on what part of the country a person was in, he or she might get different treatment on account of the resources available.  For example, resources in Kilkenny might be different from those in Galway.  We were keen to have a view of the national case base so we started a project on what we called the second-tier case base.  We set up seven second-tier branches within the regional structure and, last November, we looked at moving towards a process for five national divisions rather than the regional structure.  The staff are spread around these five national divisions.</p></speech>

It is an ongoing process and we have a lot of work to do on it.  We changed the case base over the October bank holiday weekend and we are now engaged in a massive communication exercise with staff across the organisation.  There has been a great level of co-operation from staff and I cannot get over how Revenue staff respond so positively and proactively at such times.  The trade unions come in to me to talk about what is happening and they want certainty because change can be a big challenge for people.  We have a lot of really good people based around the country and our case base is not in the same places.  We have set up an LCD corporate branch in Galway and we always had a bit of LCD in Cork and Limerick.  We have a HWI team outside Dublin and I would like at least one third of the resources for LCD, corporate and HWI to be outside Dublin.</p></speech>

The HWI base currently pays a lot of money.  It is also the case that the top 1% of income earners have 10% of the income while paying 21% of the income tax.  The top 10% have 35% of the income and pay 59% of total income tax and 58% of income tax and USC combined.  That is the cohort involved.  They are pay an awful lot of money.</p></speech>

Wealth is not assessed, but income is.  While Mr. Cody might say that group has a very high income tax level, there is significant variation.  On top of that there is the question of wealth and assets that are not included in the income measurement unless the owners derive income from that wealth.</p></speech>

I refer to the chapter on corporate taxation.  In Mr. Cody's opening contribute, he said that the Comptroller and Auditor General made no recommendations, and he is correct.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted a number of issues, as did the Chairman.  We made recommendations in one of our reports that a distinction between losses carried over and the non-use of capital allowances be made.  Is Mr. Cody picking up on that recommendation?  He has clarified that Revenue is obliged to act under the tax legislation.  To put it in plain English, companies can benefit from capital allowances they have not used and can benefit from trading losses that are carried over.  Revenue does not distinguish between that and is not able to give us the year by year breakdown.  We made a recommendation.  I am sure the Chairman was going to mention this as well.  Can Mr. Cody clarify what he thinks about that recommendation and what Revenue is doing about it?</p></speech>

Essentially, the challenge is that an unused capital allowance contributes to the calculation of the loss.  Two computations are not made.  The figure ends up as a total figure when it is carried forward..</p></speech>

Rather than putting everything under losses, it could be split up into what the losses are and what is unused under the capital allowances.

There is a 7% detection rate.  The most significant figure is the amount going back to the Government.  It is 79% of each packet of cigarettes.  Total excise and VAT now represents just over 79% of the retail price per pack in Ireland.  So 79% of the cost of every packet of cigarettes is going back to the Government.  There is a serious question there about health issues - it is for another day - if that much revenue is going back for every packet of cigarette consumed.  The detection rate is 7%.  How does it compare internationally?  In terms of scanning illegal products coming through, I understand that up to now Revenue could not distinguish.  Will Mr. Cody clarify that?</p></speech>

The reality of the factory is that a significant proportion of those cigarettes were bound for the British market.  They would not be all released in Ireland.  The system would not be able to cope.  The market is very interlinked.  We are embedded in OLAF and international co-operation.  In 2017, Poland seized 544 million cigarettes.</p><p>We seized 34 million.  It has a population approximately ten times our own.  In 2013, the UK had seizures of 378 million and we had seizures of 41 million.  In another year the UK had seizures of 508 million and we had seizures of 53 million.  I usually use the idea of dividing the number by ten.  We are proportionate but the figures jump around.  The level of tobacco tax we get is fairly static over the years, even allowing for the increase in excise duty.  That is from a significant reduction in people smoking.  Health motivation is an important aspect.  The Deputy is practically correct on the 80% figure, as the illicit trade in tobacco is like smuggling tax.  When somebody is buying 20 cigarettes, they are paying a lot of tax.</p></speech>

Mostly, the detection of illegal cigarettes or anything illegal comes from a number of processes, including intelligence, scanning, use of dogs etc.  Rarely is it a result of one aspect.

I would never come here and say that.  However, part of our realignment process increases resources directed at areas of risk.  That is what we do.  In fairness, every year when we are in here we pay very close attention to all the chapters.  If there are things we can learn from them, they influence what we do.</p></speech>

It is not a question.  I will not take any more time.  Real estate is the biggest sector for high-worth individuals.

Revenue-specific codes are 35%, but the witnesses have said that has fallen to 21% and it is different.</p></speech>

If the bells ring, I will just get through my questions with a view to finishing the meeting.  If another member arrives that will be that.</p> <p>  Not being a smoker myself, I do not normally concentrate on this end of things.  According to the figures the witnesses say are based on the 2017 survey, the nominal loss to the Exchequer in 2017 was &euro;229 million.  I am reading from Mr. Cody's opening statement.  In regard to following these matters up, two paragraphs later Mr. Cody writes that prosecutions have resulted in fines totalling &euro;140,250.  It must be the most profitable business in Ireland.  I will talk about the detection rates in a moment.  I have worked out that for every euro a person has paid in a fine, on average he or she has been involved in &euro;1,632 worth of illicit tobacco.  That is like winning the lottery every morning.  For the risk of being fined &euro;1 one can make &euro;1,632.  I find that a phenomenally low figure relative to the money that can be made.  Mr. Cody can see where I get these figures.</p> <p>  Somebody got a sentence of six months, I am sure with probation attached, a reduction in time or whatever.  Revenue cannot set the terms.  That is up to us.  As far as I can see, however, there is zero deterrent.  Someone can sell &euro;1,632 worth of illicit tobacco, and if he or she is one of those caught he or she will pay an average of &euro;1 in fines.  One person involved in that &euro;229 million worth of business got a short prison sentence.  I know about the price differential, the tax and how cheap they are in Europe, but this also has something to do with the extent of smuggling.  Is there anything more Revenue can do, or does it need more power?  It might require legislation.  That disparity speaks volumes.  Looking at the facts, I have never seen anything as profitable as smuggling cigarettes.</p></speech>

Does the Revenue pass them on to the HSE?  The HSE could undertake some promotion on this issue because a high number of people from eastern Europe are very heavy smokers and we will be paying for the hospital bills at the end of the day.  Is there any linkage between Revenue and the HSE on this issue?</p></speech>

It is just a cashflow issue.  Most people's general understanding was that this would ensure that people with an income of over &euro;400,000 would pay a minimum effective rate of tax of 30% but that is only half the sentence.  The other half is that the relief they utilised in one year can be carried forward if they have reduced income, or lower other reliefs, in the following year.  At the end of the day, the Exchequer has not got one extra bob out of this.  There will be a lot of public disappointment when it is realised that the Oireachtas allowed the relief to be carried forward to reduce tax in later years.  I blame myself, as a Member of the Oireachtas, but we codded the people on that one.  I do not believe that is what the public expected this measure to be.</p></speech>

I want to put that on the record.  We are here to scrutinise tax receipts as well as expenditure.</p><p> I will go through the schedule in the Revenue Commissioners' report.  It is all well and good publishing the report but in regard to the reliefs claimed, by far the biggest one is the &euro;98 million for the reliefs carried forward, which we have discussed.  In regard to the other big reliefs being utilised, 27 people claimed relief on hotels, holiday camps and cottages of &euro;7.6 million, which was an average of &euro;280,000 relief per person.  In regard to the urban renewal scheme and capital allowances for commercial buildings, 14 people claimed reliefs of &euro;1.6 million, which is an average of &euro;115,000 per individual.  In regard section 344 and multi-storey carpark allowances, this is a very lucrative allowance for some people.  Fewer than ten people claimed reliefs of &euro;3.6 million.  If there were ten of them, it would have been relief of &euro;360,000 per person.  If it was five, it would have been double that.  We do not have the figure but it is at least &euro;360,000 per individual.  In regard to section 372, qualifying urban relief and capital allowances for certain commercial buildings, 15 people claimed reliefs of &euro;2.15 million, which is an average relief of &euro;143,000 per person.  I am only listing those over &euro;100,000 because people ought to hear about reliefs.  I want to put what we are talking about on the record.  Section 372 relief applies for lessors of residential properties - it is a section 23-type relief - and 54 people claimed &euro;11.5 million in reliefs, which is an average of &euro;214,000 per individual.  Section 338 is relief arising under terminal losses of a business totalling &euro;7.1 million, which is an average of &euro;160,000 relief per individual.</p><p> I have mentioned the big one already, namely, losses forward.  Some 346 people claimed relief for losses forward of &euro;98 million, which is an average of &euro;383,000 relief per individual.  Are all those, not just the first one, carried forward year in, year out if a person claims a relief?  Is it just that big one, the carry forward excess relief?  Can all the others can be carried forward as losses forward if a person's incomes drop?</p></speech>

The other matter I want to discuss with Mr. Cody are his predictions in regard to the corporation tax receipts for this year and last year.  The letter he sent us dated 24 October is specifically on this issue.  I know he said it is up to the Department of Finance but he has a big input into the information the Department of Finance has.  We asked for a note because when it emerged during the summer that corporation tax receipts were surging ahead, it was said that this was due to a change in the accounting rules.  I took the view that those types of rules were predictable and did not happen overnight.  Mr. Cody said in his correspondence that there was a significant change for the telecommunications and software sectors, where long-term contracts are complex and arrangements are prevalent as to when they record their income.  He took the view that there is a transition period to record this but a number of these companies put it all into year one.  The Revenue Commissioners could not predict that which led to the &euro;350 million of extra receipts.</p></speech>

There is great co-operation but the reality is that one can see when a company is doing its quarterly or six monthly report, and it misses its own forecast targets.  There is volatility in corporation tax receipts with the small number of companies that have such an influence, and we have discussed this at length.  A company can be significantly out and this can have an impact if it is one of the big companies.</p></speech>

This &euro;350 million is due to the International Accounting Standards, IAS, rule 15 change, that we spoke about.  That means there is another &euro;415 million unexplained in Mr. Cody's letter.

It concerns people who have a lot of deposit interest retention tax, DIRT.  We often hear about constituents who have been notified by Revenue that they had "X" amount.  What is the protocol or procedure?  Are there many such notifications?</p></speech>

That will be integrated into our system.  It will lead to the abolition of all the "P" forms such as the P45, the P60, the P30 and the P35.  The 2018 P35 will be the last such form.  It will be due in February.  We will then populate individual employees' tax and credit data on an ongoing basis to ensure that employees get the right reliefs and credits as they are paid.  When it comes to January 2020 when we have the first full year, we will be able to carry out automatic reviews.  Most people under PAYE have one salary.  Everything should work reasonably well but many people have multiple wages.  Some employers have not been operating the proper tax credit system but we will be able to integrate and adjust it throughout the year.  It is a massive change.  We have been involved in significant engagement with employer groups all over the country.  It will be the most significant change in the tax administration system since the introduction of self-assessment.  In some ways, it will be bigger than that because it will affect 2.7 million people.</p></speech>

It has significant positive benefits for employees and it will have significant benefits for compliant employers.  At present they must complete a P35 for us.

We have been conducting seminars throughout the country and somebody told one of our crew that he had got the software because of this.

A couple of members asked me to make a final comment to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When his report came out at the end of September the chapter about the number of high worth individuals paying less income tax than many people on the average industrial wage created an impression among the public.  I got the same impression and I had to telephone him about it that day.  It created the impression that there were many wealthy people in Ireland.  It transpired very quickly that some of them might not be in Ireland at all and might just have a property in Ireland.  Many of us probably did not read the detail of the chapter, which is the first thing that must be said.  People looked at the headline, myself included.  I believe I got it right by 6 p.m. but I might have got it wrong earlier.  I hope somebody does not produce a transcript of something I said.
