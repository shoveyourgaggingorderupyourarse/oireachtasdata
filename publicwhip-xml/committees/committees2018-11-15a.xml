He is joined by Ms Mahin Fitzpatrick, senior auditor.  We will meet the Revenue Commissioners today and a number of chapters in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General relate to Revenue.  We will also have a private meeting in the afternoon.  I suggest, therefore, that for reasons of time we confine our discussion on the business of the committee to one hour.  We will go as far as we can and commence our meeting with the Revenue at 10 a.m.  That is agreed.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputies Pat Deering and Peter Burke.  I will hold over the minutes of the previous meeting for the moment.  Arising from the previous meeting, the clerk will circulate wording tomorrow, for consideration next week, regarding our recommendation for a D&aacute;il debate on the winding down of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  We agreed last week that there should be a D&aacute;il debate on the issue but we have to table a formal motion, which must be circulated to members for their consideration in advance before it can be agreed.  We can agree the motion for a D&aacute;il debate on NAMA's expected surplus next week.</p> <p>  No. 3 is correspondence.  The first category is category A, briefing documents and the opening statement for today's meeting.  No. 1709A is from Mr. Niall Cody and encloses a briefing document.  No. 1723A is the opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish these documents.</p> <p>  The next category of correspondence is category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers in follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and other correspondence for publishing.  We will hold over a number of matters from the previous meeting.  We got through a significant number of items last week.  I hope we will deal with all of them next week.</p> <p>  No. 1677B is from Chief Superintendent Dermot Mann of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is dated 31 October 2018.  It provides information requested by the committee on the operation of CCTV by local authorities.  It sets out the relevant legislation and statutory instruments and refers to the CCTV advisory committee and community CCTV schemes.  I know of a number of local authorities where CCTV schemes have not yet been finalised.  Given that the letter will be of interest to many people, we will note and publish it.</p> <p>  No. 1693B is from Ms Orlaith McBride, director of the Arts Council, dated 1 November 2018, enclosing an information note requested by the committee providing details in respect of matters raised in the audit opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the 2017 financial statements.  Significant issues arise in this regard and the one which attracted our attention in the first instance was the circumstances that gave rise to &euro;196,000 in funding being provided to an outside agency that went into liquidation.  The Arts Council has provided a detailed and comprehensive response.  I note that it dealt with the organisation in question, Filmbase, for 30 years.  We can understand, therefore, why the money continued to be paid each year.  The council did not get the audited accounts it sought for 2016.  It wanted the matter examined by its internal auditors but shortly afterwards Filmbase into liquidation.  The Arts Council is dealing with the liquidator to try to recover the moneys but it is listed as a trade creditor.  It made payments to some of those who should have been paid by Filmbase to avoid them being left high and dry.  It is doing all it can at this stage to recover the money.  When dealing with liquidators, people have to wait and see, as we all know.</p> <p>  No. 1698B is from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General of the Department of Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht, dated 6 November 2018, providing details requested by the committee on the performance delivery agreement between the Department and Galway 2020.  I propose we note and publish that correspondence.</p></speech>

We will place it in the public arena, rather than sitting on it, in order that people can see the significant costs involved.</p> <p>  No. 1703B is from Mr. Paul Dunne, CEO of the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, dated 2 November 2018 in respect of a request from the committee for a copy of a report arising from a value for money review of Irish Public Bodies, IPB, insurance.  Mr. Dunne advises that the report is subject to a non-disclosure agreement between the LGMA, Irish Public Bodies and PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, dated 2 September 2015.  Mr Dunne has written to IPB and PwC to request their consent for the LGMA to release the report to the committee and is waiting for a response.  It is important to point out that this was a report on insurance claims.  It became clear during our discussion with the State Claims Agency that the section 38 organisations come under the State Claims Agency and account for between &euro;3 billion and &euro;4 billion of activity each year.  I asked whether the local authorities could come within the remit of the State Claims Agency.  The local authorities currently obtain cover through IPB insurance and we asked for a copy of the value for money report.  We have been told it is very difficult to obtain a copy.  In addition, Mr. Dunne of the LGMA confirms that "there are currently legal proceedings in being in relation to the release of the Report bearing Reference - High Court Record No. 2017 /321MCA."  In addition, he notes that the case "is an appeal by IPB of a decision of the Information Commissioner with regard to the release of the Report under the Freedom of Information Act, 2014."</p><p>The Information Commissioner has said that this is to be released but Irish Public Bodies has gone to the High Court to prevent it.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I will watch this closely but the proper procedure is that, if the report has been carried out on the question of public bodies, which are funded substantially by a Vote of the Oireachtas even if they are not directly accountable to this Oireachtas, having insurance policies for claims made against them by members of the public, it should be published.  It is very disappointing to hear that Irish Public Bodies is going to the High Court to prevent such an important report being published when the Information Commissioner has said it should be published.  We will come back to this because there is a big insurance issue here.  We are also dealing with matters relating to the State Claims Agency.  Claims to local authorities might not specifically be under our remit but they are in the same space as far as the public are concerned.  It is disappointing that IPB is trying to block the release of this report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018111500002#C00200"><p>There is a cost associated with doing it too, in the form of legal costs at High Court level.  Different arms of the State are doing different things.  There is supposed to be an open Government approach which, in theory, would give a much clearer view of how decisions are made and should reduce the need for freedom of information requests, as well as the costs of administration and other things.  However, this approach does not seem to have permeated some arms of the State.  Its building on Usher's Quay is called Local Government House but the Local Government Management Agency seems to have an enclosed mindset, even in the context of engaging with us as we saw last week.</p></speech>

I will say something on behalf of the public.  We all talk about joined-up Government and this is an example of the issues.  Local government is seen as the local arm of the Government and if local governments go to the High Court to prevent the release of information they are preventing the release of information to other public bodies.  People can make multiple claims against different local authorities and State bodies and it is not in the public interest when people make sure that information is not shared.  There should be some information relating to the total number of claims against all State bodies.  People need to know because it involves billions of euro in liabilities.</p></speech>

Correspondence No. 1722, dated 13 November and which was received yesterday, is related and provides a copy of an internal report on the acquisition of Miesian Plaza on Baggot Street, which is the headquarters of the Department of Health.  There is an amount of documentation in both items and I propose to note and publish them.  There is a lot in them, much of which is technical, with one document of 204 pages.</p></speech>

There is a large amount of documentation on the agreement by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to proceed on the basis of value for money.  There is a valuation report from Jones Lang LaSalle, dated 31 March, which looked at the Central Bank complex on Dame Street, which we also inquired about.  There is also an appendix on rents and comparable lettings.  We have correspondence from a former valuer of the OPW, whom we will meet in due course and we will include this in the items of correspondence for that day.  There is no need for us to get into the specifics of these detailed reports at this stage, though I wish to highlight one item.</p> <p>  No. 1704B includes a chronological note from the OPW relating to the Eyre Square building and on the 50 flood protection schemes under CFRAM.  It also gave us a report on arbitration and a historical breakdown of the proportion of leased versus owned office accommodation.  In 2009, 51% of its overall portfolio was leased and 49% owned but in 2015 44%  was leased versus 56% owned, so the office has been in a position to let go of some of its leased buildings over a period of time.  This is on page 12 of the document, if members want to have a look at it.</p> <p>  Finally, No. 1704(xvi) is a letter with 17 or 18 appendices about the national children's science museum, which is an issue nobody had really heard of.  There is a detailed briefing note on that scheme and a three-page document.  It seems to be an orphan project and no Department seems to want to own it.</p><p>The last sentence states:</p><blockquote>The Chairman [that is obviously of ICML, the organisation involved in this]  believes that the relationship between the State and the ICML requires [further] redefinition, taking guidance from the views of the current Government.  In what might prove to be a positive development, the promoters have now indicated that they would be prepared to transfer the project to full State ownership on completion.</blockquote><p>That is a little step in the right direction because the matter had been bogged down in terms of the ownership and management of it.  We will certainly note and publish that because most other capital cities have a children's science museum and we should have one.  Perhaps there has been some progress in that regard.  We will note and publish it and if anyone wants to come back to it at a later do, they may do so.<br/><br/>The next item is 1705B<b></b>from Ms Pamela Carter, parliamentary affairs division, Department of Health, responding to the following matters raised at our meeting last week: CervicalCheck helpline; and terms of reference of the expert group on tort and management of clinical negligence claims.  We will note and publish that, but hold it over.  I am sure we will come back to the clinical negligence issue because of the State Claims Agency, and also, in due course, the CervicalCheck issue.</p></speech>

I have had contact, as I am sure have other members, with people following the meeting last week about other strands of liability.  A broad range of issues make up that liability and we almost have to decouple them from where the liability lies if we are to get to an approach that involves a different system.  Despite what the State Claims Agency says, one has to go legal.  What we heard about the way claims occur nearly always has to be legal.  It is not about mediation in the way we understand mediation.  If a couple are getting divorced, the two parties sit in different rooms with another person to try to work things out, and they never end up anywhere near the court.  That is now how it is in this case; one almost has to make a statement of claim.  We will never get beyond that to a different system unless the system itself is challenged.  That is not to say that the State Claims Agency should not robustly go through claims.  Obviously, people will make claims that are overstated and so on but I do not believe we have got to the point where we are looking at the process in the kind of detail necessary to address that.</p> <p>  On the second issue, CervicalCheck, we were spun a yarn last week about the length of time it is taking to release the slides.  I continue to have conversations with seven families and a solicitor on the practical side of things.  I restate that people are waiting for slides from April, May and June, which are not being released.  We were told that the average waiting time was 22 weeks but that is a fib, and we should not accept that from the HSE.</p></speech>

The reason that is occurring is because people have not been able to get their slides to make a judgment call as to whether they will sign up.  The release of the slides is an impediment to a range of different aspects.  We are being told certain points that do not match with the experience of people who have had a failure on the State side in terms of the way information was relayed to them, at the very least.</p></speech>

We will request the figure per month in terms of when the requests started, from October going back to March.  We need to find out the number still outstanding from last April, May, June and so on and if they do not know it, that says it all.  They should be able to give that information promptly.</p></speech>

They may be measuring two different things.  An approach may have been made in April or May but, in clarifying the information the applicant needed to supply, they were not in a position to supply the slides until they got all the information.  It may be down to a definition of what is being measured that may be the explanation.  I understand the difficulty.  If somebody makes a request, that should be the starting point of the clock.  That would be my argument.</p></speech>

For example, one of the solicitors involved told me that Quest Diagnostics had been releasing the slides in June and July but it was told to cease releasing them until a protocol was put in place.  That was put in place in August.  I accept there needs to be security around the slides-----</p></speech>

It is tying this up in a hugely administrative approach.  I do not believe any of us expected that releasing slides to 221 individuals or families would be tied up in that.

We have begun to break it down and we asked for very detailed specific information, not down to identifying people.  Quite a bit of information will come to us, more than anybody in the public arena has seen previously, which is very important.  That is an issue to which we will certainly return and deal with in depth.</p><p>The next item is 1706B<b></b>from Mr. Paddy O'Keeffe, Tax Appeals Commission, dated 7 November 2018, providing an update requested by the committee on high value appeals.  We mentioned the large number of high value appeals.  If people want to raise it with the Revenue witnesses today, they are free to do so.  We will note and publish that.</p><p>No. 1707B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell, dated 8 November 2018, providing a briefing note in regard to circulars in the context of the regularisation process provided for in a HSE circular regarding the regularisation of acting posts in conjunction with the new arrangements for the filling of short-term posts and the reintroduction of senior staff nurse positions.  Essentially, some people felt that while the HSE said it sent out the circular and the information to the different heads of the organisation, many people on the ground are saying that it never worked its way down to that level.  This letter makes that clear and we note and publish this and send it back to the correspondent who raised this matter with us in the first place and to let staff who are still aggrieved in relation to the process know that there is no cost to putting in a claim and there is a grievance procedure in this matter which is outlined in section 4 of that briefing note.<br/><br/>No. 1711B is from Ms Mary Lawlor, communications and public affairs manager with NAMA, providing further details requested by the committee on Project Nantes.  I propose we send a copy of this to Deputy Wallace who raised the matter and on whose suggestion I also raised the matter here.  I will read that letter because it is interesting and gives a broader perspective on the matter.  I will skip a sentence or two because it is so big but because of the amount of money involved and the controversy I will respond on this because there was an article on this issue in the Sunday newspapers as well.  The letter reads as follows:</p><blockquote>I refer to your letter dated 23 October 2018 in which you requested additional information regarding Project Nantes.<br /><br />As regards the first and second queries raised in the letter, NAMA wishes to point out that Project Nantes was only one of a number of separate transactions involving the debtor connection.  Overall, the connection&rsquo;s par debt was &euro;489 million on acquisition by NAMA.  This included some &euro;260 million of debt categorised as equity-backed loans which had been advanced to the connection by the participating institutions i.e. these loans were secured not by property collateral but by intangible assets (such as personal guarantees) which had no tangible value.  NAMA did not pay the participating institutions any consideration for these &euro;260 million equity-backed loans.  Thus, only &euro;229 million of the &euro;489 million par debt acquired was secured by tangible property assets with a realisable market value.</blockquote><p>That is important because it means that in relation to this particular person, the amount of loans that NAMA took over was &euro;489 million - &euro;229 million of that amount was secured by property and the other &euro;260 million was only secured by way of a personal guarantee and because the personal guarantee was not tangible, NAMA paid zero for that &euro;260 million.  It is important to put it out there that NAMA did not pay for a considerable amount of the &euro;489 million because it only effectively paid for a portion of the &euro;229 million.  That said, the taxpayer was caught in the hoop for all of it because we bailed out the banks for the shortfall.  NAMA might say that its side of it is clear but the taxpayer was caught for 100% of that unsecured loan because the banks had to receive funding as a result of that.  The letter continues with the following:</p><blockquote>The debtor connection agreed to initiate a programme of asset sales and debt refinancing so as to maximise recovery for NAMA ... Ultimately, total proceeds of approximately &euro;200 million were realised from loan, property and other loan security realisations.  As part of the disposal programme, a loan sale of debt with a par value of &euro;352 million, designated Project Nantes, realised proceeds of &euro;26.6 million.  This transaction included &euro;241 million (&euro;260 million at acquisition) in equity-backed loans (for which NAMA had not paid consideration) and &euro;111 million par debt secured by assets.  Therefore, the &euro;26.6 million realised for Project Nantes related to par debt loans of &euro;111 million (part of the original acquired property-secured par debt of &euro;229 million).<br /><br />Thus, in total, proceeds of approximately &euro;200 million were realised from the asset sales and loan sale/refinancing, equating to a recovery of 87% of the original acquired property-secured par debt of &euro;229 million. The proceeds realised were well in excess of the recovery target set by NAMA for the connection and the acquisition value paid by NAMA to the participating institutions.<br /><br />As regards the third query raised in the Committee&rsquo;s letter, I can advise that NAMA has been investigating this matter.  As part of this, NAMA undertook a review of the written confirmations and warranties in respect of section 172(3) of the NAMA Act 2009, which were provided by the borrowers and purchaser at the time of the loan sale in 2012.  These confirm that the borrower and purchaser were compliant with the requirements of section 172(3) of the NAMA Act 2009.  Following enquiries raised by NAMA, it has been established that the party who has been identified as a director of the purchaser entity was not a NAMA debtor.</blockquote><p>Maybe there was another connection with a NAMA debtor but the letter says that the person was not a NAMA debtor so there is wiggle room there.  The letter continues with the following:</p><blockquote>NAMA wishes to be helpful to the Committee but is required by law to operate by reference to the prohibitions on disclosure of confidential debtor information.</blockquote><p>Essentially it cannot say more.  There is some information there but there is still some wiggle room in there.  Some people are interested in that and I read it into the record because it is big money, it is a matter people are concerned about and it has attracted much public comment.<br/><br/>We note and publish that letter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

We are not here to go through something minutely to try to find details.  The onus is on every organisation that comes in here to disclose to us that everything has been done properly.  It is being pushed the other way.</p></speech>

However, what we are asking is not an unreasonable question.  The Deputy is right.  We could have just noted and published it and moved on.  Serious issues are raised and people feel that we should follow matters through and of course we do so we will go back and ask for further clarification of that.</p></speech>

That is a bit like Revenue saying it is a self assessment system but that there is no audit in place.</p></speech>

We said that it was a concern that it was taking assurances at face value.  The same discussion can be had with Revenue.  That creates a significant declaration and it is a legally important declaration.  It is a control process that is not insignificant but verification or standing up of matters is obviously important.</p></speech>

While there is a prohibition on the disclosure of information under section 202, it is important that the committee note that subsection (5) reads: "Nothing in subsection (2) prevents the disclosure of information ... in the course of giving evidence before a House of the Oireachtas or a Committee of either or both such Houses".

We are not legal experts.  We cannot be expected to know the subsections of section 202.  I thank Mr. McCarthy for highlighting it.  How could we be expected to know the full details of that?  We will revert to NAMA on that basis.  We will note and publish the correspondence but will follow up on it.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1714 B from Dr. Des Fitzgerald, president of the University of Limerick, UL, providing an update on steps taken by him to ensure the conclusions of the Thorn report are fully and swiftly implemented.  Dr. Fitzgerald states that there is a sharp focus on ensuring that matters are dealt with fully and finally to restore the reputation of the university.</p> <p>  I will make a remark once we put the letter on screen.  There are multiple pages to it and I do not have the relevant part to hand.  The issue I wish to refer to is on page 3, step No. 8.  It reads: "At a hearing of the PAC, in the press and in communications to UL staff, I apologised on behalf of the university to the regulatory bodies, to current and former employees and to the people of the Mid West for what was revealed in the Thorn Reports."  It is all well and good apologising to staff and former staff, but what is the current position?  Saying "I am sorry" is fine, but has anything been done in practice?  I want to know the current status of the staff to which Dr. Fitzgerald referred.  They may have been whistleblowers.  Without identifying them by name, we need a note on their current employment status and how that apology was given practical effect.  If it has not been given proper legal effect, it is only words.</p></speech>

It is on our work programme.</p> <p>  Next, we held over No. 1595 C from our previous meeting.  We will revert to it.</p> <p>  Correspondence Nos. 1674 C, dated 22 October, and 1716 C, dated 7 November, are from an individual who made a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the OPW in terms of "Strengthening Civil Service Accountability and Performance".  We requested the relevant report at our meeting with the OPW.  Members will recall that the report reviewed five specific properties.  The individual also provides the details of other properties on which he believes value for money was not achieved, namely, the former Passport Office and the Garda offices on Harcourt Street.  The individual believes that an independent report should be commissioned by the OPW.</p> <p>  We have dealt with the correspondence from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman of the OPW, which provided considerable information, including background information, regarding recent developments in the property management division.  While we might have to return to this topic in the new year, I propose that we ask the chairman to provide a further update on developments to ensure effective property management and that we advise the correspondent accordingly.  We have agreed to invite in the former employee who wrote the report.  This is on our work programme.  We will deal with the matter as soon as we set a date.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 1697 C from an individual, forwarded to the committee, regarding a value for money query relating to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  The bank is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and I propose that, with the correspondent's permission and appropriate redactions, we forward the correspondence to the SBCI.  I understand that the clerk to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has been in correspondence with that organisation.  I propose that the two clerks liaise and seek an update on any intended action.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  This correspondence has gone to two committees.</p> <p>  No. 1710 C from an individual dated 8 November relates to property leases undertaken on behalf of the State by the OPW.  We will note this correspondence and take it into consideration during our meeting with the former OPW employee.</p> <p>  Nos. 1712 C and 1713 C, dated 7 November, are from an individual who has been in correspondence with us regarding Cork Education and Training Board, ETB.  The board has advised the committee that the individual agreed a full and final settlement with it of all outstanding complaints, including a provision that the individual would not apply for any further position within the ETB.  The Department of Education and Skills provided advice to the effect that the individual was free to accept or reject any or all of the settlement, and encouraging the individual to engage with the ETB, through the individual's legal advisers, to reach a settlement.  The responses from the ETB and the Department were forwarded to the correspondent.  I propose that we advise the correspondent that our consideration of the matter is now closed.  Has anyone a comment on this?  I think we taken it as far as we can?  While it sounds severe, the person, with the individual's legal advisers, signed the agreement.  We are not going to unravel an agreement into which someone entered freely, full stop.  That is all I can say.</p> <p>  That marks the end of today's correspondence.</p></speech>

This is one of those meetings where we need to signal well in advance what we want from them so that we do not find next week that they do not have what we are looking for and we get frustrated.

The financial relationship between the particular companies and the Department is not something they will share with us because they will tell us it is commercially sensitive.  That is at the heart of this.  We are told we are almost at zero unemployment and large amounts are being expended on companies and may continue to be.  If we cannot explore that, are we really getting under the bonnet at all?</p></speech>

Essentially in reaction to the committee's inquiries earlier in the year or at the end of last year, I decided to do this chapter to try to focus on the relevant performance issues.  We had to be careful about certain commercial information.  I think we have been and the Department was happy with that.</p> <p>  The committee's Standing Orders provide the option to hear certain information that is commercially sensitive in closed session.</p></speech>

When they appeared last time and the JobPath issue was raised, my recollection is that we got the figure for the overall spend.  Two companies roll this service out.  We got the overall figure but then we were told they could not give the breakdown for each company because then the other company would know.

The voluntary housing associations and the number of schemes that are in operation are very confusing, as is dealing with the amount of money being allocated to each scheme.

The 2017 Revenue account, which was certified in April 2018, was examined by the committee at a meeting last June.</p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s administration and operational expenses are charged to Vote 9, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, rather than the Revenue account.  The 2017 appropriation accounts show that the total spent by Revenue in the year was &euro;411 million. Taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;71 million, net expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;340 million.  The surrender for the year was &euro;3.4 million.</p> <p>  Chapter 17 examines the actions taken by Revenue in recent years to tackle the issue of tobacco smuggling, which represents a significant risk to tax receipts.  Revenue and the National Office for Tobacco Control commission an annual survey to estimate the extent of illicit tobacco related activity in Ireland.  Based on the survey, Revenue estimates that 13% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2017 were illegal, with an associated notional loss of revenue of approximately &euro;229 million.</p> <p>  Revenue seizures of cigarettes and tobacco in 2017 were worth in excess of &euro;20 million at normal prices, representing a potential loss to the Exchequer of &euro;16 million in taxes and duties.  Relative to the estimated overall loss of &euro;229 million, this implies a Revenue detection rate for illegal cigarettes of approximately 7%.  The value of any seizures that take place abroad with Revenue&rsquo;s assistance is not recorded as there is no formal mechanism in place to account for such events.</p> <p>  Figure 17.7 refers to expenditure of more than &euro;400,000 incurred by Revenue up to the end of August 2018 relating to the ongoing holding in Dublin Port of a ship that was seized in 2014 for carrying illegal cigarettes and tobacco.  Significant disposal costs may also arise.  This expenditure is charged to Vote 9.</p> <p>  Revenue published its first stand-alone strategy on combating the illicit tobacco trade covering the period 2011 to 2013.</p><p>A follow-on stand-alone strategy was not produced.  However, Revenue is finalising a national action plan to combat illicit tobacco, with a focus on increased international co-operation.</p><p> Chapter 18 outlines Revenue&rsquo;s approach to monitoring and managing the tax affairs of high wealth individuals.  These are managed by a dedicated unit within Revenue&rsquo;s large cases division.  A specific case manager is assigned to each individual.  As at June 2018, the unit was managing approximately 480 individuals.  The unit was also dealing with around 140 trusts, partnerships and other legal entities related to these individuals.  Revenue&rsquo;s criterion for someone to be considered a high wealth individual is that the person is known or believed to have net assets of more than &euro;50 million.  This is a high threshold compared with other jurisdictions.</p><p> High wealth individuals tend to operate in multiple business sectors.  Revenue's practice in that regard is to assign a sectoral code to each high wealth individual that reflects his or her primary activity.  On that basis, around one third of high wealth individuals operate primarily in the real estate sector.  High wealth individuals&rsquo; tax liabilities cover a range of tax categories.  At the time of the examination, the most recent data provided by Revenue on tax liabilities for high wealth individuals were for 2015.  In that year, high wealth individuals accounted for 3.4% of all net income tax due, 9.3% of capital gains tax receipts and 2% of all capital acquisitions tax receipts.</p><p> High wealth individuals filed 334 income tax returns in 2015.  The number of returns filed is lower than the number of individuals managed in the unit for a number of reasons. For example, a jointly assessed couple, both classed as high wealth individuals, would count as one taxpayer unit and file one income tax return.  The unit also monitors individuals known to have substantial economic interests in Ireland but who may not have a requirement to file an income tax return in Ireland.</p><p> The income tax due from high wealth individuals who made income tax returns in 2015 was highly concentrated, with very significant variations between the 334 returns.  Some 85% of the total income tax liability was due from just ten taxpayers.  Across the group, the average effective tax rate was 39.2%, more than double the average rate of 16.3% for all income taxpayers.  However, 90 high wealth individuals had an effective income tax rate less than the national average rate.</p><p> The examination reviewed a sample of 30 compliance interventions undertaken by Revenue which resulted in additional tax being collected from high wealth individuals.  Of these, 14 had availed of a qualifying avoidance disclosure programme, QAD, to settle their tax affairs.  A QAD allows a taxpayer who entered into a tax avoidance transaction to settle with Revenue by paying the full tax and interest due at the time of the disclosure.  Incentives for the taxpayer in such QAD cases are a 20% reduction in the amount of interest otherwise due and the avoidance of penalties and publication as defaulters.</p><p> For one of the intervention cases reviewed, Revenue had agreed to a phased payment arrangement on the basis of limited documentation.  Another 26 taxpayers involved in the same tax avoidance scheme were granted the same settlement arrangements without the specified evidence.  Revenue guidelines set out the evidence required but also state that some cases may fall outside the guidelines.  However, the guidelines do not explicitly state in what circumstances such an exception should be made.</p><p> Chapter 19 reviews recent trends in corporation tax losses and follows on from a report I presented last year on corporation tax.  Companies are liable for corporation tax in respect of all profits arising from income or gains.  Where a company reports a trading loss, that loss can be used to obtain relief from the payment of corporation tax.  Losses carried forward by companies can be made up of a combination of unused capital allowances and trading losses.  However, Revenue&rsquo;s systems do not identify unused capital allowances carried forward separately from the overall losses carried forward.  There is a high degree of concentration in companies that have accumulated losses.  In 2016, a total of &euro;231 billion of losses and unused capital allowances was available for offset against profits.  Those available losses and allowances could potentially result in the lowering, over a number of future years, of corporation tax receipts by the order of &euro;29 billion.  This overhang of losses is, consequently, a key variable in the outturn of corporation tax receipts.</p><p> As has been noted previously, corporation tax receipts have consistently outperformed forecasts in recent years, particularly since 2015.  Based on prior year trends, Revenue forecasts receipts on a net basis, that is, after the impact of losses.  Separate forecasting of gross receipts and of the usage of losses may offer some potential for improved forecasting accuracy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.204" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018111500002#K00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to make my opening statement.  Today's meeting is to focus on the Revenue Vote and three chapters of the 2017 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General published in September.  These are chapter 17 - Tackling Tobacco Smuggling, chapter 18 - Management of High Wealth Individuals' Tax Liabilities and chapter 19 - Corporation Tax Losses.  In welcoming this opportunity to address the findings of the report, I draw the committee's attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.</p> <p>  Revenue's role is to serve the community by fairly and efficiently collecting taxes and duties and implementing customs controls.  Our aim is to protect Exchequer funds and ensure that everyone meets their tax and duty obligations in accordance with the law.  Our strategy is consistent across all taxpayer segments.  We provide the service to make it as easy as possible for taxpayers to understand and meet their tax and duty obligations and we prioritise the protection of Exchequer funds and support compliant taxpayers by identifying, targeting, and tackling non-compliance on a risk basis.</p> <p>  Revenue's response to non-compliance in all its forms, from the more straightforward non-filing of tax returns to complex tax avoidance schemes and criminal tax and excise fraud, is risk based, proportionate and responsive to taxpayer behaviour.</p> <p>  In chapter 17, the Comptroller and Auditor General reviews Revenue's progress in tackling tobacco smuggling and acknowledges that this is a global problem.  The European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, estimates that cigarette smuggling costs national and EU budgets more than &euro;10 billion annually.  The illicit tobacco trade is known to be dominated by internationally organised criminal groups who are often also involved in other crime such as drug smuggling, money laundering and people trafficking.</p> <p>  In Ireland, tobacco taxation is a key policy instrument in reducing tobacco consumption.  In keeping with the Government's public health objectives, we have one of the highest rates of tobacco tax in Europe.  In the most popular price category of cigarettes, total tax, excise and VAT, now represents just over 79% of the retail price per pack in Ireland.  Tobacco tax is a significant source of revenue and generated &euro;1.4 billion in tax receipts in 2017.  While the high tax policy has resulted in progress in reducing tobacco consumption, the trade-off is that it incentivises illicit trade.  Tackling this is a key priority for Revenue.</p> <p>  Measurement of the illicit tobacco trade is known to be challenging.  In a report in 2014, the World Health Organization, WHO, Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, FCTC, recognised that all methods to estimate illicit tobacco trade have their limitations.  That report indicated the very wide variations between countries in the percentage of the national cigarette market constituted by illicit cigarettes, for example, Latvia at 41%, Sweden at 20%, and Italy at 3.5%, and estimated the market share for illicit cigarettes within the EU at 10.4%.</p> <p>  Revenue's best estimate of the scale of the illicit tobacco market in Ireland is provided by an annual survey conducted by Ipsos MRBI on behalf of Revenue and the national tobacco control office of the HSE.  The primary usefulness of this measure is to track the trend over time.  The 2017 survey found 13% of packs to be illegal, up from 10% in 2016 and 12% in 2015.  This follows the recognised trend Europe wide.  For comparative purposes, in the UK, where a high tobacco tax policy similarly applies, in 2016-2017 the illicit cigarette market was 15%, up from 13% in 2015-2016 and 8% in 2014-2015.</p><p>Based on 2017 survey results, the nominal loss to the Exchequer in 2017 is approximately &euro;229 million in excise and VAT.  While this provides an indication of the financial significance of the problem, it is based on the improbable assumption that if there were no illicit cheap cigarettes, those smokers would buy the same number of more expensive, taxed cigarettes using money they are currently not spending on any form of taxable consumption.  That aside, we know that the illicit tobacco trade represents a significant threat to Government health policy, Exchequer funds, legitimate trade and Revenue's strategy to maximise voluntary compliance.  We also know that it funds international organised crime.  Revenue devotes considerable resources to challenging all stages in the supply chain for illicit tobacco products.  We work to identify and target those involved in smuggling, supplying or selling illicit tobacco products, with a view to disrupting supply, seizing the illicit products and maximising our impact by prosecuting those involved, wherever possible.</p><p> In 2017 we seized more than 34.24 million cigarettes and 1,768 kg of tobacco with a combined retail value of &euro;20.34 million.  The comparative figures to the end of October this year are 58.9 million cigarettes and 1,685 kg of tobacco with a total retail value of &euro;36.5 million.  This includes tobacco products seized in March 2018, when a Revenue-led operation resulted in the discovery and closure of a counterfeit cigarette factory in County Louth, the first of its kind to be discovered in the State.  Up to the end of October this year, our prosecution cases for tobacco smuggling or selling offences have resulted in 60 summary convictions, five indictable convictions, fines totalling &euro;140,250, nine suspended sentences and one custodial sentence of six months' imprisonment.  Alongside this, Revenue has worked with the Department of Health over the past two years on a new "track and trace" system to regulate the legitimate tobacco supply chain across Europe.  Revenue was recently designated by the Government as the competent authority in Ireland for this new system, which is due to be introduced during 2019.</p><p> To summarise, we aim to contain and diminish the illicit tobacco market to the greatest extent possible.  Our performance is probably most appropriately measured by the outcomes of our efforts and changes in the size of the illicit tobacco market here relative to other countries with similar tobacco tax policies.  I assure the committee that tackling the illicit tobacco trade will continue to be a key Revenue priority as, in tandem with facilitating the free flow of legitimate trade, we work to identify, target and confront a diverse and agile smuggling trade operated at global level with significant involvement of both national and international organised crime groups.  We meet these challenges by prioritising national and international co-operation, investment in technology, and intelligence development.  We work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Criminal Assets Bureau, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the European Anti-Fraud Office, Europol and fellow customs administrations in the EU and beyond.  In the context of our structural realignment, our actions will be co-ordinated in a national operational plan to maximise our impact on those involved at every stage of the illegal supply chain and deliver the best possible outcome in protecting Exchequer funds.</p><p> Turning to chapter 18 on the management of high-wealth individuals' tax liabilities, the Comptroller and Auditor General reports that in 2015, 334 high-worth individuals, HWIs, paid a total &euro;545 million in income tax, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax.  In line with best international practice, and since 2003, Revenue has dealt with large corporates and HWIs in a dedicated large cases division.  In a further refinement to this model this year, we have divided the large cases division, LCD, into two: one division focuses on large corporates, and the other on HWIs, including family members and related entities.  A significant feature of the HWI segment is that HWIs' income derives largely from capital rather than earnings.  The IMF notes that globally, HWIs maintain more than half of their wealth portfolio in cash and equities, the balance in property and investments - for example, funds, derivatives, currency, and commodities.  A stock of wealth may be held personally, in trusts, and in legal entities effectively controlled by an individual or family group.  Flows of income may fluctuate and may be planned and managed.  From our experience, we also know that individuals who have a high level of accumulated net wealth are likely to be actively engaged in wealth management and personal tax planning and subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and, in the context of wealth preservation, pay attention to global and local tax policy and legislation.</p><p> There is no evidence, and Revenue does not assume, that wealthy individuals are more likely to be tax non-compliant.  As a result of the financial complexities and potential tax yield in the HWI segment, Revenue applies close individual attention, and considerable skill and expertise, to managing tax compliance across the sector.  Revenue case managers use their detailed case knowledge, together with our data analytics capabilities and the extensive available range of Revenue, third party and internationally exchanged information, to manage compliance, profile risk and identify cases for intervention.  In 2017, the total yield in tax, interest and penalties from our HWI compliance interventions was &euro;15.3 million.</p><p> This chapter also refers to tax avoidance, which occurs where transactions are undertaken primarily to give rise to a tax advantage.  The focus of Revenue anti-avoidance teams encompasses the entire case base because use of legislation other than as intended can present real risks to the tax base and the perceived fairness of the tax system.  Also, and in line with international best practice, our HWI and anti-avoidance units work closely together.  We identify and investigate schemes and oversee legal challenges up to the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court, as may be required, or negotiate a tax settlement, including interest and penalties, as appropriate.  We make any necessary recommendations for legislative amendments to prevent tax leakage.</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General goes on in chapter 19 to consider corporation tax trading losses, capital allowances and losses carried forward.  There are no recommendations for Revenue in this chapter.  Last month I wrote to the committee, as requested, setting out Revenue's work on the estimation of corporation tax receipts, operating as we do in a supporting role to the Department of Finance, which compiles and publishes forecasts of all taxes, including corporation tax.</p><p> In summary, the Comptroller and Auditor General makes five recommendations on tackling tobacco smuggling and three on the management of HWIs' tax liabilities, all of which are agreed.  Consistent with Revenue's focus on continuous improvement to achieve the best possible return on resources, our new national structure deploys staff across a broad geographical spread, our national operational plan will co-ordinate and integrate our anti-smuggling actions and we are engaged in a significant risk-based shift of resources towards our medium enterprise, HWI and large corporates divisions.  I have provided a separate note to the committee on our structural realignment under way.  The purpose of our realignment is to provide a greater match of resources to risk, to reflect the changes in the economic environment in which we operate and to maximise the use of our resources across the country.  Among the levers that make this possible are the digital dividends and efficiencies created by our ongoing investment in data analytics, our extended range of online services, and key projects such as PAYE modernisation.  Finally, and given the focus of chapter 18 on a very small, distinct group of taxpayers, I again draw the committee's attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.  Subject to this constraint, I am happy to answer any questions from the committee.</p></speech>

There is only one game in town today.  The news broke as we came in here this morning that Dominic Raab had resigned from the UK Cabinet, and by the time we were coming down the stairs the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Esther McVey, had followed him out the door.  These resignations have sent reverberations across the political world, especially in Europe.  The reality is that Theresa May probably expected someone to go overboard but, obviously, her Brexit Secretary is a significant loss.  To lose one Brexit Secretary is unfortunate but she has lost two.  We could be calling on Oscar Wilde to pen Mrs. May's obituary by the end of the day.</p><p>It brings the reality of a hard crash into sharper focus.  While one would not want to talk it up, it must be discussed.  </p><p> I remember on budget day this year, as the officials from the Department of Finance filed into the Chamber and sat to the right of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in the area reserved for them, Mr. Cody was in their midst.  In his Budget Statement, the Minister made fleeting reference to the Revenue Commissioners and the potential Border posts, but it was our finance spokesperson, Deputy Michael McGrath, who in his speech pressed the Minister on this and on the Government's plans to hire just 200 Brexit customs officials by the deadline next spring, even though it was reported in the press that Revenue estimated an extra 600 members of staff were needed for the transition period and the future EU-UK trade deal.  Will Mr. Cody confirm that just 200 officials will be trained and in place by 29 March next year?  Does Revenue need the 600 officials, as reported in the media on the day of the budget?  Was the contingency plan in the safe in Revenue headquarters adjusted down this morning before Mr. Cody came in here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.209" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018111500002#M00200"><p>I find this to be an interesting position to be in.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has invited me in to talk about Brexit next Tuesday.  I replied yesterday suggesting it might be more opportune to have the discussion some time later, given we are now in the midst of what is very much a political process.</p> <p>  In regard to the commentary about our requirement for Brexit, Government decisions that took place in July and September relating to the recruitment of additional staff and the case we have made, the Minister set out in an answer to a recent parliamentary question from Fianna F&aacute;il's finance spokesman that in September the Government approved our case for additional resources from now until January 2021.  The agreement was that we would require approximately 600 additional members of staff for the end of the transition period.  In the decision in September, which was picked up and analysed by the media, we set out a planned recruitment campaign, which has started, and approximately 40 people in this quarter will enter a dedicated training programme for customs.  In the first quarter of next year, we will hire an additional 230 officials, resulting in 270 being in place for 29 March to facilitate the ongoing engagement with industry on Brexit-related issues and the implications for customs because it tends to be the larger corporations that are engaged in importing and exporting outside the community.  We agreed that over the remainder of 2019 and through the start of 2020 we will continue our recruitment process to have the 600 officials in place by the end of the transition period.  </p> <p>  That was as it was set out at the time but when people hear the figures it is all added up together and they wonder where the new staff are, but that was the planned process.  In the event of no deal, we agreed, as the Minister stated in his reply to the parliamentary question, we would have to consider how we could speed up the process of recruitment.  We will not have everyone in place by April, but we will be able to speed up recruitment.  We did a recent recruitment process for staff for trade facilitation.  Advertisements closed in September and in excess of 3,000 people applied for the jobs.  We started the interview process and the top 40 will be hired from the panel.  We will continue the process of assessing, interviewing and hiring the new staff through the normal recruitment process.  </p> <p>  In the event of a change of plan, we would have to think about how more could be brought in more quickly, but we also have other resources.  One of the things we do in our organisation is redeploy, and we pride ourselves on having the flexibility to respond to events.  The key issue for our planning for whatever outcome of Brexit is to ensure the information and communications technology, ICT, infrastructure is in place to cope with multiples of customs entries if the UK becomes a third country.  </p> <p>  In budget 2017, following the Brexit referendum in June 2016, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, provided for an additional &euro;2 million to improve our ICT development and have it in place because it is the key.  We used that money well and we are satisfied that we have scaled up our ICT infrastructure.  It will be able to cope with significant multiples of what it could cope with in March this year.</p></speech>

Deputy Michael McGrath contended that Government and Revenue should have taken the opportunity afforded by the high number of applications to recruit the number that Revenue needs, although I appreciate Mr. Cody's point that the media put a spin on the figures.  I know everyone uses soft language in the D&aacute;il Chamber, conscious of the need to "de-dramatise", to use that popular word, but if one turns on the television, one will see Theresa May going through Cabinet members like Brian Cody goes through hurls on a training night in Kilkenny.  She is going down.  That is happening.  I would appreciate if Mr. Cody could be candid and tell us and, more important, the public the truth.  If this thing spirals out of control, will Revenue be able to react?  He said Revenue was asked about the possibility of speeding up the process, and that will probably be required.  I appreciate his point about investment in ICT infrastructure, but will Revenue have enough trained officials by March 2019 to deal with the doomsday scenario, or will a "Dad's Army" scenario be required?</p></speech>

I spoke here and in other committees about the UCC as adopted in 2015, which is to be implemented between 2015 and 2025 by EU member states.  There is a range of options contained in it and, in that context, we are accelerating the implementation of the provisions that can allow greater simplifications for trade.  I am satisfied that Revenue will be in a position to support trade in April next year.</p></speech>

I cannot stress enough that the key issue is that if someone makes a customs declaration, our system will be able to cope with it immediately.</p><p>Not coping with it immediately is what clogs up ports and airports.  We are working on the basis, and the Government has worked on the basis, of this central case scenario, which involves an orderly agreement and a transition period.  The type of organisation we are, however, means we always have to have regard to what can happen.  That is why we identified issues with Brexit early and had done some contingency work on it.  If everybody remembers, we had done some of it before the referendum.  </p><p> The key issue is to ensure the ICT framework.  We are also identifying the companies that will be engaged in import-export processes.  We are starting a process of one-to-one engagement with companies.  I refer to outreach looking at how we identify companies that should take advantage of the various different simplifications.  If there is a no deal Brexit, then physical infrastructure will not be in place.  We would then have to look at how we would operate our systems.  One of the advantages in customs is that the transaction takes place and the goods are then brought into the country or leave the country.  The company has books and records and some of the clearance work we do is post-clearance checks.</p><p> I have spoken previously about how 92% of imports are green routed so that there is no check at entry.  Of the 8% that have some level of checking, 6% are orange routed.  That is a documentary check.  Then 2% are red routed which means that there is a check of the physical goods.  What happens, but what will have to happen to a greater degree in the future, is checks at approved premises.  The goods can be brought to the logistics company's warehouse and the check takes place away from the physical border.  Some companies will be approved customs operators so we will do checks away from the border.  I do not want people to go away saying that everything will be all right.  If it happens, there will be big challenges and there will be much work involved.  That is, however, what we will have to deal with.  </p></speech>

I appreciate Mr. Cody answering those questions given the significance of the resignation of Mr. Dominic Raab.  One of the chapters the Comptroller and Auditor General has examined in-depth is that of tobacco smuggling and the impact it has on the revenues of the State.  If a hard border is in place, then the smuggling of fuel, tobacco and drink will become even more lucrative.  I recall being at an awards ceremony once and the former Armagh football captain joked in his speech that any decent smuggler in south Armagh would have had a couple of tankers of laundered fuel on the road before breakfast.</p> <p>  My party and Deputy Breathnach introduced a Private Members' Bill, the Sale of Illicit Goods Bill 2017, a few weeks ago in the D&aacute;il.  During that debate, the Government contested the figures being quoted for the revenue lost to the State.  It stated that it could not be quantified.  Will Mr. Cody hazard a guess as to the figure?  He has spoken of the 13% loss but the Comptroller and Auditor General has said it is a significant risk to tax receipts.  I presume Mr. Cody would agree with that?  What does he believe is the loss to the State? </p></speech>

We publish the estimate and we refer this time to 13%.  The Comptroller and Auditor General would like us to publish more tax gap analyses of various different products.  Tobacco is a controlled product, however, and it is a single line.  We know what is legitimately produced every year.  It all goes through the tax stamps and we have been doing this series of surveys.  Ipsos MRBI has carried out this survey for us and the Office of Tobacco Control since 2008 and we publish the results every year.  We also estimate a figure that would result if everybody stopped buying the 13% illicit cigarettes, and instead bought legal cigarettes.  That is unlikely.  People are surely spending some of that money but they would not be able to afford to spend all of it.  The figure comes out, however, at &euro;229 million.  We publish such a figure every year.  It is, however, difficult to measure any illegal activity and the scale of it.  That applies to drugs-----</p></speech>

A value of &euro;47.8 million was put on those, so there was a loss to the Exchequer of &euro;37 million.  When there are major hauls like that - and it involved much work - is there a reassessment of what is the loss to the State?</p></speech>

We sent a series of photographs to the committee because people do not realise what is involved in these operations.  We sent the photographs to the committee to show what the factory looked like.  It was a shed in a farmyard.  The committee can see those photographs now.</p></speech>

It was a sophisticated operation and on another level it looked like something else.  When I come here, I generally do all of the talking for my team but I specifically wanted to bring Mr. Gilligan with me today.  He has led the work on criminal operations and he led the operation on the tobacco factory in County Louth.  He also leads our liaison with international bodies.  I thought, if the committee was interested, that Mr. Gilligan could outline some of the facts, bearing in mind that there are court cases under way in respect of the seizure at Jenkinstown.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.225" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Gilligan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018111500002#N01200"><p>I thank the committee.  First, in the context of illicit cigarette production and smuggling, the idea that Ireland is a discrete or isolated location, within which the availability of smuggled or illicit tobacco is a result of local criminal activity, is not the reality.  The production and smuggling of illicit tobacco is transnational.  It is a significant area of organised crime.  It involves a range of activities coming together in the sense that it is complex, organised, multi-layered and is undertaken by professional criminal enterprises.  It is also definitely linked, directly or indirectly, to other criminal activities.</p> <p>  In this case, we had three internationally-organised crime gangs involved from Bulgaria, Lithuania and Ireland.  They had come together to put a factory in place.  It was a full end-to-end professional factory in Jenkinstown and was unusual in that, under normal circumstances in Europe, the experience has been that we do not get a fully commercial end-to-end illicit factory in one place.</p><p>It is normally sectioned and kept in different locations, primarily because if law enforcement came across it, they would only lose one piece at a time.  The volume of tobacco on-site was 77 tonnes and the number of cigarettes produced was 22 million or 23 million.  This gives an indication of the size of the operation that was undertaken.  Not only is there the production of cigarettes and their distribution, all the precursors, as we call them - the tobacco, paper, filters, glue, cardboard, cellophane and all the aspects which have to come together to produce the final product - had to be transported to this location.  There were 11 people on-site 24 hours a day for the period involved, which we believe was for periods of up to two weeks, and they had the operation running 24-7.  They had shower facilities, kitchen facilities and accommodation facilities on-site in what, when one looks at it, appears to be a normal farm shed.  However, behind bales of hay, it was a professional and commercial factory.  Some of the international cigarette manufacturers who came to the site to have a look at it were surprised at how sophisticated the operation was.</p></speech>

I will move on to another seizure within the chapter, namely, the case study by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the ship, <i>MV Shingle</i>, which may be appropriately named.  It was in Drogheda Port - also in County Louth - having travelled from Slovenia with 32 million illegal cigarettes on board.  What has been flagged is the fact costs incurred by Revenue up to the end of August this year of approximately &euro;410,000 are related to the continued holding of this vessel and the lay-up cost charged by Dublin Port Company.  What is the up-to-date position on the disposal of this ship and the costs incurred, which are significant if they are running at almost &euro;500,000 at this stage?</p></speech>

We have a ship that is not legally seaworthy, and it was not legally seaworthy when it managed to smuggle 30 million cigarettes into Drogheda Port.  Organised criminal gangs do not seem to have the same regard for health and safety that we have to have.  Ultimately, our powers allow us to seize conveyance.  We seize fuel, fuel tanks, lorries, cars and other vehicles, and ships.  We usually manage to dispose of everything we seize in a reasonably timely way.  It is not a money-making operation; it is to disrupt the criminal gangs that are involved in the operations.  Unfortunately, when we seized the <i>MV Shingle</i>, there was a three-year gap because it had to be retained for evidence until court proceedings were finished.  That is a standard process for much of the stuff we seize.</p></speech>

It would not be good if an asbestos hulk was sunk by mistake by somebody.  What is important is that the registered owners of this ship wanted it back and there was a court action about it.  I would be more worried if I was coming before the committee to say we had given it back and it then featured in a cigarette smuggling or drug smuggling operation here or in any other country.  We would then be legitimately asked, "Why did you?"  I was chatting to Mr. Gilligan about this.  We often find the containers and tankers that illicit fuel goes around in are not fit to be on the road, yet we end up seizing them when we know we would be better off without them.  The criminal entities tend not to use high quality product that costs a lot of money because they know the danger is that if we come across it, we will seize it.</p></speech>

When he looks at the map in figure 17.1, which deals with the cost of cigarettes throughout the continent, it is &euro;5 a pack in Spain, &euro;3 in Turkey, &euro;5 in Austria and &euro;2 in Albania and Russia, whereas it is &euro;12 in Ireland.  Although he said it is a key policy instrument, the question is whether the high price is fuelling the illegal tobacco trade in Ireland to such an extent that the battle is being lost.  Does he believe the Revenue Commissioners are fighting a losing battle and, as he said, just trying to disrupt this trade?  How much is slipping through without being detected?</p></speech>

Every year, in the context of the budget, the Minister has to weigh both those issues and every year the various NGOs, such as the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society, will strongly recommend a significant increase in excise duty on cigarettes.  I am sure committee members hear the same views.  On the opposite side, as I said, the industry wrote to give out to me because the various retail interests and tobacco manufacturers keep emphasising the challenge of smuggling.</p> <p>  The standard increase in recent years has been 50 cent per pack of 20 in excise duty, which puts us at the highest end of the price.  In the tax ready reckoner that we publish, it is the only area where we build in an elasticity and we give a range of possibilities, along the lines, "It could lead to..."  In recent years, the budget figures have been achieved but they have been achieved in a strange way in that there have been significant fluctuations in releases of legitimate tobacco because of various health packaging arrangements.  This year we are well below the tobacco tax figures compared to forecast.  Because Ireland is a relatively small market, none of the cigarettes is manufactured in Ireland and it is not like it used to be.  The production of legitimate cigarettes for Ireland can be done in some of the factories in a couple of weeks in a quantity that will last months, and the releases then follow.  However, over a four or five-year period, the tax receipts come in on target.  Obviously, it is a policy issue and a health issue, and there is a balance to be struck.</p><p>During the few years in which the duty was not increased the tobacco companies increased their prices.</p></speech>

In his opening remarks he also spoke about how people could plan their wages and so forth.   In the case of the 83 high wealth individuals with a taxable income less than the average wage in 2015, were there reasons for this in terms of planning to be evasive, etc?</p></speech>

It was indicated that they did not have a high enough income in their own right, but does Mr. Cody believe there was a motivation behind this?</p></speech>

Sometimes the only reason they are brought in is, essentially, there is a liability for capital acquisitions or capital gains tax.  They do not have an income in their own right, but they may be the beneficiary of a gift.  A total of 25 of the 83 individuals were family members who did not have an income but were included in the case base because they were part of the family group.  A total of 21 individuals were non-resident and non-domiciled; therefore, they were only subject to income tax on Irish sourced income or income remitted in Ireland.  They were included because they had significant links with Ireland, but they were not generating an income in Ireland.  A total of 22 high wealth individuals in taxpayer specific circumstances were impacted on significantly by the downturn.  This category would not have been significant if the crash had not happened in 2009 and 2010.  Some of them have ended up bankrupt and are no longer high wealth individuals.  However, some of them will recover.  A total of 15 high wealth individuals had a significant release of capital allowances or losses.  In the material we sent to the committee we included a copy of a recent report on the high income earner restriction.  There are reliefs that are restricted if an individual's income is in excess of &euro;400,000 and he or she must at least pay at a 30% effective rate.  If relief is restricted in one year, he or she can carry forward the part that is unused; therefore, it is pent up.  It is like the lost relief discussions we had on corporation tax.  People carry forward certain losses and reliefs which impacts on their income in the year in question.  The 83 individuals have valid reasons.  They are set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, but, again, in some way it becomes a much better headline.</p></speech>

I have one or two questions for Mr. Cody about that issue that will not take more than five minutes.  I will then move on to the particular chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report with which we are dealing.  </p> <p>  I assume that if Mr. Cody has not read the draft withdrawal agreement, he has been briefed on it.  All of this will matter post-2020 at the end of the implementation period and after something else replaces it.  In terms of what has been agreed, it seems that there will be a single EU-UK customs territory.  That will deal with the customs side of things, but there are deeper provisions for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the context of the Single Market.  That seems to suggest there will be unrestricted movement of goods north and south to Great Britain and the rest of Europe, but this does not apply to goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The draft withdrawal agreement talks about the necessity for additional checks but states they will be made in the least intrusive way possible.  What does that mean for the Revenue Commissioners and the Republic of Ireland?  Obviously, it will be an issue in Northern Ireland, but it will also be an issue in the Republic of Ireland.  When it is stated these checks must happen, that there will be additional checks, especially if there is any variation in standards, and that the rules of the Single Market must be protected, at least from the European Union's perspective, what is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners?  Have they examined what the increased checks will be and what would be the least intrusive options?</p></speech>

Obviously, there is a lot of detail in the agreement, but there will also be a lot of detail in giving effect to the agreement as is common in EU processes.  Deputy Cullinane is right - the customs union deals with certain parts of it.  Before the Single Market was introduced in 1992, there were border controls between all of the countries of the European Union.  It was the Single Market that allowed the free movement of goods.  I remember it well because I was involved in many of the discussions that took place at the time on VAT; therefore, I am being brought back to a previous time in my career.  I spoke about simplification in the context of the Single Market and the customs process.  The question will be about regulatory alignment.  It may well not be about the customs process and procedures, depending on what the agreement is.  We have the lead role for all of the agencies involved in regulatory control; therefore, our IT systems are used to support them, be it the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the HSE.  That infrastructure about which I spoke will provide the basis for the management of the process.</p></speech>

I accept what he is saying, but the Commission is stating that in making the additional checks, there will be a need for some compliance checks with EU standards consistent with the level of risk to protect consumers, economic traders and businesses in the Single Market.  The Commission is talking about additional checks and stating we can try to mitigate them but there will be additional compliance checks.  Have the Revenue Commissioners looked at what the additional compliance checks will be in practice?</p></speech>

Obviously, the majority want it to be implemented.</p><p>In the event that it is not implemented and there is a hard crash, what will be the immediate revenue consequences in this state?  We are hearing that World Trade Organization rules will apply automatically in the event that no political or legal arrangements are put in place between Britain and the European Union.  Let us suppose there is no deal and World Trade Organization rules apply.  No one wants to be in that situation, but let us suppose we are in that situation.  Are there automatic responses that will have to come into play or would something else evolve over time?  Will there be immediate obligations on this state and Revenue in the event that there is no deal and World Trade Organization rules apply?</p></speech>

One thing that is really noticeable in the entire process is how the European Union has put Ireland's interests first.  I cannot imagine that on 29 March next it will state to Ireland that a given position is completely unacceptable.  I have listened to a good deal of the discussion and debate in the media on how, ultimately, when it comes to it, Ireland will be left swinging.  What has happened in recent days has been singularly important for Ireland.  I really hope things will follow through.</p> <p>  At the start the Chairman talked about how officials would not become involved in the area of policy.  I reckon I am probably in the biggest policy area for the country.  Last June I was before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach talking about various aspects of Brexit.  I have been quoted and name-checked by various Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom.  A friend sent me a text message.  He was watching "The Late Late Show" when Brexit was being discussed and told me that I had been name-checked based on partial stuff I had said.  I do not think it would be helpful.  Seeing that I am a sad individual, I find myself watching the House of Commons public accounts committee where I am also mentioned.  That committee would like to have me over to talk to it about all of these things, but it would be better all round to let the process take its course in the context of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  I can understand perfectly each time I am attending anything the reason people want to know what will happen, but I think we would all be better off in letting the policy take its course.  I am willing to come back at any time to talk about it when we are in a better position to talk about it.</p></speech>

Without that level of information, the Revenue Commissioners perhaps have to use other sources.  There are obligations at certain points when declarations of assets have to be made, but they do not apply in the same way as when income returns are being made on a yearly basis.</p></speech>

Is there any benefit in looking at that?  I have no wish to stray into policy or the political sphere, but in recent times there has been debate about whether we should have a wealth tax.  One reason it is difficult to have that debate is we cannot get an answer to the question of how much could be generated from such a tax.  That is because we do not collect data for wealth.  Is this something at which Revenue has looked to try to find better ways to accumulate data and information on people's wealth, especially that of high wealth individuals?</p></speech>

In recent years there have been many helpful developments.  We obtain extensive third party information.  We receive various data from financial institutions.  Significant purchases of property are relevant because there are stamp duty implications and reporting requirements.  As there are requirements related to probate and inheritance, we have a picture of assets on inheritance.  One thing that has been changing considerably in recent years and that will continue to change is the level of information on international wealth and the international exchange of information.  The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act governs this aspect of the US financial reporting system.  With the common reporting standard of the OECD, it allows for the exchange of financial information held by financial institutions abroad for in the region of 120 countries and tax administrations.  It also adds to the process.</p></speech>

It would be difficult to forecast with the accuracy we would like.  It would really depend on how a wealth tax was designed and what it involved.</p><p>The CSO and the Central Bank produce a wealth survey that gives some basis for figures.  The ESRI and the Department of Finance compiled a report on how to model a wealth tax.  On a macro basis, it would be possible to approximate a figure.</p><p> On statements of assets, in certain circumstances we can look for a statement of affairs in individual cases but we have to have cause and a reason.  It is a bit like some of the discussion regarding corporation tax losses.  It would be helpful if Revenue had a breakdown of certain figures but there are requirements.  We can only have a breakdown of certain figures if we have the law in place to require the reporting of those figures.  That is this type of area.</p></speech>

Some of them come in under that threshold.  A common feature of an artificial loss is when someone has a significant gain of &euro;10 million, for example, and he or she would be liable to pay capital gains tax of 33% on that in the normal course of events.  Some people try to create a loss to shelter the gain and a series of very sophisticated financial transactions would take place over a small number of days.  This would create a significant loss.  It would create another gain that was not legally taxable under a particular provision.  The person would shelter the real gain by means of the artificial loss.  The artificial loss and the artificial gain would cancel each other out and the individual would end up with exactly the same amount of money but would try to get it tax free.  We have challenged this and are now before the courts with some of the cases.   I cannot talk about individual cases but it is on public record that we identified 28 cases where the amount of tax at risk was &euro;110 million.  We were successful in the High Court but our approach was judicially reviewed.  It was appealed to the Supreme Court as a result of the judicial review.  A lot of the detail was put on the record of the court.  We have been successful in the Supreme Court, but that was dealing with the judicial review.  A number of the people involved have gone to the High Court to challenge the constitutionality of the section on general anti-avoidance provision.  Those cases still have to go through the tax appeal process, but some have settled.  This was seven cases settled with a yield of &euro;27 million.  This is what we do and this is what the anti-avoidance teams do.</p> <p>  I am aware that the Chairman is very interested in the tax appeals process.  When we identify a tax avoidance scheme it could be ten years before the case is brought to fruition.  We might say it is tax avoidance but these people are very well resourced and very well advised.  They are quite happy to go through the courts process.  The prolonging of the payment may well be enough of an advantage for them.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the witnesses responses are lengthy because of the questions being put but perhaps this one is a bit more distinct.  If I am reading it right Mr. McCarthy raised the issue, or concern, about how high wealth individuals are classified in the State, which starts at &euro;50 million.  Is Mr. McCarthy saying this is outside the European norms and that &euro;50 million is perhaps too high?</p></speech>

It would be useful to go back a little on the history.  We were one of the first administrations to have a HWI large cases division, LCD.  We were leaders in that regard.  We reviewed it in 2007 and in 2015.  We are now in the process of reviewing and realigning our structure.  I want to emphasise the fact that just because a person is dealt with in the HWI unit, or not, does not mean that the same rules and legal basis do not apply.  I spoke about the anti-avoidance process.  The anti-avoidance teams in the HWI LCD take in the cases that engage in the avoidance process that we have identified, to tackle that process.  We have some 1,240 cases of taxpayers who are involved in avoidance schemes that we are challenging.  The vast majority of those people are not HWIs at all, but they are being dealt with for the transaction by the anti-avoidance teams in the LCD.</p> <p>  I referred earlier to the Revenue's realignment process that is currently under way.  We are trying to do a serious realignment of resources with risk.  We have now divided LCD into LCD corporates and LCD HWI.  We have also set up a medium enterprise division that deals with the cases under the HWI threshold.  This division deals with 15,000 individuals and their tax affairs.  I have asked the two assistant secretaries who lead the HWI unit and the medium enterprise divisions that once we have settled down a bit of our resources in this quarter that by the end of the first quarter of next year they would bring forward a proposal to the board on the threshold for the HWIs.  I am absolutely confident that we will be reducing that threshold.  I want to put more resources into that area.  Identifying the resources and freeing up the resources from what they are currently doing is a process.  We are going through our structural realignment, motivated by ourselves, which involves a significant change in the structure of the organisation.  This will take time to bed in.  We are revisiting the threshold.  We want to see what will be the implications of, for example, a &euro;20 million threshold and how many cases this would involve.  All of those cases are being dealt with by the medium enterprise division.  It is a question of how we balance those two.</p></speech>

It relates to what is stated on page 237 in the context of tax collection.  Basically, it breaks down as tax paid by HWIs, 57 of whom had taxable incomes of &euro;36,000 to &euro;125,000 and 88 of whom had taxable incomes of less than &euro;36,000.  There were 83 who had taxable incomes of less than the average industrial wage.  It is interesting that Mr. McCarthy made recommendations in his report in respect of various matters and then there are responses.  On the tax collection side, however, there is no recommendation that I can see.</p><p>Is that because the Comptroller and Auditor General is just reporting as fact that this is how it is and he does not see any difficulty with it?</p></speech>

Some 25 are family members who do not have an income.  They are in our HWI class because they may well be recipients of significant gifts and they are liable for capital acquisitions tax on gifts.  As the Deputy can imagine, with HWIs there are family groups so we look at the family group together.  They may not have an income.</p></speech>

However, some of them may not have income or capital in a year.  One - although neither of us - could get an inheritance and live off it for years.  The taxable event might happen this year and the person might have no tax for the next few years.  Some 25 were family members who were in that position, while 21 were non-residents or non-domiciled individuals.  Mostly their tax liability or tax position - maybe tax liability is the wrong word - their centre of tax is not Ireland.  A further 15 of them had specific reliefs and claims under legislation, capital allowances and losses that applied to their gross income to reduce their net income, and they were legitimate schemes provided by the Oireachtas.  Then 22 of them had various circumstances.  These are people who would have gone through the worst of the downturn and are no longer included in our HWIs.  Some of them may have ended up in bankruptcy or wherever.</p> <p>  When the Comptroller and Auditor General is doing his reports with us and we are going over and back with our comments, we probably all end up saying to ourselves that this is tax stuff and stats and everything is fine.  Then when 30 September or whenever the report is published comes up, and journalists see a heading, we say, oh, Lord, we should have written more when we wrote back to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

One of the most interesting things around the HWIs, as I said in my opening remarks, is that we do not assume that any of them does not pay their right share.  In fact, as I noted in preparation for today, the number of HWIs who are resident in Ireland and who pay effective rates when we include PRSI and USC of 50% is actually quite striking and reassuring.</p></speech>

On the last point in respect of the 83 individuals, 15 of them had legitimate claims to a significant level of reliefs, primarily losses.  Could we have an example of the types of reliefs that would enable somebody to pay less than the average industrial wage on their income?  I am not asking for any specifics on any individual but just the types of relief that would be availed of.</p></speech>

There are 14 - trading losses greater than &euro;100,000 - that is where someone has carried forward trading losses and can set that against total income.  Nearly half the number involved had trading losses in excess of &euro;100,000 carried forward.  Their income in the year would be in excess of &euro;100,000 or &euro;120,000 or whatever but they would have the &euro;100,000 set against it.  As for the rest of the reliefs, individuals had capital allowances, trading losses less than &euro;100,000, and participation in the employment incentive investment, EII, scheme, where a person invests in some small company and can get the relief on that.  There is a lot less, though, than we would have seen ten years ago because a lot of the reliefs have been abolished.  There were a lot of property based reliefs which are now abolished.  Then the issue of the high income earners restriction comes into play.  That brings back in, for last year, I think, &euro;32 million in liability in that some of the reliefs-----</p></speech>

I have a note and it might better if I read it out instead of talking off the top of my head.  Capital allowances are a form of depreciation.  That is essentially what they are for tax purposes.  They may be deducted from an individual's case 1 or case 2 tax adjusted profit in calculating the taxable profits of a trade or profession.  A profession would be a good example of somebody who might have capital allowances.</p></speech>

There are two principal forms of capital allowances paid by taxpayers against their trade profits, namely wear and tear allowances on the cost of acquiring plant and machinery, which would be mostly in corporation tax, and then some industrial buildings allowances where somebody has bought an industrial building and would be entitled to claim that amount over a period of depreciation.  Then they can claim case 5, which is rental capital allowances on the cost incurred on furniture and fittings for their rental properties.  As is highlighted in the chapter, a lot of the people in the HWI category have significant rental-----</p></speech>

I do not want to put Mr. Cody on the spot so if he does not have the information to hand he might be able to provide it to the committee.

I might have it by the end of the meeting.  Increasingly, in the context of HWIs, we probably look at profile interview type process.  They tend to be technical.  They tend not to be investigations because with investigations one has to have significant evidence of tax evasion.  It is certainly not a feature of HWIs.  They may engage in tax planning and tax management but tax evasion is not something that is in that sphere.  I have those figures now.  In 2017, there were five investigations, 17 audits and 13 profile interviews.  The target was 105 aspect queries but we closed 1,300 where we would look at some aspect of it such as their capital allowances.  We would have carried out 1,158 appraisals.  Appraisals are when we appraise the case but we do not make contact with the taxpayer or their agent.</p></speech>

I have those figures for 2016, 2017 and 2018.  So far in 2018, and this surprises me, we have 15 investigations, 17 audits, 17 profile interviews, 105 aspect queries, and 150 appraisals.

They tend to be the avoidance cases that are not the HWIs but are dealt with in our HWI unit.  In terms of some of the legislation around avoidance, I know the qualifying avoidance disclosure features in the chapter as well, which was a legislative provision to allow settlements to be made for avoidance before the changes.  We made some significant proposals to the Department for changes in our anti-avoidance provisions because some of the avoidance practices were so off the radar that they would certainly move across the line.  I was here last year talking about some of the medical consultants project.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did a chapter on the medical consultants, which ended up with approximately 28 of those settlements being published, which means they are in that space to which I referred.  Unfortunately, what happens in certain cases is that some practitioner comes up with a scheme and people sign up for it.  We always say that if it is too good to be true, it is too good to be true.  There is a load of litigation going on in that sphere, not involving the Revenue, where people have signed up for schemes that are just not right.</p></speech>

The testing of the constitutionality of charging provisions in excise law would not be unusual.  It goes back to some of the processes Mr. Gilligan would have spoken about earlier.  Some of our excise provisions will have to do with mineral oil, tobacco and alcohol and sometimes we seek to charge tax on people who have no wish to pay tax.</p></speech>

It is under Total Quantum per Tax Type, income tax.  The tax quantum per tax type is just in excess of &euro;19 million.  It states:</p><blockquote>This appeal relates to the taxation of certain monies found at the Appellant's dwelling during the course of an audit which the Respondent contends relates to untaxed self-employment income.  The Appellant submits the monies represent accumulated savings which are not taxable.</blockquote> <p>My reading of that is that some man or woman has tens of millions in cash in their attic.  The tax liability on that, including penalties or whatever, is now &euro;19 million.  To get to a point where the tax liability is &euro;19 million, what type of money would one be keeping in one's house to reach a tax liability of that amount?  It refers to certain moneys.  It does not refer to anything else so I presume it is cash, and it was found in the appellant's dwelling.</p></speech>

When a hearing is scheduled, there is an expectation that some cases will be determined before the end of the day.  What percentage are settled in this way?  How many go to court?

In other audits we identify what we see as undeclared income and we would seek to assess the tax liability.  If our evidence was good enough it may end up in a settlement process and tax, interest and penalties will be paid as part of the settlement.  Some go to appeal and there are various stages of the appeals process.  Some avoidance cases have gone through a process of judicial review in the High Court and the Supreme Court and then the appeal itself has to start.  That will involve the Tax Appeals Commission and then it may go to the High Court.  It could, potentially, go to the Supreme Court again and may even go to the ECJ.  Most of our cases are settled, however, and do not end up being appealed.  We publish our figures on this and we collect in the region of &euro;500 million in tax settlements.</p></speech>

It deals with businesses with a turnover in excess of &euro;3 million, businesses between &euro;1 million and &euro;3 million with over 100 employees or businesses, primarily in the construction industry, with relevant contracts tax where the contract values are in excess of &euro;3 million.  Partners of accountancy and legal partnerships whose turnover is greater than &euro;3 million are also in this category, as are proprietary directors associated with any of the above businesses, which brings in a lot of individuals.  The medium enterprise HWI unit brings in 622 individuals in addition to the proprietary directors of all those companies who have a total income in excess of &euro;500,000 and an effective tax rate of less than 30%.  It also brings in people whose total consideration from capital taxes exceeds &euro;700,000 or where total capital losses exceeds &euro;500,000, and those who have multiple property transactions over a three-year period exceeding &euro;3 million.</p></speech>

The process did not start at any one point because we are constantly looking at our structure.  In 2015, we were worried about the cases below the LCD threshold.  We were not worried about controlling them but about the fact that, depending on what part of the country a person was in, he or she might get different treatment on account of the resources available.  For example, resources in Kilkenny might be different from those in Galway.  We were keen to have a view of the national case base so we started a project on what we called the second-tier case base.  We set up seven second-tier branches within the regional structure and, last November, we looked at moving towards a process for five national divisions rather than the regional structure.  The staff are spread around these five national divisions.</p></speech>

It is an ongoing process and we have a lot of work to do on it.  We changed the case base over the October bank holiday weekend and we are now engaged in a massive communication exercise with staff across the organisation.  There has been a great level of co-operation from staff and I cannot get over how Revenue staff respond so positively and proactively at such times.  The trade unions come in to me to talk about what is happening and they want certainty because change can be a big challenge for people.  We have a lot of really good people based around the country and our case base is not in the same places.  We have set up an LCD corporate branch in Galway and we always had a bit of LCD in Cork and Limerick.  We have a HWI team outside Dublin and I would like at least one third of the resources for LCD, corporate and HWI to be outside Dublin.</p></speech>

The HWI base currently pays a lot of money.  It is also the case that the top 1% of income earners have 10% of the income while paying 21% of the income tax.  The top 10% have 35% of the income and pay 59% of total income tax and 58% of income tax and USC combined.  That is the cohort involved.  They are pay an awful lot of money.</p></speech>

Wealth is not assessed, but income is.  While Mr. Cody might say that group has a very high income tax level, there is significant variation.  On top of that there is the question of wealth and assets that are not included in the income measurement unless the owners derive income from that wealth.</p></speech>

I refer to the chapter on corporate taxation.  In Mr. Cody's opening contribute, he said that the Comptroller and Auditor General made no recommendations, and he is correct.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted a number of issues, as did the Chairman.  We made recommendations in one of our reports that a distinction between losses carried over and the non-use of capital allowances be made.  Is Mr. Cody picking up on that recommendation?  He has clarified that Revenue is obliged to act under the tax legislation.  To put it in plain English, companies can benefit from capital allowances they have not used and can benefit from trading losses that are carried over.  Revenue does not distinguish between that and is not able to give us the year by year breakdown.  We made a recommendation.  I am sure the Chairman was going to mention this as well.  Can Mr. Cody clarify what he thinks about that recommendation and what Revenue is doing about it?</p></speech>

Essentially, the challenge is that an unused capital allowance contributes to the calculation of the loss.  Two computations are not made.  The figure ends up as a total figure when it is carried forward..</p></speech>

Rather than putting everything under losses, it could be split up into what the losses are and what is unused under the capital allowances.

There is a 7% detection rate.  The most significant figure is the amount going back to the Government.  It is 79% of each packet of cigarettes.  Total excise and VAT now represents just over 79% of the retail price per pack in Ireland.  So 79% of the cost of every packet of cigarettes is going back to the Government.  There is a serious question there about health issues - it is for another day - if that much revenue is going back for every packet of cigarette consumed.  The detection rate is 7%.  How does it compare internationally?  In terms of scanning illegal products coming through, I understand that up to now Revenue could not distinguish.  Will Mr. Cody clarify that?</p></speech>

The reality of the factory is that a significant proportion of those cigarettes were bound for the British market.  They would not be all released in Ireland.  The system would not be able to cope.  The market is very interlinked.  We are embedded in OLAF and international co-operation.  In 2017, Poland seized 544 million cigarettes.</p><p>We seized 34 million.  It has a population approximately ten times our own.  In 2013, the UK had seizures of 378 million and we had seizures of 41 million.  In another year the UK had seizures of 508 million and we had seizures of 53 million.  I usually use the idea of dividing the number by ten.  We are proportionate but the figures jump around.  The level of tobacco tax we get is fairly static over the years, even allowing for the increase in excise duty.  That is from a significant reduction in people smoking.  Health motivation is an important aspect.  The Deputy is practically correct on the 80% figure, as the illicit trade in tobacco is like smuggling tax.  When somebody is buying 20 cigarettes, they are paying a lot of tax.</p></speech>

Mostly, the detection of illegal cigarettes or anything illegal comes from a number of processes, including intelligence, scanning, use of dogs etc.  Rarely is it a result of one aspect.

I would never come here and say that.  However, part of our realignment process increases resources directed at areas of risk.  That is what we do.  In fairness, every year when we are in here we pay very close attention to all the chapters.  If there are things we can learn from them, they influence what we do.</p></speech>

It is not a question.  I will not take any more time.  Real estate is the biggest sector for high-worth individuals.

Revenue-specific codes are 35%, but the witnesses have said that has fallen to 21% and it is different.</p></speech>

If the bells ring, I will just get through my questions with a view to finishing the meeting.  If another member arrives that will be that.</p> <p>  Not being a smoker myself, I do not normally concentrate on this end of things.  According to the figures the witnesses say are based on the 2017 survey, the nominal loss to the Exchequer in 2017 was &euro;229 million.  I am reading from Mr. Cody's opening statement.  In regard to following these matters up, two paragraphs later Mr. Cody writes that prosecutions have resulted in fines totalling &euro;140,250.  It must be the most profitable business in Ireland.  I will talk about the detection rates in a moment.  I have worked out that for every euro a person has paid in a fine, on average he or she has been involved in &euro;1,632 worth of illicit tobacco.  That is like winning the lottery every morning.  For the risk of being fined &euro;1 one can make &euro;1,632.  I find that a phenomenally low figure relative to the money that can be made.  Mr. Cody can see where I get these figures.</p> <p>  Somebody got a sentence of six months, I am sure with probation attached, a reduction in time or whatever.  Revenue cannot set the terms.  That is up to us.  As far as I can see, however, there is zero deterrent.  Someone can sell &euro;1,632 worth of illicit tobacco, and if he or she is one of those caught he or she will pay an average of &euro;1 in fines.  One person involved in that &euro;229 million worth of business got a short prison sentence.  I know about the price differential, the tax and how cheap they are in Europe, but this also has something to do with the extent of smuggling.  Is there anything more Revenue can do, or does it need more power?  It might require legislation.  That disparity speaks volumes.  Looking at the facts, I have never seen anything as profitable as smuggling cigarettes.</p></speech>

Does the Revenue pass them on to the HSE?  The HSE could undertake some promotion on this issue because a high number of people from eastern Europe are very heavy smokers and we will be paying for the hospital bills at the end of the day.  Is there any linkage between Revenue and the HSE on this issue?</p></speech>

It is just a cashflow issue.  Most people's general understanding was that this would ensure that people with an income of over &euro;400,000 would pay a minimum effective rate of tax of 30% but that is only half the sentence.  The other half is that the relief they utilised in one year can be carried forward if they have reduced income, or lower other reliefs, in the following year.  At the end of the day, the Exchequer has not got one extra bob out of this.  There will be a lot of public disappointment when it is realised that the Oireachtas allowed the relief to be carried forward to reduce tax in later years.  I blame myself, as a Member of the Oireachtas, but we codded the people on that one.  I do not believe that is what the public expected this measure to be.</p></speech>

I want to put that on the record.  We are here to scrutinise tax receipts as well as expenditure.</p><p> I will go through the schedule in the Revenue Commissioners' report.  It is all well and good publishing the report but in regard to the reliefs claimed, by far the biggest one is the &euro;98 million for the reliefs carried forward, which we have discussed.  In regard to the other big reliefs being utilised, 27 people claimed relief on hotels, holiday camps and cottages of &euro;7.6 million, which was an average of &euro;280,000 relief per person.  In regard to the urban renewal scheme and capital allowances for commercial buildings, 14 people claimed reliefs of &euro;1.6 million, which is an average of &euro;115,000 per individual.  In regard section 344 and multi-storey carpark allowances, this is a very lucrative allowance for some people.  Fewer than ten people claimed reliefs of &euro;3.6 million.  If there were ten of them, it would have been relief of &euro;360,000 per person.  If it was five, it would have been double that.  We do not have the figure but it is at least &euro;360,000 per individual.  In regard to section 372, qualifying urban relief and capital allowances for certain commercial buildings, 15 people claimed reliefs of &euro;2.15 million, which is an average relief of &euro;143,000 per person.  I am only listing those over &euro;100,000 because people ought to hear about reliefs.  I want to put what we are talking about on the record.  Section 372 relief applies for lessors of residential properties - it is a section 23-type relief - and 54 people claimed &euro;11.5 million in reliefs, which is an average of &euro;214,000 per individual.  Section 338 is relief arising under terminal losses of a business totalling &euro;7.1 million, which is an average of &euro;160,000 relief per individual.</p><p> I have mentioned the big one already, namely, losses forward.  Some 346 people claimed relief for losses forward of &euro;98 million, which is an average of &euro;383,000 relief per individual.  Are all those, not just the first one, carried forward year in, year out if a person claims a relief?  Is it just that big one, the carry forward excess relief?  Can all the others can be carried forward as losses forward if a person's incomes drop?</p></speech>

The other matter I want to discuss with Mr. Cody are his predictions in regard to the corporation tax receipts for this year and last year.  The letter he sent us dated 24 October is specifically on this issue.  I know he said it is up to the Department of Finance but he has a big input into the information the Department of Finance has.  We asked for a note because when it emerged during the summer that corporation tax receipts were surging ahead, it was said that this was due to a change in the accounting rules.  I took the view that those types of rules were predictable and did not happen overnight.  Mr. Cody said in his correspondence that there was a significant change for the telecommunications and software sectors, where long-term contracts are complex and arrangements are prevalent as to when they record their income.  He took the view that there is a transition period to record this but a number of these companies put it all into year one.  The Revenue Commissioners could not predict that which led to the &euro;350 million of extra receipts.</p></speech>

There is great co-operation but the reality is that one can see when a company is doing its quarterly or six monthly report, and it misses its own forecast targets.  There is volatility in corporation tax receipts with the small number of companies that have such an influence, and we have discussed this at length.  A company can be significantly out and this can have an impact if it is one of the big companies.</p></speech>

This &euro;350 million is due to the International Accounting Standards, IAS, rule 15 change, that we spoke about.  That means there is another &euro;415 million unexplained in Mr. Cody's letter.

It concerns people who have a lot of deposit interest retention tax, DIRT.  We often hear about constituents who have been notified by Revenue that they had "X" amount.  What is the protocol or procedure?  Are there many such notifications?</p></speech>

That will be integrated into our system.  It will lead to the abolition of all the "P" forms such as the P45, the P60, the P30 and the P35.  The 2018 P35 will be the last such form.  It will be due in February.  We will then populate individual employees' tax and credit data on an ongoing basis to ensure that employees get the right reliefs and credits as they are paid.  When it comes to January 2020 when we have the first full year, we will be able to carry out automatic reviews.  Most people under PAYE have one salary.  Everything should work reasonably well but many people have multiple wages.  Some employers have not been operating the proper tax credit system but we will be able to integrate and adjust it throughout the year.  It is a massive change.  We have been involved in significant engagement with employer groups all over the country.  It will be the most significant change in the tax administration system since the introduction of self-assessment.  In some ways, it will be bigger than that because it will affect 2.7 million people.</p></speech>

It has significant positive benefits for employees and it will have significant benefits for compliant employers.  At present they must complete a P35 for us.

We have been conducting seminars throughout the country and somebody told one of our crew that he had got the software because of this.

A couple of members asked me to make a final comment to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When his report came out at the end of September the chapter about the number of high worth individuals paying less income tax than many people on the average industrial wage created an impression among the public.  I got the same impression and I had to telephone him about it that day.  It created the impression that there were many wealthy people in Ireland.  It transpired very quickly that some of them might not be in Ireland at all and might just have a property in Ireland.  Many of us probably did not read the detail of the chapter, which is the first thing that must be said.  People looked at the headline, myself included.  I believe I got it right by 6 p.m. but I might have got it wrong earlier.  I hope somebody does not produce a transcript of something I said.

The first technological university, TU Dublin, will be the largest educational facilitator of apprenticeship programmes in the country when it is designated in January 2019.  Of THEA's fourteen members, 12 contribute to the provision of the off-the-job elements of some 23 of the designated craft apprenticeships.  Of the nine new apprenticeships launched since 2016, seven are led by THEA members, as co-ordinating providers, in areas as diverse as polymer processing technology and insurance practice.  In addition, institutes of technology are the proposed co-ordinating providers for a further ten new apprenticeships under development.  </p> <p>  Apprenticeship, in the Irish context, is a statutory national programme that enables the apprentice to earn and learn at the same time and is traditionally associated with the construction, electrical, automotive and engineering industries.  The great advantage of this approach is that it not only provides the opportunity to the apprentice to learn on the job but also to participate fully as an employee in a real-world work environment.  The new apprenticeships aim to extend this approach more broadly into sectors that have not traditionally been associated with apprenticeships.  It is a fresh, ambitious and innovative undertaking which THEA believes has the potential to bring about very significant enhancements to the apprenticeship system as a whole and to employment sectors that identify and choose it as the optimal model for educating and training their staff in particular occupations.  </p> <p>  THEA views statutory national apprenticeships as one key element in a broad family of education and training programmes that are based on a learn and work model.  This model also includes traineeships and non-apprenticeship programmes provided by the further education and higher education sectors that have varying levels of non-paid, work-based learning embedded within them.  These include work placements integrated into regular degree programmes and bespoke programmes developed for individual companies.  It is important to offer this mixed portfolio of work-based learning to enhance the employability of all graduates and it is equally important that employment sectors give consideration to which model is most suited to their recruitment needs.  </p> <p>  Employers are primarily responsible for recruiting apprentices, not the education providers.  Employers are best placed to comment on why there have been difficulties in recruiting apprentices in certain sectors.  Our members are closer to the recruitment process of the new apprenticeships and their experience to date suggests recruitment tends to be more successful when an employment sector is well organised and has a strong professional association behind it that can determine whether apprenticeship is an appropriate work-based learning model for that sector.  A strong professional association also helps to mobilise individual companies in recruiting apprentices and can support that recruitment directly.  </p> <p>  There are significant challenges for all stakeholders in increasing the uptake of apprenticeships and, specifically, in meeting the targets enunciated in the 2016 action plan.  Arguably, the greatest challenge relates to enhancing awareness of apprenticeship among the populace at large.  Although awareness of apprenticeship has increased in recent years at policy level, it is a far greater communications challenge to raise public awareness of apprenticeship as a valid and valued option for school leavers.  The magnitude of the task is reflected in the stark fact that the total apprenticeship population at the end of the 2017-2018 academic year was 14,871, while the total enrolments in public higher education were 235,644. </p> <p>  It is also arguable that there is a need to simplify the regulatory environment in which the apprenticeship system operates.  It remains subject to the Industrial Training Act 1967, legislation that is 50 years old.  While this legislation is sturdy and has stood the test of time, it is not easily reconciled with subsequent education and training legislation, particularly that relating to the national quality assurance system.  It has led to a very complex, at times overly bureaucratic system within which to develop the new apprenticeship model.  While all the stakeholders have worked collaboratively to make the system work, it has undoubtedly hindered the agility and responsiveness of the system, delaying the throughput of programmes and making it very difficult to predict and deliver registration targets.   </p> <p>  As national supporters of the apprenticeship model, THEA's view is that apprenticeship is an integral hub in the overall provision of education and training.  Our members are significant providers and supporters of the model.  We believe that with streamlined employer support, a focus on simplifying the interpretation of the regulations, a re-visit of the recruitment targets in collaboration with the consortia and other stakeholders and a targeted public awareness campaign, the model can be enhanced to reach its full potential.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.705" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McGinty" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018111500002#B00500"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet it.  The primary focus is on discussing issues of apprenticeships and traineeships which for the most part is about points of entry into a career.  Our focus in Skillnet Ireland in working with enterprise is about developing employability skills over the work-life cycle when people have taken up employment.</p> <p>  In that context, human capital is the single greatest asset any nation can possess.  Workers, whether they were born in Ireland or attracted from abroad, are the muscle, brainpower, creative force and energy that drives our economy. </p> <p>  In an international context, the IMD&rsquo;s competitiveness yearbook 2018 ranks Ireland fifth for attracting and retaining talent.  The collective talent of our nation is not just the bedrock of our economy today; a well-educated, well-skilled and adaptable workforce has been a core pillar of Ireland&rsquo;s economic and industrial policy since the 1960s.  It is an advantage we must never cede.  If we are going to keep that advantage and the promise of opportunity to future generations, we have some work to do. </p> <p>  Our economy is being rapidly reshaped by technology, automation, globalisation, geopolitical shifts, including Brexit, and several other forces.  The manifestation of changes being discussed in the debate on the future of work are already with us today and are influencing the way companies operate and how work is organised.  This affects job content, skill needs and quality requirements.  This transformation is creating opportunity but it is also creating disruption and, with it, insecurity for many businesses and workers.  Some of this insecurity can be attributed to two gaps that are preventing our nation from leveraging its talent and our people from realising their full potential.  The first is a skills gap.  Too many people lack the skills they need to compete for 21st century jobs.  The second is a people gap.  Too many businesses cannot find the workers with the right skills when and where they need them.  Closing both gaps is imperative to our competitiveness. </p> <p>  It is a multifaceted challenge as skills supply is met in various parts through outputs from our higher and further education system, including apprenticeships and traineeships, from employment activation and supports to jobseekers, and from immigration.</p><p>However, for the greatest part, the skills that power Ireland&rsquo;s economy are derived from within employment.  For this reason, it is crucial that both businesses and workers are placed at the heart of the response.</p><p> Skillnet Ireland is the national agency responsible for the promotion and facilitation of in-employment training.  We have deep roots with enterprise in Ireland and we are contracted with more than 50 employer and sectoral groups, regional representative bodies and industry associations.  In 2017, approximately 15,000 private firms participated in Skillnet learning networks and more than 50,000 workers were supported by Skillnet-funded training.  We are funded from the National Training Fund and as a demand side agency in that we stimulate and support enterprise-led responses through 65 learning networks across a range of sectors and regions.  We operate a cost-sharing model where State grants are combined with investments by businesses.  As well as offering a subsidy to encourage upskilling, cost-sharing drives firm employer commitment to the training process.  In 2017, employers made a total contribution towards training of &euro;15.91 million through Skillnet.</p><p> The Skillnet cost-sharing model is also creating significant funding leverage in that every &euro;1 of State investment is matched with &euro;1.14 from employer contributions.  This represents a highly efficient use of public moneys and an effective vehicle for State investment in the skills of our workers.  For 2019, the annual budget allocation for Skillnet Ireland has been increased to &euro;28 million, equating to approximately 4.5% of total National Training Fund expenditure net of other employer contributions.</p><p> Through successive independent evaluations both domestic and international, including the OECD, the European Union and the International Labour Organization, the Skillnet model has consistently been highlighted as an efficient means of addressing skills challenges.</p></speech>

The Government should maintain a rigorous focus on the skills of those in employment, directing supports at close to labour market skill requirements in targeting interventions that support effective enterprise-led training and preparing more people to take up employment opportunities.  It should implement in full the recommendations arising from the independent evaluation of the National Training Fund undertaken by Indecon, including a greater priority being placed on supporting in-employment training and giving enterprise a bigger voice in how this is determined.  The Government should also provide greater incentives to firms to increase investment at enterprise level in staff training.  Such responses will serve to increase the productivity, innovation and competitiveness of firms and boost the skills and career mobility of workers and the value of jobs.  The final recommendation is to continue to expand demonstrably effective Government and enterprise upskilling mechanisms such as Skillnet Ireland to allow us to accelerate our work and penetration, particularly with small and medium enterprises, which employ approximately 70% of our workforce.</p> <p>  At this moment of rapid change and massive transition, we must put the talent agenda foremost in our minds.  That requires us to bridge the gaps that exist between students and workers and the jobs that will provide them opportunity, security and prosperity.  It requires us to bridge the skills and people gaps that exist between the needs of employers and workers, where businesses seek to expand their businesses, serve their communities and grow the economy.  Skillnet Ireland provides strong leadership in shaping the future of workforce development by working with enterprise to meet their skill requirements and helping those in work to progress, develop and upskill for the future.  We are a strong example of how the State and enterprise can work together to meet identified challenges.  With our deep roots in every region and sector, we are determined that these issues are addressed, and with the active support of the Government, all our stakeholders and through collaboration between agencies, we are working hard to play our part in addressing these issues.</p></speech>

SOLAS funds and oversees further education and training in Ireland, which includes traineeships, and has statutory responsibility for the national apprenticeship system.  The organisation has been closely involved in the national policy to expand apprenticeship and traineeship, supporting the Department of Education and Skills and working with education and training boards, higher education institutions, the Higher Education Authority, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, the enterprise community, apprentices and trainees.<br/><br/>Work has been under way since late 2014 on the expansion of apprenticeship in Ireland.  It draws on a strong track record, evidence that apprenticeship is an effective way to build the pipeline of talent within industry and a vision of its potential to become a major route to skills development in Ireland.  A national Apprenticeship Council appointed by the Minister for Education and Skills is steering the expansion of apprenticeships into new areas of industry and leading to awards from level 5 to level 10 on the national framework of qualifications.  SOLAS is represented on the council and acts as the council secretariat.<br/><br/>As of this month, November 2018, the number of national apprenticeship programmes stands at 42, up from 27 in 2016.  A further 35 programmes are in development.  Apprentice registrations have more than doubled from just under 2,000 in 2013 to more than 4,500 as of the end of October 2018.  Registrations on craft apprenticeships are exceeding forecasts and although registrations on the 17 newer programmes have been lower than originally envisaged, registrations are rising as the programmes become more established.  The new apprenticeships are developed and overseen by industry-led consortia.  During 2018 the Apprenticeship Council began engaging with these consortia to discuss progress, employer support for the new programmes and the ambition regarding targets for each apprenticeship by 2020.<br/><br/>A review of pathways to participation in apprenticeship was completed this year.  As the apprenticeship system expands, it is essential that skills development becomes a realistic, valued option for the widest possible cohort of young and older citizens in Ireland.  The review sets out five steps to tackle under-representation and exclusion in the apprenticeship system.  A national promotional campaign, Generation Apprenticeship, has been under way since May 2017.  It is designed to engage and influence employers, parents, teachers and potential apprentices on the opportunities arising from apprenticeship programmes.<br/><br/>The number of traineeships available via education and training boards, ETBs, has increased from 24 in 2016 to 51 as of November 2018.  ETBs have been working with employer partners on expansion of traineeship offerings over the past 12 months, in particular since publication by SOLAS, in partnership with ETBs, of the five-step guide to traineeship in Ireland<i>.  </i>While the target enrolments for traineeship in 2016 and 2017 were not achieved, enrolments have started to increase in 2018 and there are positive forecasts on traineeship enrolments for 2018 to 2020.  The introduction in 2018 of Skills to Advance, a new policy to support upskilling of lower-skilled employees, is also enabling ETBs to adapt traineeship provision so that people at work can access this route to skills development.<br/><br/>We ask the committee to note that overall, apprentice registrations are increasing year-on-year, as are the number of participating employers.  There are 17 new apprenticeship programmes available, with 35 more in the pipeline.  Apprentice registrations on new programmes are, however, in effect one year behind target.  Buy-in by employers to the new and expanded apprenticeship offerings will be a key success factor.  Regarding traineeship, enrolment targets have so far not been fully met but as of 2018, the trend in enrolments is upwards and there is a strong pipeline of 51 traineeship programmes now available, with positive forecasting on numbers for 2019 and 2020.  Similar to apprenticeship, employer buy-in to traineeships will be a key success factor over the next two years.</p></speech>

The expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship is a key priority for the Government.  The programme for Government and the Action Plan for Education contain a commitment to having a cumulative 50,000 enrolments on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes between 2016 and 2020.  This represents more than a doubling of activity over the period.  Details of how this overall target would be reached through increased enrolments each year were set out in the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship 2016-2020, along with information on a range of supporting initiatives.</p> <p>  Apprenticeship and traineeship are an important part of wider efforts to engage employers more closely in the education and training system and to ensure that education and training is meeting current and future skills needs.  The programme to expand apprenticeship and traineeship was starting from a difficult position.  Apprenticeship suffered enormously during the recession with a fall in registrations of more than 80%.</p><p>This closed an important avenue for young people.  As well as giving access to valued careers for learners, apprenticeships and traineeships deliver talented and work-ready people for employers.  Rebuilding these pathways to rewarding careers and increasing the pipeline of talent for employers have required significant work and new thinking.  </p><p> It was recognised that apprenticeships and traineeships needed to grow beyond the sectors of the economy that had traditionally engaged with the programmes and that this would need an entirely new approach.  Informed by an independent review of the apprenticeship system, the then Minister appointed the Apprenticeship Council in late 2014.  The remit of the council was to oversee the development of a range of new apprenticeships, initially through a call for proposals, and examine the issues associated with creating a more flexible and accessible model of apprenticeship that could meet the needs of a diverse range of employers.  Alongside this work, the curricula of existing craft apprenticeships were remodelled to keep pace with new methods and technologies in the workplace and ensure apprentices would have the broader range of literacy, numeracy, ICT and team working skills they needed to be successful.  Work was also undertaken by SOLAS with the education and training boards to engage with employers to develop a range of new traineeships in growing areas of employment.</p><p> Really good progress has been made.  There has been strong growth in apprenticeship registrations in recent years.  Seventeen new programmes have been developed through two open calls for proposals issued by the Apprenticeship Council and a strong pipeline of further programmes is in development.  A completely new model of flexible industry-led apprenticeships has been created, with a diverse range of programmes at levels 5 to 9 of the national framework of qualifications now in place.  Craft apprenticeships are growing strongly, with industry re-engaging with apprenticeship recruitment.  Nonetheless there are challenges.  Apprenticeship programmes have taken longer to get off the ground than originally envisaged and registrations of new apprenticeships are approximately a year behind the targets set in the action plan.  Female participation in apprenticeships remains low and the recovery in numbers in craft apprenticeships has not been evenly spread across all trades.  Traineeships which in the past were primarily for unemployed persons saw some falls in enrolment as unemployment reduced significantly.  However, there are plans in place to address these issues and the Department is confident about the future of these important programmes.</p><p> We are in a new phase of development of apprenticeships and traineeships.  All of the key building blocks are in place and there is an excellent base of new programmes.  The focus is now on employers and learners.  Through the Apprenticeship Council and other partners, we are working hard with employers to ensure they will fully exploit the new opportunities to develop the talent in their workforce.  It is only through real partnership and employer support that these important pathways into employment for the first time or career advancement can be opened up.  The Government is also working to address the visibility of apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities, promote these pathways to women and other under-represented groups and engage with the career guidance community.  The generation apprenticeship campaign is in full swing and the campaign has a lot to promote.  Only in the past two weeks, we have seen the first graduates from new apprenticeship programmes, hundreds of craft apprentices receiving their qualifications, the publication of a review of pathways to apprenticeship and the launch of a number of a number of new apprenticeship and traineeship programmes.  The Government, assisted by additional contributions from employers to the national training fund, has put significant additional resources into this area.  An additional &euro;27 million has been allocated in budget 2019, a tangible commitment to the programmes at a time when there are many competing demands for investment in education and training.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the contributions of the other bodies involved - I have already heard some of them - and discussing with committee members the progress made and the opportunities and challenges to come.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.715" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018111500002#D00300"><p>While I am a great supporter of apprenticeships, obviously I have major issues with their class dynamic.  When Mr. O'Flaherty referred to under-represented groups, I was wondering whether those who were under-represented in the uptake of apprenticeships were from the middle and upper classes.  I work with schools in Dublin and teachers of middle class pupils have come to us to ask how they can make apprenticeships attractive to pupils in their schools.  They are struggling to get them on board in considering the idea of taking up an apprenticeship.  When I think about apprenticeships, I look at them through the lens of my school days when the only option for the majority of my friends and class mates was an apprenticeship.  For me, it is about equality of access.  It should be about choosing to take up an apprenticeship, rather than being told that it is the only thing available to the student because of who he or she is and from where they come.</p> <p>  Many of the delegates have mentioned the growth in registrations for apprenticeships.  Part of me thinks it is good to have people working, but I view it in terms of social mobility.  The evidence is that parents who only have a second level education and who take up an apprenticeship will keep going straight, while their children's social mobility will continue to spiral downwards.  It is about being able to fill the gap; apprenticeships are not only about maintaining a certain number of people in a certain sector of employment, they are also about adding to the future progression and social mobility of young people as they become parents themselves and in terms of what their profession will mean for their children.  </p> <p>  Since I was at school, there has been a widening of the apprenticeship programmes and sectors involved.  Do the delegates have the demographics?  Dr. Murray mentioned a figure of 14,871 registrations; SOLAS mentioned a figure of 4,500 by the end of October; while the Department of Education and Skills talks about strong growth, but I would like to nail down the social backgrounds of the parents of the children taking up apprenticeships and the schools from which they are coming.  If the uptake of apprenticeships is highly concentrated among pupils from DEIS schools and more working class communities, what can we do to level the playing field in order that it will be more attractive across the board because college is not for everyone?  Whether one is from a DEIS school or a really good school, taking up an apprenticeship needs to be a viable option for more pupils other than those in a particular social class.  If the figures were available, it would be amazing to gain an understanding in that regard.</p></speech>

I recently saw a European league table on which we in Ireland were very much in the bottom half when it came to the scale and diversity of the apprenticeships on offer.  If we were to put the scale of the problem in perspective, the figures Dr. Jim Murray outlined are worth repeating.  In the 2017-18 academic year the total apprentice population was 14,871.  When one compares that figure to the 235,644 student enrolled in the same academic year in higher education, it nails down the scale of the problem in front of us.  For years, as Senator Ruane outlined, the sexy option was to proceed to higher education, while the lesser option was to take up an apprenticeship.  How do we tackle the statistics in a positive way?  A few of the delegates mentioned public awareness.  That is the key.  We need to do a substantial amount of work to increase public awareness to try to attract people to apprenticeships.  I come from County Monaghan.  If I was to mention the name Combilift, most people in this room would be familiar with it.  If I was to mention the name Martin McVicar, most people would associate it with Combilift.  If we were looking for an ambassador for apprenticeships, Mr. McVicar would fit the role very well.  He is managing director of a company that exports to more than 100 countries.  He took the route of an apprenticeship as opposed to attending third level.  If one were looking to find an ambassador for apprenticeships, one could pick up the telephone and call him.</p> <p>  I wonder about the level of consultation with employers.  Having listened to the presentations, it seems that, in terms of apprenticeships, the journey is only beginning.  It is admirable that we have made a start, but we have so much more to do.  There should be more consultation with employers.</p><p> The other statistic in figures I saw recently that strikes me is where apparently the level of female participation in apprenticeships in this country is 2% and that in our closest neighbour, the UK, is 50%.  Clearly, there is much to be done in that regard as well.  What can we do to increase that figure?</p><p> We need to incentivise employers to go down that road.  We need to incentivise those who are participating and show them a clear picture of what the endgame will look like.  Do the witnesses have anything in mind that could incentivise employers to go down this road?  For the unemployed who see an apprenticeship, initially at any rate, as leaving them not much better off financially than they would be if they were remain on social welfare, is there anything we can do to incentivise them as well?</p></speech>

I have read the opening statements.</p><p>I agree with much of what Senators Gallagher and Ruane have said.  It seems like there are many great ideas and there is a lot of good work going on to a certain extent, but my difficulty is that I do not think that information is filtering down to those at local level who might have an interest in apprenticeships.  It seems to be difficult for such people to get information.  For many, their first point of contact will be a local social welfare office, and those I deal with are pointed more in the direction of Turas Nua than towards any other option.  Whether it be some sort of training scheme through SOLAS or an apprenticeship, that information does not seem to be forthcoming.</p><p>Touching on what Senator Gallagher said about employers, I would know of a number of people who cannot find apprentices.  There are a bunch of people who are looking for information on how to get into an apprenticeship and there are many good points being said here today.  Somewhere along that spectrum, there is a piece missing or the information is not being funnelled down.  I do not know whether any of the witnesses are in a position to answer this, but when people go into their social welfare office, what is this obsession with Turas Nua and funnelling people towards that only?  That is where many of the difficulties lie.  I know of people who have been offered training schemes with SOLAS who have been told by Turas Nua that it cannot release them for that.  This is really stupid carry-on that makes no sense.  There needs to be something done to join up all those dots.</p><p>For some apprenticeships, such as a barbering apprenticeship to which there is a fee attached, the apprentices themselves must fund it.  Is there any option for them?  Someone coming from school who has been unemployed for less than a year will not qualify for the back to education allowance.  He or she will not qualify for a SUSI grant.  Where does such a person get that money?  Must such people source it themselves?  That can be a deterrent to them.  I would like to get some answers to that.</p><p>There is an <i>ad hoc</i>approach.  It is great if a person meets somebody locally who is good and will give that person the information, but what if that person does not?  It depends on where a person is in the country and who he or she meets on a particular day.  There does not seem to be any kind of uniformity in getting the information.  There was a debate last week on a Private Members' motion on apprenticeships during which the Minister stated that there is some financial incentive for employers to take on apprentices.  If there is, that information needs to be disseminated.</p><p>Mr. O'Flaherty explained how government is working to address the problems women have in finding pathways to apprenticeships.  What practical steps is the Department taking in that regard and is it looking at the issue of quality and affordable childcare, which is always a difficulty?  This comes back to different areas in different Departments not talking to each other.  To qualify for certain schemes, a person needs to be unemployed for a year or meet other criteria and he or she might qualify for something, but it means the person will not qualify for the affordable childcare.  What sort of joined-up thinking or interdepartmental dialogue occurs in that regard?  Those are the barriers for many.  It is a minefield when a person tries to get the information.</p><p>Perhaps Mr. O'Flaherty would be the most appropriate person to answer a question on the funding struggle of community education and the introduction of fees for those trying to get back on their feet, either through back to education or, as somebody I met yesterday said wisely, where this could be their first opportunity because the education system failed them in the first instance.  What if they are forced to pay fees?  Already, so much community education struggles for funding.  They do not like to have to ask the students who are coming to them for fees.  I would appreciate the opinions of the witnesses on such matters.</p><p>Some good measures were suggested.  Much of this came up last week as well.  For me, the information does not seem to be funnelling down to those on the ground, whether it be those who have left school early or those who have done the leaving certificate but want to do an apprenticeship rather than go on to higher education.  There does not seem to be the same funding stream for the latter.  For example, they do not qualify for SUSI grants and yet, financially, they would.  It is such issues that we need to look at.  It is not practical for many to pay those kinds of fees because while in an apprenticeship, they are on very low wages.  It would not be viable for them to pay those fees.</p></speech>

For a long number of years, there were no new apprenticeships developed.  They were essentially within the construction and engineering sectors, and that goes to some of the issues with recruitment.</p> <p>  The intention in implementing the recommendations of the review was that apprenticeship would offer a much broader range of opportunities for participants, both in terms of educational progression, so that the qualifications they would receive would be a pathway into higher education, and career progression of various types.  It was also the intention that it would involve the participation of a wide range of education and training providers so that a person could be an apprentice in a higher education institution.  We have a couple of universities, for example, getting involved in apprenticeship.  To some extent, the dichotomy between apprenticeship on the one hand and higher education on the other is something we are working to break down.</p> <p>  The broadening out of apprenticeship into new sectors should also offer opportunities to get involved in the apprenticeship system to those who do a range of different subjects in school and have a range of different interests.  I have spoken to young apprentices.  Female apprentices say of the opportunities for them to go into apprenticeships that, apart from cultural issues and issues with employer attitudes, they went to all-girls schools and it was not only a matter of access to careers information, guidance etc. but also that, in practical terms, the subjects they could take did not give them access to apprenticeship opportunities.</p> <p>  The social mix around apprenticeship is interesting.  In many countries, apprenticeship is something that operates at upper secondary level within schools where a student gets to the equivalent of the junior certificate here and decides to go either the academic or vocational route.  In Ireland, it is different.  Even in the craft apprenticeships, over 70% of entrants have completed the leaving certificate.  It is not a choice that people tend to make midway through their second level schooling.  In response to Senator Ruane, I do not have figures.</p><p>I think it would be a useful exercise.  We have lots of markers around educational achievement before people enter an apprenticeship from which, unfortunately, certain inferences around social background could be made.  The broadening out of the range of apprenticeship opportunities is intended to give those who enter apprenticeship a broader range of opportunities to move onwards but also to make apprenticeship available to a much broader range of people.  That is not to say that we just deal with an issue such as female participation in apprenticeship by saying we will have apprenticeships in areas that have much higher rates of female employment.  There is a job to be done in respect of the craft apprenticeships as well and around young women seeing themselves as having roles in the construction industry, engineering and motor mechanics.  The generation apprenticeship campaign tries to push those female role models.  I often think that where a female apprentice is in motor mechanics or engineering, the system leans quite heavily on her as a role model to speak about her experience and to give advice and direction to others.</p><p> Apprenticeship is complex in terms of growing the numbers.  There are no apprenticeships without employers taking people on.  There is a two-pronged issue in terms of generating interest for people to enter apprenticeships but also getting employers to engage.  Some of the incentive issues for employers are relevant.  Different apprenticeships bring about different experiences.  Many people are interested in getting involved in some of the newer apprenticeships in particular, but the struggle is to get enough places with employers.  There are other apprenticeships where there is a lot of employer interest and less interest from potential apprentices and learners.  The situation varies across apprenticeships.  Places in higher education must be funded.  The number of places can grow with the significant efforts that have been made by higher education institutions, but it is more complex to grow places in apprenticeship because employers must be recruited.</p><p> Deputy Funchion made a very good point about the visibility of opportunities.  Regrettably, a lot of apprenticeship recruitment is never seen by potential learners.  Employers take people on in the same way as they employ people more generally.  Some of it happens through word of mouth.  Social capital and other such issues become important in that regard in terms of the people who are aware of what is happening.</p><p> The pathways to apprenticeship approach proposes a number of ways to deal with that, including having an apprenticeship marketplace where those opportunities are more clearly visible.  SOLAS is working on that now.  That would also help give the Intreo offices and the social welfare service better visibility of apprenticeship opportunities than is the case at present.</p><p> The Department of Education and Skills meets the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on a range of issues in terms of the participation of people in education and training, those who are unemployed or those who are on a range of other payments, for example, single parents or those with disabilities and various other groups.  We advocate strongly for longer-term interventions for apprenticeship that would make real differences in people's lives, but other people who have significant skills and shorter interventions may be more appropriate in that regard.</p><p> In terms of apprenticeship and the intersection between it and some of the supports that were mentioned, apprentices are paid and they are employees.  I recognise that they are not always paid a lot but they are in a slightly different position than perhaps somebody who comes straight from school who has no income.  Apprentices are paid by their employers.  Nonetheless, there are very practical issues and there are probably broader issues around the taking up of employment by people in particular situations.  Reference was made to childcare.  The affordable childcare scheme is intended to enable women with caring responsibilities who want to become involved in the labour market to be supported into employment, and one of the types of employment we are talking about is apprenticeship.</p><p> Community education is an important means of bringing people into all sorts of education and training opportunities, through full-time programmes and certified learning into full-time further education and training programmes, and onwards into higher education and apprenticeship.  I am more than willing to engage separately on the issue but, typically, people on community education would not be in a position where they would need to pay fees.  However, I am more than happy to engage with Deputy Funchion on the issue.  There is sometimes an issue around the providers themselves who raise the cost of accessing certification given the fees that are involved in them registering with Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, for example.</p></speech>

I do not think that can be answered without getting into some of the granularity because there are different issues in different sectors and different regions.  I will raise it up one level to say the following, namely, that we really must get on top of the challenge that lies immediately ahead.  As I said in my opening statement, the future of jobs agenda is not an issue for the future, it is for today.  Thankfully, we are heading for full employment.  We know that we are only going to be able to add somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 at working age in terms of the population.  That means employers will be under a lot of pressure to find new skills and talent.  We can do what we can around net immigration, and that is happening already, but the real issue is how we improve the productivity of the economy to contribute to economic growth and to sustain jobs and lifestyle for people.  A key instrument of that is boosting the skill set we have in the working population.</p> <p>  Below that, we are seeing a lot of innovation happening.  One of the things to which we in Skillnet Ireland are very committed is working with enterprise.  A key question was asked about how we get enterprise engaged.  One of the key issues is working with it very strongly on workforce planning, development and bringing innovation to help people solve some of those talent problems and creating opportunities for workers to develop.</p> <p>  Senator Gallagher asked about female participation.  I will give one very simple example.  In the ICT sector, companies are crying out for skilled people to come and work in them.  The level of female participation has been an issue, with women, understandably, stepping out of their career, for example, to raise a family for a few years or to do other things.  For example, through Technology Ireland a programme has been put in place called Women ReBOOT, which is about reconnecting with women who were working in the sector, had taken time out and, because of the pace of change in the sector, had lost touch with what was happening in terms of skills.</p><p>We now have 20 of the largest technology companies in Ireland participating in the programme, which is getting women back into the sector and re-equipping and reskilling them and building their confidence.  This has been a great success.  That is granular and only one small example but it is the kind of thing that has to be done to build these sorts of responses.</p><p> Senator Gallagher asked a question about incentivisation.  There is an issue with regard to how we get enterprise more involved.  This is a major challenge for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, on which we are primarily focused.  The reason that is important at a macro level is that we recognise there is a major productivity deficit challenge, which is being masked by what is happening in the multinational sector.  At a superficial level, our productivity numbers are looking pretty good.  If we strip out the performance of the multinational sector, however, what we see is that productivity is relatively low, particularly in the SME sector.  The issue tends to arise in harder to reach areas such as parts of the construction sector, domestic services, hospitality, etc.  These sectors require a greater level of incentivisation to increase the commitment of employers to the types of tasks we are discussing in respect of participation in workforce training.  That extends across all levels.  This is about saying that we need a number of key things to happen at the same time, in particular lifelong learning must be incentivised and sold to companies.  Generally speaking, levels of participation currently stand at approximately 8.5%.  The policy commitment is to double that figure to about 15%.  While that commitment is welcome, we need to accelerate the process.</p><p> At all levels of the education and training system, we need to inculcate a culture of agile learning on the part of workers.  The systems we bring, including policy delivery and service support, have to be about preparing for the repurposing of skills and training.  I ask the committee to remember, as the World Economic Forum has pointed out, that by 2022, which is only a short number of years away, 54% of all workers will need some level of reskilling or upskilling.  That is one hell of a challenge and we need to be ahead of that in the competition for inward investment and to ensure job sustainability and in sustaining our regions.  The regions are where many of our SMEs are located and they are sustaining jobs outside of the major urban centres.  We have a significant role to play in that regard owing to our strong reach into every region and every sector.  However, we have more to do.  </p></speech>

One way of referring to it is the "Cinderella" status of apprenticeships.  This is not an easy issue to address.  The status of an education and training programme and how it is perceived socially is deeply embedded within the psyche.  It is a real cultural challenge that we have to take on and we should approach it in two ways.  First, we have to neutralise the term "apprenticeship".  Mr. O'Flaherty touched on this to a degree.  Apprenticeship has to be perceived more as a mode of provision, rather than as something that has a whole set of social values attached to it, notwithstanding whether they are right or wrong.  Second, we need to mainstream apprenticeships as a mode of provision.  That means they need to be much more visible within what I will describe, for want of a better term, as the regular system.  That is particularly the case in higher education.  The new apprenticeships have begun that task by putting apprenticeship right in at the heart of higher education.  This is a small beginning but degree programmes are now available which are in the apprenticeship mode of provision.  We have to keep working on that and make apprenticeships much more visible.  Over time, an attitudinal change will hopefully occur.  It is, however, a substantial challenge.  As Senator Gallagher mentioned, the numbers are stark.  There are reasons for that but with the new apprenticeships, we have opened up the discussion in a way that has never been done previously.  We have to sustain this discussion in the long term to make that change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.728" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary-Liz Trant" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018111500002#G00500"><p>I will make up a couple of points on the contributions thus far.  We talked about employers and the role of employers comes through very clearly.  The Apprenticeship Council has been engaging with employers involved in the new apprenticeships to discuss how things are going and the roll-out.  One of the issues that has emerged is that in apprenticeship programmes where a large number of employers went through the apprenticeship route, these employers are great champions of the programmes.  Mr. Martin McVicar was mentioned as an example.  He went through the apprenticeship route, understands it and is very committed to it as a way of learning and also of having a pipeline of talent.<br/><br/>In the newer apprenticeships in finance and even in the area of ICT, many employers have never engaged with an apprenticeship before.  We are doing a major piece of work to engage employers and get their buy-in because it is very influential.  The voices and experiences of the apprentices are the other issue.  The first graduates have come through from these new apprenticeship programmes and we will have more next year.  That social spread of people who are buying into and want apprenticeship opportunities is starting to shift but there is much more to do.  Part of the generation apprenticeship campaign is about changing that narrative.  At the heart of the messaging is that apprenticeship is a mode of learning and a choice.  We have to promote that.  <br/><br/>To return briefly to Senator Ruane's point, through the pathways review, we gathered as much information as we could on the social background and profile of apprentices.  We know that 85% are men under 25 years, 2.8% declared a disability and just 2% are women.  Interestingly, one of the new apprenticeships has more women than men but the majority of the traditional apprenticeships have a tiny number of women and, in some cases, none.  We have some of that information but in the pathways review we commit to getting more information in that area and to building that picture and understanding.  That is really important.<br/><br/>Deputy Funchion raised a point about apprenticeships in barbering and hairdressing.  We have an apprenticeship in development in that area.  It is planned to roll that out next year and it will include hairdressing and barbering.  We know the industry is really enthused and excited about this and view it as a structured way of getting opportunities for people who want to get into the industry.  It is also a way apprentices to earn and learn as they go through the programme.<br/><br/>To address a point Mr. O'Flaherty raised regarding the overall picture of awareness, we are working on what we are calling a jobs market where employers will be able to advertise vacancies.  It will be available on <i>www.apprenticeship.ie</i>.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, schools, guidance counsellors and employers will be able to provide this level of visibility of apprenticeship opportunities.  Where employers are finding it difficult to find apprentices or apprentices are not hearing about opportunities, we will be able to improve that.  We are working on that now and we hope to pilot it by the end of the year with a number of employers and then roll it out in 2019.  We believe it will be significant as part of that awareness-raising work.  </p></speech>

The committee was concerned by the statistics from last year showing that only 2% of apprenticeships were taken up by women.  We certainly hope this positive change will continue.  I thank Deputy Catherine Martin for standing in for me while I was on other D&aacute;il business.  I appreciate it.</p></speech>

I note that Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board, WWETB, is developing a nearly zero energy building, NZEB, centre of excellence and Limerick Institute of Technology is working with it to develop the training content for the programme.  This will upskill electricians, plumbers, blocklayers and others.  It is terrible that WWETB has to fight for money despite the work that it is doing.  This is the wave of the future and funding will be necessary if we are to address fuel poverty and improve our energy security.</p><p>While SOLAS has started new apprenticeships in auctioneering and property services, what actions is it taking to create them in services that improve the quality of the houses being auctioned, rented or sold?  Building standards are still under-regulated and inspected, although there is self-certification, while there is a severe lack of trained professionals to do the work required.  I know that many of the people who work in the areas of renovation, retrofitting and energy efficiency - the new green areas of the economy - have not been trained in Ireland and must travel elsewhere to acquire that expertise.  What is SOLAS doing at regional level to upskill in and support the retrofit sector?  What is its policy in that area?  Has it started to build on the pioneering work of Waterford and Wexford ETB in the area of retrofitting, especially considering the requirement to meet current and incoming EU energy efficiency and NZ targets?  I note that the action plan to expand apprenticeship and traineeship in Ireland 2016 to 2020 includes a target to have 67 apprenticeship programmes in place by the end of 2020 in new industry areas.  There is a clear upward trend, but are we preparing the apprentices for the reality of our changing economy and where we need to go?  Regarding the &euro;120 million allocated for apprenticeships in 2018 and the &euro;34.6 million allocated for traineeships to 2020, what is the breakdown in terms of how much has been invested in climate mitigation or adaptation measures, including energy efficiency measures, as compared to the level of investment in fossil fuel employment?  I believe there is talk of the European Social Fund which funds the new apprenticeship and traineeship fund being used to upskill fossil fuel workers in Germany and the Czech Republic.  Has the Department approached anyone at EU level or prepared any draft plan for the midlands to avail of such funding opportunities?</p><p> I am glad to see moves in the right direction towards gender balance, but SOLAS's submission does state the proportion of apprentices who are women is still 1%.  I am glad to hear that there is a move to encourage them to move beyond certain areas such as beauty therapy and hairdressing which quite clearly are saturated markets that are vulnerable to cyclical dips in the economy.  Care work is also an industry in which there are very poor pay levels and conditions.  Is there, for example, an Athena SWAN award equivalent for institutions and businesses in this area?  In addition, what departmental actions are being taken in the light of the fact that just 2.75% of apprentices declare a disability?  Furthermore, is there an apprenticeship expo?  Could this become a compulsory part of the transition year school programme?</p></speech>

To follow up on what Deputy Catherine Martin said about an apprenticeship expo, I know that in the mid-west there was recently an apprenticeship day.  Free buses were provided which collected students from schools and brought them to the expo.  It was a really successful day.  Parents turned up with students to find out about the various apprenticeships on offer, which was good.  I educated myself about some of the apprenticeships that I did not even realise were available.  For example, I did not realise there were apprenticeships in the area of refrigeration and so on.  I would not have thought about it before.  It is welcome that apprenticeships are growing because I am a big fan of them, especially given that third level education is not for everyone.  Many apprenticeships have been awarded.  I am aware of QQI, but some of the apprenticeships are being tied with the institutes of technology and the universities such that apprentices can be awarded, say, a certificate, a diploma or a degree.  Are they all being accredited or is it just some of them?  Given the fact that the expo was such a success, will it be repeated in other areas?  It was the second or third year it was run in the mid-west.  I pay tribute to Mr. Joe Leddin, the regional skills manager, who put the project together.  It was great to bring employers and apprentices together.  </p> <p>  This ties in with a question that was asked earlier.  Is there a lot of collaboration between employers and apprentices?  I spoke to some hairdressers recently.  They take on many apprentices and must pay the various fees, but they receive no incentive or tax relief or anything else.  Could this be considered?  Could employers be incentivised to take on apprentices in such a way that they would receive something at the other end for investing in the employee of the future?  Some employers take on many employees or apprentices and train them.  It is important that a balance be struck in that regard.</p> <p>  I think the delegates mentioned 35 other programmes in development.  Could we be given a broad outline of what else has been proposed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.733" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018111500002#H00300"><p>I welcome all of the delegates.  I apologise for being late.  I had a conflicting meeting to attend.  </p> <p>  I am delighted to see so much progress being made in developing the new apprenticeships, in particular.  I worked with some of the delegates in the establishment of the Apprenticeship Council.  It is most welcome that, I think, 67 apprenticeships are due to be created by 2020.  Really good work has been done.  The challenge now is to get the message out as broadly as possible because we need employers and apprentices to fish the opportunities that are available.</p> <p>  I join Senator Byrne in congratulating the regional skills organiser in Limerick, Mr. Joe Leddin, on organising the apprenticeship forum.  I think he is one of eight regional skills organisers throughout the country.  The forum is a model that should be followed in other places.  The delegates might let me know whether that is the plan.</p> <p>  I will focus mainly on getting the message out.  Someone mentioned the Generation Apprenticeship campaign.  I would like to receive an update on how widespread is the campaign.  Social media are crucial in getting young people interested.  Is there a need for a reinvigoration of the presence on social media to ensure young people know about the campaign?  I refer also to the local media, particularly in the case of parents.</p> <p>  I do not know whether anyone can do anything about the way in which league tables are published in newspapers, but the inclusion of apprenticeships, as well as higher education options, would make a difference in terms of perception.  I find it disgusting to read that such and such a school is the best in the country because 100% of its pupils go on to attend higher education when there are other, equally valid, opportunities that reflect the excellence of schools and which are completely brushed under the carpet.  Perhaps it might be worth contacting the media, specifically the newspapers that publish the league tables, to say apprenticeships should be included.  I do not know what the views of the delegates are or whether they would have a role in doing this.  Perhaps we might as a committee and it is something we could do.</p> <p>  The next issue I wish to raise follows on what members, particularly Deputy Catherine Martin, said about green building, the European Social Fund and the midlands.  The Youth Guarantee is another European concept that should capture young people who end up going to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection instead of the people about whom Deputy Funchion talked who should really be guided towards the opportunities which are meant to be covered under the Youth Guarantee scheme.</p> <p>  Regarding the midlands, I was struck by the reference to the displacement of peat and so on.  I think Mr. O'Flaherty might have some knowledge of the globalisation fund.  Is funding available to direct people who may have been involved in the use of fossil fuels, etc., towards alternative opportunities?</p></speech>

I apologise that I did not get to hear all of the presentations, but I will have an opportunity to look back at the transcript.  I also had the opportunity to read the submissions made prior to the meeting.</p><p>I will have the opportunity to look back at the transcript, and I read the submissions prior to the meeting.  The witnesses mentioned that the 1967 legislation is now over 50 years old.  Is it necessary to examine the legislation and consolidate the Acts to make the process more efficient?  The committee could look at that.</p><p> Engagement with career guidance teachers is very important.  Are there sufficient numbers of career guidance teachers to enable such engagement?  It would appear that apprenticeships suffer from a lack of parity of esteem, which is an issue we have to address for our younger people who are getting ready to leave school.  The career guidance teacher has a big role to play on that.  </p><p> Will the witnesses provide more information about the promotion of traineeships, as opposed to apprenticeships?  That is another important area.  </p><p> The Government has proposed increasing the National Training Fund between now and 2020.  The witnesses are liaising with industry.  Is industry supportive of that proposal?  </p><p> On the issue of women taking up apprenticeships, women tend to avail of flexible working arrangements.  Are there training courses that are offered on those terms?  </p><p> In its submission, the Department stated that traineeships in the past were associated primarily with unemployed people, but as unemployment levels have dropped this has obviously impacted on uptake.  Has this resulted in a drive towards attracting second level students to traineeships?  Are different courses available to people in their late 40s or early 50s who are unemployed, including those who have taken redundancy?  I am thinking of the employees of Bord na M&oacute;na.   We must be able to attract these people to different types of classes to ensure they remain employable.  They are only halfway through their working lives.  </p><p> Do the witnesses believe that some form of positive discrimination could be applied to apprenticeships and traineeships to encourage a greater uptake?  By that I mean possible tax breaks for employers or employees, perhaps by allowing people who have been on benefits to retain a medical card.  Would that help?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.736" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phil O'Flaherty" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018111500002#J00200"><p>I thank the members of the committee for their contributions.  They have provided us with plenty of food for thought.  SOLAS might comment on the promotion agenda and the expos we have engaged in.  A major event will occur in the spring of next year.  Members may have heard of WorldSkills, which is akin to the skills olympics.  The national version of that event, which will determine the participants at the WorldSkills event, is being brought together with a major expo in the RDS in March so as to anchor the work we have done on apprenticeships and promote excellence.  There is more to be said about promotion, but I will leave it to Dr. Trant to provide more details.</p> <p>  The idea of using the European Social Fund, ESF, is interesting.  Without being too technical in the short time available, the total amount of ESF funding is determined at the outset of the programming period at EU level and is set for the various member states.  This essentially makes it part of overall budgetary planning.  It is not that additional resources can be acquired from the EU for specific things.  It must all come from the overall ESF budget.  The question of what is included within our operational programmes is important, and further education and training is a major part of ESF supported opportunities.  As Deputy Jan O'Sullivan said, there are opportunities for specific additional interventions through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, EGF.  I do not know if it is being deployed in the case of the Bord na M&oacute;na workers or for the decarbonisation agenda more generally or what impact it has on the economy, but I will certainly check with colleagues as to whether that is a part of it.  People are aware of various major interventions facilitated by the EGF, and it is not always for one particular company.  For example, it was used during the downturn in the construction industry on a broader basis, but I will check the position on that and come back to the committee with the information it requires.</p> <p>  The question of new building techniques and retrofitting was raised.  The content of apprenticeship programmes is being changed at the moment.  Members will be aware of the 27 craft apprenticeships.  The curricula of those apprenticeships have been reviewed to look at new building techniques and regulations and how they impact on the various trades.  A fairly significant part of those updated curricula involves ensuring that those different types of techniques are included.  There are also a range of non-apprenticeship programmes which provide education and training in the areas of retrofitting.  I do not have details of how much of the overall further education and training budget is going towards those programmes, but they exist and we can provide additional information on that.  I am aware of the specific provision that is being put together in that area by the Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board, WWETB.  Hopefully that will provide an example for other parts of the country.</p> <p>  Perhaps this goes to Deputy Funchion's point about barbering earlier, but in terms of incentives, there are some things that in the common parlance are called apprenticeships but which are not necessarily statutory apprenticeships.  The flow of State funding and resourcing for those sorts of programmes is not the same.  We have people who are being called apprentice bar persons or apprentice barbers, but they are not State funded and they do not form part of the statutory programme.  As Dr. Trant said, barbering and hairdressing are coming into the fold through a specific proposal and a programme is being developed, but where programmes are not on a statutory basis, not only do they not receive the same State supports, but the employees are not getting the same levels of protection available to apprentices under the statutory system.  That may have something to do with the difficulty people have in engaging with some of those programmes.</p> <p>  On league tables, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan will be aware that this is a very contentious issue.  League tables are not supplied by the Department but are collated by media organisations through information supplied by the CAO and other sources.</p><p>However, I am aware that SOLAS has made a conscious effort broadly in further education and training but also in the specific area of how apprenticeship features as a mark of success.</p><p> Going back to Dr. Jim Murray's point, there is a danger that high levels of conversion into apprenticeships, because of some public perceptions, are not necessarily seen as a positive development.  While I do not agree with it, it all plays into the picture.  We are looking at some positive discrimination.  The review of pathways to apprenticeship discusses this point.  There is a bursary for recruiting female apprentices in the craft sectors.  We are looking to extend this into other sectors.  We need to engage with some of our other Government colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get agreement around that.  We are looking to extend that into new areas as well as to people with disabilities.</p><p> On the 1967 legislation and the statutory framework for apprenticeship as a whole, we are gathering information from employers about their experiences of engaging with apprenticeship programmes.  We will consider areas and specific issues which may need some attention from a statutory perspective.  There is not a formal proposal at this stage to change the legislative framework and it is a complex area.  Some may argue the system is bureaucratic.  However, this offers protection to apprentices in terms of the quality of the education and training they receive.  It is important that agenda is fully protected.</p><p> On industry and the increase in the national training fund, obviously there was a formal consultation process around that.  Employers said they are in a time of uncertainty, such as Brexit and various other issues, and they do not need additional costs regarding employment.  We have walked a journey with employers around this.  There was a review of the national training fund which came up with 14 recommendations around greater employer say in the allocation of funding and what the priorities should be.  An implementation plan for those was published alongside budget 2019.  An advisory group will be set up involving employers as well.  There is recognition that greater funding is coming from employers, and with that comes some obligations around influence.</p></speech>

In our experience in Skillnet Ireland, the capacity to engage locally through social media and all the various other channels such as local media is important.  Again, we have had some valuable experience around what works and does not.  I would be happy to share that with the committee.</p> <p>  Women being offered flexibility of options in training is important.  To be fair, our experience is that employers are much more sensitive to that, not least because they have a challenge trying to attract people into their businesses.  Obviously, people are testing employers to see the career mobility options available.  Part of that is how the training approach is done.  There is a much greater willingness to look at more flexible, modular, part-time evening programmes of one form or another.  Back in the day, parts of retailing might have been described as just a job in a shop.  It is not just a job in the shop and employers have grasped that issue.  Through the work done with ourselves, there is now an active presentation of a full career in retailing, whereby people, predominantly women, are having prior learning recognised.  We are working with the qualification bodies to ensure, in a systematic way, that people who may not have a leaving certificate but have worked in a retail environment for five or ten years can have that experience recognised as a stepping stone towards career progression.  People can have their skill sets properly recognised and certified up to allowing for career progression whereby they can now have a degree in retail management practice at level 7 in the qualifications framework.  That is significantly powerful and impactful.  From a business perspective, it is important because it is attracting somebody into the sector, giving them an opportunity to see ahead and retaining them within the sector.</p> <p>  What is happening to the cohort of people in their 40s and 50s?  That is an important issue.  We have had that experience when the construction sector collapsed and the challenges presented in terms of cross-skilling and getting people retrained in new sectors such as green energy and sustainability.  Even around the unfortunate experience of closures, we have been heavily involved in supporting workers who have been impacted by closures such as Coty in Tipperary, Hewlett-Packard in Kildare, TalkTalk in Waterford, Cameron in Longford and so on.  One has to have a response to cater for those particular requirements.  That has worked but it is about tailoring the response, the agility of the response and working collaboratively with other agencies.  We have been able to bring that very much to the focus of the task in hand.</p></speech>

There are statutory quality assurance guidelines to which all providers of apprenticeships have to adhere.  They then would be operated through the awarding bodies and the higher education institutions for apprenticeships at levels 6 to 10.  They would be the accrediting bodies in those instances but operating under national guidelines.</p> <p>  In terms of legislation, the issue is around the policies and processes that flow out of multiple sets of legislation.  That is where work among the agencies and providers can, over time, work on streamlining those processes.  It is necessary because it helps to break the logjam in terms of the throughput of programmes coming through the system.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin had an interesting idea about having the Athena SWAN Charter for apprenticeships.  We may be able to look at that in due course.</p> <p>  On the gender issue and access more broadly, as well as the system level activities, which Mr. Phil O'Flaherty and Dr. Mary-Liz Trant have articulated, there are also institutional on the ground efforts.  I know DIT has a new programme called access to apprenticeship.  It is run in three cycles over 12 weeks.  It would bring in many young kids from socially and economically deprived areas to sample the different types of apprenticeship.  That is the successful way of bringing people into the system.  DIT has also had an open day specifically targeted towards women.  There are many local initiatives complementing the central efforts.</p></speech>

We have 16 education and training boards, 14 institutes of technology, as well as more universities, and all of the employers.  A big part of the generation apprenticeship competition has been about co-opting everybody in that.</p><p>We have that local and regional reach.<br/><br/>Senator Byrne asked about what was happening in the mid-west.  We now have these structures in place throughout he country which are very powerful and effective and making a very big contribution.  The <i>apprenticeship.ie </i>website which receives approximately 25,000 visitors per month plays a big role in supporting, facilitating and generating apprenticeships.  We are working to make it a one-stop shop, with a profile and a link with the jobs market.  We are expanding our significant social media presence and have profiles on LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook.  We are examining how to reach men in their mid 20s, school leavers and transition year students, while not forgetting the role played by employers.<br/><br/>Members may be aware that the ESB recently received an award as part of European Vocational Skills Week for its work on apprenticeships and in attracting women into electrical apprenticeships, which traditionally were predominantly filled by men.  It has done a significant amount of work in promoting opportunities and now has approximately 16 female apprentices, whereas two or three years ago there were only one or two.  It is showing the way in terms of what can be done by an employer.<br/><br/>The Chairman asked how we were promoting traineeships.  We are working closely with education and training boards across the country in that regard and have a very exciting pipeline of 51 traineeships on offer.  We provide national support in branding, availing of opportunities to organise workshops, engaging with employers and working with the regional skills forums hand in hand with the education and training boards and their connections with employers.<br/><br/>Senator Byrne asked what was in the pipeline.  The detailed list is available and includes apprenticeships in sales, retail, ICT, farming, horiticulture and engineering.  Four chef apprenticeships will be available by the middle of next year, doubling our current offering.  There will be apprenticeships in supply chain logistics, which is of great importance in the context of Brexit.  There is a wide range of offerings.  Part of what the council is doing is looking at how to ensure our apprenticeship offering is responsive in what we have and what we will need.<br/><br/>Deputy Catherine Martin asked what was being done on the issue of climate change.  We are working closely with the Construction Industry Federation and other partners on an ongoing basis to ensure the existing apprenticeship courses have the content required to ensure we are responding to these imperatives and regulations and so on, to identify new areas in which apprenticeships are needed or need to be adapted and to ensure we can do so.  The council is piloting an engagement with employers and other bodies to ensure it has its finger on the pulse in that regard.<br/><br/>The Chairman asked about life-long learning and opportunities for employees, including those at risk of losing their jobs.  Apprenticeship is increasingly an opportunity for people in employment.  Up to half of those in the first intake in insurance and engineering apprenticeships were employees who might have been working for five or ten years, did not have a formal qualification and were being facilitated by their employer to undertake the apprenticeship and potentially take up more senior positions in their company.  Obviously, apprenticeship is increasingly a very important route for young people, but it is also for learners of all ages and backgrounds, as evidenced by the surge in new apprenticeships, of which it is to be hoped we will see more as time passes.</p></speech>

What is the exact policy on the retrofit sector?  I refer to the work done by Waterford Wexford ETB in that regard.  Is it something that will be addressed many years into the future?  That is not where we need to be; rather, we need to deal with it in the here and now.  Is there a timeframe for building on the pioneering work done by Waterford Wexford ETB?  What is the plan and when will it be implemented?  The Irish Green Building Council stated people were not being trained in Ireland in retrofitting, which is appalling.  It is the new green economy.  Many employees, particularly in the midlands, will need to be retrained and upskilled.  What is the plan in that regard?</p></speech>

However, dimensions of the construction apprenticeship curriculums now include those elements and one could look to what is being allocated for those apprenticeships.  However, we will examine the matter further to see what further information can be provided.</p> <p>  We are very supportive of the work of Waterford Wexford ETB and that previously carried out by Limerick Institute of Technology.  I do not have immediate information on the overall plan, but we can revert to the committee with further information on it.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Flaherty referred to the apprenticeship skills event in March, which is a super idea.  The committee would like to visit it and I ask Mr. O'Flaherty to let us know, if possible.  The committee was very impressed by the apprentices who represented Ireland at WorldSkills.</p> <p>  I could not agree more on the importance of retail apprenticeships.  It is very important to show that there is a pathway through the retail sector.  Two of the most recent entrants into the grocery market provide very good pathway and graduate programmes which contribute to attracting people to the area.</p> <p>  It has been a very interesting and engaging discussion.  We will resume our examination of the issue next Tuesday, 20 November, when representatives of four other groups will appear before the committee.

Today&rsquo;s meeting follows previous engagements with the chair and the then chief executive of Caranua last year and more recent meetings with two former members of the board of Caranua.</p> <p>  With regard to the role of the Department and the historical background, it might be useful if I summarised at the outset the Department&rsquo;s role in respect of supporting survivors.  This role extends back many years and arose from the fact that, historically, the Department had a statutory role in respect of the operation of industrial and reformatory schools.  Thankfully, those institutions are no longer in existence.  When the issue of abuse in those institutions became the focus of public attention 20 years ago, the Government gave the Department the task of implementing a number of measures, including the establishment of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the Residential Institutions Redress Board, and the Redress Review Committee.  These bodies have virtually completed their work and we expect they will be dissolved in the near future.</p> <p>  A fourth body, the Education Finance Board, was also in existence but was dissolved and, in effect, replaced in 2013 by the residential institutions statutory fund, also known as Caranua, which has a wider mandate than the finance board and significantly more funding available to it.  That funding derives from a commitment by religious congregations to provide funding of &euro;110 million for additional supports to survivors who have received an award from the redress board, equivalent court awards or settlements.  Having been in receipt of such an award is a key criterion for applying for and receiving assistance from Caranua.  As regards the funding available, to date almost &euro;102 million of the &euro;110 million has been received, as well as an additional &euro;1.3 million in interest associated with contributions.  There is clearly an outstanding balance.  The Christian Brothers have written to the Department to say that they expect to provide the balance of the funding by the first quarter of 2019.</p> <p>  Under its founding legislation, Caranua is statutorily independent in carrying out its functions.  With regard to the services provided by Caranua, its board is responsible for strategy, policy, governance, oversight and control, with the executive of the body reporting to it.  For example, the board is responsible in law for determining what services are approved services.  These must fall under the four classes of services set out in section 8 of the 2012 Act.  Those classes are: mental health services, health and personal social services, educational services, and housing support services.  The board also determines the criteria by reference to which decisions are made on individual applications, but it does not make decisions on them.</p> <p>  In the context of the 2012 Act, the Minister&rsquo;s role relates to matters such as the appointment of board members, the appointment of the independent appeals officer or officers, the approval of contracts and consultancies, and certain staff matters.  The Minister is also responsible for managing the process of receiving contributions from religious congregations and making those contributions available to Caranua via the National Treasury Management Agency.</p> <p>  With regard to applications and expenditure, since Caranua began accepting them in January 2014, it has received in excess of 6,500 applications, and by the end of October it had expended some &euro;78 million on supports for former residents.  To date, 5,000 individuals have benefited directly.  The supports from Caranua have made a tangible difference to the lives of many people.  Some of the case studies both on the website and in the recent annual report are illustrative of this.</p> <p>  The Department is, of course, aware that there is a degree of dissatisfaction with the quality of the service provided by Caranua.  We suggest that some of that dissatisfaction should be seen in the context of the fact that Caranua had to be established from scratch from a greenfield site.  There was no previous body doing equivalent things.  It has to be said there were teething troubles in its formative years.  Ultimately, however, while Caranua must speak for itself on these issues as an independent agency, there is strong evidence that it has and is continuing to address the concerns expressed about its operations.  For example, following feedback from survivors, the following additional services were introduced: the provision of household goods such as cookers, fridges, floors and home decoration; contributions towards funeral costs; contributions to the cost of reconnecting with family members and home place, from which some 180 people have benefited; and active listening to the stories of survivors.</p> <p>  As regards making an application for support from Caranua, each survivor is assigned an application adviser to assist him or her through the process of applying for services.  The length of time it takes to process applications very much depends on the specific needs of the individual survivor, consistent with the person-centred approach taken by Caranua.  Caranua has two dedicated call line operators who are the first port of call for those who contact the fund by phone.  If a survivor does not get a response and chooses to leave a voicemail, the policy is to call that person back within 24 hours.  Three further attempts will be made if the call line operator or adviser does not get through to the survivor on the first attempt.</p> <p>  It is also proper that there should be a right of appeal against Caranua's decisions.  That is enshrined in the legislation.  That appeals mechanism is independent of Caranua.  With regard to the structuring of the appeals mechanism, initially one person served in this position.</p><p>When that person stepped down in 2017 two appeals officers were appointed.  The Minister made these appointments cognisant that a backlog of 140 appeals cases had built up.  In May 2018, one of the two officers stepped down for personal reasons.  However, as the matter of the backlog had been addressed, the Minister decided to revert to the original arrangement of one appeals officer.  We understand that there are currently 45 appeals cases on hand.  We are keeping the matter under close review and should there be a question of a backlog arising again, the Minister will think of appointing a second appeals officer.<br/><br/>Concerns have also been expressed about the length of time taken to conclude appeals.  However, to observe due process, the appeals process requires that the views of all parties be sought on the matters under appeal and as a result, inevitably it takes a certain length of time for appeals to be processed. <br/><br/>I would also like to clarify that since mid-2016, applicants to Caranua whose applications are not approved are notified in writing of their right to appeal and how to go about the process of making an appeal.  Sample letters are included in the background briefing submitted to the committee, along with a range of statistical information on the appeals.  In addition, I would note that since 2016 there has been a sharp downturn in the number of complaints in respect of Caranua.  We have provided a graph to illustrate that in the additional material we submitted.<br/><br/>I would like to address a number of policy issues bearing on the recent and future operations and future of Caranua.  First, it will be recalled that the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund, RISF, is a cash limited fund.  Any cash contributions from the congregations in excess of the &euro;110 million statutorily provided for in the fund are statutorily required to go towards the costs associated with the development of the National Children's Hospital. <br/><br/>Some survivors and advocates for survivors have expressed their view that the cap of &euro;15,000 which the Board of Caranua introduced in 2016, has resulted in an organisation that is not sufficiently responsive to the needs of survivors, or catering for them sufficiently.  I must stress that the application of the limit is a decision for Caranua.  However, it might be observed that issues relating to the equitable treatment of the cohort of survivors do arise when decisions of this nature are to be made, and the balancing of an equitable spread of assistance across the population of survivors.  It might also be observed that Caranua has to strike a balance in the need to engage as flexibly and compassionately with survivors as possible and its obligations as regards its fiduciary obligations and other accountability requirements.  While procedures may be seen by some as too bureaucratic, the fact is that it has been necessary for the organisation to respond to the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General in this regard. <br/><br/>By end October, Caranua had expended &euro;87 million of the &euro;110 million in funds.  Cognisant of the rate at which the fund was being expended and the applications on hand, Caranua in May 2018 announced a cessation date for new applications, save for extreme hardship cases.  Caranua set the date of 1 August for that.  Unlike the earlier experience of the Residential Institutions Redress Board, where there was a large spike in the applications when that board announced the cessation date for new applications, this has not happened in the case of Caranua.  This is notwithstanding the fact that Caranua engaged in an extensive publicity campaign including advertisements and engagement with survivor groups.  Caranua is still engaging with survivors both in respect of applications on hand, of which there remains a significant volume, and in its support and advocacy function which aims to assist survivors in engaging with other State providers of supports.<br/><br/>The objective underpinning the work of Caranua was that it would address the critical needs of former residents.  Those needs were identified by former residents themselves in a consultation process undertaken in 2010 as being in areas such as housing, health and related supports.  That consultation process informed the drafting of the 2012 Act.  <br/><br/>The Department is continuing to engage on the future needs of survivors.  While conscious of time, I would like to mention three areas.  First, we are undertaking a <i>post hoc</i>review of the various redress schemes under the aegis of the Department, including looking at relevant international experience.  The purpose of the review is both to reflect on what has happened over the period we have been providing redress and also thinking about what we have learned and what lessons there may be for the future across the whole of Government where issues of redress arise.  Second, we are planning to hold a number of consultation sessions which would serve as a forum for former residents and others with close personal involvement to reflect on their experiences, on the State&rsquo;s response to redress and the issue of institutional abuse and to make any recommendations they wish to make.<br/><br/>These sessions will be externally facilitated and we propose to shortly issue a request for tender for the services of a facilitator, who will assist in the process of planning and scoping the sessions.  Let me stress that the sessions will be independently facilitated and will be independent of the Department.  We are conscious that survivors want the sessions to be delivered by survivors for survivors.<br/><br/>Third, we have convened an interdepartmental committee recently to examine how existing mainstream State services can best meet the needs of survivors into the future.  The committee met for the first time on 5 November and will meet again in December.  We are compiling an inventory of all of the various State services and supports that may be of relevance to survivors and also look at issues such as signposting, and whether the services are sufficiently attuned and how survivors can best be directed to the services and benefit from them.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for its attention and that concludes my statement. </p></speech>

Let me respond to the point made about teething problems, things not working out and changes made.  It is very hard for me to hear Mr. Costello refer to the downturn in complaints when the experience of our offices dealing with and offering supports to survivors paints a very different picture.  I wonder why there is a downturn in the number of complaints.  Perhaps people are fed up waiting between 18 months to two years in some cases trying to get white goods for their kitchen.  They probably have given up and some may have passed away.  We do not know the reason for the downturn.  It does not necessarily mean it is positive.  When I hear of the concept of a person-centred approach, I think of a man who not only has a social worker advocating for him, he also has me stepping in trying to advocate for him and,  after years of going through this process, the most he has managed to get is a skip.  He has not been able to get simple white goods for his kitchen because when he goes to PowerCity, he is told he cannot get them because of the need to pay through bank transfer or cheque.  Then he is sent somewhere else.  After all the years, he still cannot get simple white goods for his kitchen.  That is not a person-centred approach.  I would not put myself through that degrading treatment - of having to beg for a washing machine or a cooker.  That is what it feels like when one has to keep coming back with more information.  I do not believe this is a person-centred service.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions that are focused on the Department's role and I welcome the consultation with survivors.  That will be extremely important.  It would be great if the Department were to keep the committee updated on the process and if we on the committee can support that process in any shape or form.  We need to ask for an independent investigation into the operations of Caranua and its treatment of survivors, whether that feeds into the process of consultation or whether there is an independent investigation into the operation of the scheme.  What is really crucial is that we look at the role of the current chairman and chief executive.  While there is a consultation process and there are still applications that have not been met, maybe we need to bring in an independent chairperson.  I know it has been said that Caranua is independent, but it would help if the Department were to find an independent chairperson and independent acting CEO while we are trying to process some of the applications that are getting lost in the ether.</p><p>On the Department's role, in what way is the Department supervising Caranua, particularly given the widespread reports of poor treatment of survivors?  How would it describe Caranua's performance over the past four years, particularly bearing in mind the objective of the fund, which is to help with the recovery of survivors?  What measures did Caranua use to come up with its 90% performance rate?  We are accepting this 90% but nobody really knows what the measurement was and no one has seen a report.  I know the past board members were not part of any sort of survey or report that came up with that 90% rate of satisfactory performance.  </p><p> Caranua committed to a review of the impact of the 2016 changes to services, including the impact of the introduction of the limit of &euro;15,000 by June 2017.  Has that review been carried out?  What were its conclusions?  There is also evidence that the imposition of a cap has had devastating consequences for the applicants with the greatest need.  Does the Department wish to comment on that?  In giving evidence to both the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, Caranua committed to improvements in communication.  These improvements included reaching out to applicants where they lived and the provision of interview facilities at the new premises.  Of concern to the committee is whether Caranua has successfully reached out to the most vulnerable such as those in hospitals, in prisons, or on the streets, which it said it would do in past meetings, as there is no evidence of this so far.  </p><p> The residential institutions redress unit, RIRU, is the unit tasked with providing support to Caranua in redress issues generally.  The RIRU is reported to be in the process of winding down its operations with a view to closure in the very near future.  Given Caranua's imminent closure, is this the best time to close the RIRU?  Might it be better for this team to remain to ensure that any post-Caranua measures are embedded and to help ensure that Caranua's closure is achieved with the minimum of disruption to survivors?</p></speech>

I was struck by something in Mr. Costello's opening statement which said "The Department is, of course, aware that there is a degree of dissatisfaction with the quality of the service provided by Caranua."  There is much more than a degree of dissatisfaction.  It was said in a meeting of this committee earlier this year, and I will repeat it, that the State has failed.  Worse still, it continues to fail and that is to our shame as a State.  Before I ask my questions, I commend and refer to all of those who have advocated and who continue to advocate so courageously for the survivors.  They have never given up and they have been so resilient against all the odds.  What has been done by the survivors for the survivors has been incredible.</p> <p>  My questions centre around the issue of the appeal process.  What are the Department's concerns regarding the very different number of appeals granted by the former appeals officers, of which only 8% were successful, and granted by the two appeals officers appointed in April 2017?  Under these officers 43% of appeals were successful.  How have the officials satisfied themselves that the former appeals officer was not overly harsh, looking at the difference in those statistics?  How does the Department explain the very low number of appeals submitted by applicants to the fund?  There were 399 over three years.  Is the number low because of Caranua's failure to tell applicants they could appeal, which is again a symptom of poor communication?  Considering the very high number of appeals won by applicants since 2017, how has the Department ensured that Caranua's refusals are fair and in line with the Act, particularly as we have reports of this not being the case?  </p> <p>  Similarly there have been allegations of abuse of the appeals process on the part of Caranua, for example the introduction of new reasons for refusal once the appeals process has commenced and refusals on grounds not contained in the Act or in the criteria.  Is the Department aware of these allegations?  If yes, what has it done to look into them?  Has the Department ever seen a list of the reasons given by Caranua in the determination letters or further reasons for refusal only being given after the appeals process commenced?  If the Department has not seen the letters, perhaps it would like to ask to do so and to consider that information.  </p> <p>  We have also heard of several applications for services made in 2015 by applicants who have serious disabilities, who urgently need help, and who are still waiting.  In these cases we believe Caranua initially refused to issue a determination letter and then only agreed to issue the letter 12 months later, after investigation by the appeals officer.  The applicants were then refused the services.  The applicants successfully appealed in 2017, having waited 18 months for the appeal decision, or still have not been provided with the service.  Is the Department aware of these particular applications?  Does it have any information on them?  Is that the case?</p> <p>  I believe some applicants who were recently interviewed on radio are now considering legal action.  It is estimated that the cost of these cases could exceed &euro;500,000 and that this money might well come out of the fund.  Has the Department received reports of this?  If the cost was to come out of the fund, at what stage would the Department step in to prevent the fund suffering such losses?  What does the Department think of such cases and what do they tell us about the operation of the fund by Caranua?  What can we, as a committee, and the Department do to improve matters for survivors in the time the fund has left?  The service really has failed to provide survivors with a service.</p></speech>

I want to start, if I may, with a quote from Tom Cronin, who appeared before the committee just a few months ago.  He is a former board member of Caranua.  It is important to remember the people we are talking about here and what they have gone through.  Mr. Cronin said:</p><blockquote>What happened to us as children was a shame on the nation but what has been done to us since is a greater shame.  As a survivor, I have experienced the anger, hurt, despair and frustration of engaging with the redress commission and other State-established resources.  As a survivor advocate for more than 20 years and a former board member of Caranua, I have personally witnessed many survivors experiencing the same.  These schemes and the State&rsquo;s response to our past have failed on an ongoing fashion for one reason, namely, they never listened to survivor needs.</blockquote> <p>As one can hear from that quote, the testimony of Mr. Cronin on that day was absolutely powerful, as was that of Dr. Mary Lodato.  I suspect we have unanimity across all parties here because all parties have received representations telling us of appalling experiences at the hands of Caranua.  Only this morning I heard that someone who physically handed in an application received a dressing-down; &quot;How dare you come down to our offices&quot;.  How can anyone imagine that is an appropriate response?  This happened in the last month, by the way, to someone who suffered abuse.  What kind of culture is there in the organisation Caranua that makes it okay to act like that?  It is absolutely shocking.  I appeal to the Department because we have to work together.  We are not here to give it a hard time.  We just need to make sure that Mr. Cronin's request is followed up on and that survivors are listened to.  We have to recognise that.  </p><p>I echo my colleague, Senator Ruane's call for an independent investigation.  We need that because we are unable to produce a report.  We are told that we cannot produce a report as a committee because of conflicting evidence.  We cannot leave it as it is so we have to have an independent investigation.  Otherwise, we have failed to listen again.  I do not believe any of us, including the witnesses, would want to leave it in that position.  I call for an independent investigation.  I also call for a new management structure to be put in place as a matter of urgency to make sure that things improve from here on in.</p><p>I have a couple of questions.  I am going to rattle through them.  I am conscious that the Department's representatives have a lot of questions to answer here today so I will briefly get through as many as I can and then hand over to our colleagues.  My questions are around the processing of applications.  I am sure the Department will agree that Caranua's primary role is to accept and process applications, applying the criteria to each case, and to either pay for the service or to give the applicant a written determination letter giving the reason for refusal.  What can the Department tell us about the 2016 appeal officer's investigation of Caranua and its refusal to process applications?</p><p>We believe that at the time Caranua put these breaches down to an "oversight" on its part.</p><p> What has been the Department's reaction each year to the "serious concerns" raised in each of the appeal officer's annual reports published in 2016, 2017 and October 2018?  Caranua still refuses to process applications, fails to issue written determinations and fails to give information about the right of appeal.  Last month, the Taoiseach said he wanted evidence of this, and we assume he has been directed to these reports.  I am somewhat concerned by what Mr. Costello said in his opening statement about people now receiving written determinations, because that is not what the appeals officer told us in the report he produced last month in which he said there continue to be cases on this issue.  I do not understand, therefore, how the Department included that line when the appeals officer's report told us that is not the case.  </p><p> The evidence from the appeals officer and the other reports demonstrate these failings are widespread and affect hundreds, if not thousands, of applicants.  How has the Department responded to the reports of this?  Given these practices have been ongoing for four years, in the Department's estimation how many applicants may not have had their applications properly determined and thus denied a right of appeal?  It is important to know that and, in fairness, if we do not know, that again tells us why we need this independent investigation.  Under the Act which concerns Caranua, the Minister has power to direct it and, while it would be improper for him to give directions in respect of an individual case, it would be appropriate for him to issue a direction to Caranua to compel it to act in accordance with the Act and to stop the unlawful policy of delaying or refusing to process and determine applications.  In the context of these widespread abuses, why did the Minister not direct Caranua to act in accordance with the statute at any point in the past three years?</p></speech>

Many applicants to the fund will not have read the Act or the appeals officer's report.  They will not know, therefore, that their application was denied unfairly.  How does the Department ensure that survivors who are illiterate, who have only limited literacy or who are in institutional care receive the service to which they are entitled, given these breaches which have been ongoing for four years?</p> <p>  I am conscious there have been many questions.  I thank the witnesses for their patience and I will finish with this.  We understand a request was made to Caranua and the appeals officer for information to be made available to applicants of agencies that may be able to help them, such as Free Legal Advice Centres, Citizens Information or One in Four.  It appears, however, that Caranua refused to do this, which is shocking.  What is the Department's view of Caranua's refusal to make that information available?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.760" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018111500002#P00600"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  I begin by responding to some of Mr. Costello's points.  I note the Department acknowledges the problems, which is important, and my colleagues have asked a number of specific questions about the problems.  Mr. Costello said there was a commitment to call people back within 24 hours and subsequently to repeat the phone calls.  Does that actually happen?  I was told the freephone operates only on landlines but most people nowadays operate through mobile phones.  Will people be called back on their mobile phones if that is their preferred form of contact?  Most people are not there to take a call on their landline.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Costello clarify what he said about people being notified in writing of their right of appeal?  I think he said this was the practice since a date this year.  Many of the complaints we received were from people who did not know they had a right of appeal.  Will that practice apply to historical cases or is it only for current cases that have been turned down?  People who had previously been turned down should certainly be notified of their right to appeal because many of them may not know about it.</p> <p>  I accept Mr. Costello said the limit of &euro;15,000 was Caranua's decision rather than the Department's, but as people get older and more disabled, they may need an extension to their house that will cost more than &euro;15,000.  There are specific cases around that.  Mr. Costello and Caranua have both stated that, given the reduction in the level of applications, Caranua can concentrate in its strategic plan on improving the quality and impact of its interaction with survivors.  What evidence is there of that?  There are probably people in the system who need more than the &euro;15,000 limit.</p> <p>  On the problems people have in getting what they looking for, such as the white goods that Senator Ruane mentioned, people are being asked for several quotes.  It is not only about the price and description of the work but also the materials to be used.  I do not know how much guidance the Department can give but if one applies for any kind of grant with a local authority, one must get quotes but there is no need for that level of detail.  Is it the case that there are preferred suppliers which are chosen by Caranua?  That does not seem to be the norm under procurement rules.  These are some of the difficulties people have in getting what they need.  </p> <p>  The forms, in general, are difficult.  Senator Gavan raised the issue of limited literacy, which leads some people to have difficulty with the forms.  The independent appeals officer said the applications process is extremely complex.  Is help with these complex forms available?</p></speech>

On issues with governance and management, from reading the board's minutes it appears to focus more on governance than trying to improve the services.  Will Mr. Costello comment on that?  How does the Department ensure the Caranua board achieves the correct balance between governance and the fund's objectives?  On the face of it, based on the minutes and discussions with survivors, the board does not appear to consider greatly the needs of survivors.  Does it work effectively?  How did the Department react to the concerns raised by two survivors who resigned from the board earlier this year over treatment by the other, non-survivor board?</p> <p>  There has been much negative feedback on Caranua's treatment of survivors.  How did the Department react to those reports?  What steps were taken to improve the service delivery?  Caranua published a report on feedback earlier this year which claimed that 90% of the feedback was positive.  Judging by recent D&aacute;il debates and comments in this room, one would have to question that claim.</p> <p>  Will the Department comment on findings of an independent survey carried out in 2017 which showed a different picture?  Some 68% of survivors rated their experience with an adviser as either terrible or bad, some 61% rated their experience as extremely negative, while 21% rated their experience as negative.  Will the Department comment on those results from an independent survey?</p></speech>

Senator Gavan has done much work on this matter on behalf of our party.  It is hard to find the words to describe the history of these people.  They have been badly failed by the State, first in these institutions and then in this process.  It is as though Caranua's attitude is that people do not deserve this money, not least as there is a cap which it sets.  Money is not unlimited but surely the amount should be decided on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>People have varying and different needs and the fact that there is a single cap shows that there has been a very begrudging attitude from the start.</p><p> I want to make a few brief points on appeals.  I have had conversations with people in Caranua who said there was no appeals process.  As such, there are huge questions to be asked about the fact that Caranua is now writing out to people to say there is one.  I have dealt with a great many people who have been told there was no appeals process and had follow-up conversations with people in Caranua in which it was confirmed that there is no appeals system.  I would like to know a bit more about that.  As to its closure, although I do not think Caranua is fit for purpose and it is not doing a good job, what will happen to those who have slipped through the cracks and not applied for funding?  People may have been abroad or otherwise unaware of Caranua.  What will happen to them and who will decide issues of hardship or exceptional circumstances?  People do not seem now to be able to get the very basic things they are looking for.  What makes anyone believe Caranua will grant anything or deem there to be hardship or exceptional circumstances?</p><p> I refer to supports going forward.  I welcome the consultation which is a great idea.  However, one of the supports mentioned was the HSE's national counselling service which is completely overstretched as it is.  People who are literally suicidal cannot access that service.  One is looking here at a very vulnerable group of people and there is no way they will be able to get access to the HSE service.  If Caranua is winding down, I suggest as part of the consultation that a specific counselling service is made available free of charge through some system.  Directing people to a national HSE counselling service which is completely overstretched and which will not be able to meet demand is not recommended.  I see there is a division in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I am sorry about that.  While I accept that there will be a <i>post hoc</i>review on redress schemes in general, I agree with my colleagues here that there should be an independent investigation into the operation and management of Caranua.  That should be commissioned and carried out by the Department.  I would be interested to know if there is scope for such a review and, if so, what the likely timeframe would be.</p><p>The survivors in question have been in very vulnerable situations and they have been let down and failed.  I anticipate certainly that when Caranua is wound up, extra supports will be needed for them.  Can the witnesses indicate what supports will be put in place?  There was &euro;18 million available in the investment account by the end of September 2018.  That is a great deal of money to have in the account while there has been a hold-up in making payments to survivors.  Is that kept there because of the backlog or is there another specific reason?</p><p>The cap of &euro;15,000 seems quite low.  Caranua says the decision came from survivors but there was no consultation with them.  I accept that it was Caranua that set the cap not the Department but the witnesses might give us a sense of why that might be.  I ask the witnesses to excuse the suspension for voting.  As soon as we come back, we will carry on.</p></speech>

There is no question that State failed all of those who were incarcerated in residential institutions.  That has been made abundantly clear in the Ryan report, which does make for harrowing reading.  The Taoiseach did apologise, on behalf of the State, to all survivors of institutions.  That was clearly significant.  There can be no question that the State failed and that has been fully acknowledged.  It was partly on foot of that that the Residential Institutions Redress Board was established and the payments of approximately &euro;1.2 billion of redress payments made to survivors; approximately 15,000 survivors received a payment from that board.  The Caranua funding is in addition to the redress payments that were made.</p> <p>  I mentioned in my opening statement that the fund is finite and statutorily limited.  That is significant because a significant amount of the tensions that arise derive from the fact that the fund is limited.  I will talk about some of the issues that have been raised because a lot of them centre around the &euro;15,000 limit.  If one were to consider the population of survivors, and if this matter had been approached in a different way and a flat payment had been given to every survivor who already got an award from the redress board, that would have involved a payment of approximately &euro;7,000 per survivor.  It was not done that way.  The initial approach was to have an entirely openended fund that was entirely needs based.  There is an inevitable tension between that kind of an approach, a limited fund and a population of survivors who have received their redress payments already but might need further assistance from the fund.  Again, I must stress that these decisions are statutorily independent by Caranua.  That did result in, as one would understand, concerns about proportionality.  That is the reasoning that underpins the &euro;15,000 limit.  The organisation would have been conscious of the fact that there were cohorts of survivors who had not been reached to date, in the context of the balance of the fund remaining and the need to take as equitable an approach as possible.  It is clear that there are different views on that aspect.</p> <p>  I might touch on the issue of legal cases that was raised.  Yes, the Department is aware that there is a legal challenge.  It is complicated and I would possibly confuse things with the detail.  Essentially, the legal challenge relates to the &euro;15,000 limit and the application of the &euro;15,000 limit.  We have to see where the legal challenge goes.    </p></speech>

This matter is addressed in the most recent annual report produced by the organisation.  There is a specific focus on trying to get to survivors who have not benefited from the fund so far.  Many of the organisation's outreach efforts are being directed in that regard.  Before the cessation date, it picked up a number of survivors that it had not reached.   </p> <p>  I shall talk about some aspects of people who are waiting a long time.  That issue is somewhat contextualised by the fact that it is not a one-shot application process.  A number of clients of Caranua have made a number of applications and, therefore, may still have applications in process.  That situation is reflected in the statistics.  The latest statistics to the end of October show that Caranua had received 6,526 applications and of those 5,936 were deemed to be eligible but Caranua also has 2,365 open applications.  There is still quite a volume of applications that are open.  That does not mean that a client has not already received a payment from Caranua because he or she could have a second, third or fourth application submitted.  There are quite a number of applications that still require to be worked through.  That situation raises the question of why would money be held back, which the Chairman asked.  It is because Caranua needs to ensure that it has adequate funds to cater for the applications that it has on hand.  It is also why Caranua instituted a closing date for applications because it did not want to take applications and run up a bill that it would not be able to discharge subsequently.</p> <p>  Some questions were raised about the making of applications in terms of literacy issues and so on.  That is why Caranua operates with application adviser support.  That means that when a person makes an application he or she is assigned an adviser.  It is not simply a paper-based process and there is a person to assist them.</p> <p>  Again, without exceeding the role of the Department and commenting in detail about the operations of Caranua, the operations of Caranua are funded by the fund.  There is always a balance to be struck between the amount one spends on operations and the amount one spends on payments to individuals.</p><p>That is a balance that the organisation and its board have to strike. <br/><br/>In terms of the general area of applications and the process, some questions were raised about the preferred supplier issue, quotations, etc.  On the preferred supplier piece, Caranua did pilot two projects in 2014-2015 with the Cl&uacute;id Housing Association and then with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  The projects were piloted based on feedback given by survivors on the difficulties in sourcing appropriate suppliers to provide quotes.  However, the organisation found that fewer than 100 survivors participated in both of the schemes.  The schemes were an attempt to assist but there was not a great uptake and, therefore, they have not been pursued.<br/><br/>As regards applying quotes, survivors are asked to provide quotes as follows: Where the cost of the work is less than &euro;1,000 only one quote is asked for; where the cost of the work is between &euro;1,000 and &euro;5,000 then two quotes are required; and above that three quotes are required.  A proportionate balance has been struck between the cost of the works and the quotations being sought.  I commented on this matter in my opening statement.<br/><br/>The issues of regulatory impropriety and so on have been raised in terms of Caranua.  The organisation has to have regard for that.  It is understood that this is a vulnerable population of people and a balance must be struck.  Clearly, if there is an entirely <i>laissez-faire</i>approach to that type of issue then it raises the question of that process not being respected, which creates other issues. <br/><br/>On the question of customer satisfaction, a number of specific issues have been raised about specific applications.  We cannot comment on them as Caranua is a statutorily independent body.  Inevitably, as a result we would not have the information.<br/><br/>In terms of respect for the independence of the body, it would be inappropriate for us to query specific applications.  However, Members of the Oireachtas can contact Caranua and there is a dedicated Oireachtas email address.  I know that the body will be very happy to pursue any specific instances that Deputies wish to raise with it and to take those up.<br/><br/>We are aware of the survey that was mentioned.  It was a survey of a relatively small number of applicants out of the 6,500.  Caranua's statistics are somewhat more broadly based but are not comprehensive.  There is a question of customer satisfaction surveying.  Again, there is a question of balancing how much one spends on such work.  A survey costs money versus providing the supports for survivors.  <br/><br/>My colleague, Ms Hynes, will comment on the questions on appeals.  </p></speech>

In May 2017, two appeals officers were appointed.  In May 2018, two appeals officers were offered reappointment.  One person accepted the offer and the other person could not because of personal reasons but at that stage the appeals backlog had been eliminated.  Our statistics at the moment show that there are 45 appeals of which eight have arrived in the past week.  The Department provides administrative support to the appeals officer which is why we can monitor and keep a close eye on the situation.  If the appeals backlog starts to build up again then remediation measures will be taken.</p> <p>  The appeals process is not straightforward.  Let us say a person lodges an appeal.  Caranua has the right to respond on the basis of that appeal.  We know of one particular case where the applicant was written to over a year ago but the appeals process has not been concluded yet on the basis that information is being sought.  We also know that when all of the paperwork has been completed and the appeals officer gets the completed file that his decision, on average, has taken just five weeks to conclude.  Unfortunately, because of the backlog and legacy issues, the statistics skew the length of time people must wait to hear the determination of an appeal.  We are very conscious that the population of the people out there have particular needs and are an aging population.  What no process wants to do is cause further distress.  </p> <p>  Mr. Costello mentioned the issue of applicants being assigned to an application adviser.  That is the way Caranua operates.  When Caranua receives an application and an application adviser is available then the applicant will be assigned to a particular individual who will take over the case. </p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan mentioned phone calls.  We have been assured that whatever phone number the person chooses to use is the one that Caranua will use to communicate with the person.  The volume of phone calls is such that the preferred method of communication is by phone.  Again, returning to the literacy issues that people have mentioned, there is a realisation that for people with literacy issues their preferred method of communication is the phone.</p> <p>  When Caranua was established it was designed in order that it would complement not replace State services.  In terms of an aging population and the mainstream services such as housing assistance and whatever, our job in setting up the interdepartmental committee is to consider how mainstream services can support people as they age and whether existing services, such as the adaptation of bathrooms, for example, are sufficient to enable survivors to continue to live in their own homes for as long as they wish.</p> <p>  The staff of Caranua have continually offered us, as the Department, the opportunity to sit in and listen to how they deal with people.  Indeed, an invitation has been extended to Members of the Oireachtas; if they want to visit Caranua and see how staff deal with survivors, on an individual basis, then they would be more than welcome to do so.  Obviously the arrangements would have to be cleared with survivors beforehand. </p> <p>  Again, because we have no access to and cannot access the personal data that is held on individuals, if there are instances, which Senator Gavan has mentioned, where an individual was treated ignorantly by Caranua staff at their premises then I ask the member to raise the matter directly with Caranua.  I am sure that Caranua would be very anxious to correct any mistreatment of people.  </p></speech>

The so-called RIRU is a unit within my division in the Department that deals with anything concerning institutional abuse or other cases of abuse, for example, in day schools, which arose in the past.  Obviously due to the structure of the Department there are political decisions involved.  There are no plans to close down the residential institutions redress unit, to the contrary.  We have a large work programme, an interdepartmental committee, the post hoc review and continued oversight of Caranua, which are all major issues.  We also have the Retention of Records Bill, for which we were before the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  We hope to bring the legislation forward in the course of next year.  We will actively consider the question of memorialisation, which is of concern.</p><p>As members of the committee will be aware, a memorial was planned a number of years ago for the Garden of Remembrance but it did not get planning permission.  Coming up to the anniversary of the Ryan report, there is still very much a live issue around how we commemorate, memorialise and mark what was a very sad period in Irish history.  They are all activities on which we will be focusing in the coming year.</p><p> On the question around the board of Caranua, investigations are, ultimately, political decisions but we expect that the Minister will shortly fill the two vacancies on the board of Caranua with survivors.</p></speech>

What is the situation and where can people go from here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.776" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ned Costello" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018111500002#V00400"><p>I apologise for not responding.  The appeals process is statutory and provided for in the Act so there are appeals officers.  As I said earlier, there was a period, historically, when people were not sufficiently made aware of their right to appeal and this was reflected in the reports of the appeals officers, to which reference was made.  That was corrected from mid-2016 and people are now informed in writing.  We have provided sample letters to the committee showing the correspondence people receive in the supplementary information we provide.  That piece of bad practice has been corrected.</p> <p>  Senator Ruane asked about the volume of complaints.  We have attempted to make it clear that we are aware of a significant focus on the part of Caranua, since around the middle of 2016, on customer service issues.  There may be other interpretations but we believe there is a correlation between the fact that people are less dissatisfied now than they were in the earlier period of Caranua's operations.  The current acting chief executive, whom we meet regularly as part of our governance supervisory role, is absolutely dedicated to customer service.  I believe improvements are being seen but there is a legacy period when there were teething or establishment troubles while the organisation was getting off the ground and finding its feet while trying to develop processes on a greenfield site.  There continue to be repercussions for people from that period, which we have heard about today.</p></speech>

There is a fairly fundamental difference from the appeals officer.  I would like clarification on that.</p> <p>  Mr. Costello spoke about customer service and the passion of the CEO but it was the CEO who ran the applicant from the building three weeks ago.  I am saying this because there is a huge contradiction here, which is why all of us are asking for an investigation.</p></speech>

It was said that the Department had no details on the survey that showed 90% positive feedback and that we had to contact Caranua for it.</p></speech>

I said that, because of the operational independence of Caranua from the Department and client confidentiality issues, the Department cannot pursue individual cases relating to Caranua's decisions but Members of the Oireachtas can pursue any of the cases directly with Caranua.</p></speech>

Has it not struck the Department as a little bit strange?  The Department has a role in oversight and accountability in matters relating to governance.</p></speech>

Of the feedback it receives, 90% is positive.  It looks for feedback on its website and publishes statistics on that feedback.</p></speech>

It is not a population survey.  There is a frequency, volume and amplitude issue in this, however.  There may be people who are extremely dissatisfied but a large body of people who are generally satisfied.  That may explain an apparent disjunction.</p></speech>

This is because, in addition to the fact that we have the documentation, which I have supplied to the committee, Caranua asked people to come back and let it know of any individual instance where somebody did not receive the information.  It has not had anybody come back on that.  I am not sure if it was Members of the Oireachtas it asked.</p></speech>

While not all members will be happy with some of the responses, there is a great deal of food for thought in what has been said.  This does not end here for any of us.  There is an onus and duty on all members of the committee to think about what has been submitted in writing or stated to us.  As a committee, we will consider how we want to progress this but a likely recommendation will involve the commissioning of an independent investigation.  We have heard that from a number of members.  At a future stage, we will have the opportunity to set out what we would like that independent investigation to cover.  A number of members queried whether the Department was of the view that a review would happen but the committee did not necessarily get a response to the effect that it would.  It will therefore be incumbent on the committee to make a recommendation to the Minister in that regard.</p> <p>  This is a sensitive and delicate matter and we are very conscious that we are representing thousands of people.  By the end of 2017, almost 5,500 people had come forward.  There is no doubt that far more people than that are affected.  The committee wants all survivors to be dealt with in a very understanding, compassionate and practical way having regard to their needs.  Bearing in mind that a great many survivors emigrated to England, there is a particular need to make contact with the population overseas.  We appreciate the attendance of Mr. Costello, Ms Hynes and Mr. &Oacute; hAonghusa.  We will come back to this matter again.  Mr. Costello wishes to make a point of clarification.</p></speech>

I may not have made matters sufficiently clear having regard to what the Chairman has just said.  One of the things we will be doing in our consultation process with survivors is asking them for their views and feedback on both Caranua and the redress schemes generally.  As such, we are going to garner feedback on the feelings of survivors on that issue.</p></speech>

The consultation is absolutely vital and we appreciate that.  We ask that consultation is as full and whole as possible and that it involves all individuals who contacted Caranua, not just a cohort with whom it is easy to engage.  Everyone should be consulted.  That concludes this part of the agenda.  I propose that the committee defers consideration of the private housekeeping matters to next Tuesday.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

I am honoured to address the joint committee and thank it for its invitation.  I am joined Major General Kevin Cotter, deputy Chief of Staff, support, and Brigadier General Peter O&rsquo;Halloran, assistant Chief of Staff.  Major General Kieran Brennan, deputy Chief of Staff, operations, is on duty in south Lebanon and sends his regrets.</p> <p>  I will speak about the magnificent men and women who comprise &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann and the importance of continuing to attract, develop, retain and, above all, value our people.  I will also speak about our transformation programme and its importance in ensuring resilience in a world of ever-increasing complexity.  When I close, I will be happy to take questions.  I will begin by outlining some of the threats Ireland faces in the defence and security domain and how we respond to them. </p> <p>  The Defence Forces are a key component of the State&rsquo;s security architecture and part of the bedrock that underpins our sovereignty.  We operate against a backdrop of a rapidly evolving security and threat environment.  According to the global peace index, Ireland is in the top 5% of safest countries in the world, yet this is the fourth successive year of global peace deterioration.  The new environment presents risks to national and international peace and security and includes threats posed by state and non-state actors; hybrid threats cross-cutting a number of sectors, including cyber and espionage; national and transnational violent extremism, terrorism and organised crime; and environmental factors such as climate change and global population increase.  There is also the uncertainty associated with Brexit.  </p> <p>  A key responsibility of the Defence Forces is remaining fit for purpose in the ever-changing security environment. They play their part in addressing these threats by two main means: by maintaining appropriate military capabilities and providing military advice for the Minister and the Government.  To maintain appropriate military capabilities, our personnel use our unique range of assets on land, sea and air to provide the military capability to defend Ireland and its assigned interests internationally. We do this, for example, by supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in aid to the civil power.  In 2017 alone, we conducted in excess of 3,400 operations on foot of requests from An Garda.  We provide specialist services such as explosive ordnance disposal, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, special operations forces contingent capability and engineer special search teams.  We secure vital installations and provide escorts.  The Naval Service and the Air Corps patrol our maritime jurisdiction which is one of the most hostile in the world.  They also carry out maritime defence and security operations in an area which equates to almost three times the size of Germany, at almost 1 million sq. km, in upholding our sovereign rights, in particular in fisheries but also in countering illegal narcotics, as well as delivering specialist diving services.  To date in 2018, the Air Corps has carried out over 4,500 missions, delivering emergency aeromedical support, as well as many other services such as cross-Border support in fire fighting.  As one might expect,  we train for these evolving threats, remaining operationally ready to deliver robust military capabilities.  Our work in aid to the civil authority also helps to keep the people safe and protects their livelihoods, as we saw across the country during recent severe weather events. </p> <p>  Internationally, this year Ireland celebrates its 60th year of unbroken service with the United Nations in some of the most volatile areas of the world.  It is an unparalleled record and a remarkable achievement for such a small state.  We have completed nearly 70,000 individual tours of duty, with 87 members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann making the ultimate sacrifice.  We have added to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a major contributor to international peace, security and humanitarian efforts and proved Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the principles of the United Nations and the European Union and, in particular, multilateralism.  Apart from delivering on Government policy and contributing to international peace and security and conflict resolution, our overseas service is vital to the maintenance of our operational capabilities in order that we are better able to perform at home in the delivery of defence, security and Government services.  Our peacekeeping record is a key strand of the Government&rsquo;s strategy for securing a seat on the UN Security Council.  Earlier this year I was pleased to attend the launch of Ireland&rsquo;s bid in New York.  As I speak to the committee, we have a battalion operating with UNIFIL in south Lebanon, a quick reaction force operating in western Syria with the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, and a training team operating in Mali with the EU mission.  For the last three years we have had a Naval Service ship operating in the Mediterranean.  In that context, it has been involved in the rescue of 18,000 civilians, including many vulnerable women and children.  </p> <p>  The other way we play our part in addressing current threats is through the provision of military advice, which is sometimes verbal and often written.  In either case, the general staff provide this advice in a professional and considered manner on foot of evidence-based analysis.  I offer considered military advice on behalf of the general staff to inform ministerial and governmental decisions.  Once decisions are made, we provide leadership in implementing them in full, obeying all lawful orders without fear or favour, as is our duty.  </p> <p>  I want to say a few words about our people, of whom I am immensely proud.  The Permanent Defence Force is a unique organisation and different from any other public service body.  Our people have no right to join a trade union.  As such, they have no right to strike and can be called on 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days of the year.  They are subject to military law.  They have an unlimited liability contract which requires them to face hardship and danger for the benefit of others.  For all of these reasons, I need to ensure our personnel are trained and developed to the highest national and international standards; that they are provided with the very best personal and professional supports, equipment and facilities; and that they are valued.  They are highly skilled professionals, whether serving in line or technical appointments.  Their rigorous training, education and development, unparalleled operational experience, diplomatic skills, loyalty, can-do attitude and unflinching devotion to duty are of immense value and unique strengths of the State.  These outstanding qualities have made them highly sought after by employers in both the State and private sectors.  </p> <p>  While the reinvestment of these skills back in civil society strengthens Ireland, a key challenge facing the Defence Forces is the retention of appropriate levels of highly skilled and experienced men and women, both in line and technical appointments.  Similar to other areas of the public service, the process of restoring pay to the levels that obtained before the economic downturn has commenced.</p><p>Although this pay restoration is welcome, we are competing in a buoyant jobs market and current rates of pay present significant challenges for our personnel and, therefore, our organisation.</p><p> The recruitment and retention challenges facing the Defence Forces were recognised in the Public Service Pay Commission's report of May 2017.  Subsequently, the Government tasked the commission with examining these matters in more detail.  In that context, the general staff have worked with departmental officials to prepare a joint submission to the commission.  As the work of the commission is under way, it would be inappropriate to go into the detail of the submission.  However, as Chief of Staff, together with my colleagues on the general staff, I hope to have the opportunity to address the commission in the coming months.  I look forward to the outcome of its work which I hope will provide the basis for addressing these matters in the Defence Forces.</p><p> On a related matter, recently the Minister published the report on the review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  It provides a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the representative and official sides related to remuneration and conditions of service.  I must commend the representative associations, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, as they are essential stakeholders in the process.  I also commend the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association.</p><p> All that said, there is more to retention than pay.  We have been working very hard in advancing a wide range of initiatives to improve non-pay retention factors.  For example, with the Department of Defence, we have been reviewing service contracts.  In the new year we hope to play our part in reviewing the promotion system in co-operation with the representative associations.  For our part, I have been implementing various family-friendly initiatives such as postings closer to home and three-month overseas appointments.  We have also been improving internal communications, placing more emphasis on health and well-being, enhancing opportunities for the personal and professional development of our people, driving our innovation programme, including through the Chief of Staff's innovation awards, and working to embed our values in everything we do through our values champions awards and values in action programme.  Notwithstanding all of these positive developments, we are still facing significant challenges.  That is why we need to attract the best talent, especially when there is a buoyant jobs market in competing sectors, and nurture job satisfaction by acknowledging the quality of our personnel, the demanding nature of their roles and their unique loyalty and commitment to the State.  We must ensure the Government and citizens get the best return on the significant investment the State has made in their training, education and expertise.</p><p> I will touch briefly on the issue of transformation.  In order that we can develop both our capabilities and our people, we will continue to implement our strategic plans and give military advice on the allocation of defence resources.  As stated in the White Paper, Ireland's investment in defence is low by international comparisons.  Against the backdrop of the evolving threat environment, we will continue to make the best use of our allocated resources, for instance, through our capital investment programme.  In the Army the emphasis is on force protection; in the Air Corps it is on new aircraft, and in the Naval Service, it is also on fleet replacement.  One of the main ways in which we are transforming is through implementation of the policy decisions contained in the 2015 White Paper on defence.  For example, we have ongoing projects that focus on the doubling of the Army Ranger wing, high level command and control of the Defence Forces, strategic human resources policies, the proposed institute for peace support and leadership, our built infrastructure, veterans, gender equality and diversity agenda and the Reserve Defence Force.</p><p> On the subject of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, as a former reservist, I am particularly proud of the excellent contribution the force has made to &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann for many years.  In recent times it has proved its worth time and again, providing real added value in terms of manpower during Storm Emma and technical expertise in dealing with matters such as cyberdefence.  Our intention is to do more to make the most of our RDF personnel who have a huge amount to contribute.  To that end, I have recently appointed a director with specific responsibility for the Reserve Defence Force.  We are continuing to work on improving the single force framework to maximise the utility of the Reserve Defence Force, for example, through the proposed specialist reserve.</p><p> Under the leadership of the Minister of State with responsibility for defence and in keeping with my responsibility under the Defence Act and working with the Secretary General, I am absolutely committed to nurturing vibrant Defence Forces, both permanent and reserve, that will continue to meet the constitutional requirements of government and the expectations of citizens.  I again acknowledge that we have been dealing with some significant challenges in recent years.  During that time, there has been one constant - the absolute loyalty, dedication and professionalism of our soldiers, sailors and air crew, of whom we should all rightly be proud.  They are the reason the Permanent Defence Force is one of the most trusted institutions in the public service.  The certainty they have provided since independence has come within a resource envelope that represents excellent value for money for citizens.  They continue to be key guarantors of the defence, security and well-being of the people and the sovereignty of the Republic of Ireland.  As the world evolves, so too must we in order that we remain fit for service in the 21st century.  In order that we can transform, I will continue to advocate for the need to be competitive enough to retain experienced personnel, both line and technical, and attract new entrants in order that we can guarantee defence and security services for the State and every citizen, whether it is on land, in our airspace or hundreds of miles offshore, whether it is on overseas service in conflict zones or at home, in ensuring national security and resilience.  Our men and women stand ready, in the best traditions of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, to "strengthen our nation by inspiring pride and leading excellence".</p><p> I again thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to address the committee.  I am very happy to take questions from its members.</p></speech>

As three committee members have other commitments in the Houses, I will take them together.  I ask members to keep their questions brief in order that we can have an exchange of views with the Chief of Staff and his colleagues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.820" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018111500002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chief of Staff and everybody else present.  It is important that the Chief of Staff come before the committee again in the future as this has not happened before.  It is welcome that he is visible in his role in discussing defence policy and accounting to the Oireachtas.  It is about receiving feedback and playing a constructive role.  Therefore, I acknowledge the Chief of Staff's attendance and opening statement.</p> <p>  The Minister of State was here not too long ago to speak about the lack of recommendations made to the Public Service Pay Commission.  Dr. Mellett has said he will not get into the detail of the submission made.  The Minister of State indicated that the Chief of Staff had signed off on the submission to the commission.  Did he do so?  Was he satisfied that no recommendations had been included when a precedent had been set in making recommendations for the Air Corps only a few months previously?  I have a copy of his submission in which multiple recommendations were made.  Why were they dropped?  Was he satisfied that the recommendations had been dropped and will he provide a justification for it?</p> <p>  Dr. Mellett has indicated publicy that he will try to make a plea to the Public Service Pay Commission on behalf of those working in the Defence Forces.  As he mentioned, there is a massive recruitment and retention crisis.  What is his plan if the commission does not respond with adequate recommendations or a follow-through on the pay and conditions of members?  What will happen in that context?  Is Dr. Mellett completely satisfied with the submission made?  What will happen if the commission fails to address the issues raised in it?  We need clarity on whether it was signed off on.</p><p>Perhaps he could provide a chronological timeline outlining his input to this joint submission detailing when it was submitted, the level of collaboration involved and why all of the recommendations on pay, allowances, superannuation and pensions were dropped even though there was a precedent for them.<br/><br/>I also want to ask about HR policy.  Obviously there is concern about trainee and manning levels within the Defence Forces.  Is Dr. Mellett satisfied with the current departmental set up, with the new assistant secretary general for people?  Would he prefer a rebalancing to occur whereby he has more responsibility for HR policy and recruitment, mirroring what happens with the Garda Commissioner, for example?  In that way, when pay and retention issues arise, Dr. Mellett would have a delegated responsibility for it in a policymaking context, rather than everything being funnelled back to a Department that failed to make recommendations on those matters.  Will Dr. Mellett outline his thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I ask for clarity on the joint submission.  What is the status of the EU working time directive <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Defence Forces and compliance with the European Court of Justice ruling?  Why has there been no movement towards application of the ruling since 2010?  Who is responsible for the policy deficit in that regard?  Is it the Minister, the Department or the Defence Forces?  I ask Dr. Mellett to outline the timeline for the implementation of the aforementioned directive in the context of numbers and capacity.  Obviously it is not possible to flick a switch overnight.  Dr. Mellett mentioned that the Defence Forces have introduced various family-friendly initiatives such as postings closer to home and so forth.  Since the structural changes that were made to the Defence Forces a number of years ago, a lot of people are travelling from Donegal, Dundalk, Athlone and elsewhere to Dublin which is anything but family-friendly.  That reinforces issues around the working time directive.  Feedback from members of the Defence Forces and their representative organisations indicates that these long commutes are a source of enormous strain and are anything but family-friendly.<br/><br/>Dr. Mellett referred to ensuring that personnel are valued, provided with the very best personal and professional supports and are trained and developed to the highest national and international standards.  That is Dr. Mellett's aspiration for the Defence Forces as well as the aspiration of his management team.  However, there is a serious problem with morale, of which Dr. Mellett is obviously very aware.  There are also issues with recruiting trained physicians and medical staff.  Individuals have to retire because they cannot get necessary medical treatment.  There is obviously a big gap there.  In that context, will Dr. Mellett set out his plans to ensure that his words mean something?  What will happen at departmental level in terms of his engagement on these issues?  In Dr. Mellett's view, what are the key recommendations to address the recruitment and retention crisis?  Does he believe that the crisis is solely down to pay and to economic and market conditions or does it run deeper than that?  The University of Limerick report mentioned a review of the organisational and management structures of the Defence Forces.  Is that required in the context of the deep issue of recruitment and retention?<br/><br/>In terms of defence spending, the Defence Forces support division submitted an analysis note on the recent budget which said that defence spending in real terms is stagnant or reducing.  As Chief of Staff, how does Dr. Mellett feel about the fact that his is one of the few areas of public expenditure that is actually returning money to the State even though he is facing a recruitment and retention crisis?  What is his view on the fact that the Department is beefing itself up in terms of appointing a new assistant secretary general and increasing staffing levels generally while he is overseeing a recruitment and retention crisis and low morale?  Would he like to see defence spending increasing in real terms rather than remaining stagnant or even reducing?  Will he provide feedback on the aforementioned budgetary analysis?  Concerns were expressed by the support division that every other Department is seeing increased expenditure except for the Department of Defence.  The Department seems to be incentivised internally, at a Civil Service level, to return savings to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform despite the manpower and retention crisis in the Defence Forces.  Would Dr. Mellett like to see a change there?  This relates to my earlier question about HR policy and how Dr. Mellett sees his role and that of senior management going forward.  Is there a need for a rebalancing in terms of his input on spending policy?<br/><br/>I look forward to hearing Dr. Mellett's views and thank him for appearing before the committee today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.822" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1402" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018111500002#E00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for facilitating those of us who have other commitments this morning.  I thank the Chief of Staff for appearing before the committee today and commend the great work of the Defence Forces in peacekeeping and in contributing to international peace and security through various missions, as outlined by Dr. Mellett.  As a neutral country, Ireland has an important role to play on the world stage.  Indeed, that neutrality is an important facet of our bid for a seat on the UN Security Council.  I know that Dr. Mellett has been involved in that work.  I particularly want to pay tribute to all of the Defence Forces and Naval Service personnel involved in the rescue at sea programme in the Mediterranean.  Dr. Mellett outlined how many vulnerable civilians have been saved because of the work of the Irish Naval Service, among others.  It is very valuable for us to hear about the diverse range of functions and roles carried out by the Defence Force personnel, and I thank Dr. Mellett for that information.</p> <p>  I want to focus on recruitment and retention, with a particular focus on increasing diversity within the Defence Forces.  Dr. Mellett spoke about the gender equality and diversity agenda within the Defence Forces.  I welcome the fact that &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann has been a public sector leader in the practical application of policies in this area.  What is the current gender balance within the Defence Forces?  Dr. Mellett said that there is still some way to go, but how can the Defence Forces improve the gender balance?  What sort of positive action measures are being adopted within the Defence Forces to encourage the recruitment of more women and to ensure the retention of those women who are already members of the Defence Forces?  Dr. Mellett said that he has instituted family-friendly initiatives, which I welcome.  However, the issue of long commutes for those serving in Ireland is of concern in that regard.  Overseas postings must be a major issue for personnel with small children or with caring responsibilities, and while the reduction from six months to three months for such postings is welcome, that is still a very long time to be away from family.  Does the capacity exist to shorten the length of overseas postings further?  Is there any way that could be supported?  Many private sector organisations in Britain have, against the backdrop of equal pay legislation, been adopting very interesting and creative recruitment initiatives to encourage more women to become pilots, for example.  They have been working with the girl guides and within schools, and similar initiatives on the part of the Defence Forces would be very welcome.  Inclusivity is not just a matter of gender, of course.  Dr. Mellett pointed out that the Defence Forces LGBT network has been established.  I believe the Defence Forces took part in the most recent Pride parade in Dublin, which is a very welcome development.  What other policies are being adopted to encourage greater diversity?</p> <p>  I have question on the treatment of veterans, an issue that we do not often talk about in an Irish context.  It is much more of an issue in countries with greater military spending.  As a neutral country, it is appropriate that we do not have the level of emphasis on the military that is evident in other jurisdictions.  That said, I would like to hear more from Dr. Mellett on how the Defence Forces are focusing on keeping veterans involved.  It strikes me that veterans or former alumni of any organisation are very good and valuable recruiters for future generations.  In terms of increasing diversity, senior women who have left the Defence Forces could play an important role in encouraging more women to join up.</p><p>I just have those specific questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.824" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1375" speakername="Gabrielle McFadden" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018111500002#F00200"><p>I thank my colleagues for allowing me to contribute now because, like Senator Bacik, I have to go to a Commencement matter debate in the Seanad.  I apologise for leaving but I will come back later if the committee is still meeting.  I welcome Dr. Mellett, Mr. Cotter and Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran.  This committee does not have oversight, as such, of the Defence Forces and the witnesses are under no obligation to come in.  With that in mind, I am grateful that they have done so.</p> <p>  We are all aware of the issues of pay and working conditions and that it is not necessarily within the remit of the witnesses to fix it.  I know from them personally that they would like to.  We have no choice but to wait for the pay commission.  My priority will always be proper pay for the ordinary personnel who get up early in the morning and go out to work for this State with great pride.  I also feel that the measures put in place for retention will not, on their own, necessarily keep the numbers at 9,500.  We have to have those retention measures and pay.  I refer to duty pay, Rangers' pay and even down to rations and accommodation for recruits.</p> <p>  I have some questions in regard to the opening statement.  I would love some more information on the development of the family-friendly measures that have been put in place.  As Senator Bacik referred to, how do they include women?  Can we get more women to join the Defence Forces and retain them?  I would also love to know the exact number of members of the Defence Forces.  In the White Paper, the figure mentioned is 9,500 but I do not know if the number is anywhere near that.  I would like the witnesses to tell me that, if they can.</p> <p>  Are there sufficient resources for recruitment to the Defence Forces?  If not, have more resources been requested and what was the reply?  I know the witnesses cannot speak about the pay commission because it would not be appropriate.  Similar to what Deputy Lisa Chambers said, I would like to know where we go if the pay commission does not come up with sufficient pay and conditions for Defence Forces' personnel?  The restructuring of the Defence Forces and the loss of brigade status in my area was very contentious.  What is the opinion of the witnesses as to how that new structure is working?</p></speech>

I ask Dr. Mellett, as Chief of Staff, to take the questions.  If he wants to bring in his colleagues, either the Deputy Chief of Staff or the Assistant Chief of Staff, to assist with any particular issues, he should feel free to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.826" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Mellett" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018111500002#F00400"><p>I thank the Senators and Deputies for their questions.  I will start on the issue of gender diversity and inclusion.  I really would like to see more women in the Defence Forces.  That is not just because of our commitment under United Nations Security Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, not just to be politically correct and not just because we need access to the half of society that is female.  It is a capability issue and I will come back to that point in a moment.  In the context of Resolution 1325, the real tragedy in many of the areas we operate in is that sexual exploitation, abuse and gender-based violence are the main, if not the supporting, effort in many of the conflicts.  The capacity for a military force to have that institutionalised gender perspective is an essential in driving capability.</p> <p>  It is not an issue just in regard to getting a balance in the Defence Forces.  We would be better if we had more women.  I tried during my time to increase the number of women in the Defence Forces.  We have moved from 6% to 7%.  That might seem like a small amount of progress and I wish it was much more.  I would like to get it up to between 12% and 20% of the Defence Forces.  There is a tipping point where it becomes sustainable.  The issue is, however, much larger than the Defence Forces.  It is linked to a societal issue.  I believe that young girls and boys are stereotyped at a very young age into predominantly caring kinds of roles for girls.  Girls are not channelled towards science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM.  I have actually used the phrase "STEM2", that is science, technology, engineering, mathematics and military.</p> <p>  I would love if we could have a leadership that spoke about the opportunities in the Defence Forces for women.  I have dealt with female commanders overseas.  In fact, the current gender adviser to the office of the NATO Secretary General&rsquo;s special representative for women, peace and security is a woman from the Defence Forces, Lieutenant Colonel Mary Carroll.  I last met her in Syria on the Golan Heights where she was the unit commander.  That is the type of competence we have among women in the Defence Forces.  Lieutenant Colonel Carroll led that unit, predominantly male, of 130 men and women which is the fast reaction unit in that volatile area.  I have seen throughout the Defence Forces, in our engineers and in many other areas, where technical competence is coming from the addition of women to the Defence Forces.  It brings additionality in decision-making.</p> <p>  It is a capability issue and it is also an issue of diversity.  I tend to separate gender from diversity inclusion simply because I see it as such a big issue in itself.  Moving into the matter of diversity, from my perspective, diversity is a hedge for complexity.  As we drive more and more into complexity, and the world is becoming more complex, we need to have diverse inputs into our decision-making.  We need to move away from male groupthink to diverse perspectives in regard to decision-making.  I and my staff are committed to increasing the number of women but I cannot do it on my own.  I need support from decision-makers in the State, in schools and most of all the support of gatekeepers, the mammies and daddies, to say that a career in the Defence Forces is good for a woman.</p> <p>  On diversity and inclusion, similarly and on the same theme, within the Defence Forces, I and the General Staff have taken a lead on that.  We need to be inclusive across the various perspectives such as gender, culture, creed and even age.  I speak a different language from a millennial and he or she does not understand the language of a wrinkly old admiral.  The ability to break down those barriers within an organisation is critical.  I do not want stovepipes of little societies or social systems within the Defence Forces.  I refer to trying to have an inclusive workplace where everybody can come to work with their whole person as opposed to the opposite.  We have our inclusion and diversity strategy.  We were one of the first organisations in the public sector to do that and it is working well.  We are not giving up on that point and we have much more to do in that regard.</p> <p>  Turning back to some of the opening questions, on the issue of the Public Service Pay Commission and the submission to the commission, I have a responsibility to give advice and a perspective under section 13(3) of the Defence Act.  I give my advice without fear or favour.  The deliberations in regard to coming to a point of truth on the submission to the pay commission were robust, and that is to be expected.  I have my own perspective, just as the Department of Defence has its perspective.  I will say that we came to a point of truth and a submission was made in early September to the pay commission.  I stand full square behind that submission.</p> <p>  The submission has gone to the pay commission and it is considering it.  In due course, the pay commission will make a decision on recommendations to Government.  When the Government makes its decision on foot of those recommendations, then we are in a new point in time.  If necessary, I will give further advice, depending on the outcome.  I do not see it just stopping with the decision of Government.  I see my job, in terms of leadership, to implement that decision, but it may require that I continue to give further advice to Government in the context of what I have to deal with in the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that I see the challenge of pay as a key issue.  I am not, however, just looking at pay.  There are other areas where I also have responsibility and I am absolutely committed to those.  We spoke about work-life balance and the requirement of the organisation itself to be family-friendly.  I have tried to do that with the introduction of hot desks and in spouse and partner balancing in how we govern overseas service.  On the issue of three months versus six months, I would love if we could reduce it below three months but there is a practical point.  I refer to continuity and experience in service whereby it becomes disruptive, certainly in the international domain, when an individual would come into an appointment for a shorter period than three months.  There is a requirement for acclimatisation, the development of relationships with work colleagues and the delivery of service.</p> <p>  I am trying to be constructive in respect of the requirement to meet the needs of the individual.  At the same time, we have to ensure that the outputs are fit for purpose.  I feel that three months is probably the optimal in the context of family-friendly overseas appointments.</p><p>Also with regard to family-friendly appointments, I am trying, where possible, to ensure postings are closer to the family home so we can reduce commuting distances.  That is not always possible but, on balance, we endeavour to achieve that.  With regard to disturbance, if somebody is posted to an area away from the home there are supports available and the family can be moved, if necessary.  That is an option an individual can take.</p><p> On dealing with personnel and the climate survey, we have moved to increase the age of our privates and senior NCOs at sergeant level and our corporals in order that they can serve overseas until they are 55.  That has been introduced.  It increases the pool.  Previously, these NCOs used to be able to serve until 50.  We are also moving on areas such as promotion, which is critical.  In the past year, we have had about 749 promotions.  The system is not as efficient as I would like.  It causes long delays in terms of the placement of individuals in gaps.  That is a problem for two reasons.  First, it means an individual in the organisation is not getting paid at a rate he or she should be.  Second, there is a gap in the organisation where an individual should be able to function at senior NCO level.  That is why, in 2019, I hope for an expeditious outcome on the promotion competition, through engaging with the Department and representative bodies.</p><p> With regard to retention, it is a question of trying to return to some of the principles that underpinned the Defence Forces in the past.  One involves re-institutionalising the importance of sport and team activity.  We have become really focused on outputs but have forgotten some of the institutions that really support them.  One is the tradition of sport in terms of team effort and building a community within the Defence Forces rather than obsessing over outputs.  In the long run, I am convinced that returning to greater cohesion on the sport side will enhance our resilience in terms of the outputs.</p><p> This feeds into another major concern I have.  It is a general concern and not just about the Defence Forces.  It pertains to well-being.  The greatest challenge facing complex organisations is that of stress.  We feel it individually and as communities, and we feel it in organisations such as ours.  Therefore, trying to find a means whereby we can institutionalise well-being within the Defence Forces is good for a variety of reasons.  First, it means a soldier has greater resilience in facing some of his or her challenges, making him or her less likely to be stressed in dealing with them.  Second, it gives me a more resilient organisation to meet the expectations of the Government and the citizen.</p><p> As for development, a question was asked by Deputy Jack Chambers on education.  It is one of the key points on which I am focused.  Currently in the Defence Forces there is a system whereby every junior NCO can go to level 6 and every senior NCO can go to degree level.  We have degree-level programmes for officers and programmes up to master's level.  I am even committed to trying to institutionalise, where possible, work-based learning leading to professional PhDs in order that people can learn in the workplace.  This is a remarkable achievement.  Last week, I attended an event in the Institute of Technology, Carlow at which 209 members of the Defence Forces were given awards, from master's level downwards.  It was great to see.  Some of the young men and women did not have a leaving certificate when they joined the Defence Forces.  We brought them from the point of having none to having one.  With brought them to a point where they received accreditation and work-based learning, working with the Institute of Technology, Carlow.  Some of them have graduated with a master's degree.</p><p> On the issue of the soldier, sailor and aircrew of the future, it is not just about being a warrior in terms of professional skills; it is also about being a scholar in order that one can have perspective on a broader world, such that one can actually think as well as deliver.  The third aspect concerns diplomacy.  It is a matter of trying to nurture the skills in the context of one's ability to work with others.  Increasingly, the challenges we face have answers that lie outside our organisational boundaries.  It is a matter of trying to create an organisation that has the ability to recognise it is part of a broader community in terms of solving problems.  That means being able to network externally.  Although I spoke about internal diversity earlier, I regard the Defence Forces as part of a system of external diversity in terms of dealing with the higher educational institutes and bodies and other aspects of civil society.</p><p> With regard to the University of Limerick recommendations, I have an action plan called the climate survey action plan.  It contains approximately 54 items.  I have made progress on 20 of those, for which I am responsible, in the Defence Forces.  Twelve have been closed.  I am still working on a number of others.  There are areas with regard to contracts on which I am working with the Department.  I am absolutely committed to moving on that.</p><p> The issue of pay has arisen in terms of the climate survey, focus groups and employee engagement surveys.  It arises in town hall meetings when I meet the men and women of the Defence Forces.  Sometimes when one is faced with a young soldier who has a dependant or partner and he says to me on a Sunday it is costing him to deliver a 24-hour service, it is a challenge, especially when he reaches a point where he nearly breaks down in front of his peers.  Therefore, there is concern over pay.  I am not obsessed on the pay side but I am saying there is an issue I have to address.  That is why I made an appeal to address the Public Service Pay Commission.  I hope to do that.  I am delighted the Minister of State was able to prioritise the Defence Forces in respect of the work of the commission.  With regard to the outcome in terms of the recommendation to the Government, a point will ultimately be reached at which the latter will make a decision.  As Clausewitz said, there can be no way other than subordinating the military to the political.  I said in my opening statement that I will give the leadership to implement the decision of the Government but if there is a need for me to give further advice, I will do so at that time.</p></speech>

The Chief of Staff's support division delivered an analysis of the recent budget in which it outlined the defence spending in real time is stagnant or reducing, and that it represents the only area of the public service that is making a contribution back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Considering the retention and recruitment crisis and serious issues over personnel, manpower and capacity, naval ships being docked, having to outsource part of the Air Corps and an element of contagion regarding some of the core capabilities, how does the Chief of Staff feel about giving back money to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  This is based on analysis from the Chief of Staff's own division.  What is his view on the recent budget?  Does he accept his own support division's analysis that defence expenditure is stagnant or reducing?  Would he like to see a change of course in that regard?</p> <p>  On the question on HR policy, would the Chief of Staff prefer to have a greater role regarding the governance construct?  People looking from the outside note the beefing up of the input of the Civil Service, including the Department.  The Chief of Staff has made a public plea over pay.  He is saying he has given military advice and will give further military advice if the commission does not deliver.  If he was fully satisfied with the joint submission that was made, could he not have said he stood fully behind it?  Why does he have to engage with the pay commission if the submission made by the Department was adequate?  Could he not have referred to that?</p> <p>  The Minister of State said on record at a meeting of this committee that no recommendations were made but that the submission the Chief of Staff gave to the Department had multiple recommendations.  Was he satisfied that no recommendations were made and that the Department submitted purely data-based analysis?  Those are my two or three questions.  I asked another question on the working time directive.</p></speech>

I am not the Accounting Officer.  There was a White Paper process in 2015 in which this was dealt with in detail.  It set out the governance arrangements within the defence organisation.  In fairness to the Secretary General, I would not like to be reflecting on his part of the ship.  What I can say is that I have never met a Chief of Staff who could not make a case for more resources.  From having mixed with my colleagues in Europe, I am aware they will always be able to make a case for more resources.  However, my priority is to ensure the resources allocated are used in a manner that achieves value for money and maximises the capability we develop with them.</p><p>In recent years, I am satisfied that, at the end of the year, the resources that have been allocated have been exploited to the fullest.  I will continue to support and ensure we have projects related to our capabilities, which are identified in the White Paper, that are prioritised in terms of a timeline and can be delivered within the accounting year with a view to expenditure of the funds.</p><p> Governance within the Department of Defence is a matter for Government and how the Minister allocates between the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  I am quite happy, if required, to make recommendations to the Minister of State and I do that.  It is my responsibility to give the Minister advice on aspects that I feel the Defence Forces can be more streamlined in their capacity to work within the defence organisation.  I have done that verbally and I will continue to do it in the future.</p><p> On the submission to the public sector, my point is that I am standing behind a submission that is made.  It provides the basis for an engagement with the Public Service Pay Commission.  I now have a responsibility to seek further opportunities in terms of advocacy to give the narrative from my perspective.  </p><p> The Defence Forces are unique institutions, they are not like other parts of the public sector.  Our members are subject to military law.  They will not, and cannot, join a union.  They will not strike.  They will be subject to unlimited liability and that is the very reason I remember, during Storm Emma recently, that when the instruction from Government was that all personnel were to be off the streets by 4 p.m. on that particular day, the people who were out operating and supporting other primary response agencies were the Defence Forces.  They were bringing patients for dialysis, they were working with the ESB and towing ESB vehicles to transformers to keep power going.  The ability of the Defence Forces, across the spread, was remarkable.  The ability to do this is often honed in very challenging environments overseas.  This is the proof of the capabilities that we develop working with others internationally being brought to bear domestically when there is a time of crisis relating to, in that case, a climate event.</p></speech>

I see three strands to that.  First, it is being true to the legislative requirements.  The legislation has not been transposed into Irish legislation yet, but the Department is working on bringing to a point of truth the necessary derogations for the Defence Forces so that we can continue to deliver our outputs while being true to the spirit of the legislation and, at the same time, being fair to the individual members of the Defence Forces and ensuring the organisation can continue to function and meet the requirements of Government and citizens.</p> <p>  We are not an ordinary organisation so there are going to be aspects whereby a derogation there will be required.  That is a policy matter that the Department of Defence is addressing.  We have one working group in terms of identifying what the implications are and, I can assure the committee, we will be fair to the individuals within the Defence Forces.  I want to expedite the institutionalising of the working time directive as soon as possible.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; ceart go bhfuil guth na bhF&oacute;rsa&iacute; Cosanta le cloiste&aacute;il anseo seachas go dt&iacute; seo gur tr&iacute; prism n&oacute; filter an Aire n&oacute; na Roinne a tharla s&eacute; sin roimhe seo.</p> <p>  The Defence Forces are facing major challenges, and I have raised some here and I have been very critical on some issues and hopefully it is never taken as a personal issue because, like everybody else here, I have the health and safety of officers and the best interests of the men and women of the Defence Forces in mind.  </p> <p>  In general, a number of issues seem to have happened in the recent past which suggest that morale is down, people are being overstretched and mistakes are happening.  Is it just because of the failure to reach the complement of 9,500?  Is it pay and conditions, that members feel that they are not appreciated in terms of pay?  For instance, one of the big criticisms of the paper in September was to do with Defence Forces members in the Phoenix Park being on duty for 24 or 48 hours, and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the same, but a total difference between them.  </p> <p>  The Chief of Staff is right to say it is not an ordinary organisation and when people sign up they have some understanding of what they are signing up for, but, in doing so, an organisation and its members have to be appreciated and compensated somewhat.  Does he believe that the other parts of the public service, and the public in general, understand fully the differences and how much the members of the Defence Forces rely on allowances to fill the gap in terms of pay and conditions?  </p> <p>  We recently had a respect and loyalty march in the city.  It was not a strike because members of the Defence Forces were not on strike, but it was those who were supportive and sympathetic and who felt that their concerns, which I have raised through their representative organisations internally, and through parliamentary questions and so on, were not being listened to.  There is a whole list of issues that I know the Defence Forces probably have.  Most of them were to do with pay and conditions.  I understand the pay issue, as the Chief of Staff said at the outset, is being dealt with.  Others can be dealt with, and the working time directive was mentioned, and hopefully the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, conference at the end of the month will look at that.  They are bringing in some experts that will add to the Defence Forces' understanding or planning in that relationship.</p> <p>  There are other issues, for instance, moving the upper service limit of 21 years and the age at which somebody can join the Defence Forces.  For instance, there are people of an age who have the fitness and wherewithal to join the Defence Forces and who can join other defence forces.  A woman I dealt with, who was a top athlete, could not join the Irish Defence Forces because she was three or six months too old - I cannot remember exactly - but she could have joined the British defence forces.  That is something small that can be tweaked.  Society has changed.  We are living longer, we are fitter and more capable in later years of doing work that would not have been expected of us in the past in military circles.  The upper age limit and retirement age limit are issues.  Is that reflected in the conversations the Chief of Staff would have, for instance, with his members?</p> <p>  I have been very critical about health and safety, and I know major changes have been made in the past number of years.  Dr. Mellett has probably been plagued with quite a number of questions about the chemical exposure over the years of men and women - men in particular, but men and women - in the Air Corps.  A lot has been done and praise should be given for the movement that has eventually been made towards a proper regime.  What can be done for those who have major health problems which they relate to their times in the Defence Forces?  It is not just to do with Baldonnel Aerodrome.  I have also raised it in terms of those who suspect that their major health complications are related to the likes of Lariam in particular.</p><p>Have the Defence Forces looked at how other countries' defence forces have dealt with very similar problems?  Have the Defence Forces been liaising with the Department of Health on whether members can be given additional supports after they leave the Defence Forces to help them identify what is wrong with them and to address the identified problems?  I will leave it at that and come back if need be. </p></speech>

This is the first time they have appeared before us and perhaps it will be the first of many appearances.</p> <p>  We have all read newspaper reports in recent months and years indicating that morale in the Defence Forces is low.  We do not like reading those reports.  The Defence Forces are people we look to during a time of crisis, particularly during flooding.  We could go into all the cases we have experienced personally.  As the Chief of Staff said, when everybody was off the streets during the recent storm the military personnel were out.  I am delighted that in his opening statement he said how proud he was of his men and their commitment to the State.  All of us are proud of the military and we know the commitment its members have to securing the State.</p> <p>  I know the Chief of Staff does not like talking about pay and conditions all the time.  We do not like reading about it in the papers.  Nobody wanted to march with military personnel, especially retired personnel who marched in support of their serving colleagues.  I acknowledge that the Chief of Staff will go before the Public Service Pay Commission to address that issue.  It is the first time somebody has given a serious commitment to try to address it.  I hope he gets the full support of the Department on this matter.  He will certainly have the full support of the Oireachtas. </p> <p>  In regard to pay and conditions, what comparison with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the Defence Forces carried out?  Some people mentioned the Pope's recent visit.  I will not rehash the point, but we read reports on what the military personnel earned that day.  One Garda member told me the overtime he made that weekend paid for his skiing holiday.  I know damn well that what the military walked away with would not pay for a meal, never mind a skiing holiday.  Has the Chief of Staff made comparisons between what are practically the same ranks?  Has the pay of a Defence Forces recruit been compared with the pay of a new recruit to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as they move up the ladder and pay scale?  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned other militaries.  Have the Defence Forces engaged with the British, French or other armies around Europe on how they pay their staff?  If such a comparison has been made, the Chief of Staff might outline it for us.  It is an issue that has to be addressed. </p> <p>  On recruitment and retention, what can be done to keep personnel in the Defence Forces?  The strongest impression I get when meeting young military personnel is that they are leaving to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I met a young lad last week who was disappointed that he had not passed the first exam for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but he planned to try again.  That is a big issue.  It will be difficult to recruit people into the military in years to come.  We have to put in place a proper system to attract and retain people in the military.  I would like to know whether the Defence Forces have looked at what other armies around Europe have done to retain their officers.  I understand the Air Corps can no longer fly at night because it does not have sufficient personnel.  Organ donor transport used to be provided by the military.  I remember ringing Baldonnel Aerodrome in 2003 or 2004 when a young person was in a serious accident in Spain and had no insurance.  The military was able to send the Government jet out to bring that person home.  That was a tremendous service.  Air Corps pilots are required to fly a certain number of hours.  Does the Defence Forces have the manpower to provide this service now?  </p> <p>  I understand that the 2015 adjudication on post-1994 personnel is scheduled to expire at the end of 2020.  This will see the compulsory discharge of significant numbers of personnel from the Defence Forces.  What impact is the current delay in notifying personnel of their future employment within the Defence Forces having?  Will allowing personnel to serve up to the age of 50 have an adverse impact on the Defence Forces?</p> <p>  PDFORRA participated in an adjudication hearing in 2015 in which the adjudicator recommended allowing personnel of tech 1 grade and above and corporals to remain in service for five years.  This recommendation is scheduled to run out at the end of 2020.  Significant numbers of enlisted personnel are to be discharged at the beginning of 2021.  What impact will that have on the Defence Forces?</p> <p>  The Chief of Staff might not be able to comment on this, but I read in the papers recently that there has been a major breakdown in trust between the Department and the Defence Forces.  I remember a former brigadier wrote an article in-----</p></speech>

My services were never called upon, thankfully.  The one admission I will make to the Chief of Staff is that the boots were used for a lot of farming down in Kerry.  If there are any recriminations, I am willing to face disciplinary hearings, of which I had a number recently.</p> <p>  I pay tribute to the Defence Forces.  I am a member of Oireachtas all-party consultation group on commemorations for the decade of centenaries.  The Defence Forces played a major role in preparation for that.  I also want to highlight the role of the Defence Forces in visiting schools to present the flag to a generation that now understands its true meaning of peace between communities.  This is a very important part of the decade of centenaries.</p> <p>  To address the business end of the Army, while I know the Chief of Staff may not wish to comment on political decisions, I will raise the proposals made by Germany and Europe since we joined the permanent structured co-operation, PESCO.  The Germans and French have been looking for an EU army forever and a day.  The issue of neutrality is one that concerns many citizens.  The Defence Forces, like all Departments and all branches of the Government and State, put forward proposals regarding the consequences of Brexit.  The position regarding the Border changes by the hour depending on what news bulletin one watches.  Last night, there was great hope.  With this morning's resignation from the British Cabinet, it looks like the proposed deal may not stick.  The Defence Forces put forward proposals on the preparedness for and possible outcomes of Brexit, its long-term consequences and the possibility of the return of a hard border.  The lesson of Brexit is that those in power should not hold a referendum and then tell everybody what the future will be like.  That is the worst of bad planning.  Britain is now suffering the consequences of not having a truthful engagement about the real outcomes of Brexit.</p><p>I suggest, as I have done on many previous occasions, that a Border poll here is the last thing we should do as one of the possible outcomes of Brexit.  Theresa May has said it.  Lady Sylvia Hermon, who is the unionist MP for North Down, has said she believes there will be a referendum in her lifetime.  I have met some former members of the Defence Forces who have said they believe there will be a united Ireland in their lifetimes.  My concern is that a hard border and a hard Brexit will accelerate that.  As I have said, a referendum or Border poll is the last thing we need.

I am sure a plan is being put in place for this scenario.  I apologise for not being here when my colleagues asked questions about bread and butter issues like terms and conditions.  Some of the concerns about the establishment of an EU army and the benefits of being in EU operations relate to the preparedness of the Defence Forces and the implications for our service at UN level.  The long-term issue is the belief that there will be a referendum.  Those are not my words but those of people in the unionist community.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on the possible outcomes of that.</p></speech>

He asked whether we are understood or appreciated by society.  I want to commend the committee on visiting our installations.  I understand some members are due to go overseas in the near future.  That kind of engagement is good for the Defence Forces because it means there is political understanding of the Defence Forces.  The experiences of politicians who come to see what the Defence Forces are doing allow society to have a window into our operations.  That is the best way to expose the Defence Forces as a constituency.  There was a time in the past when I used to compare the Defence Forces to a walled garden.  We were quite happy to live behind a wall and do great stuff there like a self-licking ice cream.  Things have changed now.  We are completely open and transparent.  We are trying to be much more engaged with other institutions, including various parts of the State, areas of government, the higher education institutions and parts of civil society.  We are broadening our ability to recognise the point that none of us has all the answers.  Neither the Defence Forces nor any other institution of the State has all the answers.  We need to collaborate with others at national level and, in a broader sense, work with others as part of a greater multilateralism.</p> <p>  I will respond to the Deputy's specific point about whether the Defence Forces should expand to take in more personnel.  He asked questions in this context about terms and conditions, length of service and the upper age limit.  I am completely open at all times to examining every opportunity to maximise the number of recruits who come into the organisation and to be agile and flexible in retaining those who are already in service.  I would love to expedite the issue of the terms and conditions of those who are currently in service so that they can get clarity on their contracts.  This exact point is being examined as part of a project under the White Paper on Defence.  I wish we could move on it more quickly.  I am putting on the pressure to ensure this happens.  Like the Deputy, I meet soldiers, sailors and air crew who are looking for clarity.  If an outcome is not reached soon, decisions that are not entirely in the interests of the Defence Forces could be made.  This would be a pity.</p> <p>  The other point I would like to make in this context is that Defence Forces personnel bring huge talent with them wherever they go.  It has been mentioned that members of the Defence Forces are leaving to join other institutions in parts of the public service, including the Garda.  The strength, wealth and level of development they bring with them in such circumstances is being retained within the State.  When we analyse these matters, we see that many Defence Forces personnel leave to go to other parts of the public sector.  This is a reflection of their attractiveness and of the reality that they are being rewarded for going into those positions.</p> <p>  It is important for me to deal with the issue of health and safety.  In our business, it is critical to have safe operations.  It goes to the heart of an organisation like the Defence Forces, which has to put people into harm's way.  We have people who go into harm's way almost every day.  I have led on the issue of transparency.  When things happen within the organisation, there is a no-blame culture where possible.  Now and then, people have violations and have to be called to order.  The point is to learn lessons from the mistakes that happen.  If there is transparency, the lessons that are learned will be communicated as quickly as possible to other parts of the Defence Forces where there is a need for knowledge with regard to changes in governance systems.</p> <p>  We have a serious accident investigation team that stands ready at all times.  It has been deployed three times so far this year.  It delivers a report to me as soon as possible to set out the wavetops in the context of the incident in question and to spell out what we need to put in place right away to mitigate the incident and to ensure it is not replicated.  More broadly, we have a general routine order - I think it is No. 5 of 15 - that sets out the safety management system within the Defence Forces.  This is necessary under national legislation.  We are not rogue in the sense that we are not operating outside of our requirements under the law.  We are institutionalising that law into the procedures of the Defence Forces itself.  We have a risk management system and a risk assessment system.  We have a system for the reporting of accidents.  I suppose we have a truth culture which means that our focus is on trying to learn from every incident that happens.  There can be no other way.</p> <p>  I remember being laughed at when I was a young sailor because I identified a problem on my ship.  I immediately sent a signal to all of the other ships.  My command at that time said I was foolish to expose our dirty linen in public.  I still hold the principle I held that day.  I am glad to see that it has been institutionalised within the Defence Forces.  A mistake is acknowledged with a view to ensuring we can mitigate the effects of the immediate state while minimising the risk of it happening again.  Our safety statements are reviewed continually.  The Defence Forces also have health and safety plans.  All of this does not sit in isolation from other parts of governance.</p> <p>  The issue of well-being arises in this context.  I am committed to ensuring there are institutions within the Defence Forces that are promoting well-being in a general sense.  This is necessary to ensure not only that people feel the workplace is safe, but also that they have a genuine desire to have their physical and mental health looked after.  I acknowledge that stress is a big challenge.  It is often driven by many factors, including domestic factors.  I have reached out to families through our personal support services because the support base that enables men and women to operate within the Defence Forces and to give loyalty to the State is very much built on the domestic support they receive from their partners, their friends and the society around them.  I have to be conscious that we are not just talking about the men and women who come through the gate into the barracks.  We are also talking about the critical support base that is provided by wives, partners, husbands, parents and children.  In that context, we will open a page that is specifically linked to families in the very near future.  We also have a 24 hour care call system.  Family members can phone into the care call line if they have an issue relating to stress.  We are endeavouring to have family outreach, in as much as we can, involving members of the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised an issue with regard to the Phoenix Park.  Many soldiers in the Defence Forces felt that some of the populism associated with some of the imagery around that time was not appropriate.  I was there.  I saw the professionalism of the soldiers.  When we go into very rough places, we lay down and operate from there.  We put up our bivouacs and operate in very challenging environments, where we are not worried about syringes but about snakes or scorpions.  A populist movement was driven by some imagery.  I do not know where it came from.</p> <p>  The same point can be made about the food.  It was not fair to the chefs of the Defence Forces that it was conveyed that the food was not fit for purpose.  I saw the food.  It was outstanding.  I invite the Deputy to come to visit some time.</p></speech>

I am delighted that all of our chefs are certified to a level that, unfortunately, makes them attractive to other parts of society, particularly the tourism industry.</p> <p>  I have been asked whether I am listening with regard to morale.  I do not think there has been any Chief of Staff, or anyone among the general staff, who has spent more time visiting barracks, attending town hall meetings and putting himself or herself in front of troops.</p><p>That is the way I ground truth - the sense of value in the men and women of the Defence Forces.  I also see it as my responsibility to allow employees to have a voice.  This ensures people can express their point of view and speak to the Chief of Staff.  I do so in a manner that aims to promote a culture in which nobody feels inhibited in expressing a point of view.  It is working quite well.  I have set in place a sergeant majors&rsquo; forum for all our key senior NCOs.  I try to meet it every six months and take on board its recommendations on how we can better meet the requirements of young soldiers, sailors and aircrew within the organisation.  We have an internal intranet which allows us to have discussions on a raft of issues.</p><p> One of the key developments in recent times has been the value awards.  The Defence Forces have a set of values which have defined it as an institution since the foundation of the State.  They are moral courage, physical courage, respect, integrity, loyalty and selflessness.  It is critical that these are institutionalised within the Defence Forces.  One of my happiest times in recent years was giving the awards to the value champions in the Defence Forces.  These are individuals selected by their peers as best representing each of those values.  I recall ringing a young private to give her the news that she was the recipient of the selflessness award.  She was crying on the phone.  After a while, she said surely somebody else in the Defence Forces deserved the award more than her.  That epitomises the values in the Defence Forces.  She was nominated by dozens of her peers, a selfless operator in the Defence Forces who epitomised that value.</p><p> I am constantly endeavouring to raise morale levels.  There are challenges but I am not sitting on my hands in terms of addressing those.  Internationally, we have looked at pay in other defence institutions in the UK and the US.  I have dealt with the Australian and New Zealand chiefs of defence to get a sense of what mechanisms they have to deal with the issue of pay and conditions.  It is not appropriate for me to compare us with other parts of the public sector.  That is a matter for the Public Service Pay Commission.  I am sure it will look at that in the round.  It is an open book and this is a democracy.  One can go to the Central Statistics Office website to see a comparator across the average weekly earnings of all parts of the public sector.  One will see the Defence Forces is consistently the lowest paid group in the public sector.  That is against the fact that we do not have protections.  Our personnel are subject to an unlimited liability and to military law, meaning they will not strike.  I feel there is a platform in the Public Service Pay Commission which will allow me acknowledge my desire to protect what is critical in the context of the institution of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  There is a loyalty we have delivered since the foundation of the State and we will continue to do so.  I will give leadership on that side.  I am accepting there is a leadership issue here and I and the general staff will provide that leadership.  There are areas in which I believe I could be even more able in the context of meeting the requirements of the Government and society.  Pay is one of the issues on which I will certainly continue to advocate.  I have done so to the Minister of State, as he has acknowledged in the D&aacute;il.  In fairness, the Minister of State has ensured the Public Service Pay Commission has prioritised the Defence Forces as one area to be examined.</p><p> I am delighted Senator Mark Daly served with the Reserve Defence Forces.  It has made some fine men in the State.  It is a powerful institution and has given us significant agility today, and even more so in the future in terms of some of the projects in the White Paper on Defence.</p><p> It would not be appropriate for me to comment on Brexit.  The Senator can be assured that the prudent planning required is being carried out.  One would expect no less.  The EU army is in the policy space and I cannot comment on it.  Suffice to say, there is the triple lock with a requirement of a decision from the Cabinet and the Oireachtas, as well as a UN mandate.  That remains in place to ensure the Defence Forces remain within the institutions that the sovereign State decides are fit and appropriate for a democracy.</p></speech>

Some of that commentary was intended for wrong purposes.  I usually try to check the facts.  The reason I mentioned the Phoenix Park was because it showed many people the differences in remuneration for two arms of the State.  Garda&iacute; can get overtime while members of the Defence Forces get day allowances.  One can understand how members of the Defence Forces and their families feel let down and less appreciated.  It was more to get across to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Service Pay Commission that the Defence Forces are different from any other sector of the public service.  If they can understand that, whatever system they put in place to reward 24-hour duty or longer will be appreciated.  Without that, morale will stay low and the forces will continue to haemorrhage personnel.  The fact that members of the Defence Forces are leaving to go to another arm of the State shows they can get better money elsewhere in the public service.  I accept not everybody leaves for that reason.</p><p>The new naval ships bring their own challenges because they have to be crewed.  We recently heard of crews not being available for ships leaving for duties in the Mediterranean.  When the final ship is due, will the Naval Service have the complement required to fulfil its commitments?  The Chief of Staff mentioned maritime defence and security and the fact that the Naval Service is patrolling an area three times the size of Germany.  Our navy is much smaller than Germany&rsquo;s which has a smaller area to patrol.</p><p>On Brexit, I presume the Defence Forces, like every organisation, is engaging in some planning in the background.</p><p>Many people take significant pride in the work done by the Defence Forces overseas, in particular with UNIFIL, Operation Pontus and Operation Sophia.  Recently, when the <i>L&Eacute; James Joyce</i>returned to Ireland, it was commented that it was not involved in as many rescues on this occasion.  We did not hear fully from the Defence Forces on how it got on in the past.  Hopefully, it played as large a role as previous naval ships did in previous missions.  Irish people were in general happy with what happened in past missions.</p></speech>

Dr. Mellett has given a long account of the external factors that restrict the ability to entice enough women into the Defence Forces.  I am more concerned about what is done with them when they get in, and improvements that could be made in areas under his  control.</p> <p>  The first issue on that is about the Naval Service.  Women joined the Naval Service in 1995.  There is not a single female officer of command or rank, with the word being that they get a bit sidelined when they have children.  No female NCO has broken through the glass ceiling of chief petty officer.  I suppose my first question is what Dr. Mellett is doing to push for the promotion of more women to top ranks - not just in the Naval Service, but across the Defence Forces - and why is the record of promotion so poor?  What systems are in place for women with children?  Dr. Mellett might also deal with whether he has heard of any instances of women being penalised, bullied or pushed out, whatever way one wants to put it, for having children, in essence, or is that something he can say with confidence does not happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.864" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Mellett" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018111500002#M01300"><p>I think I made the point clearly that I want to see more women in the Defence Forces.  I am disappointed we do not have more women at senior rank in all three services.<br/><br/>The promotion system is part of a conciliation and arbitration outcome between representation, military management and the Department.  The critical point, I would say, is that right now in the operational headquarters of Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean, there is a female lieutenant commander, one of the naval officers, who previously commanded a number of ships.  In my time in the navy, a quarter of our ships were commanded by female captains.<br/><br/>I have read and contributed to research endeavouring to address the issue of gender inequality within the Naval Service, in particular, and I have seen some of the findings and they give me cause for reflection.  I have doubled my efforts on trying to take out some of the impediments to development within the Defence Forces.  One of them is modularisation of our long career courses.  The command and staff course is about nine months long and I have tried to break that into modules to make it more family friendly.  That will particularly apply to women members of the Defence Forces, but it is obviously open to male members.<br/><br/>I think there are challenges in terms of nurturing within the Defence Forces and the separation that goes with parenting, particular for women members.  Areas such as breastfeeding and young childcare are a challenge to us and I would love to see more initiatives like a cr&egrave;che.  I have tried to drive that on a number of occasions and have come up against impediments in trying to establish a cr&egrave;che within the Defence Forces. <b></b><br/><br/>With regard to normalisation, where we have two serving family members, I want to introduce a means whereby certain freedoms are brought in.  If members serves overseas, they will have periods of exemption from duties to encourage them and make it easier for them to serve overseas without being penalised with regards to routine domestically when they come home.  <br/><br/>I would love to see female chief petty officers and warrant officers in the naval service.  It is not a question of a glass ceiling.  It is critical for equality, as I said earlier, that we have that decision making input at the more senior ranks, in the non-commissioned ranks as well as senior officers within the Naval Service.<br/><br/>To reassure Deputy Clare Daly, I will continue to give leadership to have equal opportunities for women within the Defence Forces.<br/><br/>Regarding people being forced out of the Defence Forces, I take any issues regarding administrative instruction A7 very seriously.  That is a provision relating to harassment within the Defence Forces.  I continually monitor that, as well as any evidence of bullying and harassment within the Defence Forces.  There are regular briefings on that and there is an openness.  I mentioned the issue of town halls earlier, when Deputy Clare Daly was not here, at which I try and push the importance of institutionalising a gender perspective, the appointment of a gender adviser, the appointment of gender focal points and the creation of a woman's forum in the various units to try and ensure moving on that path towards a gender perspective being institutionalised.  Gender inequality is not just an issue for women, it is an issue for men.  In an organisation that is predominantly male, I want to address that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-15a.865" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018111500002#M01400"><p>I was really short in my questions, and I have a lot of them.  I would appreciate if the Chief of Staff could stick to the particular questions and give as much detail as possible.</p> <p>  I note that Dr. Mellett is saying he would like more initiatives.  I suppose the difference between him saying that and me saying that is that I am not the Chief of Staff.  I am not in a position to implement initiatives I would like.  I hear what he is saying when he says he could not implement a thing like a cr&egrave;che, which would give me alarm bells.</p> <p>  He mentioned the issue of harassment and I will deal with that.  We can talk in generalisations but it is good when we deal with a specific example because it portrays the reality on the ground, rather than how we might like to get there.  As the Chief of Staff said he takes harassment very seriously, I will deal with an incident and we will see is it acceptable or not.  This was obviously a very concerning incident on one of the naval ships last year where a woman was falsely imprisoned by two male NCOs who broke into her cabin, wearing just towels around their waists, and harassed her to the point that she left the Naval Service absolutely terrified.</p> <p>  In response, the two men received reprimands which will basically disappear from their records after about two years.  None of the supervisors received any punishment for not ensuring discipline was maintained on their ship and the commanding officer was quickly promoted to commander after that.  Add that to the fact of the spyhole being discovered earlier this year in the female shower area in the naval headquarters and, as far as we know, nobody was sanctioned for that.  </p> <p>  Can the Chief of Staff comment on what specifically is being done about sexual harassment?  Is it a safe place for women?  How can women have confidence in the Defence Forces' policy when that reality that I described happened?

I am not familiar with the incident to which the Deputy referred.  We have an investigative process when an incident merits a military police investigation.  That has happened in the case of the spyhole.  That is subject to an ongoing military investigation and the outcome has not been reached.</p> <p>  I am not aware of the first incident Deputy Clare Daly mentioned.  If there is additional material that would inform that event more broadly, I would welcome receiving it.  I have confidence in the investigations within our institutions and the requirement for the military police to have the ability to investigate fully, take statements from all those involved, and for victims, without fear or favour, to be able to give evidence about events.</p></speech>

I raise this issue very much in the context of Dr. Mellett saying he wants women to join the service and stay, yet here is an incredibly serious incident of harassment, of which top management is not aware.  It strikes me that the systems are failing.  I encourage him to go back and look at it because it is a very serious problem and might inform him of some of the reasons women find it difficult to stay.  Reference was made to pregnant women.  Will Dr. Mellett give us an assurance that he thinks women have not been intimidated?  I have heard reports that they have.  Has a survey of women ever been carried out?  An analysis of the reasons women were leaving would have to be included.</p></speech>

I have spoken to the deputy Chief of Staff, support, DCOS support, about ensuring the parameters of A7 which concerns the norms and principles in being a service woman in the Defence Forces are applied without fear or favour.  It is not acceptable that there would be any differentiation between somebody who is and is not pregnant.  There may be constraints and restrictions in terms of where somebody who is pregnant can operate within the Defence Forces which is linked with health and safety, but I am committed to ensuring it is in place.  In addition, I do not want to have a situation where anybody is disadvantaged on the basis of being pregnant within the Defence Forces.  To reassure Deputy Clare Daly, it is not compatible with a desire, an obligation or a capability driver to have a better gender balance in the organisation if we have principles and practices that are not conducive to it.  I take on board her points, but I am not sitting on my hands and saying everything is fine.  I have read the research.  I engage on and contribute to it and give leadership at every opportunity I can at command level.</p></speech>

Processes and practices are one thing, but these are real incidents that are affecting real women.</p></speech>

I will then call Deputy Jack Chambers.  The format is that questions are grouped.  It is not a matter of going back and forth as otherwise we would be here for the entire day.  I will go back to Deputy Clare Daly.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked some supplementary questions and Deputy Jack Chambers also indicated.  We are running into time constraints.</p></speech>

He provided clarification in that regard.  The reality is that I have huge pride in the Defence Forces and the manner in which they delivered during the papal visit.  It was critically important that we turned out and delivered the level of security appropriate to the event.  It was not just security; it also involved providing support for civil society on the days surrounding the visit of the Pope.</p> <p>  On Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's earlier point about those who were serving, there are a number of initiatives.  I have said I want to see contracts addressed as soon as possible in order that we can give certainty.  There is also the developing piece on re-enlistment on which we are in discussions with the Department.  I accept that some people leave the Defence Forces, go elsewhere and perhaps develop to a certain extent.  I want to be able to give them an opportunity to come back into the Defence Forces if they want to do so.  We are already doing this in the case of officers.  We have the opportunity to recommission officers who have left and want to come back in.  Likewise, in terms of re-engagement, a matter which is related to individuals who are serving, we want to give staff the opportunity to make it more flexible for them to re-engage.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh also referred to people being able to work later in life.  That is all on the table in terms of our advice to the Department in elaborating on terms and conditions of service within the Defence Forces.  In fact, on one of the freedoms, I was trying to move on the issue of colour blindness.  I have a working group looking at the issue of colour blindness and transgender issues in the context of how we can have institutions that are appropriate.  Going back to Deputy Clare Daly's point about colour blindness, one of the impediments is that 9% of the male community are colour blind, while only 1% of the female community are.  That helps me in one area in bringing more men into the organisation, but it does not help me on the female side.</p> <p>  Specifically on the operations side, the Naval Service has the highest churn or turnover of personnel of the three services.  That is a concern.  </p> <p>  There has been an issue with a number of ships that did not sail.  I have addressed it with the flag officer, the assistant Chief of Staff and the deputy Chief of Staff, support, in expediting an intake of incruits who will come in in the next week or so and bring a resource into the Naval Service.  I have also engaged with the Minister on aspects of the Naval Service at which we need to look in the longer term to ensure it can maintain a level and tempo of operations suited to the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  On Operations Pontus and Sophia, a number of years ago the numbers crossing by the central Mediterranean route were in the hundreds of thousands.  At that stage the Government made a policy decision that we should work in a bilateral way with the Italian Government.  For a period we sent a number of ships to the Mediterranean, during which time they were extraordinarily busy, as was widely reported.  A total of 18,000 men, women and children were rescued during the course of these deployments.  During that time we saw hundreds of people drown and recovered scores of bodies.  It was a very challenging period.  The Government decided to shift to Operation Sophia, from which, as was mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, the ship returned recently.  The focus of the operation was on disrupting those who were exploiting the vulnerable and the traffickers who were extracting money from migrants and pushing them out into the Mediterranean where they were left in a hopeless situation.  The operation has been very successful in that there has been a dramatic reduction of more than 80% in the numbers using the central Mediterranean route.  It does not mean that we are not in the business of meeting our commitments under the safety of life at sea, SOLAS, convention.  In the context of the Operation Sophia missions, we have rescued hundreds of migrants.  Nevertheless, the focus was primarily on disrupting the model used on that side.</p> <p>  A number of Deputies spoke about air traffic control.  I am trying to consolidate the resource and build it up.  We are providing a service from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. on the basis that we need to husband the resource, with a view to ensuring we can build it back up and move back to providing a 24-hour service.  That is a decision I had to make with the Minister.  People often accuse me of not cutting my cloth to measure, but that is an example of where we had to look at the resources available in the context of the constraints on the utilisation of that resource.</p> <p>  On the utilisation of the budget, we have a high level planning and procurement group, HLPPG.  It deals with how we expend resources within the Defence Forces.  It is done in collaboration with the Department of Defence in order that there is due diligence and governance in expenditure in terms of the processes used in tendering and organising competitions in meeting the requirements of the public service pay and spending code.</p></speech>

It is slightly unusual that he would plead publicly with a pay commission based on a submission on which he says he signed off.</p><p>Why does there have to be a public plea and an engagement if Dr. Mellett is full square behind the submission that was made?  We know it contained none of the recommendations he submitted to the Department of Defence.  Why is that required if he can fully justify what was submitted?  What if the Public Service Pay Commission comes back with the same recommendations as it did with regard to nurses and other healthcare professionals?  In that case, there is dissatisfaction and we have not seen any improvement.  Based on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's recommendations we will probably not see improvements.  Dr. Mellett said he is fully behind what was submitted.  Will he clarify why he needs this public plea if he is fully satisfied with what he says he signed off on?  When does he expect the retention policy to be published?  When does he expect the Defence Forces to meet the White Paper target of 9,500?  Will he give an update on his engagement at a European level regarding PESCO and what involvement the Irish military has had in that?  Will he give some operational updates?  </p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General expressed concerns about the cybersecurity unit within the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Dr. Mellett mentioned cybercrime in his opening statement.  Would he like to see the Defence Forces build greater expertise there?  In terms of defence policy, are we fit for purpose in terms of the growing concerns the public and private sector have about cybersecurity?  Ireland deals with cybersecurity as an IT management issue rather than a security issue.  There are people seconded to that Department but the Comptroller and Auditor General stated it had no strategic direction and serious concerns were mentioned.  Would Dr. Mellett like to see something established within his policy responsibilities around that issue?</p></speech>

I have a responsibility to give advice to the Minister and the Government.  That applies to the institutions of Government, of which the Public Service Pay Commission is one.  There is context only a member of the Defence Forces can provide.  It is a context that comes from seeing the men and women of the Defence Forces, who serve in Mali, Syria or the Mediterranean, on the ground delivering defence, security and Government services in very challenging environments.  The only person who can articulate that is somebody who has been shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers, sailors and air crew.  I sense I have a strong position to bring to bear on what is unique about the Defence Forces in the context of other aspects of the public sector.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked how we get to know the Defence Forces better.  This forum is an opportunity to do that.  It allows the Chief of Staff to set out his stall on why the Defence Forces is a unique institution, why they are critical as the bedrock of the sovereignty of this State and why they contribute so effectively to the institutions of civil society.  Sometimes we take it for granted when people are free, the institutions of State function and the vulnerable are-----</p></speech>

I presume members of the HSE hierarchy went before the Public Service Pay Commission.  I am not too sure.  It is not a plea.  It is a development and a statement of facts and perspectives in the context of the challenging environment in which Defence Forces' men and women deliver services at home and abroad.  I am uniquely competent to be able to do that.</p> <p>  With regard to the retention policy, I mentioned earlier that we set out the climate survey action plan which had 54 items on it.  It is a document that is open for management within the Defence Forces and concerns what is happening in various areas.  Every time I go to meet the troops, whether a formal visit with their command team or in a town hall, I set out where we are in terms of the various initiatives with regard to retention within the Defence Forces.  Some of those are still questions I am pursuing in the context of the issue of the contracts and the White Paper projects relating to retention.  That is the development of terms and conditions that allow us to extend personnel and services in a manner whereby we will retain the maximum number.  </p> <p>  The issue of the cyberdefence of the State obviously involves the Defence Forces.  We have contributed significantly to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment as some former members have moved across there.  For a period we had a number of personnel who were seconded there to support the centre.  My priority is to watch my networks to ensure I can provide cyberincident response teams to ensure our networks are protected because if our networks are vulnerable or attacked, my capacity to have the coherence to deliver defence, security and Government services will be undermined.  My priority is to look at protection within the Defence Forces.  We have a very highly functioning critical cyberincident response team process.  I am ready and open to opportunities that could come in the future in the context of broadening the Defence Forces but that would have to be driven within a policy framework that would, in the first instance, be established by the Minister and the Department.  </p></speech>

One is dealing with maritime surveillance which is very appropriate given the size of our maritime domain.  The issue around maritime surveillance is we need to be smart in terms of how we apply limited assets over and area of 1 million sq. km.  We can benefit from engagement with the collaborative network that PESCO would provide in terms of development and new ways of doing things.  It would mean we are more efficient.  The other project is very much linked to training which is an area that is a Defence Forces' meat and two vegetables.  It is looking at a training centre of competence and how we can learn and develop these centres of competence in a manner that allows us to deliver training to the best of our ability.</p></speech>

It is critically important we continue to focus on retention.  In terms of my strategic planning framework, I have set consolidation as the main effort.  We need to consolidate around retaining people who are in service.  The second thing is expediting recruitment, but recruitment in a manner whereby we have a healthy turnover of personnel as opposed to the situation at present where we are challenged by a higher turnover than is desirable of people who are leaving prematurely .  I am endeavouring to reduce the numbers leaving prematurely and at the same time trying to maximise the numbers who will come into the organisation.  It is a competition.  There is a buoyant market.

I have not yet managed the art of bilocation.  I do not know if Dr. Mellett already answered these questions when I was not present in the committee room.  I have two supplementary questions from when I spoke earlier.  One was on the current figure.</p><p>I agree completely with the point made by Dr. Mellett about focusing on retention.  The figure is 9,500.  Where exactly are we as of today with that figure of 9,500?  Dr. Mellett may have answered that question when I was gone.</p><p> Earlier, I asked how Dr. Mellett reckons the so-called new structure is working.  Many soldiers I talk to tell me it is not working and has made their lives difficult.  If Dr. Mellett could change it, what would he do?  What would the ideal situation be?</p></speech>

That means we are slightly more than 500 below strength.  That is approximately 92% of our employee control framework strength.  As I mentioned to Deputy Jack Chambers, my desire is to progress towards 9,500 as soon as possible.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the current lay-down.  The Defence Forces organisational structure is set out in terms of the 2012 review that established the current lay-down.  The question of what is fit for purpose for the Defence Forces is under continuous review in the context of how we can best shape and utilise the resources.  I engage with the Minister and the Department on that question.  Several issues arise in the context of our current 2012 organisation system and projects in the White Paper, including doubling the Army Ranger wing and our command and control arrangements within the Defence Forces.  All these issues point towards a need to look at the Defence Forces in the context of how we deliver on these projects, with a view to ensuring that we are fit for purpose.  That is a dynamic and ongoing process of review.  There are challenges with the current structure but we should not deal with them piecemeal.  We have to look at the interlinking nature of them.  Given that several White Paper projects have a significant development aspect to them, I am looking at how we can manage them together by working with the Minister and the Department.</p></speech>

In any case, we will have to have Dr. Mellett back soon enough seeing as this is his first appearance.</p><p>My difficulty is that there is something of a disconnect between the talk and the reality.  Dr. Mellett made the point that the Government made the decision for us to participate in Operation Sophia.  While that is correct, it did so on the basis of advice and a recommendation from Dr. Mellett.  In that context, when Dr. Mellett was advising the Government, did he officially notify it at the time of the manpower or staff crisis in the Naval Service?  Did he officially notify the Government that the Naval Service was not in a position to fulfil its core maritime protection duties at the time?</p><p>We are aware that there was a meeting between the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the Defence Forces in June of this year.  High-level meetings took place between the Department and the Naval Service in July and again in September.  I have a letter from someone in the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority in response to a parliamentary question tabled in recent weeks.  It is a hard-hitting letter and, let us face it, civil servants do not normally send hard-hitting letters to politicians.  It states that the authority has significant concerns about the negative impact of the staffing issues being experienced by the Naval Service in respect of fisheries protection duties.  The authority is projecting that inspection numbers for this year will be 15% to 20% lower than in 2017.  That is utterly shocking.</p><p>We have heard much talk in the media about the Naval Service, which is unusual for a disciplined force and reflects discontent among the ranks.  We know the <i>L&Eacute; Eithne</i>could not go out on a routine patrol.  We know about the ships stuck in Haulbowline.  We know about the 72 hour notice that was subsequently cancelled.  These developments smack of chaos.  The fact is that the Naval Service cannot undertake its sea fisheries protection duties.  Two things are at issue.  The first relates to a breach of the responsibilities of the Naval Service in this regard and whether Dr. Mellett officially notified the Government of the manpower crisis when advising on participation in Operation Sophia.  The second relates to when Dr. Mellett made the case for a ninth ship.  Did he discuss the staffing crisis in the Naval Service with the Department at the time?  This is especially relevant since Dr. Mellett is not the Accounting Officer and cannot, therefore, increase the budget for recruitment.  Is there a full paper trail covering when Dr. Mellett alerted the Department on that point?</p><p>The issue of retention is relevant.  Dr. Mellett made the point that recruitment has started and he is delighted with that.  That is grand but when an organisation recruits a new staff member, it takes a good deal of time to bring the new person into the place of the person he or she is replacing.  The real problem is not only the numbers but the question of not having the right ranks with the right skill sets.  In that context, will Dr. Mellett comment on the shortage of able seamen?  We have been told &ndash; Dr. Mellett may be able to verify or repudiate this statement &ndash; that the ordinary seaman, effectively an apprentice, has been renamed as able seaman PQ, which stands for partly qualified, to hide the cracks.  That could refer to someone who has never set foot on a ship but is about to do this job.  If that is the case, it does not inspire confidence.  What specific measures are in place to retain personnel?  A total of &euro;100,000 or thereabouts is what it costs to get someone to the level of able seaman.  It is frightening to have that expertise wasted.</p><p>Dr. Mellett possibly touched on my next question already.  How many personnel in the Naval Service currently have discharges pending?  I am curious about that.</p><p>How many jobs has Dr. Mellett applied for since he took on the role of Chief of Staff?  Does he not think that is a destabilising influence?  If he is looking for other jobs, it might mean he is not really wedded to his current job.  Will he comment on that?  I will leave it at that for this round.</p></speech>

Dr. Mellett mentioned the importance of dealing with the whole issue of stress.  I have been alerted by a member of the Defence Forces to the fact that there is no psychiatrist available for non-commissioned officers at present.  Is that true?  A psychiatrist is available for commissioned officers but not for non-commissioned officers.  The the previous psychiatrist retired some months ago, he was treating more than 800 patients.  He has not been replaced.  Given that stress is a major factor in the Defence Forces for various reasons, it seems strange that a new psychiatrist has not been appointed.</p></speech>

We have been endeavouring to recruit a psychiatrist for some months now.  The matter has been in the market in terms of looking for an applicant.  The competition closed in September with no applicant.  The individual providing the services retired earlier this year.</p> <p>  The issue with regard to the availability of services for all Defence Forces personnel is a priority for me.  Private facilities have been made available for all personnel within the Defence Forces until we find a psychiatrist who can be brought onto our books as a permanent resource.  Deputy Wallace's point is correct in the sense that there was a period, I believe, when the policy was that enlisted ranks were not getting access to a psychiatrist other than through the public system.  However, that has been expedited and moved to a point now, if I am correct-----</p></speech>

That was a decision of Government.  It was not my decision.  I accepted the nomination and competed for the position, but I was not successful.

Ships have been stopped for personnel reasons and for mechanical reasons.  There was a loss of 5% of the total patrol days this year, which is minimal.  I would like to see the letter from the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  I know the chief executive well and we engage regularly.  We will address any challenges in delivering defence or Government services.  There is a shift in the Naval Service in the context of the delivery of fisheries protection towards more risk-assessed boardings and inspections.  This doctrine developed in my time in the service when a boarding operation took seven hours before the truth was established.  At the end of the seven hours, we found one of the most sophisticated means of flouting the Common Fisheries Policy that we had come across.  The vessels had been inspected many times before but they were short inspections.  Now we profile vessels to ensure they are not flouting the Common Fisheries Policy.  The new risk-based approach means the number of inspections is going to go down.  If, as the Deputy said, there has been a reduction of 20% that would tally with my experience but I can get further details for her if she requires.</p> <p>  I am very proud of the Naval Service but the decisions - whether they relate to Operation Sophia or Operation Pontus - are for Government to make.  I give advice but the final call is a policy matter.  I was asked if Operation Sophia is an acceptable deployment for us and for the 25 other states which are part of it.  The general staff considered it an acceptable deployment and advised accordingly.</p> <p>  The decision to be a nine-ship service was also made by the Government and is covered in the programme for Government.  Now we have to start the arrangements for the manning of the ninth ship.</p></speech>

When he gave his advice and recommendation, did he tell the Government of the manpower and staffing crisis that existed at the time?  The Naval Service should feel bound to deliver on the service level agreement it signed with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority because this is a key responsibility.  If boardings are going to be down by between 15% and 20%, the service will be in breach of the agreement.  It was the director of corporate affairs of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority who sent us the letter, which stated that the organisation had serious concerns about staffing.</p> <p>  I had two questions for Dr. Mellett.  Did he advise Government that Operation Sophia and the move to a nine-ship service were for it to decide on, but that the Naval Service could not do it because it could not even do its real job, which is reflected in the figures?  The service has a responsibility to the authority under the contract the two signed but it seems to fall well short of that.</p></speech>

The fundamental role of the Defence Forces is the delivery of defence services and this is our <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>.  We are the guarantors of sovereignty in the first instance and second to that is security.  Third are Government services, such as fisheries protection and services for Departments.  I have to look at broader issues than just the arrangements with Government agencies.  I was satisfied, and remain so, that the Defence Forces can continue to deliver on their commitments to the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  There is a review mechanism and I am delighted that meetings have taken place to look at how the Naval Service is delivering on its commitments under the service level agreement.  It has not, however, been brought to my attention that there is an issue with, or any inability to meet, the commitments we have with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.</p></speech>

I am not saying this - I am only informing Dr. Mellett as to what the authority told me.  It is stating that there is a problem but Dr. Mellett is saying there is no problem.

I mentioned a harassment case earlier.  I could not blame Dr. Mellett for being unaware of the details of such a case, except for the fact that it was in the media and was quite unusual in that it required the disciplining of a person.  This issue, however, is on a different level because it relates to a key naval function.  If there are not enough staff, that is a problem.  It seems to be the first time that this has happened.  It may have been kept quiet on previous occasions and perhaps the fact that it has leaked out on this occasion is an indication of low morale.  There has been a lot of talk about positive measures being undertaken.  I do not doubt Dr. Mellett's intention in this regard but, on the ground, the outcomes are going backwards and morale is getting worse.  Whatever systems are in place they do not seem to be working, something we see in the context of retention and in the service level agreement relating to coastal protection.</p></speech>

This is part of the battle rhythm of delivering a complex service.  There are challenges but they are not challenges which have not happened in the past and we are managing them.  One of the key areas is retention.  As already stated, there are two aspects to consolidation, namely, the retention of serving personnel, which involves cutting our cloth appropriately, and recruitment, in which we endeavour to get young men and women to join the Defence Forces, particularly the Naval Service.  That process is ongoing.  There is a competitive market for able seamen.  We are at approximately 84% and there are a number who, for various reasons, are not available for seagoing, which makes it difficult to guarantee the level of service we provide.  We are trying to expedite recruitment,  The competitive edge in the Defence Forces also has a pay aspect and that is why I made the case to the Public Service Pay Commission.  I want to double down on that, particularly in the context of the Naval Service and the higher level of churn to which it is subject.</p></speech>

There is a lack of adequately skilled staff to put the vessels out to do what the White Paper on Defence states is the Naval Service's primary job.</p><p>The facts indicate that we do not have this so there seems to be a disconnect.  I am not sure we have all the answers here but I would be concerned.  Did Dr. Mellett deal with the able seaman partly qualified, PQ, and where that rank came from?  What is that?</p></speech>

There are legislative requirements in terms of firefighting and personal survival.  We have a very sophisticated college in the National Maritime College of Ireland.  The requirement to meet those requirements is there.  With regard to how the flag officer utilises his resources, I would expect that he would be smart in terms of the resource available to him to ensure he can continue to meet his requirements in terms of delivery of services and at the same time, the development of personnel if, in this case, as the Deputy says, the individual was an apprentice.</p></speech>

If there is a case - I will put this into the briefing note for committee - for looking at the level of services on offer to the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, we will do so.

The White Paper on Defence states that sea fisheries is a primary day-to-day task of the Naval Service.  Dr. Mellett has indicated on more than one occasion that it is not and that it is very far down the list.  We need clarity on that.  The Naval Service signed up to the service-level agreement and agreed those targets.  It is the agreement and those targets that are being breached.  Dr. Mellett stated that the Naval Service is doing it differently now.  If that is the case, the people with whom it signed the agreement should know that.  That is the point that needs to be clarified.  I am astounded that Dr. Mellett has never heard of an able seaman PQ.</p></speech>

It is the first time a Chief of Staff has addressed an Oireachtas committee.  Of course, we hope to have engagement in the future.  When we invited Dr. Mellett to appear before us, he willingly came back and told us that he was at our disposal.  We welcome his interest in coming before the committee and addressing questions.  I thank Dr. Mellett for his clear presentation and the forthright manner in which he has taken a wide range of questions.  I will not ask Dr. Mellett to respond because my colleagues have covered a lot of issues in respect of which I, as a Member of the D&aacute;il for Cavan-Monaghan - which has had a very strong Irish Army tradition over the years - would have concerns .  Pay and conditions are issues and they were raised by my colleagues.</p> <p>  I am very glad Dr. Mellett indicated that he has appointed a director in respect of the Reserve Defence Force.  The Reserve Defence Force has often not received the credit it deserves concerning the role it plays.  I previously mentioned the importance of the then F&oacute;rsa Cosanta &Aacute;it&uacute;il, FCA, more latterly the Reserve Defence Force, in helping many young people who may have been vulnerable to getting involved with the wrong company.  These young people enlisted in the Reserve Defence Force and, in many instances, went on to progress to careers with the Permanent Defence Force.  Great work was done, particularly in the Border area, in difficult years to ensure that young people who may have been vulnerable to getting involved with the wrong company were brought into the Reserve Defence Force and went on to play a very important and positive role in society.  This has never been recognised in the way it should.  It is important that the Reserve Defence Force is built up again to a better enlistment level.  There were efforts some time ago to have more regionalisation in the organisation of the Reserve Defence Force.  That did not happen.  The part of the force in my region of Cavan, Monaghan and Longford was due to be regionalised more with the north-east but, thankfully, that did not happen.  It is very important that we retain that local element to the structure of the Reserve Defence Force.  I pass on the appreciation of local communities for the work it has done over many decades and the work it continues to do.  Again, I thank the members of the Permanent Defence Force for the work they do on behalf of all of us on a daily basis.</p> <p>  I remind members that we are due to reconvene at 3.30 p.m. to meet a parliamentary delegation from Georgia.  The next meeting after that will be on 29 November, when representatives from Crosscare, Safe Home Ireland and the Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas will be before the committee to discuss the challenges and barriers facing returning emigrants.</p></speech>

As members will be aware, this week the 7th quarterly report on progress on the cost of motor insurance, and the cost of employer and public liability insurance, was published.  It shows that, of the 78 separate applicable deadlines within the action plans of the two reports at the end of quarter 3 2018, 62 relate to actions that have now been completed.  This report outlines the significant work being done to address the cost of insurance.  In this regard, there has been significant progress on a number of legislative fronts as well as the publication of the second Personal Injuries Commission, PIC, report on the benchmarking of awards.  While some deadlines have yet to be met, the general direction of travel is positive and this is reflected in the most recent CSO figures for October 2018, which indicates that private motor insurance premia have decreased by 22.9% since peaking in July 2016.</p> <p>  I will now highlight a number of the key developments that have taken place in the past number of months   The committee will be aware that the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 was signed into law last July.  This important legislation was necessary to address the Setanta legacy.  The Act provides for the payment of 100% of the compensation due to Setanta third party personal injury motor insurance claimants, including the additional 35% to those who have settled their claims and received compensation of 65% of their claim.  The State Claims Agency will apply to the High Court on 19 November to obtain approval for payments from the Insurance Compensation Fund in respect of the fourth tranche of payments to the Setanta claimants.  I am hopeful that this tranche of payments will be made to claimants in late November or early December this year.  It involves in the region of 1,500 separate payments, with a value of approximately &euro;21 million.</p> <p>  Another important step forward is in the work the Cost of Insurance Working Group has been doing with the publication, and completion of Second Stage, of the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018.  Committee Stage will be held on 29 November and I am hopeful that with the assistance of all parties in the House, it can be enacted by the end of the year to allow the database to become operational from early 2019.  Members should be aware that I intend to propose two amendments to the Bill to amend sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, in order to implement recommendations of the employer and public liability report.  These measures are important for stakeholders as, when implemented, they should make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected.</p> <p>  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018 has been published by my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and completed Second Stage on 8 November.</p><p>Given the importance of this Bill, as part of the overall reform agenda related to the personal injuries framework, it is important to facilitate its swift passage.  In many ways the most significant development over the last number of months has been the publication of the second and final report of the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC.  This was a key recommendation of the Working Group on the Cost of Motor Insurance report and I grateful to the Chair, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns., former President of the High Court and members of the Personal Injuries Commission for their careful consideration of the personal injuries framework.  In view of the findings of the benchmarking exercise, which indicated that compensation payments for soft tissue injuries claims in Ireland are typically 4.4 times that of the UK for similar claims, I would like to note in particular my view that it will be important that progress is made on the development of judicial guidelines for injuries rewards.  If implemented in the spirit intended, this will be a unique opportunity for Irish society to consider an appropriate rebalancing and recalibration of Irish awards both in the context of their relative values to each other, and comparatively, to other jurisdictions.  A significant knock-on effect from such an exercise will be lower premium levels, thus improving the situation for consumers, business owners, and society without disproportionately restricting access to appropriate compensation for genuine and seriously injured claimants.</p><p> Consequently, as the Bill providing for the establishment of the judicial council is a legislative priority for the Government, I hope that significant progress can be made towards its enactment by the end of this year.  In summary, the implementation of the personal injuries commission, PIC, report is key to fundamentally addressing many of people's concerns about the personal injuries compensation framework in this country.</p><p> Since we started our work in 2016, there is a much greater appreciation of the nature and extent of the underlying problems.  In particular, publications such as the PIC report continue to influence the public perception of this issue and provide the necessary momentum to continue with this very important project.</p><p> In addition, the robust approach being adopted by some insurers to challenging questionable claims is proving successful in tackling fraud, as can be seen in recent media reports detailing personal injuries cases which have been dismissed by the courts after extensive investigations surrounding the circumstances of the claim.  This trend is encouraging in tackling the problem of dubious or exaggerated claims from the personal injuries litigation system.  These facts, on top of the most recent CSO figures showing an almost 23% decrease since peak levels in July 2016 show that the  work of the Working Group on the Cost of Motor Insurance is making a difference.  We cannot become complacent on this agenda, however, and can therefore rest assured that i will work closely with my Government colleagues and the other relevant agencies to ensure that everything necessary is done to achieve this objective as quickly as possible.</p><p> Before I finish, Chairman, it is clear that there are a number of pieces of significant legislation at different stages in the Oireachtas.  I want to ask members of the committee and their colleagues to help in the aim of ensuring that the maximum amount of floor time in both Houses be made available for these pieces of legislation.  To put it quite bluntly, without getting the legislation through both Houses now as quickly as possible, progress will be slower than we would like.  If anyone has spare time or if they want to get the best use of their time, my Department is ready, willing and able to deal with these as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The insurance industry is rolling him over on the recommendations and as this is happening, people out there whether they are motorists, consumers, business people and those involved in the agricultural sector in marts and other areas are paying astronomical insurance premiums as a result.  They are being fleeced by what is being described in Europe and indeed here by cartel-like activities.  That is not a stretch of the imagination.  We are aware that certain sectors of this industry were subject to dawn raids by European authorities working hand-in-glove with our own authorities.</p> <p>  On some of the recommendations that he is to oversee and implement, for example, the insurance industry was asked to display the reasons for their large increases last year which the Minister agreed in a protocol.  Now he is telling us that following a review by the Department, insurers have been asked to ensure that this information is displayed more prominently on their websites so that that it is accessible and visible for consumers and the Department is going to continue to monitor it.  The insurers were to provide additional information on premium breakdowns to customers.  This was a key recommendation of the Oireachtas committee and the Minister is telling us now that there is consultation under way.  This is the second round of consultation.  We know in the first consultation, the insurance industry complained about costs and making things complicated.  These are recommendations numbers 1 and 2.  They are simply not going anywhere.  </p> <p>  If we look at recommendation number 3, to extend the current renewal notification from 15 to 20 working days, this has been blocked by the insurance sector complaining about it.</p></speech>

That is the Ladybird version of what I saying.  Recommendation No. 6 is a protocol to ensure a greater consistency of treatment for returning emigrants.  We hear again, following a review  by the Department, insurers are being asked to ensure this information is displayed more prominently on their website to it is accessible and visible.  They are messing again and doing the bare minimum.</p> <p>  Recommendation No. 8 is a protocol for policy holders to be notified of claims made against them before settlement.  Here the insurers are brazenly blocking the Minister.  He wrote to them a year ago but they are still playing hardball.  For something as simple as notifying policy holders of claims made against them, they are forcing him to go through the route of legislation.</p> <p>  That is the pattern with a number of key recommendations in the report.  The report is now a year old.  Many people who are paying these premiums thought it was just a matter of getting through an obstacle after the work this committee did in shining a light on what was happening in the insurance industry and how people were being fleeced.  When is the Minister going to start playing hardball with the insurance industry?  It is very clear to me and to my constituents that this industry is rolling him over time and time again in these recommendations.</p></speech>

The figure that is most relevant to this is that the motor insurance premium has been reduced by 23%.  That is something that he cannot argue with.  The figures that we accepted from the CSO showed an increase of almost 60%, going back to the peak of 2016.  Since that peak there has been a reduction of 23%.  The Deputy is making analogies and broad statements about rolling over but he cannot argue with that reduction figure of 23%.  I did not catch all of his points but I will address recommendations 2 and 3, which relate to the provision of additional information and the extension of the renewal notification period.  The delay in addressing these actions points is due to the Central Bank having to undertake a second consultation process on the inclusion of last year's premium and renewal notice.  This was completed last September.  The Central Bank is considering these responses, with the aim of finalising all amendments to SI 74 to the end of this year.  The objective of insurers providing additional breakdown of the premium to consumers, including the previous year's premium, and extending the renewal notification period from 15 days to 20 days was to give people the opportunity to see what last year's premium was.  I am dealing with people at every level.  Many people have more than one premium, for example those in business.  Last year's premium will be noted on the premium for this year.  If there is an increase, they will see exactly what it is.</p></speech>

The idea that one would say this is what was charged last year and this is what will be charged this year is not on.  We can all dig out our premium quote from last year.  It was about trying to make the industry justify how it was charging for motor as well as fleet insurance.  I informed this committee of one haulier whose premiums went from &euro;32,000 to &euro;120,000 in the space of three years.  In anybody&rsquo;s book, that is somebody who is being fleeced by an industry which is operating as a cartel.</p> <p>  The Minister of State claimed I was wrong.  Recommendation No. 1 is not implemented and has actually been blocked.  It is the same with recommendation No. 2.  Recommendation No. 3 has been blocked by the insurance industry.  For recommendation No. 6, the protocol does not exist and it is just about putting something on a website.  Recommendation No. 8 regarding the protocol for policyholders being notified of claims made against them before settlement again is being blocked.  Five of the first eight recommendations have all been blocked by the insurance industry.</p> <p>  We will hear the Minister of State put a spin on that, suggesting everything is much better for consumers.  It is definitely okay for the industry because it has a Minister of State not standing up to it.  He referred to the issue of fraud.  It is a real issue, but where is he on it?  He makes statements on radio and in this committee that he does not agree with the recommendation to set up an insurance industry funded Garda fraud squad but he will do it anyway.  That is not what is needed.  We need serious action with a publicly funded squad.  We need to let the Garda Commissioner know that the Government stands 100% square behind him and make the resources available to stamp out fraud.  We need to deal with the real issues which are these recommendations which are over a year old.  The Minister of State is completely out of touch with what is happening and is not playing hardball with the insurance industry.</p></speech>

He is ignoring the fact that the average insurance premium has decreased by 23%.  The figure which peaked at July 2016 was a 60% increase.  That figure is from the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  The CSO is analysing the numbers and has stated there has been a 23% decrease since then.  We need to deal with the facts.</p> <p>  We have problems in the insurance sector with fraud and exaggerated claims as well as high awards.  Those are the facts and that is what the bulk of money goes on when the premium is paid.</p> <p>  Maybe the Deputy does not agree with the CSO.  It is easy for him to pluck out an individual case, claiming it has gone from &euro;30,000 to more than &euro;100,000.  I have to deal with the average figure.  The Deputy can ignore it all he wants but there has been a reduction of 23% since the cost of insurance working group was established.</p></speech>

I am not saying it is all right but it is not all wrong either.  We have a significant problem with fraud, exaggerated claims and the levels of awards.  That is where the real problems are in the insurance sector.</p> <p>  The Personal Injuries Commission benchmarked the level of award for soft tissue injuries, which come to 70% of all claims, against those in the UK.  It found awards here are 4.4 times what they are in the UK.  We have a problem with insurance fraud and exaggerated claims.  In my view, the latter is a much larger issue.

I support it.  However, I do not support it being paid for directly by the industry.  If Insurance Ireland wishes to pay the moneys into the Exchequer and they are then passed on to the Garda, then I am 100% behind that.</p></speech>

He told the company he wanted to put another taxi on the road, as part of an expansion of his business, which is great to see.  Liberty quoted him &euro;11,700.

We heard the Garda Commissioner discuss Garda concerns about this.  The Minister of State should do the right thing and ensure his Government colleagues support what this committee is seeking, namely, a publicly funded fraud squad within the Garda.  It is ridiculous that we do not have a fraud squad in the Garda at the end of 2018.  We have raised this matter year after year.  We have heard from the industry and others.  No prosecutions are being brought when the courts clearly find that claims are fraudulent.  The false claimants walk out the door of the court.  Why would they not when there is no fraud squad in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with fraudulent insurance claims?</p> <p>  The Government has complicated the issue by throwing in this idea that, for the first time, the Garda would be funded by private industry.  It should instead do the right thing and send a letter or make a call to the Garda Commissioner informing him that the Government stands foursquare behind him.  Fraud is a serious issue, although not the only issue facing the insurance sector.  The Government should tell the Commissioner that it make the resources necessary available to him if he wants to establish a fraud squad forthwith.  Why does it not do that?</p></speech>

Those people should be pursued, but that is a matter for the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There is a cross-over from the civil courts into the criminal courts, which operate in a different space.  I am not satisfied that this cross-over has taken place.  The superintendent in charge of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau informs me there has been a big improvement in the conversation between the bureau and Insurance Ireland.  Details of claims have been sent to the bureau and the insurance industry has highlighted that some of these claims are fraudulent.  As a result, the Garda has informed some of those making the claims that it is investigating the matter.  The information that I have been given indicates that, on the basis of the number of visits that have occurred, two thirds of these claims have been withdrawn.  Claims are being withdrawn because they even get to court because the Garda is now investigating the matter.  The Deputy is again wrong when he says nothing is happening.  We are improving the pathways.  The Deputy wants to establish a new section in the Garda when it is not necessary to do so.</p></speech>

We have the proposals and I have written to Commissioner Harris who has replied.  The Commissioner is getting his feet under the desk and I do not want to be a burden to him.  He has serious issues to deal with.  For example, we are all aware of what happened in Drogheda in the past couple of days.  I expect to meet the Commissioner before Christmas when I will raise all these matters directly with him.  I will see what his opinion is at that stage.</p> <p>  I do not have a magic wand to instruct the Garda, DPP, Courts Service, Central Bank, State Claims Agency, Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and other Departments involved in the insurance sector.  This is a big and broad sector and we are moving in the right direction.  The Deputy also chooses to ignore the 23% reduction in the cost of premiums.  That is the one figure he has not highlighted.</p></speech>

I want to break down what the 23% figure means to the individual consumer.  Is the Minister of State saying, based on the CSO figures, that if everything has remained the same for consumers in terms of the vehicle they are driving and so on, they can expect to have their insurance premium reduced by 23% this year?</p></speech>

The Senator can describe it as being ripped off if she likes, but companies have different pricing arrangements.  We recently did a mystery shopper exercise with insurance companies.  Insurance with some companies costs twice as much as with other companies because of the way in which they price it.  The Senator can call it a rip-off if she wishes but each company has a different method of calculating risk for pricing.</p></speech>

Her insurance premium was doubled.  There was no insurance claim, nothing like that.  She rang up the insurance and asked if the other party had claimed.  The Minister is saying and I want to get this clear that people can have a rightful expectation to have their premium reduced by 23%.</p></speech>

The 23% is the calculation by the CSO on the basis of the entire industry of an average reduction.  If somebody is applying for a new premium 12 months later in exactly the same circumstances, there should be a reduction.  Companies have different pricing models and are stronger in certain markets than in others.  Some companies are averse to insuring younger people and some are very strong with younger people.</p></speech>

The figure that was used for the increase was the same figure that we are using for the decrease.  As people saw their premium increasing, and it was calculated on that basis  by the CSO, the same figures were being used for the decrease.  Let us not tiptoe around this.  We have 62 out of the 78 recommendations concluded.  Some of the remainder will not be done because our analysis is showing that potentially it would cost too much.  We are down to the big stuff now.  The big stuff includes the national claims information database.  That has to be passed by the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  We are down to the recommendations from the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC report from Mr. Justice Kearns where the analysis is that the rewards are way out of kilter-----</p></speech>

There will be a further decrease when we establish the national claims information database and the judicial council.  The first piece of work that the judicial council should do is, following on from the PIC report, is recalibrate the book of quantum.  Our book of quantum is way out of kilter with every other jurisdiction.</p></speech>

Both entities had a mystery shopper exercise for vehicles over ten years of age.  The variation in the market was enormous - the premium doubled between the lowest and the highest.  I cannot instruct each individual company how to have their pricing structure based upon their risk models.  That is a matter for them.  What is a matter for every individual is - a point I make all of the time -  is to shop around.  Unfortunately too many people stay with the same company or broker.  They never change.  There is much better value out there, if people shop around and get new pricing opportunities, whether with a broker or directly with the insurance company.</p></speech>

The national claims legislation has gone through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  The Judicial Council Bill is in the Seanad and is stuck behind the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, where there has been 41 hours of a filibuster.  I do not agree with guillotining but if we get stuck behind legislation, there is a cost.  The cost on this occasion in the Seanad of which Senator Walsh is a Member is that other legislation gets stuck behind it.  The Judicial Council Bill is sponsored by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Judicial Appointments Commission Bill is ahead of it.  Until we can get that  Bill concluded the Judicial Council Bill will not progress.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the fact that premiums have gone down, but we are still hearing from people who are having issues with them.  The Minister of State is well aware of that.  The debate on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 currently going through the Seanad is being dominated by two individuals.  That happens in the D&aacute;il as well.  The second Bill could have been brought through the D&aacute;il initially, rather than the Seanad.</p> <p>  To get down to brass tacks, the biggest issue we face in terms of insurance is lack of transparency.  I acknowledge the work the Minister of State has done, but I want to talk about facts.  I want to know how the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018 will improve transparency.  Who will control the database?  Who will have access to it?  What information will be in it?  Insurance companies repeatedly go through peaks and troughs.  Nobody seems to know what profits those companies are earning or the make-up of the premiums they are providing.  I want to know precisely what the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018 will do.  Everyone wants to work to get this through.  What will be in the Bill?  Who will own the database?  What information will be in it?  How quickly will it be up and running?  Will the public have access to it?  Outside of claims, what will bring premiums down will be utter transparency around them.</p> <p>  Many members of the public believe it is not worth their while shopping around.  Many are elderly and only use their local broker.</p><p>Their broker is supposed to get them the best value for money.  In fairness, most of them do a good job.  Will the Minister of State talk to us about the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018?</p></speech>

Right now the only numbers available to be analysed of which we can be 100% certain are those made available in the courts.  That represents approximately 6% of the sector.  We have the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, figures on top of that, but many of those cases move through PIAB first and then on to the courts.  We do not have any way to analyse those settlement channels.  There are massive grey areas.  The divergence in the business models of the different companies is enormous.  Some insurance companies will settle before any analysis is done.  Some even settle before medical reports are made available because it is cheaper.  That is their business model.  They decided that was the wisest thing for them to do commercially.</p></speech>

The key objective of collecting the data is to improve transparency and to enhance the ability to analyse the relationship between claim costs and the cost of premiums.  The data specification outlines the data that are required from firms relating to both premiums and claims, allied to information on the income and expenditure of the individual firms.  While this has not been fully finalised, the general thrust of the specification is along the following lines.  In respect of the data to be collected on premiums, premium policy data for the past ten years will be collected from each insurer across all private motor insurance policy types.  The data to be collected on claims will include the aggregate claims information for the past ten years in respect of all private motor claims, both open and closed.</p></speech>

We talk an awful lot about insurance.  Ultimately if there is a database which analyses all of this information we do not want to be back here again in a year's time to see it just trundling along.

Many points have been covered, but Senator Kieran O'Donnell is right about the lack of transparency, which is the most frustrating element for people.  No one has yet told me that he or she has seen a 23% reduction in his or her premium.  I have met people who have seen plenty of increases, though.  I am happy to acknowledge that if a premium reduces, people do not necessarily go around talking about it, but if the average is 23%, there should be people who have received 46% and 47% reductions, and I have not heard of anyone like that.</p> <p>  I take issue with Senator Conway-Walsh in respect of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  My party has not contributed the 41 hours of speaking time.  Were the speaking times analysed in any fair way, it would boil down to one or two individuals, as Senator Kieran O'Donnell pointed out, neither of whom is in my party.  It is the business of the Government and the Leader of the Seanad, as the Minister of State well knows as a former Senator, to schedule time.  If they want to schedule business other than that Bill, they are free to do so.  We get through a great deal of business every week, and when it needs to get through the Seanad quickly, it often does.  The Minister of State knows that.  My party has facilitated him, as have other parties.  A particular Bill cannot be used as an excuse for everything else being slowed down.  That is not fair.</p></speech>

If it wanted to schedule something else in advance of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, I am sure that could be done quickly with the agreement of others.  For example, the Greyhound Racing Bill 2018 is being dealt with extremely quickly because it is a priority for the Minister in question and we are happy to see it go through.  Many other Bills have been dealt with quickly.  This discussion is a distraction rather than anything else.  I will leave it at that.</p> <p>  The Minister of State hoped that the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill would be passed by the Oireachtas.  When does he anticipate the database will go live and start collecting information?  For those watching in who may not be as familiar with it as some of us, what will it do for people?  We mentioned that it would be an industry tool and that people would not have access to it, but what are the legislation's benefits to the public?</p></speech>

I have spoken with all of the companies.  Unusually, some settle claims before they even get lodged.  They make an offer of X thousand euro and the matter is concluded.

It is an important issue, but so are public liability and other types of insurance.  I might have been in the Chair when the Minister of State previously said that, if people wanted high payouts, there would have to be high premiums.  It was not a case of "Get over it", only "That is the way it is".  There is a large window for people who have had accidents or claimed to have had them to, for example, return to a licensed premises, restaurant or night club one year, 11 months and 30 days later and say that something happened two years earlier.  Many of the staff will have changed, GDPR will have required the venue to get rid of its CCTV footage and so on.  How do we tackle that situation?</p></speech>

However, exaggerating a claim is still fraud.  Exaggerating mileage is fraud.  If one loses a coat and claims it is worth ten times its value then that is fraud. </p></speech>

When people  produced a cloakroom ticket invariably the coat concerned was never a battered old one.  If somebody writes something on a claim form and seeks more money than the sum to which he or she is legitimately entitled, then we should not simply call it an exaggeration as it is a form of fraud.  An exaggerated claim may not be as blatant or as awful as fraud but it is.  Fraud is fraud and exaggeration is a form of fraud.  The blatant staging of accidents is worse such as a person who drives a vehicle into a pothole at two miles an hour and claims something happened.</p></speech>

There is a sanction if the perpetrators of the crime do not get away with it.  People make false insurance claims week in and week out.  It is good that insurance companies are fighting them and, thankfully, judges have thrown out some claims.  There are people who repeatedly make spurious, fraudulent or exaggerated claims.  All of a sudden the claims are withdrawn because it has been discovered that the claimants were doing mixed martial arts, skiing or whatever.</p><p>Nothing happens to them and they go off and do it again.</p></speech>

I will continue on from what the Minister of State has said, particularly in respect of the PIAB.  When claims are made, people making claims write in at no cost to themselves whereas the person holding the insurance has to defend the claim all the way up.  If it is then found to be a fraudulent claim, nothing is done to the claimant and the claim has not cost him or her any money.  It has, however, cost the person defending the claim a lot of money to defend him or herself and his or her premium may well rise.  That should be looked at.</p></speech>

There is, however, a cost to the insurance holder because he or she has to defend him or herself the whole way up along.  He or she has to employ a solicitor or barrister.</p></speech>

While we speak a lot about fraudulent and exaggerated claims, most claims are legitimate.  The biggest issue in respect of insurance is the level of awards for lower level claims.  That is the bigger issue by a country mile.  While I know people want to talk about the fraudulent or exaggerated claims, the issue is that people pursue claims much more because of the level of the award.  If Mr. Justice Kearns's analysis is that awards are 4.4 times higher than they are in the UK, then somebody getting &euro;10,000 in the UK would get &euro;44,000 here.  It is therefore very lucrative and very worthwhile for people to pursue a claim whereas they would not put the same effort and energy into claiming or pursuing a &euro;10,000 claim.  That is just the way of it.  The level of award is encouraging people to keep progressing and pursuing claims.</p></speech>

Part of the national claims information database will involve analysing how much of an award gets to the claimant.

They will not see it as lucrative to pursue claims in court as there will not be a big payday.</p></speech>

One company is prepared to run a pilot programme if taxis are prepared to use dashcams and a black box to allow analysis of whether drivers are driving responsibly.  The issue is the level of awards against full-time professional drivers.  Our level of awards is the biggest issue in insurance by a country mile.  Claims of a couple of thousand euro would be considered for some small incidents in other jurisdictions, whereas one can get &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 for the same incident in Ireland.  That is the biggest issue by a country mile.</p></speech>

A great number of people contact me regularly about massive increases in their premiums.  These people have no record of claims yet their insurance premium increases.  It does not just go up by a small amount of money.  We can talk in percentage terms but that clouds the issue of the actual cost in euro.  It could be double.</p></speech>

Because there are more claims and higher awards, there are unfortunately now only two companies that will insure taxi drivers.  We now face a lack of competition.</p></speech>

It is almost impossible to do business because of the costs of public liability insurance, especially for small pubs.</p><p>Whether one had a claim or not, one's insurance and costs are going up within a business that has an extremely tight margin.  I am pointing that out as a fact.  It is true that they are all in difficulty in terms of their insurance costs and, while we are sharing these facts this morning that have not changed, I am sharing those facts with the Minister of State.</p></speech>

The issue here, again, is that somebody can have a small claim for small damage and can claim for very large amounts of money.  If they keep pursuing it, and lengthen the process for years during which time the insured individual or premises has that claim on their books, it becomes a commercial reality and is cheaper to pay it.  Again it goes back to the level of award.  It has been lucrative for somebody to pursue it.</p></speech>

Is it that the Government or the system, regardless of who is in officw, are afraid they will lose insurance companies?  Is it a fact then that insurance companies are relying on that fear in order to increase their own profitability and protect a market that is acting like a cartel?</p></speech>

As I said, there is an ongoing investigation.  I have to also be cognisant that part of the role is to have companies come in and create competition.  Part of that is that companies should be profitable.  Until, I think, two years ago, insurance companies in Ireland were not profitable.  Prior to that, we were losing insurers and that meant that there are some sectors that only have one insurance opportunity and that is not even here because some sectors have to be insured from London.  That is a difficulty for the entire sector.</p> <p>  I have a balance to strike between protecting the consumers and having a competitive market.  As I said, until a couple of years ago, companies were in significant loss.</p></speech>

All of these are real issues that are preventing the market from expanding.  The insurance companies are quite happy to tolerate that.</p></speech>

Senator O'Donnell was making the point that I am going to make now.  Is a customer a relevant party?  Is this committee a relevant party?  The Minister of State mentioned relevant parties in the context of access to the database and mentioned people who make policy decisions.  If that database is to be worth anything, surely it should be a case-by-case, claim-by-claim register?  That is what it should be.  The Department of Finance seems to be against that.  A claim-by-claim register would inform the public as to why their policies are going up.  It would inform the industry and potential entrants to the industry in Ireland and it would give greater customer information in a general way.  The Department does not want to do that.</p></speech>

Quite frankly, it comes across as if the insurance companies are being minded and it is the customer who carries the can, regardless of what happens.  Even to go back to the earlier point about cameras and so forth in taxis, trucks and vans, even that cost is borne by the owner.  The Minister of State mentioned two pilot projects that pay for themselves.  The insurance companies in Ireland, or Insurance Ireland, are making no real effort, it would seem, to engage with the Minister of State.</p></speech>

The Department's analysis indicates compensation in Ireland ranges between three and 5.5 times that in Britain.  Last week the PIAB analysis said that awards in Ireland are five times those in Britain.  If somebody is getting the equivalent of &euro;5,000 in the UK, they are getting &euro;25,000 here, tax free.  It is very lucrative even for the best of people who have been impacted who, through no fault of their own, will pursue a case because the book of quantum is at the level of threshold it is at.  That is why this market is not competitive.  That is why there are not 15 or 20 insurers in this market.</p> <p>  I am not here protecting the insurance companies.  On every occasion it comes to my attention that there is an issue, I bring them in and put the hard line to them.  The latest occasion was about cars over ten years old.  The previous occasion to that was about how insurance companies are dealing with their clients following Storms Ophelia and Emma.  Consumer protection is high in my threshold for the job that I do in insurance.  Make no mistake about that.</p></speech>

What is happening is staggering.  Motoring insurance affects people going to work and their families and on the commercial side, taxis included, people will be affected in their pockets.  The balance is simply not right.  I am not being critical of the work the Minister and his officials are doing but someone has to tip the balance in favour of businesses that are finding it difficult, the publicans, taxis, truck drivers, van drivers etc., because that is what the economy is turning on.</p></speech>

My role as Minister with responsibility for insurance is to highlight areas where there are difficulties and that is what I am doing.  The insurance sector used to keep information hidden and information was only obtained by dragging it out of the people who held it but, with the implementation of the national claims information database and the fraud database, this is changing.  The sector is changing for the good but the issue which is driving costs is that of the level of award.</p></speech>

Between 2012 and 2014, however, insurance companies incurred significant losses, which bears out the Minister's thinking.  Taken as a whole, however, insurance companies amassed profits totalling &euro;2.86 billion from 2002 to the date of the report in 2016.  The data from the Central Bank's blue book show that motor insurance companies made &euro;3.1 billion in profits from 2001 to 2012.</p></speech>

If a sector in industry is doing poorly, whether it be agriculture, marts or taxis, and the capital required to underwrite it is loss-making, the holders of that capital will decide to close the book and leave.  That is part of the problem we have.  For a period of time, the level of awards was so high in this country that the insurance companies made losses.</p></speech>

I am of the opinion that it is a cartel-like operation.  According to the Central Bank, the insurance industry has made significant profits and is desperately reluctant to come forward and co-operate with the Minister and the Government to try to achieve a more balanced marketplace.  Until it is taken on, just as its members take on the Minister, the Government and all of us, they will continue to do what they are doing.  I agree with the Minister of State about the cost of claims but I think insurance companies and Insurance Ireland have an awful lot to answer for.  They are getting away very lightly.</p></speech>

A total of 62 out of 78 recommendations have been concluded although some will not be concluded because, upon analysis, they will be too expensive or will not produce the effect for which we had hoped and anticipated.  The 22% reduction is welcome and we want to reduce it further and move into other sectors.  We are getting to the big stuff now and the role played by this committee, and both Houses, in the coming three to six months will determine the level of competition in the market and how we can get the market onto a strong stable footing, without large profit spikes followed by losses.</p> <p>  The consumer protection side of insurance is very important to me.  We have done two reports in the past six months on consumer protection and how the industry operates with its clients, external to fraud, exaggerated claims or high awards.  Make no mistake about this - I am on the side of the consumer, along with the Chairman.  I hope we will get the national claims information done before the end of the year and get the Judicial Council Bill through both houses in the same period.  I hope we can also get the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Bill done.  These last few bits are the really important work. </p></speech>

They might have a different view now of what recommendations might and might not work.  At the next meeting of this committee, I will recommend that we write again to all stakeholders who made submissions, such as Age Action, and everybody else affected, just to get their updates on what they now perceive to be the situation out there.  We could invite Insurance Ireland back before the committee because nothing much has changed, in spite of the best efforts of the Minister and his officials.  We could put further pressure on the industry to focus more intensively on the need to settle the outstanding matters.</p> <p>  We did not do prelegislative scrutiny on the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018 because we wanted to allow it to progress and 29 November has been set for Committee Stage.</p></speech>
