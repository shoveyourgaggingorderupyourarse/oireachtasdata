He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.</p> <p>  No apologies have been received.  We are holding the minutes over until the next meeting and there are no matters arising from the minutes. </p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  The first category is A, briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  We will note and publish Nos. 2536 and 2537 from the Courts Service regarding briefing documents and opening statements.</p> <p>  The next category is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to PAC meetings and other items for publishing.  The first two items, Nos. 2476 and 2538, are from Professor Phillip Nolan, President, Maynooth University, dated 17 October and 8 November 2019.  The first item includes a request for further information in regard to an anonymous query we had written to the university about.  We received an anonymous query and we indicated the last day we would send that to the university for comment.  After the meeting, we looked at it again and we summarised the contents because it was felt that if we gave the anonymous correspondence directly to the university, the correspondent might be identifiable within the university, and we felt that might not be appropriate.  We gave the university a summary of the key points and it is coming back to us for more information.  We will give it as much as we can but I want to hold back on giving it the original documentation because the person might be identifiable within the college.  The university says that, based on what it has received so far, it cannot trace the particular issues.  In any event, we will provide any additional information we can.</p> <p>  The second item is a response to our queries following correspondence which raised a number of concerns.  The following information is provided by the university: the university&rsquo;s current risk register, as well as any internal or external reviews or audits of this conducted in the past three years, and this is quite an extensive document from the professor; the final accounts in regard to Innovation Value Services Limited, which we have discussed and which is the organisation that went into liquidation; details of occasional staff in receipt of payments for one year, two years, three years, four years and more than four years; and an information note on the research and knowledge transfer plans for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.  Professor Nolan states that the services referenced were procured in accordance with and satisfy all legal requirements and guidelines as set down in the university's procurement policy.  The monetary value of the engagements referenced are under the threshold for a national tendering process system and, accordingly, contracts were awarded on the basis of quotations sought from suppliers of the relevant services.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  The reason we are asking this of every organisation is that we are looking at the issue of non-compliance with public procurement guidelines.  It is a matter of form.  We will be issuing this to every organisation which has submitted 2018 accounts.  In the meantime, there are a number of Votes - perhaps five or six - that are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General where non-procurement issues are listed.  We will not get to some of those until well into next year.  With the secretariat and the Comptroller and Auditor General, we will look at the annual report and identify those five, six, seven or other number of Votes and, next week or as soon as possible, we will agree a letter to each of those Accounting Officers.  We want to complete everything that has been published.  Those accounts have already been laid in the Oireachtas and published.  Even though we do not get to interview the witnesses at this stage, in advance of that we want to get information in regard to non-compliance with public procurement.  We will want to include that topic in a report next year so we will do advance work on it.</p> <p>  There is a lot of information on what are called in the document "occasional hourly payments".  There is comprehensive information on the number of staff and on the number of registered students who have been in the system for occasional payments for over four years, which is 126, as well as the range of payments.  We asked for the amounts paid to the 158 staff in the six months up to 30 March 2019 where those staff had been engaged over more than four years.  One staff member was paid over &euro;20,000 in that six-month period when we are talking about "occasional hourly payments".  It seems to be a pattern, which was the purpose of Deputy Catherine Murphy's query.  As to how widespread it is, the university has given us the information in regard to people being employed on what it calls "occasional hourly payments".  They are not temporary or part-time; they just come and go, and it is a case of, "We will call you when it suits.  Here is the hourly rate.".  However, for some people, that arrangement seems to be continuing for a period of time.  We will note and publish that.  I am sure Deputy Murphy will want to comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-14a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019111400002#B00300"><p>This is a general point rather than a point in regard to Maynooth University.  There is a presumption that university people are going to be extraordinarily well paid but, in fact, one will find there is a high level of fairly poor payments and, often, there is a greater level of job security at primary school level than at university level.  I do not think we should be surprised that there is quite a low level of payment of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000, even though quite a lot of hours could be put in.  The other point is that this also relates to registered students and it is not unusual to see MA or PhD students lecturing on a part-time basis.  It is an area that needs to be looked at in its own right, irrespective of this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-14a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019111400002#B00400"><p>Will we write to the Higher Education Authority to establish if it is a practice across all universities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-14a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019111400002#B00500"><p>That would be useful because I believe there are other things that flow from it.  The things are flow from it will be things that will catch up on people later on, such as employment rights, holiday payments and all those other things that go with the casualisation of work.  It is certainly prevalent.  I have spoken to people in several universities and the same profile is cropping up.  It comes back later if people end up, for example, getting a welfare payment that is not a benefit but an allowance.  There is a circular point about this possibly being almost a subsidy from the public purse.</p> <p>  While the number is not very large, there are 1,300 people and, again, it is not unusual to have people coming in and guest lecturing, and so on, which can really be of benefit to the college.  Let us acknowledge things like that.  There were 126 with some number of years and 56 with four years, yet they were occasional staff.  The term "occasional staff" could mean people are trying to serve their time to end up becoming permanent staff.  It is a class of employment we are seeing more of.  The HEA would be the body to address this to and I imagine IFUT would have something to say on this. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-14a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019111400002#B00600"><p>That is the Irish Federation of University Teachers.  We will follow this up because perhaps there is a broader issue.  I suspect there is an element of this across many of the third level colleges.  I call Deputy Cullinane.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-14a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019111400002#B00700"><p>That was my point on this issue.</p><p>I agree with Deputy Murphy that it is a class of employment that we have seen, not just in universities but in other areas as well.  It may be a big job of work for us but this is just one university.  I would imagine the situation is similar across all of them.  Would the HEA have that information readily available?  Could it send on a breakdown to us for each institution and university?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-14a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019111400002#C00200"><p>Okay, we will send this-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-14a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019111400002#C00300"><p>I have another issue I wish to raise when the Chairman finishes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-14a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019111400002#C00400"><p>We will send this letter to the HEA because the specifics of it might be news to the authority as well.  We will ask it for its views and also ask it to contact the other colleges and ask them to assemble the information.  It is not our job to do its job.  We will ask it to assemble the information from the constituent colleges and pass it over.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-14a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019111400002#C00500"><p>The other issue is on the non-compliant procurement contracts.  I am not exactly sure what is being asked of the Comptroller and Auditor General in that regard.  Every time the appropriation accounts come before us, we write to the Accounting Officers looking for a detailed explanation which, in itself puts pressure on, which is of value.  Let us say, for example, we pick 2018 and have a report on the full picture at each organisation that has submitted its accounts - some have not but most have - and where there was a problem.  Is there a possibility of the secretariat then doing some work on this?  We have been looking at the areas where there are problems.  Some of the problems are benign while others are not.  We can examine areas of crossover in terms of the problems.  That would be useful because we want to get the parties involved to learn from this.  There are two issues at play here.  First, the rules themselves may not be fit for purpose.  That is one of the issues we may need to consider.  The rules may need to be changed.  That is not for us to do but it might be the outcome of our work.  What would be the way forward in that context?  I would imagine that it would not be hugely difficult to do this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-14a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019111400002#C00600"><p>No, it is not too difficult.  We are not proposing that we go back to 2016 or 2017 because we have enough data for 2018.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has published the appropriation accounts and they have been laid before the Oireachtas.  Some of them have these issues.  They have already been published and noted by the committee.  We are just asking the secretariat and the Comptroller and Auditor General, in the context of the Votes, to pick out those with procurement issues and we will systematically go through-----</p></speech>

It is only a minority of them but we will systematically write the standard letter to each of them and ask them to give a detailed breakdown of the procurement issues that are referred to in their appropriation accounts.  We will write to all of those organisations whose 2018 accounts have either been examined here or noted and published and acknowledged in the Oireachtas and where there is a reference to a procurement issue.  We have done quite a few of them already.  In January, we will assemble all of that information, and when that is done, we will break it down into different categories.  Some issues may be around extensions of contracts, proprietary products-----</p></speech>

One theme I have seen is a consistent referral to the fact that the Office of Government Procurement has not established a framework.  I can see between four and six different reasons for these procurement issues arising.  Some of it is down to bad management, to be honest.  When we assemble the information, we will be able to examine and categorise it under the different headings-----</p></speech>

Members should note that on foot of further items of correspondence received by the committee and discussed at our meeting last week, we will be writing to Maynooth University with further specific queries.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence, No. 2522, is from Professor Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh, President, NUI Galway, dated 31 October 2019 providing an information note requested by the committee on the number of non-compliant procurement contracts in 2018.  The details are all there.  We will note and publish this.  Members can use it as they see fit in the meantime, but we will include it as part of our information gathering process as just discussed.  We will come back to it.  I note that some of the 2018 non-compliant contracts mentioned are no longer non-compliant.  The contracts have been corrected.  We will keep the pressure on and will assemble the information over the next month or two.</p></speech>

It is confirmation that the university is taking this seriously.</p></speech>

As Deputy Cullinane said, we must look at areas where the rules may be overly restrictive, for example.  We will look at the nature of the frameworks being established by the Office of Government Procurement.  Are those frameworks achieving, in the round, the best value for society?  Price is-----</p></speech>

We will then have a list of 50 organisations, let us say, that had compliance issues.  We will have dossiers on all 50, and we will ask the secretariat to streamline them into categories such as those for which there was no Government framework in place or those that involved proprietary products.  The contract for the locks in prisons is an example of the latter.  It was not possible to put that contract out to tender.  Other categories would be those where the contracts were rolled over or those where there was no proper system in place.  The HSE would be an example of the latter.

Let us take a printing example and a contract for ballot papers for a general election.</p><p>They can break it down into a number of printing contracts so it is not one national contract for all constituencies.  Similarly, with Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, for example, it does not make sense that they would have to procure everything from a national competition.  There should be regional delivery because a lot of the demand is going to be local.  There are challenges there.  It is important that everybody has an opportunity to compete.  One needs to look at the conditions that are applied in a competition that can perhaps rule out certain suppliers, for instance if one sets too high a threshold for turnover level a business has to have or the track record of the business.  There are protections that come from that, because one knows that somebody is established and not a fly-by-night operation but one does not want to rule out legitimate competition that could actually deliver better value for money.</p></speech>

It is not all about the commercial side.  Consider libraries, for example, where books are procured that may be published in another country.  One loses some of the local dimension, which is incredibly important from a cultural perspective.  This is not a quantifiable one.  Is this counted in at all?  It is just an example.</p></speech>

If certain books are required, maybe for local history or local interest requirements, it is for the library to specify that these are the books it wants and then place the order, as opposed to somebody saying "Here is a selection of books that we offer."  It is complex but it is amenable to common sense being applied also.</p> <p>  To get an overview on 2018, the committee may need to look back to some of the big organisations that were through in the earlier part of the year.  The obvious one is the HSE where the financial statements would have been noted earlier.  This is in case they are not in the trawl that is already being done.  The committee may need to add those.</p></speech>

We will get back information about EU directives and all of our obligations but we are teasing out the balance here and how to get the balance, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has just said.  It is about how we tease this out to ensure it is competitive but still of benefit to the local community, that it is fair and that they have an equal opportunity to participate.  That is the balancing exercise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-14a.63" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019111400002#D00800"><p>It is a balancing issue.  From looking at this issue previously I am aware that Ireland, which is the only island economy in the EU, ends up placing more of its contracts outside the State than other EU countries do.  In France 98% or 99% of all contracts given out by public bodies go to French companies.  It is the same in Germany, Spain and Italy.  Ireland, however, is taking a lazy approach that we just adopted.  We all remember the situation some years ago when every leaving certificate examination paper was published in France.  They just made the contract so big that a French company got it.  The French would never do that.  It could have been broken down by subject and made into ten contracts and perhaps ten, six, two or three Irish companies could have bid.  It is about how the contract is constructed.  This goes back to the scale of the contract and the scale of the turnover and number of people the organisation must have.  In my experience, public sector organisations take the lazy approach where they want the bidder to have a big turnover.  I have seen how companies or building contractors built housing estates for local authorities and if five or six years later two more houses were wanted in the same estate, the contractor was no longer eligible - having built the previous 20 houses - because the company's turnover in the past two years had diminished during the recession.  Things like that do not make sense.  There are a number of such cases.  In other cases some contracts come up and a company that perhaps has experience in the area does not have turnover.  It can set up a joint venture company with some other utterly unconnected business that has a high turnover cashflow.  A filling station business with a big cashflow could link up with a builder to form a joint company and then the builder meets the turnover criterion.  There are lots of aspects we need to watch.  It is easy to construct a company to get the turnover if one sets about to do that.  I have seen this happen in practice.  These are the issues.  In the meantime, the people with the track record are not getting a look in at all.  I apologise for that diversion but the members can see where we are at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-14a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019111400002#D00900"><p>We have come at this in the first place because there is an obvious problem.  If every second or third set of accounts has a note that there is non-compliance, it means there is a problem.  When we have looked at this we have found that the problems are twofold.  In some cases it is bad management and a flagrant disregard of the rules.  This is one element of it.  There are also problems with the system being too rigid and not flexible enough for smaller organisations also.  This is where our focus should be.  The thematic approach advocated, where it is broken down into the four or five or six themes and reasons why there are failures, could tell us where lots of the problems are.  Initially we were hitting all the organisations over the head to say "Why are you not complying?".  The system obviously is not working and I believe we need to be looking at that.  It cannot be working if every second or third organisation and big Department comes back time and again with non-compliance.  Some of it is bad management and we cannot let them off the hook on that one.  Some of it is just that they are not complying with fair rules.  If there is no level playing field, however, or if it is too rigid, too complex or too difficult - or whatever the problems might be in some areas - then we have a responsibility to find that out.</p></speech>

I remind members of where we can achieve results.  Some years ago we had only one of the 17 education and training boards getting its accounts in within three months of the year end.  We brought them all up, went through them one by one and put four of the ETBs in front of us.  Hey presto, the following year every one of the ETBs' accounts were in on time.  The committee's involvement does help, with the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Having to answer to the Committee of Public Accounts does help.  Let us use the bit of influence that we have.  No. 2522 is agreed.</p><p>No. 2523 is correspondence received from Anne Graham, chief executive, National Transport Authority, following up with information requested at our meeting on 1 October.  I will first refer to the headings.  There is some shocking information in this, which follows through on the request for more information.  Some of it is routine and great information is provided but there is one issue I wish to highlight.  Ms Graham gives a breakdown of: the money spent on advertising campaigns for bus shelters; the cost of the Go-Ahead Ireland project <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Dublin Bus; the roll-out of accessibility infrastructure, a list of the towns where that has been completed in the past year or two and the ones that are currently in planning; the proposal to carry out accessibility works in Carlow train station; and the payment by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for free travel.  We had been asking about the issue of free travel.  There are five pages on that and we will come back to it in detail because it is connected to the public services card.  We will note and publish the correspondence but we are not finished with the issue of the public services card yet.  There is a lot of correspondence coming in from individuals on that issue arising out of the committee's discussions here and our meeting with the Department last week.</p></speech>

We are aware that the public service obligation, PSO, for the free travel scheme has been capped for nine years at &euro;51.6 million.  The National Transport Authority also states that it understands that increases were paid to commercial operators.  Can the committee write to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to find out exactly what is paid and who the contractors are?  We know that over the years, when Bus &Eacute;ireann was in huge financial difficulties it had to subsidise the difference, which put the company into even further financial difficulty.  Bus &Eacute;ireann had to subsidise the difference between the Government-awarded funding for the free travel scheme and the actual cost.  Perhaps we could find out who is getting what and how much the operators are getting from the Department.</p><p>It is important to establish if the public transport service operators are being put at a distinct disadvantage.  Even with some of the private operators, they are not compelled to have disability access, while public transport operators are and rightly so.  It will be interesting to see if they are being awarded more in funding under the free travel scheme.</p></speech>

It is not immediately obvious.  Obviously, some of those advertising campaigns will be on buses and bus shelters.  It is not immediately obvious who benefits from this.  It is probably Adshel.  That area is a little opaque in terms of the income from advertising.  Does the National Transport Authority, NTA, get it or the commercial company which provides the shelters?  That is not immediately obvious.</p> <p>  On the sanctioned headcount, there is a litany of stuff in that which is unacceptable in terms of how the Department deals with it.</p></speech>

We did not ask about the income from advertising on the various bus shelters and who gets it.  We will ask the question.  We were shocked to discover at a meeting last week that the majority of the staff in the NTA are outsourced and on contract.  We have never met a State organisation where the majority of the day-to-day staff are not direct employees.  The NTA has a situation where it has 118 direct employees and 148 people sourced through agencies on placement contract.  I have never seen this before.</p></speech>

We got shocked at that and we asked for a breakdown.  This is what I am shocked at.</p> <p>  On page 20 of this letter, it states the current employee headcount is 118, which costs &euro;8.7 million.  That is an average of &euro;73,728 per employee.  That includes PRSI, superannuation and everything that might go with that.  The outsourced placements, that is, the 148 persons sitting beside the direct employees doing the same day-to-day work, cost &euro;20.6 million.  That is an average &euro;139,189 per employee which is 90% greater than the cost of a direct employee.  This is a gross mismanagement of the budget.  It is spending 90% more per person than it needs to.</p> <p>  It further states that there was sanction to increase some additional staff.  That has been done.  At the end of the schedule, it states the board agreed to put plans in place for additional staff to be recruited.  It does not give us the numbers of the staff to be so recruited, however.  It states its long-term objective is to ensure it has the proper staffing requirements.</p> <p>  Ten years after the organisation has been established, this is totally unacceptable.  There is bad expenditure on behalf of the taxpayer of &euro;10 million.  There is &euro;20 million on outsourced staff.  If these were the authority&rsquo;s own staff, that figure would halve.  Up to &euro;10 million is being spent on outsourced staff to do day-to-day work in that organisation ten years after it was established.  It gave all the details about recruitment embargoes over the decade.  These figures are such a stand-out.  It is a matter on which we will report.  We have mentioned that at the meeting.  Those of us here were shocked to hear this.  That is why I want to put those figures out there now.</p></speech>

It is one that we should be conscious of with organisations which have been created in recent years.  It is a kind of a staple question we might ask to see if there is the same profile.</p> <p>  The Chairman demonstrated the costs with figures and there may well be an adjustment in that.  There is another issue, however.  If people are on contract, the organisation will have to keep on training new people coming in.  Staff retention becomes an issue, as does the viability of an organisation.  We can point the finger at the NTA and tell it to get this sorted out.  In actual fact, it is the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that is the origin of the issue.</p> <p>  If we are to take action, we need to write to the Department.  It has constantly asked the NTA to outline its requirement.  It knows what its requirements are.  It can evaluate the work of the people it is employing on a contract basis and decide what is essential employment.  It is a bit like the schools building programme.  One goes through many stages and one concludes that it is all about spreading money over several years.  There is not even a saving in this case with the NTA.  As the Chairman demonstrated, it is actually costing more.  I do not think, however, we are counting the total cost.  I would like us to write to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport as opposed to the NTA.</p></speech>

It is No. 2531B.  I should have linked this to the other remark earlier.  We wrote to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport because we were so shocked that day.  We have the reply back from it, No. 2531B, dated 6 November 2019.  It actually states under progress in implementation that in December 2018, the NTA received approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the sanction of funding of phase 1 involving 26 additional new positions.</p><p>The recruitment of the additional personnel commenced in January 2019 and all new staff are expected to be in place by the end of the year.  Phase 2 of the plan was approved by the Department's management board in July 2019, and it is engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the NTA in respect of sanction for phases 2 and 3.  Discussions are continuing on the approval of the associated delegated pay sanctions for phase 2 of the plan.</p><p> The Department's effort to date, even in respect of the 26 additional staff, has been minuscule and it has not dealt with the issue.  Given that it is now in talks about phases 2 and 3, we will write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because it is involved in the sanction.  The sanction it should consider relates to ensuring that it has the adequate complement of staff rather than continually paying contracted staff, who cost &euro;140,000 each as opposed to the average salary of &euro;73,000.  If the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has the remotest interest in the issue of cost, that is what it should consider, rather than arguing whether 24 or 26 additional staff should be appointed.  It is symptomatic of where we are.</p></speech>

My concern is whether it is fit for purpose or whether the complaints relate to what are just teething problems.  Much information has been provided in the letter.  The complaints suggest that people are not being paid properly and payments are weeks overdue, and they have been submitted by everyone from porters to hospital consultants and ambulance drivers.  The system has to be flexible.  I cannot understand how it would not be flexible and it may be that it is a matter of how it is being used.

We will note and publish the correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 2528 is correspondence from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, dated 6 November, regarding correspondence we sent to him on the alleged misuse of special educational needs allocations and resources.  We asked about the Department's oversight of school expenditure and the school grant system in this regard.  The Department makes clear it allocates special education teachers.  There is no allocation of funds and, therefore, that is not an issue.</p> <p>  The Department states that since the system was introduced several years ago, 88 reports of potentially inappropriate use of special education teaching resources have been made to the Department, comprising 71 in primary schools and 17 in post-primary schools.  It states the figures should be viewed in the context of more than 13,500 special education and training posts and 4,000 primary and post-primary schools, that there have been 1,500 school inspections, and that the majority of the issues arose having been uncovered by the Department during its own inspections.  It states that in respect of the numbers we mentioned, 34 schools have confirmed they use the allocation in accordance with the guidelines, 29 schools have replied to say the allocation is being reviewed, replies are awaited for a further 20, while five schools are yet to be in a position to demonstrate compliance.</p> <p>  The Department is addressing the 88 schools that have been reported and goes on to state that, ultimately, the first responsibility is with the board of management, which must satisfy itself that proper controls are in place.  It indicates that the board's income and expenditure accounts must be prepared for the end of each school year and must be properly audited or certified.  All schools' accounts are available for audit by officers of the Department, officials and the Comptroller and Auditor General, if requested.  There are 4,000 more schools, therefore, that the Comptroller and Auditor General can audit if he wishes.</p></speech>

There were some cases but we are clear that the problem is not with staff.  Perhaps the schools are doing something else.  There have been 88 complaints and most of them were uncovered by the Department.  While some were not, it is systematically reviewing them.  We will note and publish the correspondence, and reply to the person who wrote to us.</p> <p>  No. 2529 is correspondence from Ms Colette Drinan, secretary and director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, dated 7 November 2019, responding to a query regarding vacancies at that office.  The information was requested by the secretariat and will feed into our next periodic report.  There will be some good news for some of the staff at the office.  The letter states that as of 31 October, the office had 181 full-time equivalent members of staff and no vacancies, which was the result of ongoing active recruitment, especially at the trainee auditor grade.  Consequently, the office has more trainee auditors than the complement but fewer senior auditors than the complement.  It is expected that a number of internal promotion competitions will re-align the numbers at an early stage.  There will be some promotions, therefore, for some of the people at the office, which is good to note.  It shows that when we examine accounts, even though the Comptroller and Auditor General appears before the committee every week, we do our work straight and ask straight questions, and we received good answers in this case.</p> <p>  No. 2530 is correspondence from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, providing information following our meeting with Caranua.  I specifically asked for details and we have received details of properties.  The letter states it was indicated that four properties would transfer to public bodies, the Department or the HSE, as the case may be.  The four cases referred to are Cloughmacsimon, County Cork, offered by the Rosminians, who took cash of &euro;101,600; in Portlaoise, the Congregation of the Christian Brothers gave a cheque with a value of &euro;2 million in lieu of property; in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, the Congregation of the Christian Brothers paid &euro;412,665 in cash as opposed to property-----</p></speech>

In each case, ownership and title issues arose, and it was a requirement of the indemnity agreement that the property transfer with good market value for each title.  There are issues with trusts in those cases.  I am told that in some cases the orders had to revert to the Vatican to have the trusts corrected and it was easier to hand over a cheque.</p><p>That was strictly only in the cash and the funds received were placed in the special account used to fund the awards made by the Residential Institutions Redress Board and associated legal and other costs.  We will place that on record.  We will remind Deputy Connolly that the letter is here because it is relevant to our ongoing discussions on Caranua.  People understand the reason that some properties were offered but could not be transferred.  We have been following that.  We will note and publish the letter and we will make sure that Deputy Connolly is made aware of its existence.  She can raise it next week or at some other future date because there is more correspondence dealing with Caranua.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 2531B is from Ms Ailish Neville at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We have dealt with the matter which concerns the NTA.</p></speech>

When I was reading the letter from the NTA, I knew I had read that other correspondence but it was further down the list.  I was speaking from recollection.</p> <p>  No. 2532B is from Ms Rachel Downes, CEO of Caranua.  She provides a lot of information.  We will note and publish it but we will hold it over.</p></speech>

We are aware that a number of people have met Mary O'Toole, who is reviewing cases where there is a dispute about the length of time involved due to the lack of records.  It is not clear if an amount has been retained, but there is no point in doing the review if there is nothing in the budget to deal with it.  Could we clarify the position as it is not immediately obvious?</p></speech>

A deadline for closing off cases was introduced.  Some cases arrived after the deadline and they were not taken into account.  Based on the average payments made to date, Caranua knows that if it pays what it has in its system, there will be a surplus and it might be able to look at some of the cases that arrived late.  We will note and publish this and we will hold over a discussion on the document until next week if Deputy Connolly wants, particularly as it is Caranua.  We will associate the other letter from the Department about the properties with it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2533B is from Mr. Gerard Dollard, CEO of the Irish Greyhound Board.  He is providing a response on whether it is standard practice to perform post mortems on dogs that die on tracks.  The board stated that it has not been standard practice, but it is its intention that it will be the practice in the future.  The board has been dealing with the veterinary medicine department in UCD in Belfield and it is its intention to do that from now on.  Is it agreed that we will note and publish this?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2534B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We wrote to Mr. Watt asking for information on the full list of public bodies that are using the public services card and an information note outlining what stage the project is at.  He referred us to the Government website which shows the public bodies that are currently using the card and the stages the project is at.  There is also information on the website on whether the card is currently live or is planned for introduction in the near future.  We also asked for a detailed implementation and costing plan and he said the Department does not have that; it is a matter for each implementing body.  First, he referred us to a website and, second, he referred us to every other Department.  We will note and publish that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2540B is from the Courts Service and is dated 11 November.  It provides a note on the recording of wards of court fees in the appropriation account.  Can we agree to note and publish this item?  We will discuss the matter later with the Courts Service.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We now move on to category C correspondence.  No. 2517C is from Mr. Michael McGlynn, communications and research executive with Nursing Homes Ireland.  Mr. McGlynn provides a statement issued to the media.  The organisation has called on the committee to question the HSE and the Department of Health to achieve full disclosure regarding the costs to bring HSE nursing homes up to the required regulatory standards.  We will note that question for the HSE, which will be here in three weeks' time.  We will put that on the list and tell the HSE we are going to ask that question.  I propose that we ask the HSE to provide an information note on that.  We will note that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2518C is from an individual.  I propose to hold the discussion in private session because this is a letter I received following our meeting with Caranua.  An individual whom I think was too late in applying for the first tranche of funds saw there might be funding available.  I think a person had to get an award from the redress board before he or she could go to Caranua.  I will hold this letter over for the private session because it contains personal information.  We will come back to that in due course.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2520C is from an individual asking what the Committee of Public Accounts is going to do about Deputies' expenses.  I understand that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is examining the matter of expenses.  That is important.  We will note this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2535C is from an individual and is dated 6 November, requesting the committee to investigate expenditure management in Irish Water.  Irish Water does not fall within the remit of the committee but it receives money from the Department.  We will send the correspondence to the Department and ask it for a response in respect of its oversight and governance of Irish Water regarding the matters raised.  The Department is a funding Department and it is answerable to the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

When I asked a question of the officials of the Department when they came before the committee, I was informed that it was just a newspaper item and that there was no issue arising.  I tabled a parliamentary question subsequently.  It is not a big deal, but it is an issue relating to accurate information that is being given.  The reply stated:</p><blockquote>I am advised that in late 2017 an issue was raised concerning specifically the CV Builder element of ...[a particular] software package and where relevant CV data was stored.  Seetec were requested to remove the capacity to store CVs on the ... platform and this functionality was replaced ... [and people have it] ... on an optional basis.</blockquote> <p>There was a basis for the question I asked and it is very annoying that it was batted away.  I got a perfectly acceptable response then but I am surprised that I was given that kind of response.</p></speech>

We saw this week, on the front pages of our national newspapers, that it has come home to roost.  There was a drop of some &euro;35 million in the Local Government Fund and there was a change in terms of the Irish Water situation in that its contribution would be based on population.  As a result of the changes, this week we saw that Dublin City Council now finds itself in receipt of some &euro;8 million less in funds.  Previously, commitments had been given that loss in revenue would be resolved through a Government subvention but the Government has back-tracked on that commitment.  I made the point to the Comptroller and Auditor General that it would have serious implications for the funding of local government.  I accept that is not within our remit but it goes back to the changes in local government funding, which has now resulted in &euro;8 million less going to Dublin City Council, and that is just one council.  I am trying to ascertain the figures for the various councils across the country at the moment because it is having a major impact.  I ask that we would look at this again because that one change will have a major net impact on the operation of local councils.</p></speech>

That is not forthcoming now and the council is down some &euro;8 million.  It is in a budgetary process whereby it is trying to pass on the cost through parking charges, increases in rent and so forth.  My point, which is a broader one, is that we still do not know the net impact across all the councils in this country and where this will leave them.</p></speech>

It is a very important part of Irish Wheelchair Association infrastructure that is available to wheelchair users throughout the country but it is to close imminently.  We all know the association is an important organisation and that it does excellent work, which we support.  It probably does not get enough resources but, that said, it did get &euro;40 million for the current year.  We should invite in representatives of the Irish Wheelchair Association and the relevant Department.  While the association is a section 39 organisation and is well within its right to decline the invitation, it might be happy to send representatives along to talk to us about the matter along with officials from the Department.  There are 48 jobs involved.  Apart from that, the infrastructure is unique.  It is a policy issue but we should be seeking to have more such infrastructure to facilitate those with disabilities rather than seeking to close one of the facilities we do have.</p></speech>

We can write to the HSE for a note on the compliance and service-level agreement it has with the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I am sure this must be covered in the agreement.  HSE representatives will be before us in three weeks.  I understand the health committee agreed yesterday to invite members of the Irish Wheelchair Association.  Can we double-check that?  The representatives should not have to appear before two committees on the same issue.  We will invite them if the health committee has not done so.  If that committee has already agreed to invite the representatives in, we will let them go to that committee.  We will not duplicate each other's work.  In the meantime, we will contact the HSE, the funding body, regarding its service-level agreement with the Irish Wheelchair Association.</p> <p>  There are only two sets of financial statements in front of us.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has a clear audit opinion and the Social Insurance Fund has a clear audit opinion.  Attention is drawn to Chapter 12, on the regularity of social welfare payments, which we discussed at length here last week.  I am formally noting the accounts we discussed last week.</p> <p>  On the work programme, there is no significant change.  We can keep it under review.  Is there any other business?</p></speech>

I saw on the eTenders website at the weekend that Irish Rail called for a consultancy to develop a commercial business case to secure support for the expansion of the DART.  I am not getting into policy areas.  The issue was announced about three times.  On the record of the D&aacute;il in 2015, there is a reference by the Minister to the then updated business case for July 2015, and now we are calling for another business case.  The public is quite rightly expecting that it concerns the expansion to Kildare, Drogheda and so on given the commuter crisis and rail-capacity crisis.</p> <p>  What are the rules?  How many business cases do we need?  It seems that the dogs on the street could pull the business case together.  We were talking about numbers of staff earlier.  If we are putting this out to tender, I presume it costs money.  I do not know whether it will be hundreds of thousands, millions or tens of thousands of euro, for what seems to be the third business case for the expansion.  With all the staff we have, and with the expense involved, are we really saying the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Irish Rail, the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland are so lacking in appropriate expertise that they cannot produce the business case for a DART extension?  I believe there is an administrative merry-go-round.  Everybody needs plausible deniability and no one is prepared to take a decision.  I can understand that regarding more spurious issues.  With the public services card, there was no business case.  We all had an issue with that.  When it comes to public transportation, however, we do not need much convincing that certain things are needed.  So many years on, we have just gone to tender for what appears to be the third business case.  Two issues arise in this regard.  Why do we need external consultants to produce a business case?  Why do we need a business case at all?  While I know I can be accused of being facetious from time to time, I fully understand that any Minister would want to secure value for money.  As we heard at a meeting of this committee, there were not too many business cases for reopening Stepaside Garda station, yet, while the DART extension is a much greater and more pressing issue, we are looking for the third business case, effectively six years after it was announced by the then CEO of Irish Rail, Mr. David Franks, as something Irish Rail intended to produce.  There is not a commuter in Ireland who could not write the business case pretty quickly.</p></speech>

We need to know the ingredient that is different.  There is reliance on the likes of the DART upgrade going ahead and on building capacity into treatment plants in regard to the zoning of land.</p><p>Many of these are interconnected.  For instance, headroom is needed if the DART is to be upgraded, which involves rebuilding bridges and so on.  All these components are important in understanding the timing.  What components are being examined and do they differ from the original proposal?  Is that detail part of a business case?  </p></speech>

We should consider how the business case is made for major infrastructure projects or their expansion and the documents that are examined by consultants.  Some weeks ago when Ms Anne Graham from the NTA was before the committee, I raised the flawed business case that was written in 2011 relating to the Navan rail line in my constituency.  Where are all the documents that they are examining?  They are lifting them from the senior planners in every county.  As Deputy Murphy noted, they are only looking at the development plans, projections for land zoned and so on.  Every senior planner in the country is writing the same document.  The senior planner in my county has written the business case for the extension of the train line that is required and I am sure that is the same everywhere, whether it is to address congestion in Galway or whatever.  These people are paid by the State in the first instance.  The duplication of this work is a waste of taxpayers' money.  I am frustrated that a senior planner is paid money to write something only for his or her work to be re-examined by a consultant who is paid out of the public purse by the NTA to just lift the planner's work, stick a cover on it and give it back to the authority.  It is bananas.  The people who are employed by the State in the first instance know the nuts and bolts.  What frustrates me even more is that some of the consultants come in and reject what the senior planner said originally.  Who do we trust more?  I trust the senior planner who is employed by the State and knows the nuts and bolts a damn sight more.  Deputy MacSharry's point about the processes that we go through to produce a document to put on a Minister's desk, who is prepared to make a decision and who is the fall guy if something goes wrong is pertinent.  It is worthy of much more discussion, perhaps when we consider the chapter on local government and State agencies again.  I fully endorse those points.</p></speech>

Perhaps circumstances are changing and there is a need for more planning or whatever but we have legislative powers.  Section 181(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 empowers the Minister to gazump the law in an emergency, but when is an emergency an emergency?  There is no doubt that if we want to continue to obsess about covering one's ass, for want of a better expression, we will never get anything done.  If a business case is done and a decision made, that is the leadership we look for from the Executive, yet we are going around in circles when it comes to commuters.  This does not even relate to my constituency but to that of Deputy Murphy and others.</p></speech>

We can also ask there but I think it is an issue of public expenditure.  This is going to cost money.  Let us ask the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport why agencies under its remit do not have the expertise to make a commercial business case.  If the answer is that they do not have the expertise, then there are recruitment problems and the HR policy approaches are wrong.  If someone does not know the commercial case for rail expansion and they work for the NTA or Irish Rail, those organisations are not fit for purpose.  The next question is: how many business cases are needed?  Someone will always take issue but someone needs to take a decision and say that they have the two or three quotes, that they are happy that this is what is needed and a decision will be taken to do it.</p> <p>  I do not know who will be Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport by the time any of these projects come to fruition if we continue along these line.</p></speech>

The associated expenditure is accounted for through Vote 22.  The 2018 appropriation account for the Vote records gross expenditure of &euro;135 million.  This is up marginally from &euro;133 million in 2017.  An analysis of the main components of the 2018 gross expenditure is provided in the figure now shown on the screen.  The largest element of spending is administration pay, amounting to &euro;52.5 million.  Salaries of judges are paid directly from the Central Fund of the Exchequer and not from the Vote.  These amounted to &euro;26.8 million in 2018.</p> <p>  The second largest area of Vote expenditure relates to charges levied under public private partnership, PPP, arrangements for the provision and operation of courthouses.  Expenditure in 2018 was &euro;35.8 million.  Note 2.8 to the appropriation account summarises the estimated overall cost of the PPP arrangements and the remaining financial commitments to be met over the life of the contracts.  At the end of 2018, these future commitments were estimated at &euro;758 million.</p> <p>  On the receipts side, appropriations-in-aid of the Vote totalled just over &euro;49.5 million in 2018.  More than 90% of this related to a range of fees charged in respect of legal documents lodged and services provided in court offices.</p> <p>  The net expenditure on the Vote was around &euro;4 million less than was provided in the 2018 Estimate.  The Courts Service got the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over &euro;2.5 million in unspent capital funding to 2019.  The balance of &euro;1.6 million was due for surrender at the year's end.  Funds held in trust by the courts and managed by the Judiciary do not form part of the appropriation account and are not within the remit of my audit.</p> <p>  In my report on the appropriation account for 2018 I drew attention to a material level of non-compliance with national procurement rules in respect of contracts operated by the Department during the year.  This is disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.</p></speech>

Overall the Vote was managed successfully and was within budget at year end.  A surrender balance of &euro;1,611,785 was recorded on the Vote.</p> <p>  The Courts Service is responsible for the management and administration of the courts.  As committee members are aware, the administration of justice is a matter for the Judiciary, and in accordance with the constitutional independence of the Judiciary and the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, it is outside the scope of the functions of the Courts Service.  The committee will appreciate that in my discussions today, I am therefore precluded from commenting on any matter relating to the exercise by a judge of his or her judicial functions or on any matter relating to the exercise of quasi-judicial functions by an officer of the court.  I am also, of course, precluded from commenting on matters of Government policy.</p> <p>  Since its establishment, the Courts Service has worked to ensure that the courts operate effectively and efficiently, the use of available resources is optimised, value for money is achieved and the best possible service is provided to court users.  In recent years the service, in common with other Departments and agencies, has seen a very welcome increase in funding and staff numbers.  Using the resources available to us, the Courts Service continues to work with the Judiciary to introduce a broad range of reforms that provide improved services to the citizen as well as yielding significant savings for the Exchequer while maintaining the constitutional right of access to justice.  The service has robust financial measures in place across the organisation to ensure that expenditure is kept to an absolute minimum and incurred only where it is necessary and unavoidable, and that value for money is achieved.</p> <p>  The Courts Service was established to support the courts in the administration of justice.  This is a unique role supporting the third branch of Government.  An effective courts system is critical to a functioning modern society, especially in these challenging times.  Like most public bodies, the key task for the Courts Service is to continue to meet the expectations of all stakeholders and to deliver efficient services in a timely fashion.  In addition to the change and diversity in the economic, social, demographic and cultural landscape, we have also seen very significant challenges from advances in technology that have positive and negative impacts on the efficiency of the courts system.  Allied challenges arise from increasing levels of litigation and increased complexity in legislation, both of which are outside of the control of the courts but to which the service must respond.  The Courts Service has had a modernising agenda since its establishment in 1999.  Very significant performance and efficiency improvements have been achieved since the last time the service was before the committee in 2017.  I will now outline the most significant of these.</p> <p>  First, I refer to regional courthouse projects, which constitute a public private partnership bundle.  The project to construct or refurbish seven regional courthouses was completed in 2018.  Forming part of the Government&rsquo;s infrastructure and capital investment plan 2016-2021, it was the largest courthouse building project undertaken outside of Dublin in the history of the State.  The project saw the construction of four new courthouses in Drogheda, Letterkenny, Limerick, and Wexford and substantial refurbishment and extension works to existing courthouses in Mullingar, Waterford, and Cork.  The courthouses were delivered as public private partnership projects.  Finance was arranged through the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, with payments to be made by the service over a period of 25 years.  The seven-courthouse project delivered in excess of 36,000 sq. m of accommodation, including 31 courtrooms and all relevant support facilities, including consultation rooms, victim support facilities, holding cells and court offices.</p> <p>  The courts office review implementation was a major review in 2017 of Circuit Court and District Court combined office structures.  It included recommendations to improve and better support the service delivery framework and operational model in provincial court offices.  The first 18-month phase has focused on taking work out of court offices and enhancing the support available to them through the implementation of eight projects.  The eight projects involve centralising jury summons administration, such as printing, posting and enveloping; centralising the service of foreign documents under EU regulations; electronic transfer of non-Garda summons; developing clear and consistent parameters for customer service; introducing a new management structure in offices; supporting succession planning; supporting technical training; and developing a more reactive and transparent resource allocation model.  Work to deliver on these projects commenced during 2018 and an office has now been established in Castlebar to deal centrally with the service of foreign documents under EU regulations and the administration of jury summonses using the printing and enveloping facilities of the Revenue Commissioners.  The centralisation of tasks will result in significant efficiencies, achieving economies of scale, consistency in service delivery, automation of tasks currently carried out manually, and the redeployment of court staff to other customer service tasks.  A new management structure was piloted in several offices in 2018 with arrangements in place to extend it to all provincial court offices in 2019.  A new customer charter, together with clearer and consistent parameters for customer service delivery in combined court offices, is also now ready to be launched.</p> <p>  Inter-agency work has also taken place for the benefit of citizens.  The service continued to work in partnership with other agencies and NGOs to deliver enhanced services for the benefit of courts users.  Among those that are of significant benefit are arrangements for courts users with mortgage arrears.</p><p>The service facilitates the work of Abhaile, a scheme to help homeowners find a resolution to their home mortgage arrears.  It also facilitates staff of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and duty solicitors who may attend Circuit Court hearings either before the county registrar or a judge of the Circuit Court.</p><p> In the area of family mediation, the service continued to work with the Legal Aid Board to increase access to mediation services in family law offices of the District Court.  A project in Dublin District Family Court in Dolphin House resulted in an increase in the number of information sessions per mediator per week.  A similar service continued to be provided in Clonmel, Cork, Dundalk, Ennis, Naas, Nenagh and Limerick.  Efforts continued to extend the service to other court office locations around the country.  Arrangements have also been put in place for victims of domestic violence in partnership with local non-governmental organisations in 18 locations nationwide.  The service facilitates support and referral services for people appearing in the family law courts.</p><p> Part 10 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 provides for the establishment of the new Office of the Legal Cost Adjudicators of the High Court, which has replaced the Office of the Taxing Master.  It will also provide greater transparency in legal costs awarded by the legal cost adjudicators with additional governance arrangements.  Work has been ongoing over the past two years to prepare for the establishment of the office and the transition from the current Taxing Master regime.  The legislation was commenced on 7 October 2019 and two of the three legal cost adjudicators have been appointed.  The Courts Service has put in place arrangements to support the operation of the office.  These include the assignment of additional staff members to the office, a new online information and communications technology application process and the refurbishment work to the office to accommodate additional sittings and other requirements, which was completed in 2018.</p><p> The Probate Office review assessed the current probate service in terms of its rules, legislation and structures with a view to improving delivery to the next-of-kin of deceased persons.  Implementation of the recommendations of the review commenced in 2018 and included improvements to existing business processes which at the end of the year resulted in significantly reduced waiting times for probate applications.  A new simplified fees structure will be launched later in the year, which will make the application process easier for all court users.</p><p> The service has developed an online system for the management and administration of licensing applications to the Circuit Court and District Court.  The system will provide for electronic filing of applications, including electronic payment of fees and an electronic register.  The roll-out for online use by solicitors is continuing and five offices in counties Louth, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim can now complete their applications online.  Data show that between 1 July and the end of September 2019, 32% of applications in those counties were made using the new system.  An information and communications strategy for solicitors is under way, involving seminars, posters and information on the Courts Service website.  A project to provide for online applications for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was completed in 2019.</p><p> I will now speak to the national development plan for the period 2018 to 2027.  A number of proposed courthouse developments were included in the Government&rsquo;s national development plan, which was published in February 2018.  These include further new or refurbished courthouses in regional cities and county towns where facilities remain substandard, including Galway city, Wicklow town, Portlaoise, Tralee and Roscommon, as well as further provincial locations such as An Cloch&aacute;n Liath in Dungloe to serve as the Gaeltacht court for the region and Tuam.  They also include the family law and children court complex in Dublin, followed by the redevelopment of the Four Courts as a campus for civil courts; the construction of standard county town-type court facilities at several locations in County Dublin and in north Kildare, Bray and Navan; and regional family law centres.  The precise allocation and timing of additional funding over the ten-year period of the national development plan remains to be fully determined.  The outcome of further detailed planning and analysis of costs will determine the prioritisation of projects.</p><p> In addition to the provision of new and refurbished court buildings, the Courts Service is also responsible for ensuring that court accommodation is maintained to an appropriate standard which meets the needs of court users and protects the architectural integrity of our historic courthouses.  In 2018, a contract was awarded to AECOM Ireland to conduct a nationwide condition survey of court buildings.  As well as detailing the condition of each building, the report also sets out a 20-year planned preventative maintenance costing for each building on a year-by-year basis.  It is anticipated that all surveys will be complete by the end of quarter one in 2020 and once all surveys are completed, the results will enable the Courts Service to make some key decisions about how best to provide for the maintenance of court buildings into the future.</p><p> In the area of reform, the Courts Service is extremely appreciative of the continued support from the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Oireachtas for the resources it makes available to support the continued operation of the courts system.  Having an effective courts system is a key component of a well-functioning modern society and will be essential in meeting future economic challenges.  We recognise that enhancing and reforming our processes and procedures can make an important contribution.  We can point to our track record of investment in ICT as evidence of our commitment to the improvement of services.  In particular, the implementation of our ICT programme over the past two years has resulted in the optimisation of courtroom and court support technology, including the roll-out of digital audio recording to all court jurisdictions and venues and extended use of video link and video conferencing, which has resulted in significant efficiencies across the justice sector.  Court-generated financial transactions valued at approximately &euro;1.8 billion have been transformed and centralised in a shared service centre utilising modern financial accounting technology.  The development of case management and e-filing projects have been mentioned.</p><p> The funding provided in recent years for investment in ICT has allowed the Courts Service to continue its programme of maintenance and development of our ICT infrastructure, as well as driving the implementation of new software for the benefit of staff, judges and courts users.  However, like many organisations, the Courts Service cannot afford to stand still.  The increased use of technology is key to meeting the challenge of maintaining services to the Judiciary, staff, the legal profession and the public, and to meet legislative requirements and the demand for additional eGovernment and online services.  We recognise that ICT is the enabler of modernisation and reform initiatives, supporting increased interaction with other justice agencies and Departments and providing improved customer service.  Significant benefits have already been achieved through the ICT projects already in place for a range of stakeholders, including savings for the Exchequer and better service to court users.  The Courts Service's ICT strategy has charted the course for the maintenance of infrastructure, delivery of online services and the development of courtroom technology for the past three years.</p><p> A major challenge in the implementation of the strategy continues to be projects that require to be given priority over those outlined in the strategy.  In 2019, with the assistance of KPMG, a new plan for an ICT operating model was developed and it is being prioritised for resourcing.  At the same time, a new long-term strategy for the delivery of Courts services for the next ten years has been developed and consultations with key stakeholders will commence shortly on its implementation.</p><p> It is critical that the Courts Service has the capabilities and operating model to continue its reform agenda, meet the challenges we are facing and capitalise on opportunities as they arise.  In keeping with the renewed focus at government level on key reforms in the Department of  Justice and Equality and in the civil and wider public sectors, the Courts Service continues to take a co-ordinated and focused approach to the implementation of change in the organisation.  To this end, the Courts Service has recently established a strategy and reform directorate to provide leadership in the definition of the systemic change necessary to deliver tangible change to courts users.  The recruitment of a chief information officer to lead the ICT function is also essential to enable the service to meet the challenges of the future.</p><p> Our strategic plan for 2018 to 2020 sets out the strategic priorities and objectives of the Courts Service.  It was designed to ensure that we can continue to deliver effectively on our key legislative mandates over the period of the plan.  Significant progress is being made in the review and reform of our structures and service delivery with a focus on maximising the use of technology and rationalising processes.  My role as chief executive officer is to ensure that the Courts Service supports access to justice for citizens and delivers improved value for money for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

When the site was acquired by the Office of Public Works, OPW, drawings were done to maximise its use.  They included a complex of 21 or 22 family law court rooms, the children's court and facilities for the Supreme Court.  Those plans came in at &euro;141 million.  Currently, the Department of Justice and Equality has an envelope for PPP projects of &euro;150 million.  Of that, &euro;80 million has been allocated to the Courts Service and &euro;70 million has been allocated to the Garda for three Garda stations.  We asked the OPW to redraw the plans for Hammond Lane using &euro;80 million only.  The first drawing that came back provided for 12 or 13 family law court rooms.  The Courts Service board rejected that earlier this year.  Subsequently, the Department asked us in late July to include the children's court in the &euro;80 million.  At the last Courts Service buildings committee and board meeting, the drawings came back to us from the OPW.  They would accommodate between eight and ten court rooms, including the children's court, for &euro;80 million.  The Courts Service board considered that that would not be good value or accommodate our current requirement for family law court rooms in Dublin.</p> <p>  Since we own various other properties around Dublin, we have now asked the OPW to see whether if, in the balance of the Courts Service's estate, the children's court could be accommodated somewhere else and to give us a price as to how much a renovated building would cost.  We have also asked it to see what we could do with Hammond Lane for the &euro;80 million, given that we have a number of other priorities.  For example, the lease on our headquarters at Phoenix House will be up shortly and the staff located there will have to be accommodated somewhere else.</p> <p>  We would like to maximise Hammond Lane for the purposes of family law.  To say that family law facilities in Dublin are appalling is not an overstatement.  We would like to do our best for family law users.  That is our priority.  We have a building in Smithfield and own the old traffic court building next to it.  We are trying to see whether we can do something with those two in terms of the children's court.</p> <p>  This matter will come back to the next board meeting in December.  I hope that the OPW will revert to us in the meantime.  It is our intention to proceed with a family law building on Hammond Lane.  The difference between us and the Department is the &euro;80 million as opposed to the &euro;141 million that would develop the entire site.</p></speech>

According to the then Minister in 2015, the price was going to be &euro;40 million.  Did the board move the goalposts or did the Government decide that it needed more or less out of the site?  I am interested in knowing whether additional demands were made of the Courts Service to do a bigger, better and wider job.  How did the figure go from &euro;40 million to the approximately &euro;140 million in four years, notwithstanding the precedent of the national children's hospital where the price has risen much more quickly?</p></speech>

One of the purposes of the Act was to put in place a regime for people who could not pay fines.  Prior to this, people who could not pay small fines such as those relating to their television licences were imprisoned for a short time, often leading to a revolving-door situation with other prisoners having to be released to accommodate them.  If a fine was not paid within the default period, it would be re-entered by way of a fines notice, the matter would come back before a court and a District Court judge would decide how the matter would be dealt with.  Various orders were available to the judge, such as making an attachment order, requiring community service, making a recovery order or, ultimately, imprisonment.  The policy of the Department was to deflect people who could not pay small fines away from entering the prison regime.  The working out of the Act has not been exactly as envisaged by the Department and it has meant the Act has not operated as it should.  Accordingly, the payment of fines to the Exchequer has reduced considerably.</p></speech>

It requires a fine to be levied, the fines notice to go unpaid, a fines enforcement notice to be served and then for a person to reappear before the court.  This takes a period of time.  We have found that large numbers of people do not appear before the courts.  Up to one third of defendants do not appear before the courts for a second appearance.  It is for this reason bench warrants are issued.  Those bench warrants must then be executed by the Garda to bring people back to the system.  It is fair to say this is one of the reason the Fines Act does not operate in the manner envisaged.</p> <p>  Earlier this year, the law was clarified with regard to the traditional prosecutor being in court.  Traditionally, a garda in court was the prosecutor and it was that garda who made the application for a bench warrant.  Because there was no garda present, certain judges took the view they should not issue a bench warrant, as there would be no application.  There was a case stated to the High Court on the matter and it was clarified in May this year that there is no necessity to have a prosecutor in court and that the appropriate order is not to strike out the matter if the prosecutor is there.  This is another reason the Fines Act-----</p></speech>

It is fair to say the number of these appearances before judges has been a lot lower.  None of the default provisions can kick in until there has been an appearance and they have not appeared.</p></speech>

It directed the Chief Justice to write to the Minister for Justice and Equality in January, which he did, outlining that the Fines Act was not operating in the manner envisaged.  It is fair to say the Department responded to this moderately quickly and set up a high-level working group.

The Chief Justice was in contact with the Minister in March and straight away, we established a high-level working group which involves the Department, the Courts Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, prisons, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General and the Probation Service.  It is useful to look briefly at its terms of reference.  We are looking at-----</p></speech>

We are trying to preserve the policy of minimal committals because in the past, we have seen people go to jail for not paying fines and then being let out after two days.  The idea is to find an effective way of observing this while, at the same time, maximising the effectiveness of the alternative sanctions available to the courts in cases of default and, overall, ensuring the integrity of the criminal justice process at this level is maintained.  The group is meeting and, as has been indicated, there will be areas, such as the legislation, that can be tightened up.  This is one of the solutions being considered.</p></speech>

The levels of fines are consistent and across the Revenue Commissioners and the fines and fees that are applied we were taking in &euro;7.2 million and we are now taking in &euro;5.7 million.  We were taking in &euro;11.2 million and we now take in &euro;6.9 million.  A total of 33.33% of our fines are not being paid.  The witnesses are telling me the reason was to keep people out of prison and not put people in jail or send them to Castlerea.</p></speech>

While the intentions were brilliant, it has not worked.  Why is the default position not to revert back to what it was before rather than have a high-level group and - I love this line - an administrative merry-go-round whereby in about six years' time, we will have it all figured out and at that stage cumulatively one third of the money that was due to the State will not have paid.  This is money we used to collect very efficiently back in 2014 but since we legislated for it, we are incapable of doing this.  I would love to know who is to blame and if it is the Minister or the Government of the day we will take it up with them.</p></speech>

I accept that use of the poor box is at the discretion of judges, but the court in Ennis accounted for &euro;3,750 while the court in Tralee accounted for almost &euro;500,000.  A court in a small rural area is allocating more than the court in Tallaght, which is in the Dublin metropolitan region.  That would look highly unusual to a person with an audit background.  It is a matter I would have expected to be escalated to the highest level of the organisation.</p></speech>

The criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill proposed to abolish the court poor box and replace it with a statutory reparation fund.</p><p>It is fair to say that we would welcome that.

Based on good audit practice, if any one individual is directing control over where a fund should go, there is no connected-persons assessments of where it should go.  There is no risk assessment carried out in terms of the funds.  That is a gaping hole in terms of the management and operation of the process.</p></speech>

In 2011, 2012 and 2013 only 6% to 7% of those disqualified through the courts handed back their licences.  In response to a parliamentary question, the CEO of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, advised that the RSA and the Courts Service were engaged in an exercise to reconcile data that involves managing and matching information between the Courts Service and persons identified in the courts against the consequential record in the National Vehicle Driver File.  The RSA anticipated that this exercise would be completed by mid-January 2019.  Has the Courts Service completed that body of work with the RSA?  Are these figures accurate?</p></speech>

I think it is important to point out that one of the reasons the data between the RSA and us does not always exactly match is that it is a moving target.  People appeal their cases and cases are heard.  We measure the court order that is made.  There is a 14-day period in which that order can be appealed.  The RSA measures the actual disqualifications and clearly disqualifications can be higher because people can get penalty points that combined go over 12.  So, there will never be an exact match between the two.</p></speech>

However, when the rate is only 6% or 7% it indicates that for some of the years on foot of a District Court order to surrender their licence, only 6% of those people actually surrendered their licence.  While there can be some overlap with individuals reaching the threshold of penalty points and there can be issues under appeal or adjudication, the figure should not be that low.</p></speech>

In 2018 after the change in legislation, it went up to 13%.  Those figures are a long way off one third of people.  There is a serious contradiction in the figures and Mr. Mullan is saying there is only a 1% variance.</p></speech>

The fact is that a District Court judge issues an order that someone has to surrender their licence.  We should be able to measure exactly what is handed in on that day and exactly what is not.  It is the job of the Courts Service to ensure that we have the data to enable us to make decisions and legislative change if that is required.</p><p>I have major concerns in three instances, namely, the poor box, the collection rate of fines and the issue of disqualified drivers' licences.</p></speech>

We are witnessing a shambles.  The performance that is being televised live is a shambles.  It is probably undermining the administration of justice in the country.  The message here is that most people do not pay fines or hand in their driver's licence.  Ms Denning does not know who does or does not, or whether they have their licences in court or not.  Some of them do not show up.  She does not know whether they were even licensed drivers to start with.  If I was a criminal, I would say that the system is broken and let us ignore it.  Ms Denning is new in the job.  Something is radically wrong here.  I have been here weekly for a long time.  I have never seen such confusion and people not knowing what is going on with regard to who is in or out of court, with people and garda&iacute; being here and there.  An awful impression is being given today of how the Courts Service works and that is not good.</p></speech>

She is making a differentiation between the Courts Service and the Exchequer but I am afraid that we will not make that differentiation.  This is because Ms Denning will be looking for the Exchequer to fund, for example, the refurbishment of courthouses and so on and that is part of where the money comes from.  It strikes me that we are here again with a topic that arises weekly with various Departments and agencies.  We do things backwards.  We create the problem and then go back to try to fix it.  Instead of doing the proper regulatory impact assessment to begin with, it looks like there is a four-stage process for the fine from the Courts Service's perspective but nobody has ownership of it after that, whereas somebody did before, with a garda following up on it.  Does Ms Denning have immediate solutions?</p></speech>

If we deal with it as a public private partnership, PPP, it will stay in the ownership of the OPW, we will pay the unitary charge and then ownership will transfer to the Courts Service once the 25 years of payments are concluded.  However, if it is built as a traditional build, it would stay in the ownership of the OPW, which would build it while we would pay for it.</p></speech>

These were all historic buildings and the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, advised us that we should retain the risk for latent defects in order that we would have a good tender and in order that the prices would come in at a reasonable level.  If the developers took on that risk, the tender prices would be significantly higher.  When the buildings were completed, a number of claims were submitted for latent defects.  The NDFA dealt with those.  Out of 14 categories of claim, only three were allowed, and that claim was settled for &euro;8.9 million to be paid over three years.  That is additional to the tender price.  That said, we saved in excess of &euro;5 million because of the timing of the delivery of the courthouses, so it represents an additional &euro;3.9 million to be paid over three years.</p><p>That is to deal with things like what happened in Mullingar when they took casings off the walls and discovered that there was a structural problem.</p></speech>

I know, for example, that Kilcock courthouse will be closed permanently.  It is for the service to consider and recommend what is needed for the future.  How many buildings are under active consideration for closure outside the ones that have been refurbished and for which there is a different strategy?</p></speech>

The Courts Service board has decided that priority will be given to county town venues which will all be refurbished.  The next question that arises is that if a significant amount of money is spent in refurbishing a county town venue, does one then need three or four smaller District Court venues in the same county.  There is a broad spectrum of criteria used by the board.  Recently, we had work done by consultants in looking at the demographics, geographical locations, the distance between courthouses, the availability of cells, the condition of courthouses, courthouse ownership, the caseload in a particular area, security, health and safety issues and the capital cost of refurbishing a courthouse.  All of these are taken into consideration before a decision is made to either close or refurbish a venue.</p></speech>

In conjunction with the Office of Public Works, we had a reactive maintenance programme such that where something went wrong, we fixed it.  For example, in recent times a ceiling collapsed in a courthouse, but we would prefer if things did not reach that stage.  The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted this issue in an earlier report as presenting a risk.  We have taken it on board and asked the contractors to look at courthouses throughout the country.  It will be done in quarter one of 2020.  In the case of one courthouse that I thought was in pretty good shape, it will cost about &euro;4.5 million to undertake works which will mainly involve the mechanics and electrics, as well as work to the roof.</p></speech>

In simplistic terms we could take a figure of 1,000 people coming before the court and presenting their licences, with 334 doing so and 666 not doing so.

Until recently I was a member of the criminal justice working group looking at the fixed charge notice system.  Certainly one of the elements being worked on by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is a master licence record project whereby driver licences would be matched to registration numbers of vehicles.  The reliance in the system for the person to produce the licence will, I hope, in the near future be at an end.  Whether a person attends court or does not, the aim would be that as close to 100% of cases as possible would be matched.  At this time we are completely reliant on the individual bringing his or her licence to court and producing it at the required time.  If the person leaves before the case is dealt with and without producing the licence, we provide the data as best we can to the Road Safety Authority to match the licence to the penalty imposed.</p></speech>

There is also a cost to getting to that point in the first place.  I imagine in the vast majority, if not all cases, a garda would have stopped an individual because of a road traffic offence.  There is a cost to the taxpayer to get to the point where somebody is given a fine in the first place.  The taxpayer would hope that the administration of justice would be done and the law would be acted upon but that does not seem to be the case.  The witnesses spoke earlier about why this happening.  One of the reasons given was a shortage of judges.  Am I wrong in saying that?</p></speech>

The shortage of judges would arise in the event that we would list all 80,000 or 90,000 fines notices at the same time.  We do not have a shortage of judges aside from when we replace retired judges etc.  We are short one judge in the District Court now.</p></speech>

The footprint of Dolphin House in Dublin simply is not large enough for the number of people who use it every day, and which leads to overcrowding and cramped conditions.  When people who do not get on with each other have to sit in close proximity to each other it aggravates the problems.  The building is not fit for the throughput of traffic and the type of work it has to deal with.</p></speech>

At a broader strategic level we are establishing a family justice oversight group under a deputy Secretary General in the Department to look at reform in the family courts and the scheme of a new family law Bill.

The system seems to have an aversion to building a review into legislation and where it is built in, it is in a very limited manner.  If provision for an operational review had been built into the Fines Act, it would have sorted out matters very quickly.  Mr. Fallon said the Department had spotted a problem, but it did not act and the Courts Service has been left with egg on its face, which is not really fair to it because it is legislation it is trying to operate.  There are two elements - the D&aacute;il which passed the legislation but did not see the lacunae and the Department of Justice and Equality in the review of its operation.  Is there not a lesson to be learned that legislation should be reviewed more frequently and efficiently?</p></speech>

I was involved in the processing of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  It contains a specific section which requires a review of its operation to be carried out every three years.  That this should be the case is something we can roll into legislation as a matter of principle.  We also have a new mechanism to carry out periodic critical reviews of various States bodies and related legislation to see if the legislation is being operated in the way it should be.  That is a major component.</p></speech>

There is a very good provision included in that Act to provide assistance for victims of sexual or gender violence, but nobody is availing of it.  The figures are extremely low.  I think there was just one case in 2018, although I will not give further figures as I do not have precise figures.  However, there is almost no take-up, with just one or two people availing of it.  Although it is very good in theory, nobody has reviewed the legislation which dates from 1995.  It concerns access to justice and goes back to reason representatives of the Courts Service are before us, namely, to examine the efficient running of the system and legislation operated.  The Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 is a very good one in theory, but its operation has not been reviewed.  There has been little or no uptake of the provision that allows victims to receive legal aid in a case of rape or a limited number of other cases.</p></speech>

We use a mix of mechanisms in that regard.  Some cases are heard bilingually and the proceedings translated, depending on who is present in the courtroom.  We provide jury explanatory leaflets in Irish.  We also provide court orders and written judgements as Gaeilge.  We provide translation and interpretation services for any party.</p></speech>

A director was appointed in 2017.  There is a high-level steering group that is driving the initiative.  It involves representatives of the Department of Health and our Department.  Work is continuing to recruit the necessary staff resources, install IT systems and so on.  Research work was done in developing a code of practice for use in implementation of the advance healthcare directive.  The director of the Decision Support Service has conducted work which has included organisational design, a scoping of the service, project governance, defining the regulatory framework, stakeholder engagement, the mapping of customer services and processes.  There is quite a bit of work to be done, having regard to the group the system will benefit.  The Department funded researchers in the development of codes of practice under section 103.  The Minister for Health has a multidisciplinary working group which is assisting in the development of the code of practice for the advance healthcare directive provisions which he will be commencing under Part 8 of the Act.

The case in question was thrown out of court and it is reported that up to 28,000 other cases may be affected by the ruling.  What effect will that have on the Courts Service?  This raises an important issue.  It has been reported that prior to the introduction of that legislation, in upwards of 80% of cases brought before the courts the defence used was that the accused had not received a fixed charge notice.  I do not know if that figure is correct and I ask our guests to correct it, if necessary.  What effect will the October ruling have on the Courts Service?</p></speech>

Fixed charge notices are served by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that is where the issue arises.  I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is looking at the legal issues involved.  It is a matter for the force to decide whether to appeal.  When the matter arrives in court, it becomes an issue if the person claims that he or she has not received the fixed charge notice.  That then becomes part of his or her legal defence and it is a matter for the judge to decide whether to accept that defence.  The ruling could give rise to some quite significant issues.</p></speech>

It is the responsibility of garda&iacute; to issue fixed charge notices.  Reference was made earlier to the setting up of a high level committee to address various issues.  Has the Courts Service ever flagged this issue with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Department?  The numbers are significant and if this legislation is unconstitutional then the problem is not going to go away any time soon.  Has the Courts Service flagged this issue?</p></speech>

The group is co-chaired by the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Justice and Equality and is looking at a lot of road traffic issues, including this particular one.  It is fair to say that some of these problems have been with us for some time.  Some of the solutions will require interventions from both Departments and from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are issues around the service of documents.  The issue regarding the constitutionality of the legislation is a matter upon which the court has just decided.  That is a new matter.  Up until six weeks ago, the law was constitutional; now it appears to be unconstitutional and that will have to be dealt with by the Oireachtas unless the decision is appealed.</p></speech>

It took thousands of people out of court that previously, under old regimes, would have been summonsed to court.  My colleague, Mr. Mullan, is correct.  The decision has just been handed down by the High Court.  It is a question for the State in the form of the police to decide whether to appeal the decision.  Certainly from our point of view, we would not welcome a situation where all of those cases would immediately come in as summonses.  The more cases of this nature that are kept out of court, the better in terms of the overall efficiency of the system.  The group that oversees the penalty point system met the week before last.  I understand that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is advising An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the matter of an appeal.  The issue is being taken very seriously.  There are timeframes within which the State has to decide whether to appeal the High Court decision.  That is the best information I have on where that stands.</p></speech>

A full 80% of persons detected as having committed a relevant motoring offence avail of the first two options under the fixed charge notice.  In fact, the vast majority of persons actually pay the fixed charge.  The remaining 20% are the ones that end up in court and a subset of them claim that they have not received the notice.  To clarify, 80% of the recipients of fixed charge notices pay the penalty and do not come into our system.  The vast majority pay the fixed charge.</p></speech>

It was reported last month that one quarter of drivers detected using their mobile phones while driving did not receive summonses and of the cases that made it to court, only half resulted in convictions.  Given that cases were brought before the courts, one would imagine that evidence was presented by garda&iacute; who saw drivers on their phones.  In that context, I am curious as to why only half of those brought before the court were convicted.</p></speech>

Our statutory mandate is to manage the courts and provide support services for the Judiciary.  I am not sure it would be within our statutory mandate.  The obvious example is that if prosecutions were unsuccessful, it would be An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that would record the information.  The data and the reasons should be recorded.</p></speech>

The information is being recorded on the spot on the day .  The inspector knows the reason offered and the judge&rsquo;s decision.  The raw material is available.  The prosecution team cannot walk out of the courtroom without knowing why a case has been struck out.  I should not have to spell it out because it is so basic.  It cannot be the case that the information is not noted.  The system would not work if the prosecution team was walking out of the courtroom without a reason being noted as to why a case had been struck out.  It is obvious that it is recorded manually in a file.  Somewhere along the line will somebody think about recording it, even on a sample basis?  Will they try to get an accurate read on the reasons cases had been struck out?  Perhaps then something might be done about it.</p></speech>

It is hard to credit this issue is still ongoing and that the different services have not got their act together.  It beggars belief that a simple matter of collating data that would provide useful information and result in co-ordination between all of the services involved is still ongoing.  It is laughable that there is not this co-ordination.  It flags everything that was said.  It all relates back to co-ordination, the collating of information and where the legislation stands.  I have always said there is a need for the consolidation of the road traffic laws because they are in an absolute mess.  Adding little bits here and there without consolidation is causing many of the problems experienced.  Hearing that work is ongoing aand that the Department is only thinking about it at this stage is not good.  If the work had been done, we would not have half of these problems.</p> <p>  On the statement on accounting policies and principles, in appendix A on page 25 eight courthouses are listed, in respect of seven of which there were public private partnerships.

The only mechanism available for several years to provide that accommodation has been the PPP mechanism because of the funding position.  In July 2012 the Government announced a &euro;2.25 billion infrastructure stimulus programme, of which the seven courthouse PPP bundle was part.  The Criminal Courts of Justice building will be ten years old this weekend.  It was built as part of a PPP.  From our perspective, we do not have maintenance issues with PPP buildings.  When we take ownership of the buildings in 25 years&rsquo; time, they will be as new because of a preventive maintenance programme.  That has been proved to date.  The Criminal Courts of Justice building is ten years old and it looks exactly the same as it did on the day we moved into it.  All of the costs are included in the unitary charge, which is a significant bonus for us as it meant that we do not have to employ maintenance staff, go to tender in carrying out repair works and so forth.  That is why PPPs were used in building those courthouses, but we are not wedded to the idea of having PPPs.  Whatever central government policy is at the time, we will go with it.</p></speech>

We have an opinion from the Attorney General, which is in legislation, to the effect that the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General does not include the audit of court funds.  Insofar as I account for what I do, it is in respect of the infrastructure we have put in place to manage the funds.  Ultimately, they are not subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That restricts the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit the funds.  Insofar as I have been, hopefully, of some help to the committee over the years, it is to explain how the role has been discharged to support the Judiciary.</p></speech>

Moneys are paid into the courts, such as for wards of court, which is a big issue.  Coincidentally, it was a recurring matter at the State Claims Agency, which told us the majority of its payments every year are to the Courts Service.

We asked the agency, therefore, what proportion of the payments it makes is to the Courts Service.  It was able to produce the figure because it knows where its payments go.  It is understandably a high figure.  It includes cases from private insurance companies, perhaps as a result of accidents and so on.  Given that it is the responsibility of the Judiciary, there is separation between it and the Oireachtas, which is why the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot examine the figures.  Am I correct?</p></speech>

I pay for them but they report primarily to the President of the High Court because they provide solicitor services to the office of wards of court.  For example, if a ward of court is an elderly person and there is a dispute within the family, and if there is nobody within the family to act as the committee for the ward, the general solicitor may be appointed as the committee for the ward to act in his or her best interests.  In other circumstances, such as where a ward of court has property that needs to be sold, the general solicitor will do the conveyancing and so on.  The general solicitor acts as the solicitor on behalf of wards of court, in the main.</p></speech>

We could refurbish the existing courthouse, which is the middle of the town.  I do not think it will be possible to provide a full range of services if we do that.  We are looking at acquiring an adjacent town centre site.  Again, we do not think we can get a site at a price that is good value for money for the taxpayer, which is a difficulty.  We could build a new courthouse outside the town.</p><p>The Department of Defence has a site at Ballymullen, which has been considered.  Alternatively, Kerry County Council has a town centre site known as the Island of Geese, which is our preferred option.  The council is developing a master plan for the site and we have sought another meeting with it in order to progress that further.  We bought the courthouse in Roscommon from the council last year or the year before along with an extra plot of land.  </p></speech>

The courthouse in Roscommon is part of the public private partnership bundle.  Part of the ceiling in the jury room recently collapsed.  We had asked the OPW to look at the mechanical and electrical systems in the building.  We thought the renovation would cost approximately &euro;350,000 overall but it will cost a minimum of &euro;450,000 just to upgrade the electrical system.  We have a contingency plan in place such that if there is a further problem with the building, as an emergency measure we will move courts to Castlerea and Carrick-on-Shannon.  We are in discussion with local users to see whether we can keep the court business in the town in the medium term when we close the courthouse next March for refurbishment.  If another ceiling collapses or something else happens in the morning, we have an emergency contingency plan in place.</p></speech>

I have completed my questions.  I thank the witnesses from the Courts Service and the Departments of Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform for their attendance.  I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his officials.  It is agreed that the clerk will seek any follow-up information and carry out any agreed instruction arising from the meeting.  There is information outstanding.</p> <p>  Our next public meeting will be on Thursday, 21 November 2020.  There will be two sessions, the first dealing with the financial statements for 2018 of the Charities Regulator and the second involving a meeting with representatives of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2018 report on greenhouse gas and carbon taxation.  That follows on from our meeting with representatives of the Central Statistics Office and the Economic and Social Research Institute.</p></speech>
