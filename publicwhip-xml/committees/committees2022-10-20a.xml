Apologies have been received from Deputy Matt Carthy.</p> <p>  If attendees are contributing from within the committee room, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members of the committee who are attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of the Parliament.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the place the Parliament has chosen to sit.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Paul Southern, deputy director of audit, from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to examine the following matters from the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Account of the Public Services 2021: Chapter 3 - Vote accounting and budget management; Chapter 4 - the reallocation of voted funding; the format and content of the appropriation accounts; and the value for money and spending reviews.</p> <p>  The Department has also been advised that correspondence concerning the following may also be raised: the closure of the Benefacts database; the National Maternity Hospital; and a recent minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which is the official response to the recommendations in the committee&rsquo;s report.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the Department: Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General and Accounting Officer; Mr. John Kinnane, assistant secretary, expenditure policy division; Ms Niamh Callaghan, principal officer, expenditure policy division; and Mr. David Feeney, principal officer, corporate office.  You are all very welcome.  I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards reference that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means the witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#A00600"><p>As members are aware, central government Departments and offices deliver or oversee a wide range of public services.  Expenditure required in relation to those services is provided for each year under a number of voted Estimates approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  If circumstances require, additional funding can be provided through Supplementary Estimates.  Ultimately, the voted provisions are given legal effect in an annual Appropriation Act.</p> <p>  The Accounting Officer for each voted service is required to prepare an annual appropriation account within three months of the end of the calendar year.  This must conform to the reporting requirements set out in the relevant appropriation account circular issued each year by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The accounts are prepared on a cash basis, which means they report the actual cash transactions of the Votes in the year.  Some additional accrual-based information is also provided, in notes 1 and 2 to the accounts.  The accrual basis is the standard method for accounting.  Broadly, it aims to report the true costs of an economic activity in the period of account, and the value of any related assets and liabilities at the end of the period.</p> <p>  The Department determines the framework and basis of accounting for annual financial reporting by all public bodies.  In addition to the accounts circular and other guidance set out in Public Financial Procedures, the Department has issued the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, and the Public Spending Code.  Collectively, these represent the specific public sector standards and expectations against which my office carries out the audits of the accounts and financial statements of the bodies within my remit.</p><p> Chapter 3 deals with Vote accounting and budget management in the aggregate.  The chapter aggregates and summarises the results of all 45 appropriation accounts for 2021.  My office compiles this report each year because there is no other published source of aggregated appropriation account information.</p><p> The Appropriation Act 2021 provided for spending on voted services totalling &euro;76 billion.  This was to be funded by the issuing of up to &euro;73.1 billion from the Central Fund of the Exchequer and the use of certain expected Vote receipts, referred to as appropriations-in-aid, of up to &euro;2.9 billion.  In addition, unused capital funding totalling &euro;710 million was carried over from 2020 for spending in 2021, bringing the total available Vote funding to &euro;76.7 billion.</p><p> A Department or office may not spend more than is legally provided for a Vote.  In 2021, total gross expenditure for all 45 Votes amounted to &euro;74.5 billion.  The aggregate surplus for the year was almost &euro;2.5 billion.  Some &euro;819 million of the surplus was approved for carryover to 2022 and the remaining &euro;1.7 billion was liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.</p><p> Within each Vote Estimate, the funding approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is allocated to various programmes and subheads and the appropriation accounts must report on spending at that level.  For practical reasons, as set out in public financial procedures, there are arrangements to vary the allocations between subheads within an individual Vote.</p><p> When underspending on an individual subhead is anticipated, the key principle is that the Exchequer has the first claim on the saving.  However, there are two formal mechanisms in place to allow for voted funding to be reallocated between subheads during the year.  These are the passing of a technical Supplementary Estimate by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or a process called virement, which is usually used for lower-value transfers and requires the prior approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p> In the course of audit of the appropriation accounts for 2021, a number of cases were identified where there was reallocation of voted funding between Vote subheads but where the prescribed transfer procedures did not appear to have been complied with.  Chapter 4 outlines the circumstances of four such cases.</p><p> The total amount transferred through the virement process by the four Votes referred to in the chapter was more than &euro;1 billion.  The prior approval of the Department had not been obtained in all cases where required, resulting in the need for so-called retrospective sanction.  Additionally, there is an evident requirement for better documentation of virement decisions.</p><p> Some of the amounts reallocated using virement were substantial by reference to the original subhead provisions, which in effect represent the level of spending envisaged by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The principles in public financial procedure indicate that a Supplementary Estimate should be used for such large transfers.  This would allow the relevant sectoral committee of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, in a timely way, to examine the reasons for both the emerging savings and the planned additional expenditure and to make recommendations in that regard.</p></speech>

As set out in the invitation, he has five minutes.  I know his statement is quite long because I read it yesterday evening.  Could he please summarise it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me.  I will just briefly address each of main items on the agenda.</p> <p>  Turning to chapter 3 of the report, the total gross expenditure outturn for 2021 amounted to &euro;74.5 billion.  This level of funding supports the provision of a wide range of public services, infrastructure investment and income supports.  There were a number of expenditure developments within 2021.  Covid-related restrictions had a significant impact on the lives of Irish people, requiring a continued Government response.  Some &euro;13.5 billion was spent in 2021 on Covid-related measures.  This level of expenditure reflects the funding allocated to support people, businesses and public services with the challenges posed by the pandemic. </p> <p>  There was capital carryover, or deferred surrender, in 2021 amounting to &euro;819 million, sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for use in 2022.  In addition, &euro;1.7 billion was surrendered back to the Exchequer.  These developments are due to a combination of factors, including slower than anticipated progress on capital projects driven by closures of the construction sector in early 2021 as a consequence of public health restrictions and supply chain issues, and also lower than expected uptake of core current services, for example, in the Department of Health, again, driven by the pandemic and public health restrictions.</p> <p>  Chapter 4 of the report refers to instances found in the audit relating to the practice of virement and raises issues as to whether, in some cases, Supplementary Estimates should have been used.</p> <p>  Virement between subheads in a Vote is possible because the Oireachtas, in appropriating money in the annual Appropriation Act, does so by specifying in the Schedule to the Act only the ambit of each Vote.  The Act does not give legal effect to the various subheads, as to do so would almost certainly result in considerable overestimation and would disrupt the smooth working of the financial system.  Accordingly, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has discretion to vary the allocation for each Vote between its constituent subheads.</p> <p>  Public financial procedures recognise that the judgment of the Department in respect of virement is a wide power and provides guidance on instances where the Department may refuse virement, for example, where the additional expenditure: is on a new service, is novel or contentious; is large in relation to the original provision or although relatively small, likely to involve significant liabilities in future years; or arise from a major change of policy. </p> <p>  Within the overall financial parameters and where possible and appropriate, the Department is willing to consider the virement of sums from subheads to other subheads.  The Department considers such cases in the context of the public financial procedures and where it is considered proportionate to facilitate a Department to deliver its policy objectives.</p> <p>  As outlined in chapter 3 of the Comptroller and Attorney General&rsquo;s report, the Revised Estimates for public services provided for a total net fund of almost &euro;67.7 billion across 45 Votes.  After taking account of further Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates, this increased to &euro;73.1 billion in the Appropriation Act 2021.  This increase of &euro;5.4 billion, or 8%, reflected decisions by Government to allocate significant additional funding for measures to respond to Covid-19.  By way of comparison with the last pre-Covid financial year, the increase in net voted funding set out in appropriation account 2019 relative to that year&rsquo;s Revised Estimates was &euro;0.6 billion, or only 1%, of the difference.  In these circumstances, with Government having presented significant additional sums for approval to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in order to respond to Covid-19 and with savings emerging on core expenditure programmes and projects driven by the impact of the pandemic, the Department considered it appropriate and in line with public financial procedures to utilise the virement process to reallocate funding to facilitate delivery of priorities across Departments.</p> <p>  Decisions in relation to granting virement will always, as the public financial procedures make clear, rest significantly on the judgment of this Department.  It would be counterproductive to the goals of both supporting the smooth operation of the Government financial system, and indeed to the operation of the D&aacute;il, if artificial benchmarks were created in respect of the monetary thresholds which if exceeded would require Supplementary Estimates rather than virement.</p> <p>  Briefly on the format and content of the appropriation account, correspondence received by the Department from the committee in November 2021 highlighted a number of issues.  In response, the Department made a number of changes as per the request from the committee in terms of the presentation of the legal </p> <p>costs note in the 2021 accounts.  We provided for the disclosure of the Accounting Officers salary scale or equivalent in a note to the account.  In May, the Department committed to examining changes to the remuneration disclosure, but due regard was needed to the request for disclosure of actual remuneration of officers.  Accordingly, my Department sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  That advice has now been received and is being considered by the Department.</p> <p>  The Department is now reviewing changes that could be made in the appropriation account for 2022, including providing for the disclosure of the accounting officer gross salary and details of pay band analysis.  The Department recently provided an update to the committee on these issues. </p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the Department is also progressing the financial accounting and reporting reforms programme for central government Votes.  That will change the basis of the reporting of the financial statements from a cash to an accrual basis, in line with international public sector accounting standards.</p> <p>  Finally, turning to the value for money and spending reviews, the Department not only focuses on fiscal sustainability, but also the transformation of public services, supporting excellence in service delivery, strategic policy making and public governance structures.  To achieve these goals, it is vital that public expenditure is managed in a planned, balanced and evidence-informed manner to support Ireland&rsquo;s economic, social and climate goals.  This is progressed in a number of ways, including through day-to-day management of resources and regular engagement with Departments throughout the year on their funding.  It is also progressed through a range of important budgetary reform initiatives, including the spending review process.</p> <p>  Spending review is a key platform for the development and publication of evaluation output and the promotion of evidence-informed policy across the Civil Service.  It works in tandem with broader initiatives, such as the establishment and development of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, to develop capacity and enhance the role of economic and value for money analysis in public policy making.  It is with this more complete understanding that policy-makers can work towards the achievement of value for money, efficiency and effectiveness. </p> <p>  I thank the committee members for their attention.  I look forward to our discussion on the agenda items.</p></speech>

There were particular circumstances in 2020 and 2021 related to Covid that impacted in three ways.  First, the closures impacted on capital spend; second, the Government took decisions on supporting businesses and households due directly to Covid but, more important, and maybe most important from the point of view of virement, a lot of ordinary day-to-day services spent less money because people could not access them due to Covid.</p></speech>

The Covid-related restrictions and the unpredictable elements of Covid were much smaller this year than they were in either 2020 or 2021, so we are working to get back to a more normal situation post-Covid.  Normally, we do not really support virement in ordinary circumstances because savings are often time-related savings.</p></speech>

Reallocating those costs this year is no good because you have then spent it and you need it again next year when you have managed to hire people.  During Covid it was slightly different because though the savings are themselves temporary and related to the closures due to Covid, so were the Covid supports they were then used to support.  From our point of view the context for virement in 2020 and 2021 was very different from other years.  One of the things we strove to do was to ensure we did not have &euro;1 billion of extra money from the Oireachtas that was not required.  In fact, because of the unpredictability of Covid and of events as they rolled out through the year we ended up, even with considerable virement of existing allocations, with a very large surrender to the Exchequer at the end of the year.</p></speech>

I am glad Mr. Moloney has raised it.  I am concerned it is being spent at the end of the year in a sort of heavy way on a range of different projects, including the purchase of turnkeys, which the Department says helps finance the development of those properties.  That is fine except there is a willing market out there already looking to purchase homes.  I am interested in Mr. Moloney's Department's oversight relative to the capital spend relative to profile and its capacity to do that.  I understand his Department has that oversight role and that it has somebody liaising with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on its capital spend.  It does, does it not?</p></speech>

What is his Department's capacity to test how the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is doing relative to profile and in its decision-making?  For example, does Mr. Moloney's Department have any engineers, chartered surveyors or any people with professional expertise in the industry or is it somebody else who is supervising it?</p></speech>

If Mr. Moloney's Department's objective is to ensure capital projects are delivered on behalf of the State and it provides the funding for that, in order to be able to effectively oversee that delivery his Department needs to at least have the capacity to test what other Departments are saying to it about delivery of the projects.  A key part of that is the capacity to test it technically as much as from an accounting perspective.</p></speech>

It is not enough to give a big pile of money to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the Department of Transport and to fail to have an oversight mechanism for the State to ensure those Departments are actually being tested externally in some way to ensure those projects are delivered.  The sense one has is there is an awful lot of money in the State but things are not happening and not getting delivered.</p> <p>  I will give a different example with the local authorities.  It is a continual source of frustration in this room that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not able to audit their accounts.  They received, I think, &euro;5.8 billion funding and we have no capacity to test how that is being spent on the delivery of capital projects, whatever about the management of the housing assistance payment or anything else.  The authorities essentially audit themselves and the Comptroller and Auditor General can only go so far.</p> <p>  My question is really about Mr. Moloney's Department's capacity as the ultimate overseer on behalf of the State to technically and expertly probe the management of different projects without having to resort to your KPMGs, your Deloittes or anything else.  Does Mr. Moloney's Department just give the others money and wait for them to come back at the end of the year when each either has a return or it does not?  How can the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform be sure the projects are being A, delivered, B, delivered efficiently, C with the best value for money and that whatever is being learned - because there is always something to be learned on any engineering project - is being captured by the State system for the following capital projects?  Where is the Department's expertise on that, or does it just pass on the money?</p></speech>

I understand the OPW may have rectified the absence of qualified engineers, chartered surveyors and so on, because this came up at this committee before.  It obviously needs a measure of technical expertise to be able to manage projects and so on.  However, that is in respect of the OPW itself.  My suggestion to Mr. Moloney is his Department also needs such expertise.  We have raised legal costs relating to the accounts.  Mr. Moloney raised in his opening statement that the Department is now including legal costs and so on but we still regard that as insufficient, having regard to the Department's own code of practice for what needs to be included in the accounts of State bodies and indeed from a legislative perspective what we have said private bodies need to do.  It should be in the appropriation accounts.</p><p>There should be information concerning temporary agency staffing.  Crucially, it should include gender.  Let us turn, however, to what I am talking about, which is expertise and the question of the expertise available to the State so we do not have to outsource every thought to KPMG.  We are more than well able to do it ourselves.  To be able to properly oversee the delivery of projects funded by the taxpayers and that the Oireachtas has voted money towards, I suggest it is the Department's responsibility to ensure these projects are delivered and that to do this it requires a measure of technical expertise to be able to probe the delivery of these different projects.</p></speech>

We demand business cases for projects and we look at those.  We have a major projects advisory group for very large projects.  We have, therefore, means of assessing these projects.  Again, however, we do not have engineering or other technical expertise and I do not think the Department needs to duplicate that type of expertise.  Quite rightly, the Deputy mentioned the OPW.

I am not suggesting that the Department should get into project delivery.  What I am suggesting is that when the Department is testing how the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is doing in respect of delivery, it should have somebody who can ask probing questions about the delivery of different projects.  The spending of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the example given, is now 30% under profile three quarters of the way through the year.  Were this trajectory to continue, we would say it will be 40% under profile by the end of the year.  Now, we both know that is not going to happen because that Department is going to spend like billy-o at the end of the year.  The question, however, is what this money is going to be spent on.  Are officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sitting down with those from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and asking this question now?  For example, if this money is going to be spent on turnkey developments all over the country, is this what the Government intended would be done or was it intended that housing would be delivered in a different and sustained way throughout the year?  Is this a satisfactory way of managing this endeavour?</p></speech>

There is constant communication.  At all stages, we have a fairly good oversight of how much money is being spent and where it is being spent.  We grant sanction for that spending.  There is an ongoing and detailed conversation in this regard.  We do have visibility regarding where the money is going, if that is the question.  This is what we focus on.</p></speech>

The Department has visibility of where the money is going, but it does not sound like there is a conversation about whether that is enough spending, whether it is correct and whether it will deliver at the end of the year.  If there is constant visibility, is spending of 30% under profile acceptable?  Are other Departments under profile?  Which Departments have spent above profile at this point in the year?  This is an important year from an inflationary management perspective.  We want to spend capital that is there for a range of different reasons.  Which Departments are spending over profile now?</p></speech>

Departments have faced significant challenges this year and last year, first, because of Covid-19 and then due to supply chain disruption related to the war in Ukraine.  There have been considerable challenges, particularly in rolling out new programmes.  As the Deputy will be aware, the national development plan represents a considerable uplift in our capital ambitions.  There is a certain amount of catch-up in the face of Covid-19, supply chain disruption and, as the Deputy said, inflation.</p></speech>

That is a considerable gap and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not testing how it is spending.  Officials are not sitting down with an engineer and asking what the projects are, which are behind and what is not getting delivered.  At the end of the year, as happens at the end of every year in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, it will get caught up somehow.  I appreciate that 2021 was a year affected by Covid-19, but nearly all the Department's money was spent.  Something like &euro;116 million was surrendered, which is a very small proportion of the &euro;5.1 billion the Department had to begin with.  It all got spent at the end of the year because there was a rush to spend it.  My contention is that this is not an acceptable way to manage this within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage itself or for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as the overseer either.  The latter needs to strengthen its expertise to be able to ask more probing questions.</p></speech>

There are far more worthy things, I would assume, that the Secretary General could have come up with.</p> <p>  I have a question on local government.  I may have to get this in writing.  A sum of &euro;5.8 billion is significant.  Has the Department a lack of oversight regarding amounts of central funding of that nature - nearly &euro;6 billion - being allocated?  Especially, when, in Wexford, my local authority got sanction from its councillors to increase local property tax last week, in a cost-of-living crisis, by up to 15%, has the Department an appropriate oversight of the spending of local authorities?</p></speech>

I will start with the Department's dispute over the amount of the postal charges due to An Post for the 2016 general election.  It has been reported that the Department paid &euro;14.1 million to An Post in May 2016 and it disputed the liability of the Exchequer to pay the balance, which was &euro;1.5 million.  Will the Secretary General explain the reason for withholding this money from a State body such as An Post?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.181" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#E06000"><p>That is broadly correct.  In 2011, the then Department of Finance and An Post signed an agreement covering the cost at a discounted rate of election communications for candidates in the 2011 general election at an agreed discount price.  When the 2016 general election came along, An Post charged a higher price than had been agreed for the 2011 general election but that price had not been agreed with the Department of Finance.  Therefore, I suppose, in fairness, a dispute arose as to what the appropriate level of charge should be.</p></speech>

The view that the Department of Finance at the time took was that there had been no agreement to increase the charge.</p><p>That is where the dispute arose.  As Deputy Dillon knows, general elections take place at short notice.  There was not an agreement in time to allow communications to go ahead.  It was not viewed as feasible to stop the communications, so we had a situation where a service was delivered but there was a dispute about the price.  The amount we paid at that point was based on the 2011 price.</p></speech>

It was agreed to split that, so we paid &euro;367,000 of that.  We made a further contribution to the cost of arbitration, which I think the Deputy is referring to, of &euro;92,000.</p></speech>

That is part of life.  Regarding lessons learned, we now have an agreement in place with An Post that covers until 2026.  The way around this happening again is to have longer term agreements in place so that we are not caught on the hop by an election or such.  I think the agreement lasting until 2026 means that this will not arise.</p></speech>

That is not always possible but, in the main, public bodies would seek to settle these differences outside of a court or legal case framework.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Moloney give an indication of the spending reviews for health?  What findings, conclusions or recommendations have been taken on board with regard to health spending?</p></speech>

Initially, they were mostly done by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  More recently, they have been done in collaboration between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health, or by the Department of Health itself.  Some of the significant issues that were covered and informed policy in the area included work on the nursing homes support scheme, which is called the fair deal scheme.  That has fed into the review of costings for that scheme.  We have negotiated agreements on pharmaceutical pricing.  IGEES did work which the Department greatly informed.  As I said to Deputy Verona Murphy, IGEES has been around for ten years.  The Government Economic Service, GES, in the UK has been around for 50 years.  It is in a phase where collecting data and using those data to inform policy is at its core.  Over time, it will become even more impactful.</p></speech>

This arises in particular when the HSE and the Department of Health are before the committee to discuss their financial accounting systems.  There are concerns about accountability for and traceability of the use of public funds and about the value for money reports.  We are very light about how we assign funds to areas in health where funding is required.  There is frustration at this committee when the HSE and Department of Health come before us.  Have any recommendations been implemented to date in 2022 that Mr. Moloney can share with us with regard to value for money or spending reviews in health?</p></speech>

There are other examples.  We have looked at various aspects of primary care and at care for the elderly.  Much work has been done.  The work by the IGEES economists and policy analysts in Government Departments has brought much greater clarity to what is being spent and what it is spent on, which greatly facilitates value-for-money assessments and how money is allocated within the health service.  As the Deputy knows, there are considerable limitations in the information available about financial management in the HSE.</p></speech>

We are told it could take four or five years before the HSE is able to roll it out.  I know procurement has finished and a contract has been signed to implement the system, but I am sure the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform wants to get this up and running as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It made progress before Covid.  Post Covid, we are told that the current timeline for the project is that 53% of all the HSE's directly-run services will be on the integrated financial management system, IFMS, by the end of 2023.  It will be at 82% by the end of 2024 and 100% by mid-2025.</p></speech>

Will they be put on the system first?  Are the HSE and Department of Health telling the Department which areas they will pick?  Is the Department working with them to address where the scrutiny and traceability need to be focused?</p></speech>

The legacy system is derived from the old health boards.  To a large extent, the programming was dictated by the old legacy systems in the health boards, which were primarily regional.  The prioritisation of the programming was focused on where the greatest weaknesses in the legacy systems were.  The risk assessment fed into the timing and sequencing for the move to the IFMS.</p></speech>

I want to turn to the Department's role in establishing remote policy across the Civil Service.  Remarkable things were done during the Covid pandemic with regard to seeing what was possible to do through remote working.  Thousands of social welfare payments were processed in a manner and from places which we would probably never have sanctioned or predicted.  I think the same work was carried out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  How has the Department taken that learning and applied it to a new policy?  Will Mr. Moloney talk to us about the Department's policy on remote working and how it applies to the broader Civil Service?  How does the Department take account of our climate action targets in that same policy by reducing commuting times and so on?  How do the new provisions for flexible working fit with the Government's policy on work-life balance?</p></speech>

A huge amount was done in the Civil Service, public service and private sector when the pandemic landed in spring 2020.  IT resources were quickly put in place to make remote working practical in a way we never thought it was before.  As we discussed earlier, there are some trade-offs with that.  There was a level of disruption in 2021 with such an unplanned move.</p><p>As we look to the future, however, we have seen there are benefits to remote working.  There are benefits as an employer of choice and there are benefits to the people who work for us and with us.  We have seen that large areas of work can continue uninterrupted and at high quality within a blended working environment.  For the Civil Service as a whole, the Minister has charge of the Civil Service blended working policy framework and we have a blended working policy framework that has been agreed by the Government in terms of general principles.  That has been discussed and supported by the Civil Service Management Board.</p></speech>

There is a sense that because Departments are currently piloting different types of blended working schemes, it is the experience of individual Departments that will matter most.  I suspect the review will take the form of the collection of the experiences of individual Departments, perhaps in the context of the Civil Service Management Board.</p></speech>

There are energy saving initiatives across the civil and public service.  There are guidelines in respect of heating and light within each Department.  We have supported policies to reduce use.

I specifically refer to the value for money process in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, particularly with regard to the value for money sought for the procurement of housing.  Does Mr. Moloney believe that model is sufficiently broad to balance also the spending in the Department of Social Protection, for example, on the procurement of housing through schemes such as the housing assistance payment, HAP?  Sometimes there is too narrow a focus on value for money in the procurement of a particular unit or set of units and account is not taken of the broader value for money in terms of it not having to be spent by another Department.</p></speech>

That view across Government is something we need to strengthen in terms of our value for money approach.  In terms of housing, we take into account the money spent by the Department of Social Protection as well as the money spent by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage when we consider those issues.  In recent years we have moved a lot of the spending that was formerly in the social protection Vote into the housing Vote so that there is greater consistency of approach.  We are conscious of that and we are aware how important it is to take it into account to the full.  In any value for money assessment or business case, the full costs to the Exchequer should be taken into account and, indeed, the full benefits in terms of the access to services should be as well.</p></speech>

That holistic approach to housing is important.  In particular as we now start to look at procurement, there is going to come a point when viability is a major issue for housing, even social housing.  Last week, Dublin City Council had tenders with which it cannot proceed because the costs for social housing are deemed to be too high, yet we know the cost of not doing it is far greater.  That broader aspect of how we apply value for money in housing is key.</p> <p>  I refer to the delay to the process that often results from value for money auditing.  Local authorities would say they are almost constantly, at each stage, coming back with value for money reports, and that is adding to the overall delay in the provision of housing.  Has the Department examined that issue?</p></speech>

There are two points we would make in that regard.  One is that the development of business cases and value for money justifications at an early stage in a project are a key signifier of the success of that project.  Where that basic work is not done at the start, the project has a much higher chance of going over budget and over time.  We do not see it as a delay.  There are challenges in different State agencies in the context of remembering and taking it into account in their planning.  Nobody goes out to buy a suite of houses next week.  These things are all planned well in advance, and the value for money aspects need to be built into the planning by purchasing authorities.</p></speech>

The value for money is evident regardless of what the house costs.  I am not saying we should pay any amount, but the cost of it is dwarfed by comparison with the cost the State is incurring in the context of emergency provision of accommodation.</p></speech>

An issue that has come up many times at the committee is that the people who are procuring one of the largest amounts of spending, namely, HAP, are some of the most vulnerable people in Ireland.  They are the procurement manager for their own rents, yet the State is spending millions in the private rental market with a resultant disproportionate impact.  Has the Department examined the impact of HAP and the idea of who is procuring the service?  In my experience, it is often the most vulnerable people - those who need housing - who are negotiating on behalf of the State, to put it that way.</p></speech>

It was very useful for internal audit, for example.  Tusla, for example, expressed an interest in its continuation for precisely that reason, the internal audit process.  Was anything done to assess the impact of the loss of Benefacts on Tusla and how that might manifest?  Funders such as the Department of Health, the HSE, the Department of Social Protection and a couple of local authorities contributed to the pilot project that was Benefacts and its information was comprehensive.  There can be no accountability without transparency, and here was a very transparent database that was open source.  It was very usable for internal audit purposes and Tusla expressed an interest in its continuation.

We canvassed quite widely.  It was a pilot, or pathfinder, project and it was clear from the start it was not part of our core mandate.  Part of our approach in reform issues is often to start with a pilot project and then to find a home for it.  Among the most likely State agencies - Tusla was certainly one and the CSO was another - we asked whether they wanted to take over Benefacts and they did not.  It did not align with their data needs.</p></speech>

We have this supposedly open Government approach but I do not see how that can manifest without tools such as this one, which was working, usable and being used and which had potential other uses.  When it comes to value for money, starting a project, getting it to that point and then ceasing it seems to be the opposite of that.</p> <p>  Did the Comptroller and Auditor General's office have any reason to use Benefacts?

I am sure taxpayers, along with ourselves on the committee, and the Department would be eager to ensure value for money when it comes to the scheme.  The national development plan had allocated &euro;202 million for 2022, but as of August of this year no deep retrofits had been completed.  Has the Department raised concerns with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications about the scheme?  Some &euro;40 million, or almost 20% of the total fund, was reallocated from the scheme to other purposes this year.  Would Mr. Moloney consider it a red flag that the scheme is not working or is not being implemented as expected?</p></speech>

She obviously knows that the retrofitting scheme is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in the first instance, but of course, we do take an interest.  It is a large amount of money, and it is a big part of the NDP and a significant commitment within it.  The challenge in the context we discussed earlier in terms of the broad capital programme, post-Covid supply chain disruption and all the rest of it is probably amplified in the case of retrofit because the ambition in the national development plan is to create a whole new retrofit industry.  My understanding is that Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications is optimistic that progress is being made in that regard, and that the underspend we see in retrofitting will be addressed over time.  Many people are now going into the industry and there is a lot more interest, in particular with the price of energy going the way it is.  The Minister anticipates a greater interest in the scheme.  We do look at it.  Internationally, the big problem with deep retrofit is that it is costly and disruptive, so there is a good deal of inertia.</p></speech>

It is concerning that as of August of this year there were no deep retrofits completed.  When the Department was doing the budget for 2022, did the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications say it would be able to spend that money?</p></speech>

Every year a certain amount of funding is allocated, and it is never spent because the Department does not recruit sufficient staff.  At what stage does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform ever take the Department to task over that, or is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform happy to take whatever is said and to allocate the funding?  My concern is that it is going to be the same for this scheme.  Where is the oversight and the assurance that it has provided value for money, and that the moneys allocated will be spent?</p></speech>

From our point of view, in terms of value for money, it is fairly well established that retrofitting does provide value for money in the long term, given our climate targets in particular.  That is well established.  Deputy Munster made a good point about whether income levels then start to determine how much of that a person can do.  That is one of the reasons the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has a number of different schemes that operate at different levels.</p></speech>

We accept that it is a lot of money.  The demands of Covid-19 and the need to provide for Covid added more than &euro;5 billion to public expenditure in 2021.  Our concern was that we would not add &euro;6 billion when we did not need to and that if there were savings on budget line, those savings would be used in the first instance to fund the temporary Covid measures.

My apologies for arriving late but I had other meetings to attend.  On the overall expenditure by the Government, part of that expenditure is funding that is provided by the relevant Departments to local authorities.  Does the Department believe there is enough scrutiny of how local authorities use that money?  I know they are accountable to the councillors but there is not the same level of scrutiny.  For instance, we cannot invite a local authority before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Do the witnesses believe we now need to change the legislation to deal with that issue?  It is a substantial budget, between all the local authorities.  Is it time to look at that whole issue of how we can get better value for money?  We have talked about that.  Does the Department feel we can do a lot more in scrutinising that whole area?</p></speech>

Earlier, we promised to provide a note on that to Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  The Deputy is quite right that we are constrained, in that the accountability for local government funds is dealt with separately.  The legislation and legal provisions dealing with it are separate.  Instead of having a role for the Comptroller and Auditor General, there is a role for a local government auditor.  I suppose I am precluded from commenting on that, as it is the policy position, but we have agreed to furnish the committee with a note on the issues and what flows from them.</p></speech>

I know there is a local government auditor but have concerns been raised with the Department in relation to this issue?</p></speech>

One of the problems that is arising now is the timeframe from the time a project is started to the time it finally gets approval.  For instance, the documentation on the new elective hospital for Cork was submitted by the South/Southwest Hospital Group in January, and we still do not have a decision from the Department because it has to go through the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The figures given in January are in real terms a kind of estimate of what they would be now.  It is not necessarily saying that it was an inaccurate estimate.  The figures are now completely irrelevant because the whole issue of costs has changed substantially.  Does the Secretary General not think that it is time now for all Departments to look at the way we assess projects and the timeframe it is taking to do so?  I will give the Secretary General one example.  I know of a project in my own constituency which started off as planning for a school.  A Government agency objected to the planning and took it all of the way to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Its argument was that the local sewage treatment facility did not have capacity, even though it was an existing school which was already connected into that system.  The people gave an undertaking that the school would not increase its numbers but the appeal still went all the way to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p> Does the Secretary General not think that we need to look at this whole issue of the delaying of projects and how we can deliver them more quickly, especially where the decision-making process needs to be looked at?</p></speech>

There is a concern about the length of time projects are taking to get to implementation stage and that is being addressed in a number of different ways.  A review of planning legislation is at an advanced stage and is being undertaken in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.</p> <p>  I currently chair a group which is looking at the public spending code to consider how much of that can be foreshortened, where appropriate.  We are aware and conscious of the need to minimise any delays caused by regulatory decision-making.  </p> <p>  I made a point earlier is that all of these projects take a long time;from having the idea, to getting the planning permission, to finding the funding.  On the value-for-money pieces of that, those pieces can generally be done alongside the planning for the project and perhaps the thing that needs to be done most is that alongside the planning for a project, the value-for-money pieces and the business cases need to be factored in and done alongside it.  They do not need to be a surprise or a delay at a particular given point.</p></speech>

We are now talking about a completely different budget to what we were talking about ten months ago, and we still do not get an explanation as to why it is taking so long.  Some clarification needs to be given as to why projects are taking so long.</p> <p>  I am aware of another project, which is about ophthalmology care, where the building has been sitting idle for the past six months but adequate funding to fully equip and staff the facility has not yet been provided.  Why does all of this happen?  We have made a decision that we need to improve a service but when we take that decision towards its implementation stage, it is just not happening fast enough.  How does the Secretary General believe we can change that?</p></speech>

We are looking at planning permission and at our own processes.  It would be appropriate for all State agencies to look at their own processes.  We discussed the underspending of capital earlier on also, so at this stage, with a greatly expanded capital programme, it is very important that all public sector agencies look at their procedures.</p> <p>  On the other hand, I have to go back to the reasons we have many of these procedures, which are twofold.  First, we have had problems in the past, in particular with major projects.  Second, all of the evidence shows that planning around detailed specification and proper business cases at the start makes it a quicker process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#M00500"><p>I fully understand that but the problem I have is that on this elective hospital issue, it has taken ten months.  The decision had been made that we need it but the two Departments have not signed off on it.  We have not even gone to planning stage or started that process.  Why does it take ten months to come to a decision where everyone already accepts that we need to build this hospital and in the meantime, a huge cost has been added on to it.  It is likewise with school and housing projects.  It is about the time from when the local authorities make a submission to the Department to getting the response back from the Department.</p> <p>  If one takes the Glashaboy flood relief scheme in my own constituency, the tender was submitted but in the time the Department took to accept the tender, the price had gone through the roof because there was too much of a delay in accepting the tender that had been submitted.  In planning permission, a decision has to be given within a certain number of weeks.  We do not seem to have the same timeframe in respect of tenders.  When a tender comes in, is there a timeframe within a Department at the moment by which a decision must be made as regards who is awarded the project?</p></speech>

The Secretary General of the Department of Health appeared before this committee and I was advised that the decision on the elective hospital in Cork would be made in mid-October and this is on the public record.  The Secretary General is now telling me that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform did not receive the documentation from the Department of Health until 27 September.  In fact, I was misled and I had been advised earlier that the decision would be made at the end of July.</p></speech>

Clearly, on the consideration that has to be done for any of these projects, the engagement with external experts, and so on and so forth, timescales do change, but the information I have is that we received this documentation on 27 September and we expect the MPAG to complete its review in mid-November.</p></speech>

There are timeframes within which local authorities have to comply in respect of planning.  From the time tenders are accepted and are actually submitted, and where, for instance, there is a deadline set for 1 October for all the tenders to be submitted, what is the deadline within Departments for a Department to come to a decision in respect of to whom the contract will be awarded?  Do we have deadlines within Departments because I have seen delays of five months to six months in Departments in respect of deciding what tender the Department is accepting.  Is it not now time that we would set down for every Department a timeframe, from the time a tender is to be submitted to a Department and within which a decision has then to be made?  That can be four weeks, six weeks or eight weeks but at least to have a timeframe.</p></speech>

There have been some substantial infrastructural upgrades done over the past number of decades.</p><p>In that context, I wish to ask about cases where there may be a level of collusion between companies that are tendering.  In July, six Spanish construction firms were fined &euro;200 million by the Spanish regulator for colluding on bids for public-private contracts, or public private partnerships, PPPs, as we know them.  The regulator found that their behaviour resulted in fewer and lower quality bids being received.  The Spanish state has moved to ban these companies from winning public contracts for the foreseeable future.  Five of those Spanish companies have won contracts for PPPs in this State.  Was Mr. Moloney aware of the situation that arose in Spain and the decision of the regulator there?</p></speech>

Dragados, which is a part of the ACS Group, was fined &euro;57.1 million, FCC Construccion was fined &euro;40.4 million, Ferrovial Construccion was fined &euro;38.5 million, Acciona Construccion was fined &euro;29.4 million and Obrasco Huarte Lain was fined &euro;21.5 million.  The sixth company, Sacyr Construccion, was fined &euro;16.7 million.  This story was reported by Reuters on 7 July.  The Spanish regulator found that, between 1992 and 2017, the companies had met weekly to analyse which public projects they were planning to bid for, plan a common strategy and share technical documents between them.  The regulator found that this had affected many construction bids, leading to fewer and lower quality bids.  The regulator viewed this as a serious infringement of Spanish and European competition law.  We are under the umbrella of the latter, as Mr. Moloney is well aware.  The Department is not aware of this situation or has not been alerted to it.</p></speech>

She has sought a more sophisticated data system - I will come to the Department's role in a moment - to monitor for potential abuses.  I understand that the CCPC is currently examining the waste and motor sectors.  She outlined that the CCPC was relying on whistleblowers to detect wrongdoing.  It has been estimated that wrongdoing may be adding 20% to 30% to the cost of contracts.  On 14 August, she was reported as saying:</p> <blockquote> 	We've had various complaints over the years, and we've done various investigations, but we haven't had a successful prosecution.  We need to improve the data, the evidence base for what we're looking at. </blockquote> <p>She added: &quot;International experience would tell you that [public procurement] is something that tends to be very prone to cartel activity, and particularly to bid-rigging&quot;.  I understand that she and her office have written to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to make the case for a data analytics-based system, which would make it easier to track activity.  In this regard, she has stated:</p> <blockquote> 	At the moment in order to detect bid-rigging we'd be reliant on a whistleblower ... But we also know that the Irish State could use software a lot more cleverly than we do at the moment to kind of detect patterns like that ... [and] to look at the historical pattern&quot; </blockquote> <p>I am not alleging wrongdoing, but the Department needs to be alert to this.  When I became aware of the Spanish case, it alerted me to the situation.</p><p>Dragados, which Reuters reported was fined &euro;57.1 million by the Spanish regulator, was awarded the New Ross N25 bypass contract, which was worth &euro;230 million.  It was also awarded the Gorey M11 contract, which was worth &euro;350 million.  From the Department's point of view, have issues arisen with any of these contracts?</p></speech>

One of the bidders was BAM, Dragados was another and FCC Construccion was a third.  It was reported in July that the latter two had been caught colluding in Spain.  I am not alleging that there has been collusion in Ireland, but there are substantial opportunities for companies internationally.  What I am saying to Mr. Moloney, as the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is that we are signing multimillion euro public contracts - in some cases, they are worth billions of euro - when there are issues arising internationally to which the State, the Department and our committee need to be alert.  Has Mr. Moloney any concern that there has been price rigging on public contracts?  I do not mean the contracts I mentioned, but public contracts in general.

What happened as a consequence of that?  Have any measures been put in place to assist in that regard?  The CCPC raised the matter again this year.  My concern is that these two things happened within a month of each other.  The chair raised the issue of the inability of the CCPC to examine these matters because of the absence of a sophisticated database and the technological means to look back and monitor.  Has the Department engaged with the CCPC on that so far?  Can any of the officials indicate whether there has been any level of engagement?</p></speech>

Is Mr. Moloney concerned about the potential in this area and the need to be extra careful where big contracts are being awarded?  The Spanish case worked its way through to a conclusion and some damning findings on those five companies are being reported.  This shows the potential.  We all wonder about that, maybe in relation to smaller contracts at a more local level.  Issues arise sometimes and allegations are made, many of which are wrong.  False allegations are sometimes made by people who have a gripe or for some other reason.  Perhaps they lost out in a bidding process.  Is Mr. Moloney concerned about this and does he feel we need to keep a good eye on it?</p></speech>

Mr. Moloney is the accountable person and someone in his position in the public sector or in a public sector body has an ongoing obligation to demonstrate to this committee in particular that what is happening with Government and public spending is good value for money.  I have not heard anything today that demonstrates how he does that or what his benchmark is.  I understand the line of questioning from Deputy Carroll MacNeill when she asked about expertise.  What does Mr. Moloney benchmark value for money against in the housing sector?</p></speech>

Gathering the data showing the outputs is a very important element of that but, fundamentally, the Accounting Officer for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is responsible for value for money for housing.

I know it is the system we have and without extra supply, we are not going to overcome it.  Would Mr. Moloney believe that several people have contacted me pointing out that the housing assistance department in Limerick has been writing to them on a monthly basis - for years in some cases - to tell them their tenants have not paid their portion of the rent.  The landlord wrote to HAP to say their tenant has continually paid their rent.  The letter comes monthly to say the department is stopping the HAP payment.  It is a monthly letter and no matter what form of communication the landlord uses to say the department is incorrect, that letter still arrives.  It still comes on a monthly basis and the tenant has missed no payment.  First, the letter says it is stopping the HAP payment, which it never does, and, second, it comes monthly, which obviously means there is a postage cost.  Was Mr. Moloney aware of that?</p></speech>

How would the Department identify that?  I do not know how many cases of this there are.  It is clearly a huge waste of money on postage.

I have read a huge amount in preparation for this committee meeting and many of my colleagues and I are of the opinion it is time to reintegrate the two Departments.

Mr. Moloney previously mentioned that the equivalent body in the UK has been in existence for 50 years.</p><p>Unless Mr. Moloney has proof that the Department has saved in excess of &euro;50 million in reforms, it is not really worth our while.  It is a waste of money.  We are paying two grade 1 Secretaries General.  I do not see the level of expertise there.  Can Mr. Moloney tell me categorically, for the benefit of the committee and the people who pay their taxes into the Exchequer, that his Department is value for money?  I am not talking about him personally.  Is the Department worth those 650 people and taking up this committee's time?  Has it generated savings in excess of &euro;50 million in the years since it was established?  It it ten years now?</p></speech>

This is an issue I have raised with Graham Doyle, the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  At the moment, we are in a housing crisis.  I am approaching this in a constructive way.  I am not making a criticism but it is one of the issues that I fail to understand.  We have to mass-produce houses, particularly social housing.  I am not talking about low quality housing but good quality affordable housing and cost-rental housing.  The State has, thank God, at last moved to doing that but personally I would like to see it on a larger scale.</p> <p>  As I recall, around 2002 local authorities were instructed that all local authority housing be architecturally designed.  Up to then it was done in-house.  Nice, good and practical local authority houses were built that were very easy to maintain.  I will not go into it because I have said all this before.  Looking at examples of houses built before that period and ones built after, the ones built after are totally impractical and awful looking.  They are not all awful looking but some of them are terrible.  I am not sure what the move to architecturally designed houses did.  I could rattle off some bad examples of where there were maintenance problems afterwards but that is for another day.</p> <p>  A couple of years after that I was chair of a housing strategic policy committee, SPC, and the cost of architecturally designing was 7% or 8%.  One senior local authority figure told me recently that it is now up to 10%.  I mentioned the 7% figure and they said it was closer to 10% now.  We built a lot of houses in the 1930s.  I am not arguing for them.  I pass them coming in here in the morning.  They are okay.  They are fine.  I lived in a house like that for a good few years, no problem.  I am not arguing that we should go back to those two-up, two-down houses.  What I am saying is that one of the reasons we were able to build those is that we did not mess around by starting with a blank canvas for every site.  We started with a drawing from the local authority.  The houses I pass are in Sligo, Portlaoise, Donegal and Waterford.  I have seen them all over the country.  If we want to build houses on that scale, that is what we have to do.</p> <p>  I am raising this in the context of the pounds, shillings and pence of it.  It is taking up 5% or 10% of the cost, which is outrageous.  Graham Doyle would say to the committee, and I accept this, that there is now a standardised framework within the Department but that is not the same thing.  That is not what I am talking about.  What I am talking about is a standard design.  In other words, the only blank canvas should be the actual site.  Obviously there is a need for different types of housing.  There is a need for single-storey housing for elderly people and people with disabilities.  There is a need for apartments, and houses with one, two, three or four bedrooms.  There is a need for rural housing, semi-detached houses, terraced houses and so on.  I get all of that.  There is only way we can do that.  I will give this example.  There have been situations where decisions about the hood over the front door or the type of windowsill have gone back and forth between the local authorities and the Custom House.  This has been going on over the last number of years.  The people in the Custom House have a job to do but that is not their job.  They could give the money to the local authorities but the local authorities are strangled trying to deal with this.  They did not have the staff, although there have been some improvements there and I welcome that.  The Government has moved on that but the Department needs to move further on it.</p> <p>  One thing holding up all of this and costing more money is this ludicrous situation where we have different designs for every development.  We have good examples of good houses built in the last two or three years.  In the case of social housing, we should use those examples and just build the bloody things.  It is the same for affordable housing.  People in Laois or Cork are not worried that there is someone in Donegal living in the same type of house as them.  This includes people who want to buy an affordable house.  Most people are priced out of what is called the market and we need to get people into a position where they can buy an affordable house.  It is a good scheme but we need to accelerate it.  It is not even in first gear yet.  That is the problem.  I am asking Mr. Moloney, as Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to take this up with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I have raised this with previous housing Ministers.  I have raised it with Secretaries General.  Graham Doyle said he would talk about this again.  Maybe there is an openness there now to do it.  Can Mr. Moloney raise this now with the Minister?  It is not a policy issue; it is procedural issue.  Shuffling papers back and forward from local authorities to the Custom House and adding up to 10% extra onto the cost is absolutely bananas in the middle of a housing crisis.  I ask Mr. Moloney to give me a view on that.  What can be done about it?</p></speech>

It is certainly an issue I can speak to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage about.  We are involved in a number of working groups under Housing for All, which seeks to simplify the processes around the approval and delivery of housing, and social housing in particular.  It is made more complicated by the preference for mixed-tenure developments, which would not have been there in some of the instances the Chairman has described.  There could be scope for making further progress on that matter.  I am happy to take that forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#P02000"><p>It could be done in mixed-tenure developments.  The estate I live in is private but there is local authority housing in it.  People driving in cannot see the difference.  There is no difference.  Nobody even knows who is living the local authority housing, although I would know as a former councillor.  There is no need for this duplication and this rigmarole, and the extra cost.  I am saying this to Mr. Moloney as the head of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and a senior official.  He is the Accounting Officer of the Department.  Someone somewhere needs to take action on this.  I am saying this out of frustration.  It annoys me to think that any money is being wasted on architecture.  That is nothing against the architectural profession.  If we need to perfect some of those two-up, two-down houses, three bedroom semis, or one or two bedroom bungalows for people who have disabilities or pensioners, that is fine.  Let us do that.  The only blank canvas there should be is the actual site layout with the infrastructure in place.  We cannot have a blank canvas for each individual house.  It is absolute madness.  The Department talks about this framework it has of a certain size for rooms, the energy requirements and all of that.  That is all fine.  That is not the issue.  It has to go a step further by using the same house.  I would not see any problem with it.  If Mr. Moloney was on the housing waiting list, trying to buy an affordable house or get a home, would he have an objection to living in the same type of house that I was living in?  Going back maybe 30 years to when he would have been trying to get going with a house, would that have bothered him?  I do not think it would bother anyone.  It would be irrelevant.  If people out there on the market want to buy something that looks a certain way or they like the look of a house, that is fine.  This would not stop any of that.  That happens and that is legitimate.</p><p>If the State, as the player, is trying to get housing moving, it cannot be done with one foot on the accelerator and one foot on the brake.  That is the point I am making.  Will the Department come back to the committee with a note on this, if it can be addressed directly with the head of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage?</p></speech>

It is not the intention to stop a project.  The intention is to be very clear about the specification and as clear as possible about the costs from the outset.  We are very much informed by a lot of the work the committee has done on particular projects in terms of what can go wrong.  We are also very informed by international experience, which suggests, as I said before, that the better planned and specified a project is from the start, the better hope we have of delivering that project on time and on budget.  The public spending code has that emphasis.</p></speech>

As I have said this morning, capital projects, particularly major capital projects, take a long time to plan and execute.  There is no reason the timeline for their planning and execution could not run alongside the timeline for ensuring value for money.

Investors from abroad look at Ireland at the moment and they express concern about the pace at which we can develop our infrastructure.  The NDP is under the auspices of the Department.  I cannot see how those projects are going to be developed within a respectable timeframe, as has been demonstrated with projects such as metro north and past projects that have either been shelved or cancelled as a consequence of bureaucracy and red tape.  I want to get an insight into how the Department intends to get those projects done, particularly given what happened with the Galway ring road, where, effectively, an independent State agency, electable by or accountable to pretty much no one, which has been proven to be the case, is able to go in and strip Government-backed decisions that have been made to build road infrastructure.</p></speech>

Obviously, the planning issue is subject to national and European law.  We would hope that, as we look at all of our approvals processes, that we constantly look at them with a view to foreshortening them and making them more efficient and more effective.  We are concerned about delivery.  We have very ambitious delivery targets within the NDP.  As we discussed earlier, we are behind profile in capital spending at the moment, although we are ahead year on year.  That is a concern for us.  At every stage, we are trying to look at our decisions and approvals process with a view to speeding that up and making it better.</p> <p>  We would have to say that we do not accept that the application of value for money rules and the public spending code is, of necessity, a delay in that regard.  It does not have to be.  It just needs to be incorporated into the planning at an early stage.  We believe it can assist in the delivery of projects.</p></speech>

With regard to the funding envelope for the NDP as described, I want Mr. Moloney to bring that away and to look at the State agencies.  There is An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the relevant Department, the local authority and now, to add insult to injury, the Office of the Planning Regulator seems to be increasing its interventions, for example, in county development plans.  All of these are essential, along with Cabinet approval and, therefore, there are six major steps when it comes to getting a capital project effectively on the road.  Does Mr. Moloney think that process could be streamlined to potentially save the taxpayer billions of euro?  I will give one example.  If we were to implement a strategic policy unit within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the delivery of capital projects, with a representative from the relevant Department in each area, for example, the Department of Transport, and people from the local authority in the relevant area where the project is happening, does Mr. Moloney think that would be appropriate or could be done from a statutory point of view?</p></speech>

To be fair, I am not trying to be smart with Mr. Moloney.  I am just trying to figure out how we can deal with the issues we have in this country, where we seem to be tying ourselves up in knots when it comes to delivering capital projects.  I am even hearing some reports from Irish Rail that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is delaying some of the projects it has ongoing, and it is waiting for months to do what should realistically take weeks when it comes to the delivery of new infrastructure.</p><p>I wish to make the following point to the Secretary General of the Department that provides the entire funding needed for these projects.  It is outrageously slow to develop a capital project in this country and I want to develop an understanding of how we can improve upon that.  Has he any suggestions?  </p></speech>

It cost that much for plans and for everybody to have their say but we have nothing except that a defunct organisation called An Bord Plean&aacute;la overturned the decision.</p> <p>  Last week, I made a speech in the D&aacute;il about regulation and regulation has been mentioned here today.  To my mind, regulators in this country are appointment by the Government in order that the Government and the politicians in government are once removed from having to be accountable.  They instead put in a regulator.  Consequently, we have an energy regulator that could not foresee the energy crisis.  We have an aviation regulator that could not foresee the crisis at Dublin Airport.  I am well known for commenting on how the Office of the Planning Regulator does its business.  We have a planning regulator who clearly could not identify the difficulties in An Bord Plean&aacute;la until they were published by an online magazine or another media outlet.  In terms of value for money, how much will all these defunct regulators cost the State?  In the case of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I assume that at some point we are going to have huge legal fees on top of the ones that we already have incurred, which are upwards of &euro;20 million for the failed strategic housing development, SHD, process.</p> <p>  I struggle to identify what the &euro;50 million spent on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does, so please explain.  Perhaps &euro;500 million has been saved but we have spent it already with defunct regulatory organisations.  Has the Secretary General any act or part to play in advising the Government to get rid of or stop appointing lame ducks?</p></speech>

Obviously regulators are set up under legislation and the legislation on which they are established is passed by the Oireachtas.  That legislation often reflects EU legislation.  We have a part in resourcing those regulators.  There clearly are concerns about some regulators.  Those concerns need to be address and will be addressed.</p></speech>

Did the Department learn anything from the banking fiasco and regulator?  Has the Department anything to say after all of these instances?  It is like the Department is arriving breathless to the scene of the accident when everything has occurred and nobody foresaw what was happening, even though we have all of these regulators.

Last weekend, I heard that a private nursing home gets &euro;950 per week per bed, whereas a public nursing home just a little further down the road cost &euro;1,900 per bed per week.  The problem at the moment is that private nursing homes are closing and 16 have closed since January.  I understand that one Department has something like &euro;47 million or &euro;49 million available to the private nursing home system to assist them but the homes do not know when that money will be made available, even though the funding is in the budget.  The whole issue about public expenditure is to make sure that where someone provides a service, because that person is unable to get adequate funding then that service is no longer available and the service comes back then under the control of the State or the State must step in.  Why would a Department delay a process that really needs to be sorted very fast in order to prevent the closure of essential services?  This aspect does not just relate to nursing homes but can apply to other areas as well where, due to delays in Departments in dealing with an issue, there are huge consequences, which is exactly what has happened in this case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.470" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#R02600"><p>It would be very undesirable if delays in Departments caused the closing down of essential services.  By and large, the fair deal scheme works very well.  The scheme is administered on behalf of the Department of Health.  There are differences between private and public within the scheme.  Some of those differences relate to the complexity and composition of care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.471" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#R02700"><p>That is not correct.  For example, if a private nursing home decides to take in someone today and the health of that person deteriorates over the next three or four years, then the standard of care provided and time required to provide that care will increase but the home does not get any increase in the payments to it in three or four years' time, whereas it is a different scenario in a public nursing home.  I do not accept that there is a difference although there is some difference in certain cases.</p><p>However, we have a scenario where 16 private nursing homes have closed because they could no longer provide the service with the funding they were getting.  We also have a situation where a Department has &euro;49 million in funds which is designated for private nursing homes and the private nursing homes have not been told how that is going to be administered and when, all while they are under pressure.  It should be remembered that a private nursing home has a good deal of expenditure that a public nursing home does not have, for instance public liability insurance, whereas all the public nursing homes are covered by the HSE insurance.  Private nursing homes have commercial rates which must be paid to local authorities.  The average 50-bed private nursing home is paying out on average &euro;120,000 per annum between those two items.  There is funding available in the Department but the Department is not saying how it is going to deal with the private nursing homes.</p></speech>

The responsibility for looking after the people who are now in private nursing homes will then come back to the HSE and the public nursing homes, which may not have capacity.  We also have the other problem.  For example, I spoke to a person yesterday whose family member has been in a hospital bed for nine months because they cannot get a care facility to take on the person who needs a certain level of care but does not need hospital care.  There is a huge cost.  The average cost in a hospital is &euro;8,000 per bed per week.  We are talking about nine months of that and the problem is still not resolved.  The question is about timing and about getting funding out to where people are prepared to provide the care.</p></speech>

Where that is not operating, that is a considerable concern.  We can follow up on the specific question with the Department of Health.</p></speech>

I regret to tell the Secretary General that I am very worried by the presentation and the answering of my questions earlier, and Deputy Murphy built upon it.  Mr. Moloney needs to appreciate that, from our point of view, the public has no confidence in our State's ability to deliver on capital infrastructure.  I cannot blame the public for that.  If we look at all the major public transport infrastructure projects in the country that have been proposed, shelved and cancelled and all the issues that have arisen with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the planning system itself, there are so many problems.  It is hard to know where to start.  Above all else, it is hurting the economy.  The Department has had, between 2015 and 2017, a review of more than &euro;40 billion in expenditure and more than 80 spending review papers.  In regard to the questions I asked today, while Mr. Moloney answered them, I regret to say he did so very poorly when it came to those efficiencies.  I am particularly interested in capital infrastructure which, outside of the Department of Health, is one of the biggest users of the capital in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it is where we can make efficiencies.  Will Mr. Moloney take another opportunity to tell the Committee of Public Accounts how we are going to deal with the extraordinary mess our country has when it comes to building basic infrastructure such as roads and rail?  Will he give us any further outline of what is underway and what is being proposed rather than giving us sentiments that something needs to be done about it?</p></speech>

The spending review papers predominantly relate to current expenditure, so they are probably not as relevant to the national development plan, NDP.  Within capital expenditure, we have the public spending code which requires business cases to be created in regard to particular capital projects.  That is important.  We have seen from international evidence that setting out planning correctly and specifying and costing a project at an early stage is a very positive indicator of delivering that project on budget and on time.  We know that is very challenging in regard to bespoke or megaprojects.  It is less challenging in regard to more standardised projects.  We are very conscious of that.</p> <p>  In regard to the issues raised by the Deputy on planning, I accept that planning is an issue that needs to be constantly reviewed and overseen.  I have pointed out that there is a major project on planning currently being undertaken by the-----</p></speech>

There was a focus on four areas.  We received a minute from the Minister in reply to those recommendations, as would be normal, on 7 October.  We normally get a response saying "Yes" or "No", it can be done, will be done or why it cannot be done.  In this case, however, we did not get any answer in regard to two of the issues, nor did the Department give a commitment to provide any further responses.  That minute would have been signed off by the Minister who was presumably advised by Mr. Moloney.  I noted that in regard to recommendation 2, which was about the corporate governance division of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media and which recommended that it should continue to monitor RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s response to the findings of the Eversheds report, which related to the classification of employees at RT&Eacute;, and report to the committee on its views of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s responses to the findings of that review, the Department did not accept or reject the committee&rsquo;s recommendations, nor did it discuss providing the recommended report to the committee.  As I understand it, in my time as a Member, that is without precedent.  Is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform satisfied with that response to recommendation 2 in that report?</p> <p>  Recommendations 6 and 7 called on the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media to provide a report to the committee on the means of generating extra income for the Exchequer in regard to broadcasting and exploring measures for RT&Eacute; to reduce its dependence on Exchequer funding.</p><p>The Department did not accept or reject our recommendations nor did it discuss providing the recommended report to the committee.  Is this an attempt to brush off the Committee of Public Accounts?  This is what it looks like to me.  What accountability do Departments and public bodies have to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the implementation of committee recommendations and responses to them?</p><p> What is the view of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the responses provided in the minute of the Minister given that none of the recommendations have been accepted or rejected and no explanation has been given?  This in the context of circular 01/2011, Revised Instructions for Preparing Material for Inclusion in Minutes of the Minister for Finance on Reports of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Mr. Moloney signed off on this as the assistant secretary at the time.  I am speaking about a response to the committee.  When the committee does a report and makes recommendations, we do not want to waste our time.  These are important issues.  We expect that at least note is taken of the recommendations.  If they cannot be implemented, we want clear explanations as to why.  If they are being implemented, that is good news and we want to hear about it.  It is not acceptable that such a response as we have received would come back.</p><p> Circular 01/2011, which Mr. Moloney signed off, states the committee may consider minutes in public session and if it is not satisfied with the responses to the recommendations it may pursue the matter further with the Minister for Finance.  The circular also states the committee may seek to debate the matter in the D&aacute;il.  There should be a response to every recommendation stating whether it is accepted or not and why.  The circular was signed off by Mr. Moloney.  Appendix 1 states every recommendation should have a response stating whether or not it is accepted and the reasons.  This has not been done.  As Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, what is Mr. Moloney's view on this?  The committee is basically being told that its report and recommendations are irrelevant.  They are being neither accepted nor rejected.  There is no engagement or explanation.  What is the opinion of Mr. Moloney on all of this?</p></speech>

This is not to mention the licence fee that it collects.  It has responded to us.  Mr. Moloney has a role as Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  His Department has accountability to ensure these issues are dealt with.  The Department with responsibility for media has clearly decided, for whatever reason, that it does not have to give us any meaningful response on this.  It has not said "Yes" or "No" to the recommendations.  We made recommendations in good faith after giving these matters serious examination.  The Department has basically brushed us off.  The committee will consider this later.  At this point I do not want to speak for the committee, and committee members have their own views on it.  What I am saying is that we will not let go of this.  This is not acceptable.  As Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, I will not tolerate it.  I want Mr. Moloney to take this up with the Department.  I want him to examine the matter.  I want him to come back with his response to it.  I, and I am sure other members, will revert to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to inform it of this.  Does Mr. Moloney want to make a comment on this?</p></speech>

We can follow up on this issue in whatever way the committee wishes.  Perhaps the issue has not been fully set out in the replies.  It is unusual not to accept or reject a recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is usual to accept such recommendations.  I believe the reason for how the reply is phrased is how various Acts are being interpreted.  We can come back to the committee with more detail on this.</p></speech>

I do not expect it to micromanage RT&Eacute; but it cannot have a hands-off approach when significant amounts of taxpayers' money are being administrated.  I am alerting Mr. Moloney to this.  I would appreciate if he came back to us on it and followed up on it.</p> <p>  That concludes our business for today.  I thank the witnesses for joining us, the departmental staff for the work they did in preparing for today's meeting, and the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for attending the meeting.

This is with regard to the Eversheds Sutherland report on RT&Eacute;.  There is of gun to the head of the staff for this Friday.  Pension entitlements, maternity leave and all the other issues have not been fully worked out.  We should contact the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as a matter of urgency to say this is not fair.

For the Deputy's information, I raised the issue of the RT&Eacute; report and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications in her absence this morning with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The proposal is that we notify the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications that the committee has done work on this and we are concerned about the fact that workers have to make a decision by Friday and want more time.</p></speech>

It received a qualified audit opinion.  As a health body, the accounts give a true and fair view except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements of staff only as they become payable.  That is a standard issue I have pointed out in relation to many health bodies.</p> <p>  No. 2 is the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority. This is a new body and this is the first period of account.  It covers the period from 1 February to 31 December 2021.  This is an 11-month account.  That received a clear audit opinion.  No. 3 is the Arts Council for 2021.  It was a clear audit opinion.  No. 4 is the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund.  That received a clear audit opinion.  No. 5 is the Environmental Protection Agency for 2021.  That received a clear audit opinion.</p></speech>

The Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority is a new body and the State relies heavily on approved housing bodies, AHBs, to carry out functions that might be more correctly performed by the State.  As AHBs are not full State bodies, we should bring in the regulatory authority to work through that and how it will operate, including what the layout of its assets is.  Substantial public funds go into AHBs, and I am very supportive of them, but it would be remiss of us not to keep a very close eye on that area and the regulatory body.  I propose that this be added to the work programme in some form?</p></speech>

The AHBs are now major players in the provision of housing and their regulator is important.  Is Can we agree, therefore, to note this under the financial statements?  Agreed.  As usual, this will be published as part of the committee's minutes on the web page.</p><p>I propose to move on to correspondence.  As previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee meetings and published on the committee&rsquo;s web page.</p><p>The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-up to committee meetings.  No. R1496B is from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 5 October 2022.  It provides information requested by the committee regarding the catering contract to provide meals for Ukrainian refugees.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I had flagged this for discussion.  There was one particular issue with that.  I will bring the Comptroller and Auditor General in on this.  The correspondence in response to our letter states:</p> <blockquote> 	  	<font color="#00201F">The awarding of the specific contract as referenced in your letter is a matter for the relevant Accounting Officer.  The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform includes the provision of guidelines ... [but] does not have a role in evaluating such transactions.</font>  </blockquote> <p>In relation to the tendering process and so on, does Mr. McCarthy wish to comment?  What kind of tendering process was used there?</p></speech>

I suggest that we write to the Department to ask for its view of it, as we are 12 months into this, and to see if the Department has a comment to make on it and how it is operating to date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. R1497B from Mr. Paul O'Connell, on behalf of Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 6 October 2022, provides information requested by the committee regarding Benefacts.  We will note and publish this item.  These are internal working documents, and there was a request that they are not published.  We had agreed that we were going to deal with it in public.  The clerk was speaking with the Department about this and I had a discussion with the clerk yesterday about it.  The Department is okay with us discussing it now, so we will discuss it.  Deputy Catherine Murphy had it flagged for discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.532" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#EE01000"><p>Deputy Murphy is not here.  I am aware that she had a particular interest in Benefacts, on which I supported her.  I note we are not publishing the correspondence but I can refer to it.  Both Deputy Murphy and I were trying to understand why Benefacts was being brought to a close in real terms because we were not funding it any longer and we sought more information about why that might be.  I will not read directly from the document but I will refer to it.  It seems there is a recognition in the Department that the Benefacts service was worth preserving.  It seems the discussion was that it did not have sufficient scope or control over the project and this is why it was unhappy with the grant system.  Having read through it all, it is not clear why we have decided to truncate or end that service.  It does not seem that what is being proposed is similar or equal.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy is not here, perhaps we could roll this discussion on to the next meeting.  There is more work to be done here.  We are losing an important service in the context of transparency and, reading between the lines here, I believe civil servants recognise that.  There is a recognition of that in the correspondence.  There is more work to be done here.  I do not know what the work should be.  If the Department does not want us to publish the correspondence, can we even have this matter on the work programme?  I am not sure.</p></speech>

The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform this morning confirmed that he had referred to and used the service in the past.  He said that other Departments and bodies have benefited from it as well.  This matter puzzles me because the cost of Benefacts over six or seven years was roughly &euro;6 million.  My concern is that the proposal to replace it is through Pobal.  Again, I am open to correction on this but Pobal is saying clearly that it does not have the resources or staff to deal with this.  In any case, to get a database like Benefacts back up and running again would result in a time lag.  What happens in the interim?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.534" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#EE01200"><p>That gap will end up costing us money if we are to resource that system.  I understand the point about Pobal.  I understand it more now that we have seen this correspondence insofar as the Department believes there is a gap in oversight or a gap in the scope of sufficient control.  I do not have any serious evidence here to argue with it over that but it is not immediately obvious to me that Pobal would be the organisation to bridge that gap, or that it would assume this role, because I am not aware that it has done this kind of work in the past.  We should keep this matter on the books because I am not happy with this answer.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The funding for Benefacts is a small enough amount of money relative to funding for many other areas.  The service was widely used and to lose it like this is a loss to the State.  We will put it in the work programme for next week.</p><p> The next item of correspondence is No. R1498B from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 7 October 2022.  It concerns the minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to our report on our examination of Vote 29, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, programme B, broadcasting, for 2019, and Vote 33, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media for 2020.  The minute of the Minister is the official response to the recommendations of the committee.  We raised this matter with the Secretary General this morning and it is clear the minute is not in line with the Department's own circular, which I quoted to him.  That circular, which was signed off by Mr. Moloney, provides that the minute should respond to every recommendation, stating whether that recommendation has been accepted or not and the reasons for same.  That has not been done in regard to any of the recommendations in our report.</p><p> It is open to us to take this matter up with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We could also write to the Accounting Officer for the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and request an explanation for the poor quality of the response.  In addition to failing to comply with the circular, a number of the committee's requests are not directly addressed.  That is the situation and, as I said, I raised it with Mr. Moloney earlier.  Do any members wish to comment?</p></speech>

Members might reflect on the correspondence and the minute of the Minister, which were circulated, and we will come back to them.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is R1501B from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 10 October 2022, providing further information requested by the committee in regard to the summary report on climate action plan targets.  Deputy Catherine Murphy flagged this item for discussion.  I also want to raise an issue relating to the estimated cost of the climate action plan, which, according to the report produced by McKinsey &amp;amp; Company, is &euro;119 billion out to 2030, much of which will come from the public purse.  We looked for more information on that and what we got was a two-page summary document that gives headline figures.  The question that arises for me is whether this is really the only breakdown the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has.  It seems to be very scant.  We are dealing with expenditure of &euro;119 billion by 2030.  If this breakdown is the basis for rolling out the climate action plan that has been adopted by the Oireachtas, I am concerned about the lack of detail and information.  There is the question even of how the information has been arrived at.</p> <p>  The document seems very light on detail, facts and specifics, as I said, and I wonder whether we should look for more information on it.  Members will see the figures on pages 1 and 2.  The &euro;119 billion estimate covers the total investment required for the next nine years across electricity, transport, built environment, industry and agriculture.  It also includes investment that is redirected, including spending on electric vehicles and adaptation of internal combustion engine vehicles, as well as incremental investment in retrofits.  Does anyone wish to comment on this?  What we got is very light on detail.</p></speech>

A point to note is that there is not a lot of discussion around the impact of land use on the plan, which is a major part of it.  When much of this was agreed in the past few months, there was a suggestion the land use aspect would come about in the next 18 months.  There definitely is a lack of information.  We should, as a committee, be expecting a bit more detail.</p></speech>

Under electricity and power generation, which is one of the big headings, it looks like a very low figure of &euro;1 billion or less out of the &euro;119 billion is given for backup capacity.  I wonder whether we might probe that in the context of energy security to see what the figure is based on, whether it is sufficient and if there is more detail on it.  It seems from the graph on page 2 that there is &euro;1 billion for backup capacity, which I presume is what is meant by the reference to dispatchable power.</p> <p>  I propose we write back to the Secretary General seeking more detailed information, specifically in regard to the agriculture aspect.  Deputy Hourigan wants more information on land use and I assume members would also like details on afforestation.  I propose that we also ask for further information on backup power and capacity in electricity generation, including how much is pencilled in for that, what it is based on and how much of that would come from the private sector and how much from the public purse.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

If we look at the building industry at the moment, its workforce is way below the numbers we had in the period from 2000 to 2008.  We cannot deliver a whole lot of projects without having the workforce in place.  I do not see any Department dealing with that issue.  We have talked about training more apprentices and so on but I am not clear that enough is being done to respond to this issue, which we will need to do if we want to deliver on the whole area of building, retrofitting and all of that.  I have spoken to people who applied to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, for instance, and it is only two years later that they are getting a response because of the workload the authority has.  Departments need to look at that issue.  It is grand putting everything that needs to be done in a plan but there is no point in doing so if we know full well it cannot be delivered without a workforce.</p></speech>

However, he makes a fair point.  There are 27- and 28-month waiting lists for some of those schemes.  It is clear there are workforce pipeline issues and I think there is a policy issue in this regard.  I do not have a problem asking in our letter for the view of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this matter.  As Deputies, we need to raise the issue in the D&aacute;il as well to try to flag its importance.  I and many others have raised the need for more apprenticeships, not just in the traditional trades but right across the board, which would be more like the German model.  People should be able to learn a trade instead of having to do degrees in third level institutions that might not get them into employment as quickly.</p><p>That is not to play one off the other.  It is recognised that there has been a shortage of apprenticeships in this State.  We missed the opportunity from 2008 to 2019 or 2020 to start doing this in a serious way.  I do not know the figures off the top of my head but I know there has been some improvement.  We can include that issue and flag it with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  From a public expenditure point of view, we can ask what consideration the Department gives to workforce planning and pipelines in terms of people being trained when it makes decisions to allocate money.</p></speech>

It recommends that carers be added to the eligible group for work permits.  The recommendation is that 1,000 work permits be issued.  I imagine that strategic group is working across all sectors.  We should at least try to find out if that is the case.</p></speech>

Under the Department's approach to section 56 and section 39 organisations, the national pay agreement does not automatically apply to staff in that sector.  In the longer term, this poses challenges to recruitment and retention in those areas.  Deputy Burke made a valid point that, beyond apprenticeships and such, it is about the broader package of how we retain and attract people to public bodies.</p></speech>

The figure given looks like &euro;23 billion, with between &euro;9 billion and &euro;13 billion under another heading of electricity generation, with &euro;1 billion for backup generation.  It is proposed that we also raise the need for availability of workforce training and a pipeline of people coming through and ask if this is being taken into account.  It is also proposed to ask if the Department has had discussions with the relevant Departments that come under the headings of electricity, power generation, transport, buildings and industry and agriculture.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1502B and is also from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is dated 11 October and provides the information requested by the committee on the proposed building standards regulator and the national building control management project.  This arose from our consideration of the minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which responded to the recommendations in the committee's report on its examination of the appropriation accounts for Vote 34, housing, planning and local government.  It is proposed to note and publish that correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 4 is the work programme.  At last week's meeting, we agreed to proceed with a schedule of engagements to Christmas and the secretariat is working to make the necessary arrangements.  We also agreed to schedule a meeting with An Bord Plean&aacute;la after Christmas.  Next week, we will engage with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p> <p>  Deputy Hourigan asked that we add a meeting with the regulator of the approved housing sector to the work programme.

I am the reform manager and I am joined by Dr. Niamh Lally, principal investigator for the service reform fund, SRF and action research programme.  I will talk about how Genio has developed a methodology for the training programme to support system reforms.</p> <p>  As part of the SRF, Genio advised on reform strategies, supported the implementation of change and provided resources from a fund of &euro;45 million comprising public and philanthropic resources to implement change across the fields of disability, mental health and homelessness.  Flagship projects of the SRF include Housing First in homelessness, individual placement and support in mental health and people to moving from congregated settings to communities in disability.  These have all been rolled out nationally.  The way we work is to support change over a specific period of time, build capacity and then step back.</p> <p>  All of Genio&rsquo;s work has two core features.  The first is the voice of the person.  People using services and supports should be at the heart of the design, implementation and evaluation of services.  Central to everything Genio does is the belief that services and supports should be shaped to the greatest extent possible by the people using them.  This co-production not only ensures that services have more impact, it can also help to accelerate social service reform processes by articulating clearly the expressed will and preference of those using the services.</p> <p>  The second feature of Genio's work is a methodology for enabling change within complex, challenging systems.  Realising rights can be a challenging process.  Large, complex social and health services often get stuck in inappropriate models of support.  Negative perceptions of people using services as lacking capacity and being vulnerable can result in people being excluded from mainstream society and being denied the relationships and sense of self-fulfilment we all take for granted.  Genio has developed a model of intervention to help services re-orientate towards community-based, self-directed supports and to overcome deeply institutionalised practices.</p> <p>  We will concentrate our statement on the component of the SRF which focused on supporting people from ten large congregated settings to live fulfilling lives in the community.  This work of the SRF was carried out between 2016 and 2022 hand in hand with the HSE national disability team.  The methodology was based on approaches Genio has been supporting service providers to implement since 2008. These ten sites were prioritised by the HSE as many had received highly-critical HIQA reviews and were considered to be in need of urgent interventions.  The focus of this programme, in line with Government policy, was to build self-directed, community-based services for these people in accordance with their will and preference and to support them to move from congregated settings to mainstream communities. </p> <p>  Prior to the SRF, the Genio Trust supported a large number of demonstration projects on community living and developed evidence on the impact and efficacy of community-based living.  In 2013, a team led by an international expert in disability studies, Professor Roy McConkey, produced a report analysing the impact of supporting people with intellectual and physical disabilities and people with significant mental health challenges to move from congregated to community settings.  The study followed the lives of 160 people over three points in time and found that the personalisation of accommodation had significant impacts on the people's degree of independence, social integration and anxiety.  One of the key findings was that staff and families were often supportive especially once they saw these significant improvements.</p> <p>  In response to the challenges of implementing change to transform congregated services to community-based, personalised services Genio has developed training courses in supported self-directed living, SSDL, over the past six years.  This training radically changed the assumptions that front-line staff held about people they supported.  SSDL is an intensive approach spread over nine months where staff engage in discovery around people's wishes and supports them to achieve a good life as much as possible with other people in society.  SSDL was adapted from social role valorisation in the US.  It was central to our capacity building programme under the SRF as we provided training, information and expertise to individuals, families and service providers.  The HSE identified having &ldquo;change teams&rdquo; working within services who have dedicated time to implement and lead new models of supports, as central to the successes of the SRF.</p> <p>  The number of people supported to move went far beyond the original targets with 370 people moving from these ten facilities over the period against an initial target of 163 people.  Perhaps more importantly, the people were supported in ways shaped by their expressed will and preference in line with international best practice.  The key to this was an intensive, rigorous process of training for staff, many of whom became champions of change in this process.</p> <p>  In 2016, the SSDL training was redesigned for senior managers and front-line staff due to a tight timeline and because ambitious numbers of people were to be supported to move into communities as a result of the HIQA reports.  Therefore this training was tailored to the specific challenges in the these congregated settings.  In many ways this training restructured how staff viewed the people they were supporting.</p> <p>  Stories were recorded and proactively shared during the time we supported them under the SRF.  One example I will share is that of a man from the south of the country who lived in a large institution for more than 30 years and is a wheelchair user.  This man has now retired.  During the discovery process as part of the SSDL training, staff got to know this man in a different way as they were able to spend one-on-one time with him to identify his will and preferences.  His wishes were to move back to his home town community to be near his siblings and to have a garden where he could have his own plants and grow some vegetables.  A suitable home was identified in the community and staff supported this gentleman to make weekly visits to the local area, make connections and get to know the area facilities such as the post office, library, etc.  This gentleman has now moved to his new home in the community.  He has also joined the local choir and regularly attends the local GAA club to support his local team.  He has learned to cook for himself and enjoys spending time in his wonderful, colourful garden, where his family comes to visit him regularly.</p> <p>  In addition to the SSDL training, an action research approach was used to support and inform the expansion of a community-of-practice, focused on overcoming the challenges of implementing reform of services from congregated settings to community-based services.  Interviews were conducted with staff who had been involved in closing congregated settings and establishing community-based supports.  A case-study was developed and leaders who had implemented change provided guidance to others on how to overcome challenges and transform their services.</p> <p>  Criteria-based funding was developed in partnership with the HSE national disability team and approved by the Genio Trust to finance the "community connection" component of the change process.  This funding enabled staff trained in SSDL to explore ideas with individuals who were being supported to move to the community.  In partnership with the HSE, regular visits were facilitated to the ten services to monitor and review progress and payments were only made when agreed targets and milestones were reached.  Many of the services moved from being heavily criticised by HIQA to receiving praise for the quality of their community-based services.</p> <p>  We have learned three lessons from the implementation of change in supporting people to move to mainstream, community-settings.  One was clarity of purpose.  The SRF employed assessment criteria to access funding and required supports to be self-directed and provided in mainstream community-settings.  It was an ambitious programme to help services transform the way they support people.  The fact that the funding was tied to specific targets and quality of engagement enabled a creative pressure for change.</p> <p>  The second lesson relates to changing ingrained beliefs and practices.  It must be recognised that shifting models from group-based, medicalised, congregated services to community-based, self-</p> <p>directed services is highly challenging.  Staff needed to have the opportunity to consult with the people using the services in their everyday practice for meaningful engagement.</p><p>When afforded this opportunity with a robust evidence based engagement methodology, the reform programme paved the way for front-line staff to see the people they support in a new light.  Through this process staff biases and assumptions about the people they support were brought to light in a constructive way.  Across the programmes participants expressed cases of being astounded and shocked at the change in their perception of people&rsquo;s capacities and capabilities.</p><p> Finally, I refer to adapting to overcome challenges and sharing lessons.  Individual services need to build their capacities to be able to avoid challenges.  The change teams that led the change processes within services learned from each other in communities of practice about how to avoid challenges emerging from human resources, finance and sourcing accommodation to implement the high quality reform work.  During the lifetime of the service reform fund, many workshops, information sessions and webinars were held by the HSE national office and supported by the Genio action research team to share the learnings.</p><p> I again thank the committee for inviting us.  We are happy to discuss this programme of work further and answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

At Crann we have a unique solution focused on a co-ordinated care plan and wrap-around services for the whole family, enabling them to not only deal with these issues but to thrive.  This is our two generation, 2Gen, approach.  The Crann Centre, based in Ovens, County Cork, was established in 2014.</p> <p>  Our clients include children, adults and families living with spina bifida, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, arthrogryposis, acquired spinal injuries and stroke.  These are complex conditions which significantly impact on the fabric of the family requiring lifelong clinical care and intensive in-community supports.  There are more than 7,000 people in Munster living with a neuro-physical disability.  In addition, there are more than 20,000 family members whose lives are impacted, all requiring services and supports.  Nationally this number increases to almost 100,000.  We currently support 300 Munster-based families and our strategic vision is to support more than 600 families in the next three years.</p> <p>  Our services focus on six key areas comprising health and continence; psychological well-being; mobility; education and career pathways; community and networks; and independent living.  In a few moments our colleagues at Ascend will share details of the 2Gen approach and how a network of organisations across the United States use it to help improve family well-being.  Crann is the first organisation in the Ascend network and the first in Europe to adapt this 2Gen approach for disability services.  Why?  It is because disability affects all family members and if the person with the disability is to thrive, it is not enough for them to get the supports they need.  Their parents, carers and siblings need supports too.  This is why our 2Gen approach works, because it serves all family members simultaneously.</p> <p>  Our key strategic priority is building a sustainably-funded organisation.  We are totally reliant on fundraising.  We do not receive any annual statutory funding.  An equitable level of statutory support is a key priority for us.  We have submitted a comprehensive business case to the HSE for a service level agreement, SLA, for our continence clinic.  This service is recognised by the HSE team, consultants, urologists, clinicians and community health doctors as being a unique and vital addition to services for children, adults and families.  Our referrals are increasing weekly.  Without the modest annual funding set out in the business case, we cannot guarantee the future of this vital service, which is not available elsewhere.  We know that our services are saving the HSE significant money, up to &euro;100,000 for each pressure wound, which we prevent from ultimately requiring hospitalisation.  We recently completed a social return on investment evaluation, SROI, which showed that for every &euro;1 we spend on services our clients receive &euro;4 in value, a 400% return on investment.</p></speech>

It is an honour to join the Chairman, Deputies, Senators and colleagues from Washington DC on the ancestral land of the Piscataway people.  On behalf of our founding executive director, Anne Mosle, and our managing director, Marjorie Sims, along with our network partner colleagues at the Crann Centre, I thank the committee for this opportunity to speak about Ascend at the Aspen Institute and the two generation, or 2Gen, approach.</p> <p>  In 2010, in the aftermath of the great recession our founder, Anne Mosle, set out to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty and intentionally foster the well-being of children and the adults in their lives together.  Our work from day one has honoured lived expertise and encompassed racial, gender and economic equity with an intersectional lens.</p> <p>  Ascend at the Aspen Institute brings together diverse leaders working across systems and sectors to create a society where every family flourishes.  We have been building a national network to surface and spread innovative 2Gen approaches in communities across the United States.  Today, the Ascend network includes 479 partners in every state in the US, as well as DC and Puerto Rico, and now reaches across the globe through our only European partner, the Crann Centre, and two other international partners.  Together this movement of parents, practitioners, policymakers and philanthropists are working to transform systems impacting more than 10 million families.</p> <p>  Many programmes focus solely on the child or the parent, but 2Gen approaches do not focus exclusively on either a child&rsquo;s development or isolate an adult&rsquo;s needs, because their wellbeing is interconnected and interdependent.  2Gen approaches aim to integrate services and supports to move the whole family forward, benefitting both the child and the adults in their lives.  2Gen approaches recognise whole family units, as families define themselves.  By design, we seek to understand the multiple dimensions of family life and consider a variety of pathways for promoting effective outcomes for everyone.  We work with families as experts and meaningfully engage parents and caregivers in designing policies and programmes that affect them.  Our goal is to develop holistic, integrated and equity-focused solutions.</p> <p>  A 2Gen approach can take many forms in policy and practice.  One example of such an approach would be a care centre providing young children with early childhood education opportunities while also offering a workforce development programme for parents and caregivers.  The Crann Centre is undertaking this important work by recognising the needs of both children with disabilities and their caregivers.</p> <p>  In 2012, in partnership with a group of philanthropic partners, Ascend published the Two Generations, One Future report that laid the groundwork for the growth and development of the 2Gen field.  Over the last decade of accomplishments and learnings from our network, Ascend has advanced 2Gen approaches with more than ten US Governors' Cabinets, more than 100 fellows from across human services, non-profit, and philanthropic systems, and has engaged more than 60 parent advisers to translate their lived experience into new policies and programmes.  We are thrilled to be partnering with the Crann Centre on advancing 2Gen for families with disabilities and creating a new way of working to lift up these families' strengths and centre their voices in the systems designed to serve them.</p></speech>

From what I have heard, I have much to learn because a lot of it was not familiar to me.  I have not been on this committee for long and I am trying to learn what is happening across the country.</p><p>When I was listening to the statements, I got the impression that much of this is Munster based in terms of the activities.  There is much philanthropy in terms of support and funding.  Applications have been made to the Departments to get more stable funding, which is essential for all of the organisations.  I found the 2Gen approach interesting in that it takes in family members, including the person who has the disability.  I would like to hear a bit more about this because it seems to be a very good approach.  My experience has been that in many cases when people who have a disability, whether an intellectual or a physical disability, get older, we often find that those around them die or move on and they are left on their own.  They have no family supports around them.  I often see this in my constituency.  While much of what we have heard here is about the structures around that person, I find that people are left isolated.  How do we deal with that?</p><p> In terms of housing, as was mentioned, research was done on people who were living in complexes, where there would have been a significant number of people with disabilities, and who ended up in the community.  I refer to HAIL Housing, for instance, which provides mental health and others supports.  I would have thought that was a good model.  However, the witnesses focused on trying to get people back to the areas they are from.  I am curious about the attitude to these types of complexes and what people think of them.</p><p> Many of the things I have heard here are new to me.  The 2Gen approach is very interesting and it has come mainly from America.  It has been imported here through Crann.  Are there any plans to expand this further?  Obviously, the economic issue is a big one but are there plans to expand this?  In Munster, it has grown from 300, with a target of up to 600 over the next couple of years.  Maybe the witnesses will explain to us whether it is possible to expand this over the next while.</p></speech>

The 2Gen for Ireland is a new model.  It is very well proven with ten years of evidence-based work in the United States.  From the Crann perspective, it has been a great privilege to work with Ascend at the Aspen Institute to adapt the 2Gen to serve people with disability.  In terms of numbers, first and foremost, it was about establishing the project and bringing value to lives, the lives of all the family.  Second, it was about creating the model of care that we can evidence base ourselves, or proving the model.  That was stage two.  It was about serving the families well and proving the model.  On the idea of expansion, the answer is very much a "Yes".  However, we need to get to proof of concept for this model first.  We need to be able to show people and service users that this is a very good way and a better way to serve people.  It is cost effective and it works in the community.  The answer to the question on expansion is "Yes" but in time.</p></speech>

They would have worked with people who were interested in moving into the community and their families.  They would have put in applications to us which were assessed against specific criteria.  Once the funding had been received, staff were employed to work with those individuals in a different way to source suitable accommodation in the community for their needs.  The services then had the challenging piece of unbundling funding within the services to support that person in the community.  Some people have quite complex needs and sometimes many adaptations were required in the home.  The services would have worked with each individual around that piece in terms of sourcing what they needed.</p> <p>  The important thing around the training that was provided, in terms of supported self-directed living training, was that staff were trained to support and work with individuals in a different way.  It was not the medicalised model.  It was more around the preference and needs of the person.</p> <p>  We started small and then we grew bigger.  With the service reform fund, we look at whole large institutions around that reform piece.  We started small.  We became champions for change and learned from experiences and used the stories to help and support other people who wanted to move.</p></speech>

I listened to the questions Deputy Ellis put.  Members find that at times, there is a huge difficulty for people with disabilities, in that there are no clear pathways as to how they can get the supports they need to live independently.  I do not know how this can be dealt with but there is a repeated request for people to prove they have a disability.  There is not a standard way of assessing people's needs across the country.  It is different in different locations.  How can we have a more caring and understanding approach to people with disabilities?  Part of this is that we are trying to provide supports to everyone without trying to provide individual supports to people who need them.  It is a difficulty, in that we are taking a one solution fits all approach, which does not work with disabilities.</p> <p>  There are huge gaps.  The idea of having people living independently, having a set up for them and what is being done in Cork is great.  How does that become national policy?  How can we help it become national policy and become a standard?  How do we track the success or otherwise of the project as it evolves?  If the service was to grow, how could it be monitored to make sure it is still delivering a high-class service and doing what it was set up to do?  As we roll things out further and do them nationally, they get lost and we do not get the results for people with disabilities.</p> <p>  This may be is a cultural change we have to try to get around, and I am getting around it, but instead of looking people's disability, we should look at their different abilities.  How do we harness that to have people living independently?  One of the biggest fears families, especially parents, who have a member with a disability have is around what will happen when they pass away and who will be the person's guardian.  Those are my thoughts.  I thank the witnesses who may have some responses for me.</p></speech>

Everyone is unique and individual and every support system is really different.  Our model of support entails putting a lot of training into supporting staff to work and support people in a different way in the community.  That is not only for paid staff.  We look at natural connections within the community where people can link into communities where they came from and with family members and friends.  It is not only about moving from an institution into the community; it is also about that ongoing support and review to make sure people's preferences have been listened to.  Our model of support is in terms of that ongoing capacity-building for staff because they are the people in the community who are paid to check in on individuals as well as friends and family.</p> <p>  One of the things we have done to ensure it is long-lasting is that we have supported the HSE through funding to continue supported self-directed living training.  In other large institutions, staff can now commence this training.  We also bring staff together on a community of practice so that they can learn from one another and share ideas.  It is very important that everybody who  moves into the community has that ongoing natural support and paid support, if needs be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.569" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niamh Lally" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022102000002#E00200"><p>The questions raised about that national policy, how it can be monitored and safeguarded and how one tracks success is very much about embedding a sense of curiosity within the system and among the practitioners and the staff who are within and run the services and who are very passionate about them.  Part and parcel of what we do in Genio is really about that process.  Everybody in this room knows that decongregation or shutting down long-term institutions, not just the buildings, but the institutional practices and ways of working, is very difficult.  It is a very challenging arena to be working in.  Part of the process that we bring in Genio is that curiosity through an action research process.  That is very much about asking people how they are experiencing their service, what their lives are like and about their practices and putting those at times undiscussable things back on to the table, that is, things that go unsaid and the practices that are not unearthed.  In this arena there are very strong and very different views because there are so many stakeholders involved.  However, it is about giving people that airtime and that sense that they are being heard and that they are contribution is valued.  It is really about tapping into the expertise that is already there.</p> <p>  Much of the time there can be a policy implementation gap.  There can be fantastic policies but it is about how you embed them on the ground.  That is very much about tapping into the expertise in the room, working with that coalition of the willing and exposing people to each other and to all that richness that is there in terms of how people want to live their lives, how people want to live in the community and their will and preference and their rights.  It is about trying to bring people who have that expertise together, that, is, the people with lived experiences, the people in use of services, the people with disabilities, the staff, the policymakers and the people with oversight.  It is really about how one co-designs a way forward together, although not necessarily a solution because, as Ms Doheny said, not one solution fits all.  The question is around how one co-designs it and how one can people be brought together.  It is really about embedding that in a way that one can have those fast-paced loops and feedbacks we have with the HSE and the National Disability Office.  It allows us to feedback to them quickly, in terms of what is happening on the ground, what are the good practices and what are the things that are blocking them, so that people can move together in a way that is solution-focused and that moves forward.  That is what one gets in terms of that sustainability piece, that change in practice and that breaking down of institutional barriers.</p></speech>

Is there data to back that up or is it just a softer approach than that?</p></speech>

The process side of things is the action research side of things where one is finding out what is happening on the ground now and feeding that back up, so that we can feed into that loop.  As Ms Doheny mentioned, with the service reform fund, there were criteria attached to that.  There was funding attached to that.  Not everyone got the same funding.  It was weighted differently, depending on the area of the country and on the community health organisation.  That was monitored and tracked over a period of time.</p></speech>

As Dr. Lally said, we did not just divide the pot of money between the organisations or CHOs.  Applications were put in to a grants committee.  Family members sat on that committee and reviewed proposals.  Money was divided out and awarded, based on those proposals and on how many people were going to be supported.  After money was awarded, monitoring and progress around how those individuals were progressing in the community was very much tracked over the three years.</p></speech>

"Disability" is one word but there are many different types of disability, so the one solution does not fit all.  Our model of care in Crann is about looking at people with a neuro-physical disability and how with our wraparound service we bring all the family into that situation and ask what its goal and plan are for the future.  Fundamentally, with the families we meet, what is really of concern to them is around what happens in the future if something happens to them.  We look at that from a whole family perspective and support the family around that.  We also look at the needs of the person with the disability and the needs of the family.  Then with our model and our wraparound services, we build towards giving them skills to achieving those goals.</p> <p>  One of the key areas for us in our service offerings is an independent living module and that develops those life skills from a very young age.  Often people with disabilities may have been over protected as a young child.  Then when they get to the age of transitioning on to third level or on to further education, they do not have the life skills.  Suddenly they are looking to live independently but they do not have the basic skills.  We work with the family from a very young age in bringing on those skills.  We look at adaptations that need to be made, so they can achieve the successes and the goals they want in life.  Another big part of that, and a part of what we do in our model, is around researching that and evidencing that.  I will let our colleagues in Ascend or Mr. P&aacute;draig Mallon speak to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.574" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr P&aacute;draig Mallon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022102000002#E00700"><p>Measurement is built into the 2Gen approach and our colleagues at Ascend can talk about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.575" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarah Haight" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022102000002#E00800"><p>I can share a little bit about the evidence behind 2Gen approaches.  There is a strong and growing body of evidence in the United States.  We know the return on investment in early childhood programmes is as high as 13%.  We also know the greatest predictor of a family's overall economic mobility is the parents' educational attainment.  We know now from brain science that people's brains change and adapt when they become parents, just like babies brains.  This is true of mothers and fathers.  These bodies of research inform 2Gen approaches.</p> <p>  One example of its impact in the United States is Tulsa, Oklahoma, where there is a large early childhood centre called Cap Tulsa.  The leaders at Cap Tulsa realised that many parents of children who were enrolled were seeking greater opportunity, namely, better jobs and wages.  They created an employment training programme in the health field, training parents in nursing and health technology.  In studying the impact of this 2Gen approach, researchers found that the children of parents enrolled in job training had higher rates of school attendance and the parents themselves reported lower rates of stress.  This is applicable to this conversation because what we are seeing is that when the whole family is addressed in its need, in this instance, it is an educational and economic need, there are improved results for both generations.  We like to say that you cannot give one member of the generation a balloon and the other a dead weight.  These types of efforts are gaining momentum across the US and they demonstrate both the effectiveness and the efficiency of 2Gen.</p></speech>

We recently undertook a social return on investment initiative, a valuation of four of our key services.  As we said in the opening statement, that captured from the service users themselves what value the services were delivering for them.  The value they attached to the services they are receiving from the Crann Centre is four times what it costs us to deliver those services.  For every &euro;1 we spend they get &euro;4 in value.  That sort of fiscal-based evidence hopefully points to a situation where you are not just looking at the qualitative aspects of the improvements in terms of life improvements and health and well-being improvements.  We are really focused on measuring that too, and that is why social return on investment analysis is a very effective tool.  It asks the stakeholders what value they would put on the service if it was not available and they had to pay for it.  We are talking about thousands of euro in value for services we would offer, which could be an opportunity to meet with peers.  For families, children and adults, our service provides the opportunity to come together.  Isolation is one of the key issues for people with a disability.  The value they would place on that would be upwards of about &euro;6,000 for a programme that enables them to come together and meet with their families.  We feel very confident that we are able to track and show clear evidence that there is a return on investment by philanthropy or the State.  I think that is rooted in Deputy Canney's question as to how we know that approaches are working and how we can prove that we are delivering value for the funds coming in.</p><p> Social return on investment is one tool among others, but it happens to be quite effective in hearing the voice of the stakeholder and understanding the value to them.  There is no point in delivering services if they do not ultimately deliver value for the person who receives those services.  Not alone is it important to deliver good outcomes but it is also important to be able to evidence for them as well.  That is why the 2Gen approach and the methodology established over ten years through Aspen and Ascend is attractive to us, because it gives us a strategic framework in which to deliver great services but also commitment to measuring and evidencing.</p></speech>

It is important that we continue to highlight the social return on investment, and that if money is being invested, people are benefitting from it and the social return is there.  I say well done.</p></speech>

I read through the opening statements last night and I have a couple of questions.  Moving people from congregated settings is very important work and it is obviously time to move on from congregated settings as the targets were not reached there.  The witnesses talked about the staff in institutions and how being trained to look at things differently and engage with the residents has meant that they looked at their work completely differently.  Would the witnesses say that initially people in congregated settings were being treated almost as patients rather than as residents and that that has changed?  How much more work has to be done to move more people from congregated settings into the community?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.580" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara Doheny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022102000002#F00400"><p>The training was very important.  When we set out with initial pilot projects back in 2018 and when we put out applications for funding, we very quickly realised that staff were not equipped to work with people and to help them move to community in a different way.  They had been used to working and were trained to work in a specific way within the large institution.  They did not have the time to work with people individually to see what their will and preference was.  This was something that we found in the very early days so we consulted with the services and brought some of them together.  They told us they needed training because they wanted to see people move on and wanted to work differently.  Not everybody came on that journey in the early stages, so we engaged in social role valorisation training and over the years that developed training into the nine month training.  That was a key ingredient to help staff understand and learn more about the people they were supporting, not only in a medical model.  We were given some examples when out on visits where some people would have been on medication and then through the new discovery process, they had reviewed medication and that person no longer needed it.</p> <p>  Some of the most ingrained staff in institutions who are now the best champions for change went on that journey in the training.  Not everybody stayed, some people felt this was not for them.  We have to realise as well that within the large institutions there are cleaners, cooks and gardeners.  Some of them came on the journey and did the training as well, so they were community connectors.  That is what they were seen in terms of supporting people in the community.  If they needed support medical support, they go to the local GP or the local nurse to get that support, but certainly the key ingredient was that training.  I refer to the community of practice that came out of training and the learning from the other services of what was and was not working.  Small things came up like how we work petty cash and transport when we move to community.  All these small things were huge when they were moving from an institution out to community living.  They were all issues that had to worked through and ironed out.  The staff themselves worked that out.  There might have been another service further along the tracks that was able to help and provide support.</p> <p>  For people who have now moved to the community, it is really important that that ongoing support, monitoring and review in terms of the discovery continues for the individual people.  Everybody's needs change over time, so it is important that staff are trained to recognise that and to continue to review.  The Deputy is right that there are more people in large institutions and training needs to continue, and the HSE national team is continuing that training through the service reform fund.  That will be finishing up next year for the next cohort of people moving out of the large institutions.</p> <p>  Obviously there are some barriers around housing access, and suitable housing at the moment.  That is a huge challenge.  However, when we started this journey through the service reform fund we were fortunate there was accommodation available and the people were able to move in and we were able to use to the stories around the successes to support and to share with others.</p></speech>

There are many different routes as to how people access our services, because of the range of services we offer, particularly our continent service.  That has gotten a referral pathway where the hospitals, consultants and local health services refer into our continent service.  People can self refer, but as we have grown over time and people have begun to know us, they certainly come more and other people like rehabilitation centres are referring to us to support the family because of the services we offer.  We are not just a medical model.  The range of services we have, because we are living and following the Aspen 2Gen model, really focus on the family, so quite often we have people who maybe have a child or older adult with a disability but we would support their family as opposed to just supporting that person.  Many of our services are supporting the parents and siblings, and maybe supporting the carers in the community or the special needs assistants in the schools.  This is all to support the family unit to make life that bit easier for them.</p></speech>

In the last 12 months we have grown 75% in terms of people.  As we are becoming known and as our services are growing, the demand is certainly increasing.  We are currently serving 305 families but if you average that out at about four per family and if we are serving the whole family, which we do, you could be talking more than 1,000 people that we are potentially servicing.  They are accessing our psychological support services, our continence service, our occupational therapy, OT, services and our independent living services, as well as our community services.</p><p>We were fortunate this year in that we opened our first inclusive, fully-accessible playground where all the family can come together and play.  That is really important because many parties or similar events cannot happen because the kids cannot go as they are not accessible.  We have kids parties where the whole class can come and play as a unit along with the family.  It is the ripple effect.  That is our model.</p></speech>

When this project began in 2014, it started with the research.  We hired a research doctor to do a needs assessment because the core part of this project from day one has been the voice of the stakeholder.  Once we identified the stakeholders' needs, we developed a project in response.  I looked for a model of care that could respond to what the research showed us.  The original piece of research completed in 2014 or 2015 was a revelation.  It showed that the primary concern for our stakeholders, which I thought would be clinical, was not clinical, but was social isolation.  I then began to look for a model of care that addressed the whole family, because social isolation was affecting the whole family.  It meant they did not engage in the community they lived in and instead of being proactive members of the community, they were marginalised.  I found the Aspen 2Gen model of care in the United States from a connection I had with United Way in central Indiana, which was using the 2Gen model.  It was my eureka moment.  We are the first to employ the 2Gen model for disability in Ireland.  We would love to prove the model of the evidence-based platform of data and for people to copy us or expand the programme.</p></speech>

I support people with disabilities living in their community.  It is important and it is great that we have that focus.  Will Ms Buckley describe her experience as the parent of a child with a disability and how the Crann Centre supports her to live in her community?  Will Ms Jarvey speak about her motivation for founding the Crann Centre?  What needs is she addressing that are not being met by other organisations?  Deputy Tully touched on that.  Ms Cahill referred in her opening to the SLA for a continence clinic.  Will she describe this service and what contribution it makes to care in the community?  To go back to Ms Jarvey, what was the basis for adopting the 2Gen model?  What evidence does Ms Haight have to support the effectiveness of the 2Gen approach?  What are the long-term impacts?  That is important as we go forward.  It is all about learning.  I am in CHO 5, so it is important for me to listen and learn today.

She has spina bifida and hydrocephalus and she is a full-time wheelchair user.  We were probably the first people at Crann's door when it opened.  From when she was born, our biggest hope was that she would be as independent as possible and achieve her full potential.  When we knocked on Crann's door, it was fantastic for the entire family.  Crann's doors opened at a transition phase for Niamh.  She was moving on to secondary school, which was a time of huge stress in our house because she was moving from a very small school to a much bigger school.  She had also moved into a wheelchair full-time at that point, which brought its own challenges.  She did not know how to use a wheelchair properly.  Straight away, she undertook a mobility programme that taught her how to better navigate her environment.  She also undertook confidence training to ensure her voice would be heard and that she was confident enough to express her feelings.</p> <p>  There were many supports for my family and for me.  My other daughter was approaching the end of her secondary school education at that time and she was hugely worried about Niamh starting off and how she would manage, but those fears were alleviated through the mobility programme.</p></speech>

As the Deputy rightly said, we have made a business case for an SLA within the HSE.  Speaking to Ms Jarvey's point on the research carried out, the need identified by the stakeholders was the lack of community support around bowel and bladder continence services.  We set about addressing this at Crann.  We set up our continence service, which is the only community continence service that covers both bowel and bladder.  It is a sensitive area for us, as a nation, and in our culture to talk about, but it is the elephant in the room when it comes to disability.  If you ask a person with a spinal cord or another type of injury, continence is the biggest factor that causes a lot of ripple effects.</p> <p>  Our continence service has grown exponentially.  In the last year alone, we have seen 75% growth in people attending our service, which is quite substantial.  What we provide is support to the individual.  It is a human right to be able to manage your continence and to go out.  It affects families because they plan their trips and journeys based on where the next toileting facility is.  For the service we provide, we bring in and meet with families and work with them over a period of time.  Our nurses, Eimear and Ita, work with them to come up with a programme that works for them.  Many of our referrals come from hospitals and community settings because we can give the time to provide that support.  The reason it works so well is that, while we have our health and continence service, we are not just a medical model, as Ms Jarvey said, and as came out in the research.  We also provide psychological supports that can go around having continence issues.  We have mobility and occupational therapy services, so if seating or positioning is an issue we can bring that service in.  It is a wraparound service.</p><p>We discovered through working with families that there was a gap in that SNAs in schools were not being trained so our team, including Ita and Eimear, took that on.  Eimear developed an SNA training programme to align with the hospitals.   We are currently the only setting providing SNA training for continence in Ireland.  We have trained 120 SNAs in the past year and a half.</p></speech>

We have recently been accredited by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI so we are now training nurses.  So far we have trained 20 nurses.  Training SNAs is our ultimate goal.  We are providing the service for all of these people free of charge and we are not funded for that.</p></speech>

They are early childhood services; post-secondary or what we often call college or workforce development services; economic assets which includes what kind of public benefits the family might need; social capital including access to networks, individual and institutional supports; and health and well-being.  The Crann Centre's two-generation approach focuses on the health and well-being component but by applying a two-generation lens, it also considers the economic and social needs of the family.  As I noted earlier, in the US we have a lot of evidence about those components, such as the return on investment from early childhood programmes and the knowledge that parents' educational attainment has the greatest impact on the child's overall economic mobility.  We also have evidence of the concept of mutual motivation, which refers to when a child is learning and developing and the child can motivate the parent.  Equally, when a parent is learning and growing, he or she can reinforce subjects and ideas for the child.</p> <p>  We are seeing emerging evidence that children who are part of two-generation approaches are more likely to attend school regularly and read by third grade.  Parents who are engaged in their own dreams and aspirations and who are seen not just as parents, but as whole people with economic and educational aspirations, are more likely to have living-wage jobs and more economic stability for their families.</p> <p>  When we think about evidence, we also think about this from a systems standpoint.  In states and counties in the US where there is a two-generation lens, we see more co-ordination and alignment among systems that aim to serve families.  That results in faster services; services that are more tailored to the unique needs of families; and more dignified treatment of families, recognising their strengths, which we believe will result in better long-term outcomes for those families.</p></speech>

I am a lifelong philanthropist.  It is sort of in my DNA as I hail from the Lilly pharmaceutical family and philanthropy is a strong family tradition so I suppose I am hardwired to be a philanthropist.</p> <p>  I came to live in Ireland in 1997 and was looking for a project that could bring value to lives, prove it was a good way to serve people and eventually provide systems change.  Through personal connections I discovered that services for persons with disabilities in Ireland were fragmented and difficult to access.  Stress on families was compounded by this fragmented care.  That was when my ears pricked up and I thought perhaps there was a project in this area.  We hired a research doctor to carry out the preliminary professional needs assessment in which the voice of the stakeholder was honoured and shone through.  The project then moved forward in line with what the stakeholders needed and wanted.  They told us that, like the rest of us, they do not live in silos and asked that their care not be delivered in silos.  They said that their clinical care should not be separated from their health and well-being because that is not how they, I or anyone lives.  They have disabilities and complex medical needs demanding clinical care but these are all interwoven into people's health and well-being.  That is when the two-generation model came to my attention and I was fortunate to have Ascend take me under its wing and mentor Crann to adapt the two-generation model for disability, and here we are today.</p></speech>

Enabling people to exercise that right requires complex supports, crucially suitable housing and interconnected physical and social facilities.  The HSE's strategy Time to Move on from Congregated Settings: a Strategy for Community Inclusion is moving much too slowly.  The most pressing issue is the more than 1,300 people aged under 65 who are forced into nursing homes because the State will still not support them in community settings.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for helping us to understand how their organisations operate and how their models of support can and should be applied in other settings to help as many people as possible to live independent lives actively in their communities.  As a Cork TD I am familiar with the incredible work that Crann Centre Ireland does in Ovens, County Cork.  Its use of the two-generation approach that recognises whole family units and integrated processes responds to many of the issues that are raised on a weekly basis at this committee.  In his opening statement, Mr. Mallon mentioned that collaboration between a whole series of actors is important in the development of the two-generation approach.  I am aware it has been elaborated somewhat already, but from its experience in the US and Ireland, will the representatives explain some more about the significance of the co-operation?</p> <p>  One of the issues disabled people face here, as the witnesses have mentioned, is a siloed approach with some responsibilities falling under the HSE and others under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Transport or local authorities and so on.  Consistently we see people falling through the cracks.  Will the representatives of the Crann Centre elaborate on the particular challenges faced by people with disabilities living in rural Ireland?  What are their key recommendations to create systematic change?  Can they comment from their experience on what work can be done to simplify and make Government services more accessible?</p> <p>  We are all struck by Genio's emphasis on having the people who will be using the services and supports being at the heart of the design.  That should not be striking.  It is clear that on average the implementation and evaluation of services in Ireland are in no way close to that model.  Ms Doheny mentioned research findings that the personalisation of accommodation had significant impacts on the degree of independence, social integration and reduction of anxiety of people moving from congregated settings.  Will the representatives from Genio elaborate on that point?  How does that approach function on the ground?</p> <p>  Genio's work in helping people to move from congregated settings under the service reform fund in tandem with the HSE is positive and welcome.  From the lessons it has learned in that process, what is the potential for that approach to be rolled out on a much larger scale to support the hundreds of people who are still unfortunately in congregated settings?  Genio has correctly identified that this overall process can be challenging for everyone.  As public representatives we come in contact with cases in which people living in communal settings and their families have a preference to stay there rather than to be moved to community living.  Will Genio share its insights into situations that it might have encountered?</p></speech>

On the last question about how challenging this process is, Genio has been involved with all ten accelerated sites, hand in glove with the HSE and especially with the staff tasked with implementing de-congregation.  What we see from the findings is that it is very challenging.  The Deputy is correct that these congregated settings are in violation of many human rights including the UNCRPD.</p></speech>

It is like going to war and the closure of these places is very difficult.  We are asking people to change long-standing institutional beliefs and practices that have been there over a very long period of time, as Ms Doheny pointed out earlier.  It is not today or yesterday that these congregated settings have been there.  They have been there for generations.  We are asking people to change, to take on new roles, to develop new relationships, new values and very much new behaviours in how they work and how they approach that work.  We are asking people to unlearn many behaviours and when people are managing that kind of change with staff, they can no longer be that buffer.  There has to be that questioning and that time for discomfort.  They have to be able to feel the pinch of that backlash that is coming.  As one can imagine all of that is a highly emotive and an emotionally charged arena to work within.</p> <p>  What we have found from that is that it really is about capacity building, as Ms Doheny said.  It is really about the person at the centre of that and sometimes the person gets forgotten at the beginning of this change process because everything is coming at one.  There are HIQA orders, closure orders and media attention and rightfully so in that context.  When one begins to unpack it and unpack the layers, there are very ingrained beliefs and practices that have been there and have served a purpose for a long period of time.  To bring people around, the staff really need an opportunity and ability to work their way into reform.  Whether that is through fidelity to a model, such as social role valorisation or the supported self-directed living, SSDL, model, Ms Doheny spoke about, they have a life boat and a way of being able to look at it and to change their practice by doing and not by theory, not by a nebulous concept or not by necessarily following a policy about which maybe all staff do not all know, that is, that policy implementation gap they are living in.  That gives them the life boat and that is very much from the person-centred approach, that will and preference of the person.</p> <p>  As Ms Doheny also identified, it is about the time to do that for staff, the resource available and the training required and that the person is at the centre.  All of a sudden one is spending a huge amount of time with an individual.  One staff member told us she had worked with a lady for 30 years in the same setting.  She said that it was only in the last six months that she realised who that lady was.  She said she knew her as a client or as a patient but she never knew her as the individual she was.  That was very telling.</p> <p>  The other aspect is that staff are transformed.  Staff go on this journey but the person is at the centre of it.  The person is the catalyst and the one pushing the agenda, pushing their will and preference and their right to move out into the community, to go back to their families and to go to the local GAA match, all of the things we take for granted.  That gives staff their own journey of discovery and their own way of acting into it.  It is that transformation among staff who have been there for a long period of time.  Much of the time they can have the greatest challenges in moving in this way but when they move, we have found, whether from the research or the service reform fund, they move fundamentally and that transformation can occur.  Again the person is always at the centre of that.</p> <p>  As regards how challenging it is, the research has definitely uncovered just how challenging it is but in terms of how to move that forward, there are many lessons to be learned.  Through the research, we took cases of decongregation, where they were in the middle of it.  They were in the middle of the fire.  We took the lessons learned from persons in charge, community connectors, heads of service, heads of social care and everybody who was in this who had a skin in the game.  What we took from those lessons was around what one does.  As I said, there is no one way to do this.  It is very complex systems change.  There are many voices in the room and there are problems with different solutions.  Using the business case and the Harvard business model, we took a teaching case and we brought people back into the room and told them what had been learned.  It was not about the lessons learned or about the model.  We said that if one is at a fork in the road and one takes the right turn, there are pluses and minuses to that route and that if one takes the left turn, there are pluses and minuses to that route.  We asked what the least harmful scenario within this was.  It was very much taking a business case and taking people around the country and, prior to Covid, bringing them into that workshop facility.  We had huge sessions with 70 to 100 people from different organisations represented.  For the people in the room it was very real and very raw but they could relate to it.  That relatability is very important when people are in the midst of that change.  It is taking the research and taking the lessons learned but making it very applicable and relevant to people.  It is incremental change, so they are able to do something on Monday morning and are able to enhance that practice.</p> <p>  Through Covid-19 we moved those sessions on to webinars and again we ran six sessions in collaboration with the HSE national office so There is that feedback loop going back continuously.  We found that there is no one way to do this but in order for that to sustain and embed it is incremental changes that get made.  It is not very sexy or overly attractive it is that hard grind a lot of the time on the ground with the people.  However it is the transformation in the lives of the people who are bring supported that reall,y staff have said "I am happy to go to work.  I have hope.  I know my practice was less than and very much less than previously.  But I had an a-ha moment and I am able to move forward with that".  They go on a journey then together.  They leave the congregated setting and a lot of the time we say that is really the start line.  People feel that they have arrived and are there but it is really the starting point in terms of community living and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in particular.  I hope I have answered some of Deputy Cairn's questions.</p> <p>  During Covid-19, we moved those sessions to webinars and we ran six sessions all in collaboration with the HSE national office.

Three members from that team worked with us hand in glove, as Dr. Lally said.  We turned up to every meeting together so they picked up all of our tricks of the trade at the same time.  When we set out the criteria for funding, we worked very much in tandem with the HSE.  We said these were the criteria and we asked how these would land with the community health organisations, CHOs, and the senior manager within of each services.  They obviously knew what funding the HSE service providers were getting, so they were able to say when applications came in that they were already getting funding for that and that there was no need to double fund.  Funding was an important aspect of this as well.  I remember going out to one of the services one time.  It said it just could not buy a bus for this.   We said that this was tied to people moving into the community.  We need to be able to track people and see how it is going.</p> <p>  The HSE was involved in the training with us all along.  It came with us on the journey, so it has the skills to continue with this work. As I said in the opening statement, the SSDL training is continuing through the national HSE office and the community practice.  This is an excellent resource to have.</p> <p>  As for people and families who do not want to move, a key thing we ingrained in all the staff was that everybody had the opportunity and chance to work with a staff member in an individualised way and to say what they wanted and that they wanted to explore it.  In the early days, we worked with people who really wanted this and with families who said they wanted a different type of service.  As more  people started to move, other families or individuals who were not maybe as keen said that people had their own house and that they had visited them and asked when they were getting their house and when they could move into the community and do X, Y or Z.  That had a ripple effect.  However, some people said it was not for them and that this was not what they wanted.  Other arrangements were made in terms of moving into other group homes and so on. If there was a HIQA closure order and the building had to close, other arrangements were made.  One thing we said at the outset was that everybody had to have the opportunity to do that one-on-one discovery, or that piece.  That was a key as well, so that nobody got left behind.</p></speech>

She knew of us in Cork, which was good to hear.   In terms of simplifying the services, I would like Ms Buckley to talk about that.  What is really difficult for families, and Ms Buckley will speak about it from experience, is that the search for services and supports and the energy that needs to be put into that.  There are challenges there.  I agree with Deputy Cairns on simplifying the services and maybe Ms Buckley could talk about what it is like on a day-to-day basis trying to find, and get access to, a service.</p> <p>  Ms Cahill will talk about what our model does because we have a wraparound service and we also have that co-ordinated care plan.  We develop a care plan for children, adults and families where they can be signposted to other services.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Cairns's point about collaboration and not duplicating services, Crann has two key founding principles.  We do not duplicate services.  If a service already exists, we do not duplicate it because there is no added value.  Nothing happens or nothing changes for the family; it just adds to that confusion of whether they go to A or B.</p><p>Ms Jarvey commented on the founding of the organisation.  One of our founding principles was that we would not duplicate services.  That has helped us to add value and important services into the mix.  Collaboration is a key principle for us.</p><p> We began offering services in earnest in 2019.  In the beginning when we had a team of two people we recognised we would not be able to do this alone so collaboration was hugely important for us.  We are fortunate to collaborate with Ascend which are attending the committee remotely.  That is an international collaboration which has helped us in giving us a strategic framework.  From the initial contact, we had a ready-made strategic framework which we adapted, so we know the value of collaboration.</p><p> Locally, Ms Cahill and our team collaborate on a day-to-day basis with all the actors in the space offering services and supports for people with disabilities.  Sometimes putting the energy into those collaborations can make a real difference for parents because - Ms Buckley will speak about this - they often do not know where to go next and if we can make a connection for someone through professional contacts, that can alleviate stress.</p><p> In the past three years, we have put a huge amount of energy into developing collaborations with organisations that provide services.  We work with University College Cork, UCC, which gives us access to practical support from the therapy schools.  UCC has helped us to expand our research and in practical ways.  An example of our collaborations with organisations to deliver services involves one of our major initiatives this year when we developed an accessible co-working space for people with disabilities.  As we all know, we have all moved in the past couple of years towards remote working and working either in the home or away from the office.  The Department of Rural and Community Development invested significantly in that area through the National Hub Network.  We looked at that and asked ourselves what we at the Crann Centre could do to provide support and a model where people with disabilities could have access to that new world of work and to the opportunities to collaborate in starting or accelerating their businesses or to work in a business where people want to come together in such a setting.  We were fortunate to be able to collaborate with Cork County Council, Cork City Council, the Open Doors Initiative, Ballincollig Business Association and the rubicon centre at Munster Technological University, MTU.  Through those efforts we managed to bring together a successful co-working space that is purpose designed for people with disabilities.  People with disabilities are now using that space to work in a setting alongside others and grow their businesses.  As we invested energy in collaboration, we were able to make those connections and bring in the local enterprise office.  Sometimes those connections are the key enabler.  Those principles of collaboration, trying to simplify as much as possible and not duplicating services, add value.  Perhaps Ms Buckley can elaborate on that simplification.  It would be interesting to hear the voice of someone who is working in that space every day and trying to find services for her family.</p></speech>

Many appointments were only about the child and when we walked into the Crann Centre, it was as though a light came on.  The entire family was taken care of and looked after.  My daughter was very well taken care of and she participated in many different services.  She gained independence and resilience.  That she would be able to be the best version of herself was important for us as a family.  The setting is wonderful.  It is now the one-stop shop for everything for our family and it is continuing into adulthood.  We are in another time of transition now.  My daughter is in her leaving certificate year and we will be knocking on the door of the Crann Centre for a long time to come.</p></speech>

We work with the whole family and the Crann Centre does not have an exit strategy.  We do not discharge people at any point.  They can come in and out of services and avail of them as needed.  That is the beauty of the service we offer and of our model of care.  In the generational approach, we support one generation who will support the other generation and that has a ripple effect.  That is all.  Ms Buckley has said it.  We are the wraparound service.</p></speech>

Ms Buckley's family lives in the country.  Transport and accessing services is a significant part of the work for all of us.</p> <p>  As Ms Jarvey said, isolation is a significant issue for families, especially for children, teenagers and adults with a disability, whether in a congregated setting or in the home.  We provide the simplest of programmes where we bring people together for a summer camp or to take part in our successful drama group that meets every Saturday morning.  The drama group works with both children and adults with disabilities and the facilitators find that the value is not so much that participants are learning how to excel in Hollywood or on Broadway, but that they have the opportunity to come together and be around peers.  They value that more than anything else.  It is also an opportunity for parents to come together, so one simple activity such as the theatre group has a multiplier effect.  The child or adult has the opportunity to participate, their confidence and networking skills grow, they learn how build social capital from an early age but, most important, for the parents who drop them off or choose to stay around, there is a significant upside for them because they get the opportunity to meet people like me, or I mean like-minded parents rather than people like me.  The opportunity for people to come together, share experiences and grow is of huge value.  The rural challenges that were mentioned are significant.  Isolation is a real issue for many people but it is more pronounced in rural settings.</p></speech>

It has been interesting to hear about the work of the Crann Centre and Genio.  I must applaud Ms Jarvey for her incredible benevolence.  I wish we had more people like her.</p> <p>  We all understand from the research that there is strong evidence to show that people with disabilities lives improve when they move to more home-like settings.  That is the big challenge.  Approximately three or four years ago a friend of mine who was director of nursing in a congregated setting told me a story.  A young man who had only known this setting all of his life was in tears and the staff had to physically try to put him in a taxi to bring him to a new place.  All of the staff were crying.  He and all the staff members were bereft.  While it clearly works in most cases, we must be cognisant of those who wish to stay.</p><p>It is all about that choice.  <br/><br/>I come from County Kildare and I have seen evidence from the new community settings through the work of Care and the Muiriosa Foundation.  Most of those houses are in Rathangan, Monasterevin and Newbridge.  The integration has been top class, particularly in Rathangan and Monasterevin, because they are small communities.  That is so important and hats off to the community because it is about that cultural shift and about hearts and minds.  It is so important.<br/><br/>Going back to the drama Mr. Mallon spoke about, in Kildare Youth Theatre we are lucky to have drama for people, particularly young people, with intellectual disabilities.  We have a Hollywood star.  Conor O'Donnell, a young man with Down's syndrome from Newbridge, is in &quot;Bad Sisters&quot;.  I know his family very well and was on that metaphorical journey but could not tell anybody when he was going over and back to England to participate.  I completely agree that it is just phenomenal how people's lives can change through those opportunities.<br/><br/>My questions are about new types of service delivery around individualised supports and personalised budgets and how that can help.  The Independent Living Movement Ireland, ILMI, and Inclusion Ireland spoke at a previous meeting about the really difficult application process for people with disabilities and the fact it is different in every county.  It is not transparent and it is very repetitive and complicated.<i></i>I find form filling complicated.  How can we have uniformity and make Government services more accessible?<br/><br/>I love the two-generation, 2Gen, approach at the Crann Centre.  As for independent living, there is independent living within a house in the community but there is also independent living staying within a family setting and that is where the complications arise from a rural point of view, which Ms Buckley talked about.  How can we ensure that we support the individual and the family, particularly in situations where parents are older and in their 70s and 80s?  Quite often it is older women who have been widowed and have one child with a disability.  There may be a family network around the person but it is still so important that if that is the best place for that person, they have all of the wraparound services.  I think that is where we need to be going and that is why I really like what witnesses are doing.  Could they outline how they decide what supports a family receives?<br/><br/>My last question is about what ILMI and Inclusion Ireland said here about the recommendation that 7.5% of all new social and affordable housing be ring-fenced for disabled people.  They are also looking for a centralised list so it would not just be county-by-county.  Do witnesses have any thoughts or recommendations they could make on that?</p></speech>

Quite a few staff from there undertook the SSDL training and the community connector training, so I would be very aware of those services.  What strikes me about the specific services the Senator mentioned is that there is an ongoing community of practice for the staff, so it is not just the move and then everything is left.  It is very evident from the data we gather.  That ongoing support is very important.  Some 973 front-line staff, managers and families have completed SSDL training to date and that has been accredited through Athlone Institute.</p> <p>  It is not one-size-fits-all.  There needs to be a menu of options so that when front-line staff are supporting individuals, they can look at what that person needs.  We start with the person and work outwards as opposed saying we have a house and they need to fit in there.  We all know that type of service delivery does not work.  In terms of the support we have heard about, some people move back to their family home and are supported that way.  There is an array of different types of community living supports available.  However, I agree with Senator O'Loughlin that it is very important we have that drop-down menu of options, so that individuals can make an informed choice and sample things as well.  I remember when I was at the front line a man wanted to live in an apartment and I kept exploring it with him.  When he moved to an apartment, it did not work.  The reason it did not work was that he only wanted to move to an apartment because all the nurses who worked with him lived in apartments.  He was from the west and ended up living in a wee country house that was very similar to his home, so that was a lesson to me around exploring the reasons.</p> <p>  Services hold a lot of the moneys as well. They get a large amount of funding and they need to unbundle that funding to suit the individual needs of the people they support.  Personalised budgets were mentioned and some people want to have more control over their budget, so that option should be available to people if they want to explore that.  It gives people more choice and control over their life if that is what they want to do.</p></speech>

Crann does not operate like that.  We do not have a residential setting as such.  We come from a different approach.  The families we work with are predominantly with a physical as opposed to intellectual disability.  However, at the same time, life skills from a young age are really important.  Our programmes are designed to give them life skills in terms of budget management and being able to make a sandwich for themselves, or the life skills and adaptions that might be needed within their environment to ensure they can cope.  Kitchens and so on can be set up in such a way.  If one is a wheelchair user, one needs the counter to be at a certain height, so it can be accessed.  They are the types of things but we work with the whole family on that.</p> <p>  Senator O'Loughlin talked about how we decide what a family needs.  It is very much based on our two-generation approach.  Based on our model, in our intake process, we very much look at what they want and we ask them.  The stakeholders lead our services and we very much follow.  They talk about what they want and we look at how we can support them to meet the needs they want for their life goals.  As was said, people might not all want to leave home and might be quite happy to stay with their mammies or whatever.  It is working towards what they want.</p> <p>  One thing we are working towards is talking to the families about end-of-life and about whether they have thought about what happens to their child or adult in terms of inheritance and who is going to care for them.  We have those conversations and we do that from a legal perspective but they are educational sessions.  We refer some of what arises out of that to other services which are a better fit to look at supported living for them.</p></speech>

I will start by saying it has been a really fascinating and important conversation.  I also support people with disabilities living in the community.  It is an invaluable way of empowering people to realise their full potential.  I have experience of that in my constituency where we have Stewarts Care and Peamount Healthcare which do incredible work empowering people with disabilities to live both in congregated settings but also, critically, in community-based settings.</p> <p>  I listened to Senator O'Loughlin talk about the Hollywood star in her constituency.  We do not have a Hollywood star that I am aware of but I know that one of our Stewarts small screen stars appeared on "First Dates Ireland" recently.  It is fantastic to see things like that.  It is a real glimmer into people's day-to-day lives.</p> <p>  Crann sounds like an incredible organisation and while I was so pleased to hear of what it is doing in terms of training and supports from a continence perspective for special needs assistants, SNAs, and teachers, I was also disappointed because I cannot believe this is falling to it and that it is not Government-funded.</p><p>How can we offer that level of training right around the country?  What funding do we need?  Is it something that Crann could roll out?  Is it something that we would need to do in partnership with others?  It is soul destroying to think that the State does not provide SNAs with the necessary training to support some of the children they are working with, or that nurses require additional training that is not provided by the State in order to facilitate respite care.  I would love to get under the hood of that and what we need to do to rectify it.</p><p> I was particularly interested to hear Ms Buckley speak about the transition period when her child was starting secondary school, and starting in a wheelchair.  The supports provided were such a benefit to her, to her child and to the entire family in terms of the mobility programme, including the confidence training which every young person could benefit from.  It got me thinking.  It is probably an ideal world scenario but does she think it would be helpful or beneficial if we could pinpoint particular periods in people's lives that are likely to be key transition areas - for example, if they are starting secondary school, if they are moving to a wheelchair as the result of disability and or if their family is separating?  Unfortunately, in many people's lives there are going to be many key traumatic experiences in childhood.  Maybe we could map those a little better and increase service support at that time.  It strikes me from Ms Buckley's experience as something that might have a long-term and lasting impact.  I know she benefitted from wraparound supports that unfortunately not every family has, but I think her testimony has shown why it is so valuable and why we need to reach a point where every family gets that.</p><p> With reference to 2Gen, the research cases and analyses are always most compelling and it is really fascinating to hear what the witnesses had to say.  In terms of Genio, it also works so well when projects are built around the need and the voice of the client.  I would be interested to hear what the key challenges are but also what advice the witnesses would give to the committee, which has the opportunity to put the relevant Ministers under pressure from time to time.  What advice would the witnesses give us to try and help our public services to be better at this?  We know the constraints in terms of resourcing, retention and recruitment of talent.  What specific advice would they give us that we could pressure the Minister with to try to increase this area to make it better?</p><p> My question for Crann is really around support for SNAs and teachers, and what it is already providing and how it could roll that out further.  For Ms Buckley, my question is about that transition period and whether in an ideal world it would be worth mapping out those peak periods of stress, so we could support people better.  I apologise if people can hear my office phone ringing in the background.</p></speech>

That is a big focus for us in Crann.  Our transition through life stages from toddler to child and our education and career pathways module in our service offering speaks to that and it is an area on which we are putting a lot of emphasis and focus in terms of support.  We find in many cases that transitions in school are instrumental in life for any of us, not just for those with a disability.  Transitions are huge.  Having extra supports feeds into the training of the teachers and SNAs.  Teachers work really hard in schools but do not often get released in terms of doing modules and understanding the needs of a child with a disability in the class, because they have so many different disabilities.  You are talking about physical disabilities and the needs of a physical disability, and then the learning needs as well.  We are addressing some of that through some of the transition pieces within our education piece, but a lot more needs to happen on that nationally as well.</p> <p>  Coming back to the Deputy's question with regard to continence and SNA training, and the teachers and the nursing training, she was right and I agree it is a bit disappointing that it is falling to us in Crann to deliver that.  At the same time, we need to be fair and acknowledge that the nursing services and those providing training and supports in terms of continence and so on to families do a fantastic job.  I have come from that background, so I know you do your best in that environment but you have big lists and you have a lot to do.  The difference with what we are providing is that we are able to tailor it.  We understand the families we work with, so we are able to deliver that training.  For the SNAs and teachers, that training is really specified.  They get the extra layer of support that maybe in a hospital setting you might not be able to give because there is such demand on the services across many different areas.  All support to roll it out nationally would be greatly appreciated by Crann.  We would love that.</p></speech>

Our current continence service is provided by two nurses working 1.5 whole-time equivalents.  They share the role and we can provide the service in CHO 4 for just under &euro;175,000.  To amplify and increase the service next year, we are looking at about &euro;210,000.  To move to three whole-time equivalents would cost just under &euro;300,000.  The number of families we could reach with that would be really significant because the demand is huge.  As Ms Cahill said, for every family that has a child with a physical disability, particularly a neuro-physical disability and is in a wheelchair, issues of continence and self-management are going to be one of the primary concerns.  We can significantly impact on that through our service, so it is really cost-effective.  Our social return on investment tells us that for every &euro;1 we spend, the stakeholders tell us that they are going to receive &euro;4 in value.  Not only is it effective but it is cost-effective.  We can demonstrate and are happy to prove the value of it and our stakeholders will tell you that it has a high value for them.</p></speech>

As we said in our opening statement, we have presented a business case to the HSE locally for this.  It is very supportive but it is a matter of funding.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has been very supportive but we need to move it along because, as we said in our opening statement, this year the service is going to serve 260 families.  We are without funding for this service.  We are highly concerned that we will be able to continue.  Ms Cahill has demonstrated the value and innovation of it and how we are working with SNAs.  The multiplier of working with an SNA in a school, where several children have a disability, means the reach of that back into the family home is really significant.</p><p>Yes, it is a significant issue that it is not being offered elsewhere but Crann is set up to offer it.  We do not currently receive any annual statutory funding for any of our services.  That is a situation which we are really keen to change.  Being here today affords a real opportunity to raise these issues but one can also see how practical it is.  For less than &euro;200,000, 260 families get really intensive, practical support which enables them to enjoy better health and wellbeing, opportunities to participate in society and a huge increase in quality of life.  This applies not just to the person with the disability but also to their family.  As Ms Jarvey mentioned earlier, self-management really is a human rights issue.  The capacity to be able to manage one's own continence goes to the core of a person's being.  It really governs a person's opportunities for equitable participation in society.  In terms of money well-spent, this would be really significant to us and would deliver huge value for money.</p><p> To come back to the transitions, this year we were delighted to receive funding through SOLAS and the mitigating against educational disadvantage fund, which is a really important one.  We have submitted an application to work with the Cork Education and Training Board on an initiative which, thankfully, it saw the value of.  It focuses on mentoring and supports parents and students to give them the right support at key points of transition.  Most importantly, that mentoring helps the parents and students to make the best and the right choices for themselves.  It also enables them to understand that their disability does not necessarily need to limit them in education.  We have been able to deliver supports for 15 learners and their families and we will have the data that will evidence the effectiveness of that coming through over the next couple of months.</p></speech>

There are always lots of challenges.  We were fortunate to have been learning from our demonstration project back from 2008 to 2013.  We could see from those initial small grants what worked and what did not work.  When we moved into the service reform fund phase, we scaled up the programmes in </p> <p>terms of looking at the larger institutions and supporting that work.  What Genio brought to the table was private funding.  We were able to set out in terms of the conditions what we wanted and that was the voice of the service user and bringing improvement to their lives.</p> <p>  When we sat down to look at an invitation for funding to go out to the services, we sat down with the HSE.  The two areas that were awarded the most funding were the stakeholder engagement piece and sustainability.  In terms of the stakeholder engagement piece, people applying to the fund had to illustrate how they conducted the stakeholder engagement and how they worked within their community healthcare organisation, CHO, or within their service on what people wanted.  In terms of sustainability, we could not allow people to move to new living arrangement where they did not have the funding worked out at a local level.  This was quite challenging.</p> <p>  This was huge shock to the system for many organisations in terms of having to talk to finance and HR within their own service.  We were quite adamant that these were the things that we would not budge on.  When the applications for funding came in, there was a grants committee, made up of the funding partners and family members.  These applications were scrutinised very heavily and not everybody got funding.  We had people calling us to say they did not get funding and that they wanted to be on the list.  Some services said they needed to be on the list to be seen to be doing well but our response was that they did not demonstrate how they were doing that through the application process.  They also had to detail in their budget what they were going to spend the money on and how many lives were going to be impacted.  These were all challenges.  The way we overcame them was in terms of the private funding.</p> <p>  We lifted the rock people often do not want to lift around unions and how congregated services can be dismantled.  We did this in partnership with the HSE and at all times we had it with us on this journey.  There were difficult conversations.  Sometimes we had to ask for money to come back because a service was not employing the community connectors to do the piece of work that was agreed on.  We had grant conditions and contracts with each of the services.  We outlined the conditions and one of these was training where services sent their best and brightest and their champions of change on SSDL training.</p> <p>  What happened very quickly was that two teams developed within the services.  The change team was ring-fenced to do the work.  This was not an add-on to the everyday job.  Everybody was so stressed in their normal day-to-day job so the change teams led out in this new way of working.  One could very quickly see the benefits for the individuals.</p> <p>  I refer to the visits.  I remember the first visits we went on everybody was almost rolling out the red carpet.  It was not meant to be like that.  It was more of a support visit in terms of how could we help.  From those visits around the country, we could hear that people were all saying the same thing.  They had now employed many connectors but they did not know how to support them within their structures.  They said they needed training and to be connected to other services.</p> <p>  Pre-Covid, services did day visits to each other to learn from one another.  People came in and told their own stories.  We started to video some of these and captured the journey of people.  It was not all roses.  An awful lot of heavy lifting had to be done but it was done in partnership, with the service user at the centre of that.</p></speech>

I also thank Ms Haight and Ms Toze who joined us from Washington DC.  We are delighted they joined us and gave us their insights.  My job is to wrap up the meeting and to thank the witnesses for coming before us.</p> <p>  The discussion we had was on supporting people with disabilities leaving their communities.  The most important thing is the lived experience and Ms Buckley gave us that in a very sincere way and we thank her for that.  It is not easy for families to put on the public record the challenges they face.  The witnesses gave a sense of thinking outside the box and challenging the different silos.</p> <p>  I picked up on a couple of words.  The 2Gen model is so important because we need to have a family focus.  The social model is important because for so long, people with disabilities were treated under a medical model.  A social model is so important for society as a whole in terms of integration.  Those were the challenges.</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about the training of SNAs.  It is a huge indictment on the State that there is not a service there.  That is a basic human right for kids when they are going to school.  That is something that we will continue to raise and reflect on.  I refer to the silos, the flexibility and the greater social good, which is to ensure people with disabilities are integrated into society.  It is not just the person with the disability; it is their families and their communities.  Some communities can be absolutely fantastic while others do not embrace it as much.  Our challenge is to do that.</p> <p>  I have been working with Crann over the last few months.  I think Mr. Mallon rang me on a Friday afternoon in February.  Much has been achieved.  Deputy Higgins mentioned the Stewarts project.  There is one common thread between the Stewarts project and Crann and that is Mr. David Doyle, who is consulting with the Stewarts project in developing the equine centre.  We are eternally grateful to the Crann Centre for the sponsorship of the land.  We cannot say enough about what has been done for us.  It is going to be a very exciting project and a fantastic project for the CHO 4 and for the area.  Both Crann and the Stewarts project should continue to challenge the system.</p> <p>  I refer to the various mindsets in regard to people with disabilities.</p><p>In the late 1960s when community groups and organisations came together to set up the section 38 and 39 organisations, that was one of the major developments for people with disabilities, but it is now time to further challenge the situation.  I urge the organisations to keep challenging the system.  The committee is charged with trying to make the lives, families and communities of people with disabilities better.  We hope that we do that every Thursday morning.  We will continue to do so.  I sincerely thank all the witnesses for coming today.  They gave us very enlightened information and a lot on which to ponder as we continue with this module of engagement on the UNCRDP.</p><p> Members are practising bilocation every Thursday morning.  At one stage, they are in the Chamber and at another stage they are sitting here.  Sometimes we might wonder, but when members come on they know every single thing that has happened in the meeting, so they are listening to the meeting while they are doing something else.  I thank members for their continued effort.  It is only through the strength of the questions from our members and the genuine interest they have in the subject matter that our committee can be strong.  I urge them to them to keep up the good work, although I know they have competing challenges.  I also thank our team who keep us all on the straight and narrow and keep things ticking over.</p></speech>

Members have the option of being physically present in the committee room or joining the meeting via Microsoft Teams, as quite a number have, from their Leinster House offices but they may not participate from outside the parliamentary precincts.  I ask members joining on Teams to mute their microphones when not making a contribution and to use the raise hand function to indicate.  All those present in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  Today we are considering the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality regarding leadership in politics, public life and the workplace.  We are delighted to have representatives from three groups with us, the 30% Club, Women on Air and the National Traveller Women's Forum.  I warmly welcome from the 30% Club, Ms Gillian Harford, country executive, and Ms Meliosa O&rsquo;Caoimh, country chair; from Women on Air, Ms Roisin Duffy, chair, and Ms Pat Coyle, media trainer; and from the National Traveller Women's Forum, Ms Maria Joyce, co-ordinator.  We may be joined by another representative from the National Traveller Women's Forum.  I thank the witnesses for taking the time to attend.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I must read an important notice regarding parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity in such a way as to make them identifiable.  Participants who are giving evidence from a location outside parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from with parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, the participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I will now invite the witnesses to make their opening statements before opening the floor to members for questions and answers.  We look forward to digging into the key recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly under discussion today, namely, recommendations Nos. 20 to 25 on leadership in politics, public life and the workplace.  I call Ms Harford to make her opening statement on behalf of the 30% Club.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.643" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gillian Harford" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022102000002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation today.  My colleague and I represent the 30% Club, a global campaign supported by chairs and CEOs committed to greater gender balance at senior levels for better business outcomes.  Our focus is on engaging chairs and CEOs, influencing progress at a national level and supporting a talent pipeline for sustainable progress.  As a business-led body, we share a common goal with the Citizens' Assembly to see increased gender balance in all senior decision-making fora, whether commercial or State-led.  We strongly believe that in the business arena, better and more sustainable progress is made when organisations are actively encouraged to be accountable for progress, particularly when the evidence supports better business outcomes.  For example, when the 30% Club was established in Ireland in 2015, the percentage of women on ISEQ 20 boards was just under 12.5%.  Based on the voluntary actions taken by those organisations, most of which are supporters of the 30% Club, together with the voluntary target approach adopted by Balance for Better Business in 2018, that percentage in 2022 now stands at just over 32%.  Ireland moved from 17th place out of the 27 EU member states to 11th in 2021.  This achievement reflected not just keeping pace with European counterparts primarily driven by quotas, but also overtaking them.  In the latest European Women on Boards report, 50% of the Irish companies listed on the STOXX Europe 600 have a board gender balance above the European average.  Critical to the talent pipeline, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, gender balance in business survey 2021 data show that almost 30% of senior executive posts were held by women, a figure well in advance of many of our European counterparts.</p> <p>  There is more to be done and progress is not consistent across every organisation and sector.  Targets are preferable and a sustainable way to achieve gender balance and set out a floor for progress, whereas quotas are more likely to set a ceiling with no incentive for extending beyond the mandatory requirement.  When quotas were introduced for board membership were introduced in Norway in 2006, the number of women in executive roles reduced as organisations focused on board compliance.  These figures have yet to recover.</p> <p>  Our research has identified that organisations that are more focused on voluntary gender balance as part of their business strategy have a focus that extends beyond the boardroom and moves equally into the early- and mid-career talent pipelines.  If we are to prioritise changing the face of decision-making executive teams in a sustainable way, we need to focus on removing the barriers to progress for mid-career men and women in equal measure, and for all women.  This is our most critical talent challenge.  Quotas for boardroom representation will not drive change in this area.  The current methodology applied by Balance for Better Business of extending targets to private companies is already starting to yield results and should be given time to demonstrate progress before quotas should be considered as the only option.  We recognise, however, that there is a lack of data beyond listed organisations and we are supportive of initiatives to improve gender representation reporting, whether as part of gender pay gap, CSO data collection or otherwise, as the benefit of data is that we can track progress and pinpoint areas for action.  Ultimately, what gets measured gets done.</p> <p>  On the additional recommendations under consideration, while we strongly welcome the focus on gender balance in competitive public processes for funding, we are less confident that applying a specific quota requirement as a prerequisite would drive real change.  Instead, we ask that consideration be given to the requirement to include information on gender representation, targets and progress as part of an application process as a demonstration of action.</p> <p>  For recommendation No. 23, we are proud to count many State bodies within our supporter group.  We believe State and semi-State bodies have the opportunity and responsibility to lead by example.  We support the proposal that any form of family leave should be equally available to elected representatives in delivery of their paid responsibilities.</p> <p>  For recommendation No. 25, we believe workplaces should be encouraged, rather than required, to develop, resource, implement and monitor gender-neutral recruitment and promotion policies and practices.  The introduction of a best practice code around recruitment practices, as well as education programmes encouraging gender-neutral selection and promotion, would be more beneficial in supporting the range of scenarios faced in different sectors of industry, rather than a one-size-fits-all assumption.  It would also facilitate the opportunity to change and grow as our understanding of best practice continues.</p> <p>  In business, we recognise the value of an integrated approach when we focus on diversity and inclusion, D and I, matters.</p><p>Gender equality is not a minority issue and, as such, it needs specific collaboration to focus on all women in terms of access to education, social policy, enterprise and jobs, rather than in a limited few areas.  Until such time as women are equally advantaged in their roles within society and the workplace and as decision makers at the most senior echelons, we support the application of resources driving cross-government co-ordination of actions to improve gender equality issues in a more cohesive and effective way.</p><p> I thank the committee for its invitation.</p></speech>

Our core message is focused on the urgent need for data to inform and give context to the discussion on gender imbalance on the Irish airwaves.  It is a first step.<br/><br/>When D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann debated the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality in October last year, many Deputies commended the 45 excellent recommendations from the assembly.  However, some also referred to a key obstacle, namely, the lack of live, continuous data evaluating the extent of gender inequality in public life.  This is the elephant in the room.<br/><br/>In 2018, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland identified data collection and publication as key to the promotion of gender equality.  The Minister with responsibility for equality, Deputy Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, acknowledged that such information was, to use his word, &quot;vital&rdquo;.  International experience shows that it is this information - the whole picture revealed - that precipitates change and gives added urgency to initiatives like that laid out by the Citizens' Assembly.  Data collection is also imperative as it yields the type of necessary, accurate information that allows for an appropriate, systemic response which can in turn be the subject of evidence-based evaluation.  Yet, the paucity of such data here remains a key barrier to this type of action and evaluation.  International research, as well as the simple evidence of our own ears, indicate that on-air gender balance remains a problem here.  However, in the absence of serious data our conclusions will always be speculative.<br/><br/>It is important to note that there seems to have been an increase in the representation of women on air and a growing awareness of the issue.  Since the data we have are limited and somewhat dated, it is difficult to ascertain the extent of progress, if any.<br/><br/>Women on Air is a voluntary group that was set up with the sole purpose of redressing the gender balance or imbalance on broadcast media.  In recent years, our organisation has been engaged in practical ways in getting more women media-ready by offering a mentor-based training programme carried out by media professionals.  It is a one-of-a-kind programme.  We have run workshops here and abroad enabling women to have their voices heard.  We are proud of the women we have trained, many of whom have become on-air regulars.  We have supported this work with the establishment of a database of women contributors and experts for the use of journalists and media professionals.  We have also staged events to raise consciousness around the under representation of women on the airwaves.  While these actions have been welcomed and deemed entirely worthwhile by the women participants, they are <i>ad hoc</i>and contingent by nature, and have only served to make us all the more certain of the need for accurate and informed data as the basis for the necessary strategic planning that is required.  It is as if we have been papering over the cracks when they need to be exposed and then filled.<br/><br/>International research, and the very limited Irish research available, strongly suggest that women are under-represented on air, both with respect to the number and nature of their contributions.  This has serious implications for our democracy.  As a people, as we all know, we are very much invested in the controversies and crises of our time.  We at Women on Air have consistently argued that the first draft of public or social policy in Ireland is often thrashed out on the airwaves, particularly on talk radio programmes.  Women make up over 50% of the Irish population - in fact, it is 51.49% at this point - yet this is not reflected on air.  Women&rsquo;s concerns, needs and experiences are not, therefore, informing this public debate sufficiently.  For example, women account for the majority of carers in our society.  When we neglect to give them voice, we are silencing the voices not only of women but of children, the elderly and those with disabilities, women and men.  <br/><br/>Women on Air believes a year long monitoring project, concentrating on a number of key high-audience programmes from the public and independent sectors, is essential to establish a true picture of female representation on air in Ireland.  Crucially, more in-depth research would flow from that, giving us as a democracy a window into the many and complex issues that contribute to the problem, such as gender stereotyping, unconscious bias and the like.  We understand at least one major broadcaster in Ireland is committed to the concept of data collection and monitoring on a bigger scale, but what is needed from all parties concerned is a firm commitment to turn aspiration into action.<br/><br/>I will now turn to another key concern for Women on Air, namely, the issue of gender quotas which Ms Harford of the 30% Club spoke eloquently about.  Women on Air supports the concept of compulsory gender quotas for broadcast media, particularly broadcast media in receipt of public funds. The Citizens' Assembly cited the success of compulsory quotas for party candidates at general elections and recommended that they be extended to include all elections, including local, European and Seanad elections.  The National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, NWCI, is running a campaign to bring in a 40% gender quota for the 2024 local elections to match the 40% quota that will be in place for the next general election.  These female candidates are entitled to the same airspace as men but currently no mechanism exists to ensure they get that.  This also applies to women in all the various spheres of Irish public and private life.  The challenges involved are not insurmountable but if we continue to allow the <i>status quo </i>to persist, we seem to imply that women are less able than men, their views matter less and they are a minority rather than the majority they actually are.<br/><br/>As regards the issue of compulsory quotas, the approach needs to be incremental, starting with measurable targets which will serve as the impetus for the evolution and realisation of the desired quota.  Simply put, we do not need a blunt instrument.  Women consume and pay for publicly-funded media just as men do.  They are entitled to hear their concerns, views and, most important, voices on air.  Equally, seeing is believing.  If women hear their own voices, it will encourage more to follow suit.  The fundamental first step in all of this must be to establish statistically the level of under-representation through a year long data gathering process.  It is well beyond time that we gather the data so the data, as well as women, can start doing the talking.</p></speech>

They are solid strong recommendations which. if implemented, could increase the number of women in politics.  I say "could" because they need to be implemented.  Unfortunately, they would not address the needs of Traveller women and other minoritised women and would serve to further marginalise us.</p> <p>  As we outlined in our submission, Traveller women experience significant exclusion from decision-making and wider political processes due to discrimination and marginalisation.  There is a real need for Traveller women to have an attainable opportunity to participate in spaces of power and decision-making.  This includes the need to value our expertise and knowledge in political and broader public spheres and to ensure those who hold public office are held to account for racist and sexist comments about Travellers.</p> <p>  Earlier this year, we published the report, Different Paths, Shared Experiences: Ethnic Minority Women and Local Politics in Ireland.</p><p>The research was prepared by Professor Pauline Cullen and Mr. Shane Gough.  We collaborated with Akina Dada wa Africa, AkiDwA, and the link to the research is available in the submission we made to the committee.  Professor Cullen and Mr. Gough also made a submission to this committee outlining key aspects of the research and what needs to be addressed.  The report calls for women candidate quotas for Irish elections to incorporate a quota for ethnic minority women to help tackle the issue of our under-representation in elected office.  Under-representation is an understatement.  We do not have Traveller women at national level in politics other than Senator Eileen Flynn, the Taoiseach's nominee, which was greatly welcomed.  She is doing a fantastic job and we continue to wish her well but we need to make greater strides.</p><p> The research shows that for Traveller and other minoritised women campaigning and canvassing were found to be a mixed experience, positive in some respects but at times discouraging.  Experiences of abuse ranged significantly from racism and sexism online and offline, to sustained in-person racist and sexist harassment, abuse and intimidation.  The minoritised women who took part in the research shared experiences of exclusion from electoral politics at the same time as they engaged in essential political work in building our own communities.</p><p> For Traveller women, community activism was more likely to be with our own community with less involvement in majority community organisations.  This work is less recognised as leadership or political work and is not usually where political parties look to when recruiting candidates, and when I say less recognised, not by Traveller women or the community in terms of their leadership roles, their advocacy and their political and policy work in various consultative committees in relation to Traveller policy issues at local, regional and national levels.  The research indicates that the range of current interventions to increase the number of women in local politics will increase gender parity there, but will not deliver the change required for minoritised women to access local politics, such as the issue of Traveller political participation, which remains the issue hiding in plain sight.  Increasing Traveller women&rsquo;s inclusion in local and national politics will require confronting the sexism, racism and other forms of discrimination in public life.</p><p> The report makes many recommendations across a range of areas, including: nested quotas, which I mentioned before, reserved seats, linking current State funding to parties to include a requirement to diversify their membership and candidate lists and to include ethnic minorities with gender parity in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Seanad nominees and for resources to be made available to achieve this.</p><p> Specifically on nested quotas, we want to see the inclusion of those from 2023 when the current national gender quotas for political parties increase from 30% to 40%.  We would also call for the inclusion of nested ethnic quotas in any introduction of gender quotas at local political level going forward.  We think it is essential to bring them in from the beginning as opposed to trying to stitch them in afterwards which is always much more difficult to do.</p><p> Before I finish, I would like to reflect again on the recommendations that the committee is deliberating on and to ask what the limits are in terms of the committee's ambition for women in politics in Ireland.  We want the committee to push further and produce work that has the scope to make the Irish political landscape much more diverse than it is today.  We need the committee's recommendations to specifically name Traveller women to ensure equality of outcomes for Traveller women from the work that this committee will produce.  While we recognise that Traveller ethnicity in the D&aacute;il was a significant issue in 2017 when it was recognised, there continues to be significant barriers to healthcare, adequate and culturally appropriate accommodation, equality of outcomes from education and meaningful work for Traveller women and girls in this country.</p></speech>

First, I really welcome the idea, especially at local level, of looking to how we can design either the quotas and any other incentives in a way that look to represent the diversity of women and the diversity of those who are affected by issues at local level.  I am noting those points on local political participation.  The National Traveller Women's Forum is often called on to input into lots of processes at lots of levels.  I wonder if more of an effort needs to be made to have a more active system of seeking the input of Travellers rather than leaving it to Traveller organisations and representative organisations to remind us that we need to have policies that work for everyone in our society and for Travellers and Traveller women.  I am thinking of a range of policies.  We are not just thinking of policies that are specifically targeted but of general policies - for example, health policy and to check if it works for everyone in our society.  Looking to some of the other areas we have looked at, such as care or social protection policies, I wonder to what extent Ms Joyce thinks more needs to be done to resource civil society organisations, such as her organisation, to engage but also to build in the questions in terms of automatically policy-proofing, that is, that there is a more active role for Departments and public bodies and that they seek relevant input into their policies.</p> <p>  I also agree with Ms Joyce on comments that are racist and discriminatory.  We used to have a protocol around the commitment to no-hate speech, which parties and candidates used to sign up to.  I wonder if Ms Joyce has thoughts on whether that needs to be revived and strengthened.</p> <p>  As I understand it, the 30% Club came about it in the context of when a 40% quota for women on boards was being looked at as an EU directive.  I will be honest and say that while I think it is good to have good practice and for everybody to seek to be good examples, if we have that good practice, rather than that being used as an inspiration, that should be pushing more ambition.  In regard to an incremental process of some good practice being used as an argument, unfortunately it seems from the opening statement that it is being used as an argument against regulation or against having proper quotas.  It stated that we should see how it all goes before we move to quotas and another and it talked about encouraging rather than requiring.  We have waited a very long time to have any progress in this area, or even a demand for progress.</p> <p>  The 30% Club in the UK at least - I do not know about Ireland - came into being when a quite strong 40% legislative measure was being discussed.  I hope to be reassured on leading the way in terms of good practice and peer support around good practice.  That should be encouraging of having good practices and making the case for why it is a good thing to have good practices.  That can be done while encouraging those harder regulatory measures and perhaps building a greater constituency of support for new and better laws.  Could the witnesses comment on that?</p></speech>

On her question on being called on in terms of spaces of policy to try to inform and shape them, I absolutely agree on the point she made on building in the questions when research or policy is being developed.  For example, for four years I sat on the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020, which came to an end last year.</p><p>Numerous times throughout the life of that strategy, various pieces of research and studies were presented by different Departments, whether on the economy, gender equality, pay, employment or pensions.  At no point were Traveller women or other ethnic minority women, including Roma women, mentioned across all of that research.  After each presentation was given over those four years, I asked what the situation was for Traveller women.  They were not enough for it to be warranted, or they did not see the need.  That is why it is so important.  It is not just about Traveller policy naming the specifics around Traveller women.  Wider gender policy in research and policy development needs to explicitly ask those question while also resourcing and supporting local and national organisations in the context of gender.  Collaboration and working in solidarity with wider mainstream groups is really important.  We need those groups to pick up on this as well.  We do not need them to speak for us, but we need them to work with us, supporting and picking up on the issues.  Much needs to be done in relation to those wider policy spaces because we are excluded from them.  Our voice is not there.  Those questions need to be stitched in and mechanisms need to be found to have us at the table as well.  That is incredibly important.</p><p> On the racist and discriminatory comments, I agree with bringing back that protocol in terms of signing up to the incitement to hatred legislation.  The incitement to hatred legislation needs to deliver protections for Traveller and Roma women and the wider Traveller community in general.  Strong, clear recommendations in relation to that need to be at the core of the incitement to hatred legislation.  When an elected official, in either the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, makes racist or discriminatory statements, they need to be held to account.  Apologies are all well and good, and they are welcome and they need to be made, but it needs to go further than that.  There needs to be consequences in political parties when their members make racist and discriminatory comments in relation to Travellers or other ethnic minorities, including Roma. There needs to be consequences and serious penalties.</p></speech>

I am one of those who benefitted from the really good training and work that Women on Air has done in the past.  I remember from research the women's council did many years ago that it is not just around getting access but it is also around the question of what women are asked to do when they are given space in media and broadcasting.  I remember research, which is possibly outdated now, from a number of years ago which found that women were very often asked to talk about their experiences while men were asked to explain what was happening.  There was that kind of qualitative difference in terms of how women were being asked to react, to talk about their experiences and to say how they felt about something while in the areas of analysis and explanatory work a disproportionate number of men were seen.  Will the witness expand a little bit further around that qualitative dimension of the importance of having not just greater representation but greater representation in different ways in media?</p></speech>

I fully appreciate her position.  It is one I get presented with on a regular basis.  When we talk about voluntary targets, we are very glad that it is seen as inspirational but that is not the position in which we talk about them.  We talk about them in terms of being an absolute requirement for responsible and sustainable business in Ireland.  This message is reinforced by employees, by investors and by the wider stakeholder group.  We are all in agreement that we need to go beyond the level we are at but we see it as a good opportunity to think about how we get there.</p> <p>  As the Senator rightly said, the EU directive was in discussion for a very long time.  It has only come to fruition recently and when the directive talks about 40%, it talks about 40% of non-executives but 33% across the full board.  In terms of the ISEC 20, we have already got there.</p> <p>  Our challenge with quotas is that they only apply to a very small number of organisations.  These are typically listed organisations, which is a small market in Ireland in terms of employers.  We also have the advantage in Ireland, unlike some of our European counterparts, that we did not jump to quotas a number of years ago.  We are still on a learning curve.  We have the opportunity to see how other European states have progressed.</p> <p>  In our submission, we talked about Norway.  Eight years after Norway introduced its laws on quotas at board level, there were no female CEOs in the country's 60 largest companies.  There was no data to demonstrate that board quotas had achieved anything in terms of senior executive progress for women, of higher pay or better conditions for women throughout the pipeline.  In fact, a number of Norwegian companies de-listed in order to meet the quota.  Alternatively, they took women out of the executive world into the board world and many executives filled a number of positions which impacted further down the pipeline.</p> <p>  We are not saying quotas are not an option but we are saying they are the last option.  We really want Irish business to do this in a very sustainable way.  We would like to think that companies on the ISEC 20 have already committed to that.  We have seen quite a number of our larger organisations already exceed 40% across their full board against 33% in the EU directive.  We also welcome the fact that Ireland is looking to the position in the EU because that is where we compete.  However, many European countries that have not had quotas and have not had targets are very far behind the Irish experience and we see the directive as being really important in terms of raising the playing field where we are already starting to show progress.</p> <p>  Please do not underestimate our views in terms of them being anything other than all of us looking for the right result at the end of the day.  We would like this done in a sustainable way.  A quota can be met today but how will the quota be met in five or ten years if we are not working within industry to build the pipeline?  We believe in organisations stepping up and being required to be accountable.  This could be through what might be described as soft quotas through balance for better business.  Alternatively, it might be set target in terms of how they go about it.  We believe these strategies would bring better and more sustainable results for Irish women in the voice of business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.658" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022102000002#F00500"><p>It is fascinating to follow this discussion.  This committee is starting to look at what beyond quotas will look like.  The question of what happens when 50% or 50 plus one is reached needs to be considered.  We are still a long way off that in many places but it is about that idea of sustainability.  I was at the unveiling of a portrait of Kathleen Clarke, the first woman Lord Mayor of Dublin City two weeks ago.  Hers is the first portrait of a woman to be placed in City Hall, which is quite breathtaking when you think about it.  When my daughter came into the chamber one day she said to me that there were no portraits of women on the wall.  There is that whole great movement of women on walls and so on.  This has an impact and the idea of leadership is probably the least tangible of all of the recommendations.  It is harder to get your hands around it but it is really important, so I am 100% committed to it and to the issue of quotas at the general election.</p> <p>  What I would like to ask about is the practicality of quotas and balance on air and how we do that over a longer period.  For example, I really welcome maternity leave for women in local government.  That Bill is really important as are some of the work-life balance improvements we have brought in.</p><p>We need to keep women over more than one term.  I am not as good a Deputy as somebody who has been here for two or three terms.  I was certainly a better councillor during my second term than my first term.  On Dublin City Council, the Social Democrats, the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il  have a majority of women.  I worry that a strict quota might mean we need male quotas.  The difficulty with that is that a quota will be met.  I am not advocating for a male quota as the legislation already does that but what I am saying is that women need to be empowered over two terms.  We cannot let them face an artificial barrier at the end of their first five years because of their gender.  It would be perverse.  We need to look at how we do that.  It needs to be broader than one local authority and we need to do it across the whole country.  There are local authorities with no women.  Offaly County Council, for example, has no woman councillor, which is bizarre.  We need to give a little thought to how a local election gender cap would apply.  We have had that discussion here.  We had it with the Taoiseach last week as well.</p><p> More supports are definitely needed for parents and for those impacted by childcare, male and female, at local authority level.  We insist on it being a part-time position, although it is far from it.  There are always going to be calls on childcare needs in that balance.  We need to do more than just gender.  We need to have the supports.</p><p> My question is for Ms Duffy and it touches on the same point.  In the last week or two we have had much discussion around editorial independence on radio programmes and so on.  How do we ensure that we have editorial independence but also see the idea of balance in programmes?  Twenty years ago, there were programmes, like Gay Byrne's and Gerry Ryan's programmes, where 95% of the contributors might have been female, but all of the radio hosts were male.  How do we make sure that we have that balance for producers, researchers and editors, but by the same token see the output of more women in the public eye?</p></speech>

It has happened, and it happens.  It is quite a complex situation.  As we do not have data that explains to us the extent of the problem, so it is very hard to fix it.  These days most organisations want to have a mixture of men and women.  You would go for 50-50 and try to do the best you can in that regard.</p></speech>

Tokenism is completely and utterly damaging for any organisation.  However, quite often there is more than one good expert who can be on a panel, and sometimes you have to dig deeper to find the two, three or four other people who can do the job just as well.  For example, if you are in a situation where you are dealing with Brexit and most of the commentators or experts are male, then there has to be a red flag at programme level to say that is not sustainable and there needs to be a deep dive to find the people we need.</p></speech>

I refer to the 50:50 Project.  I do not know if the Deputy is aware of what it is.  A guy called Ros Atkins ran a programme called "Outside Source" and after some research into the BBC around gender, which was not particularly brilliant for women, he decided to look at his own programme.  It was a BBC World programme and dealt with experts across the globe.  He basically decided to count the people appearing on the programme, and he discovered to his horror that the percentage of women across a week was significantly less than men.  Just the idea of raising the consciousness of that among his team on the programme he presented meant the number improved because they realised that if they had four men yesterday, they needed to do something about that today.  They started to look for good people.  When it came to areas where they did not have a female they could go to, then the researcher or somebody else on the programme would take responsibility for finding people and creating a database so that those people were there.  That is what they started to do.  It is very practical, and it works.</p></speech>

I think the collection of data even at basic programme level heightens consciousness for everybody and it immediately changes it.  When that programme, "Outside Source," started in 2017, they discovered that 30% of those on air through the week were women.  That went up to 52%, but crucially the reach of the programme expanded by another 25%.  It simply makes good sense, and what they looked at became deeper and more interesting.  That is what happens.  That embellished and helped their own democracy.</p></speech>

It is the most important piece.  Senator Higgins spoke about information around gender stereotyping and why women do not step up, because a lot of women do not step up.  Ms Coyle, as our trainer, could tell the committee a lot more about that.  It is a complex scenario but there is not a pile of men sitting somewhere saying they do not want women to participate.  That is not it.  It is much more complex than that.  However, the information from a monitoring project would lead to research and that data would start to drive change.  That is fundamental.</p></speech>

It is something that we really struggle with in politics.  Even with a quota system, we still have to challenge that.  I imagine it is also why the witnesses did not bring a man with them today to provide a bit of gender balance on the panel.</p></speech>

What Senator Higgins said is that there is anecdotal evidence that suggests, but it is simply a suggestion, that in some cases the man becomes the authoritative voice.  This kind of thing was shown in the BBC when it looked at its statistics.  It is unconscious, but quite often the woman is giving you the experience of something and the man is saying what the reality is.  However, we do not have the research.  If we had the monitoring, it would lead to the research and then we would know the extent of that here.  We suspect it is pretty high, and that women deal a lot more in soft social science and softer storylines than finance, taxation and legal, but again we do not have the evidence.</p></speech>

In response to the Deputy, we are a while off having to worry about white male privilege.  We will not need quotas for quite a while for men in politics.</p> <p>  To get back to my point, the ethnic identifier in data is important.  My core point is that we cannot have equality for one group of women while other groups and communities of women are lagging behind.  For Traveller women, right across all of the areas, there are stark inequalities, whether it be health, accommodation, education or employment.  In all the areas the committee is examining, there are considerable deficits as well in terms of what Senator Higgins spoke about earlier and the care aspect.  Unless we can measure for all women and measure impact, we will fail those groups of women in the context of that.  I wanted to make that point on the data and the importance of it in measuring and monitoring for all women, including Traveller, Roma and other ethnic minority women.</p></speech>

One of the important aspects for us in terms of the area that Women on Air is focusing on, and that Ms Joyce is focusing on as well, is around how do we make sure that the recommendations work for the future generations.  Whether it is recommendations on science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, career guidance, women in business or women in family, much of that is dependent on what young girls see today.  When young girls look at media, they need to see themselves.  They need to see their voice.  They particularly need to see themselves in higher value roles and making stronger contributions because that is the most important thing that, we believe, needs to come out of the assembly.  It is not only the women of today that we are trying to solve for.  It is the children who are there today, particularly girls, who need to see themselves as equal contributors.  We would be supportive of the proposals that Women on Air are considering today.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for all their presentations.</p> <p>  Senator Lynn Boylan, when an MEP , commissioned an independent report into gender equality in the media sector.  The Senator's report found that while 68% of graduates of media and journalism were female, they were severely underrepresented in journalism on the radio, in newspapers, etc.</p> <p>  It is important that we remember we are talking about diversity in the media and in society as well, and women are not one homogenous group.  There is diversity.  We have different interests.  We have different backgrounds.  We have different incomes.  I would like to talk about women with disabilities, the women from less well-off backgrounds, older women and Traveller women.  Certainly, one rarely hears the voice of a Traveller on the national media unless he or she is there to apologise for something someone else did.</p> <p>  I have listened to a fair few podcasts.  Often I would be busy and I would be trying to catch up on housework or whatever at the same time, or cooking.  I listen to Ms RoseMarie Maughan a lot on podcasts and she is amazing.  I might be busy but I will sit down if she is on and listen to her because she is enthralling to listen to.  Ms Anne Marie Quilligan also features a lot on podcasts, in particular, the Echo Chamber Podcast, which is a left-wing podcast.  They are really interesting as well when one looks at what Dr. Sindy Joyce has achieved in Limerick.  I have heard Mr. Martin "Beanz" Warde.  He has been on RT&Eacute; a bit recently but there are not enough Traveller women on.</p> <p>  Given that we are in a cost-of-living crisis, diversity of women in the media is important.  I am certainly sick of hearing well-off men telling us about economising.  It is a bit like teaching your granny how to suck eggs because less well-off people know well how to economise.  It is important that there is diversity in those women on air.</p></speech>

There are huge strides to be made in the inclusion of Traveller and other ethnic minority women, including Roma women, in the media in this sphere.  It is not only about responding to remarks that are made, something that has come out into the public domain or research specific to Travellers being launched.  Traveller women have so much to offer across the range of debate that takes place in the media.  It is about creating the conditions and the supports and ensuring that resources and supports are there but it is also about media outlets addressing it.  Travellers have been targets of the media in a derogatory or discriminatory way.  It is about media outlets themselves looking at their own practice and, as was said, needing to dig deeper as to what they need to do to ensure that on all their platforms, there is diversity of women.  However, on all their platforms, they need to look at what that diversity means in terms of women and that it is not only one group of women, but all women.  On the contributions of the speakers Deputy Cronin referred to, when Ms RoseMarie Maughan, Ms Anne Marie Quilligan and Mr. Martin Warde are on, you are enthralled by them.  They are there and they have something to say about what affects them and the issues of everyday life in Ireland but they are not getting the space from media outlets.</p> <p>  Resourcing and supports in that space in the media need to go in to make that happen.  Targets and quotas need to be set because sometimes they are all that will create that bit of shift in relation to something happening.  On the will, in the political sphere, I mean the political will.  In terms of the media, as I said, I mean the will of those who can do that and make those decisions to include and diversify their panels and how they broadcast.  Looking at ways and routes in, internships in the media to try and look at underrepresented groups would be an important piece targeting young Travellers and other groups.  I refer to specific measures to address those deficits that are there.</p></speech>

We have trained from all sections of society.  Dr. Sindy Joyce is one of our graduates.  Right across the board, from people in business to people in direct provision, voluntary groupings, politicians such as new people coming into these Houses, we show them how to navigate the media landscape.  The training programme is kind of special because it is made up of media professionals.  For example, we have mentors.</p><p>Mentors can be former editors of programmes in a number of organisations, such as Virgin, formerly TV3, and RT&Eacute;.  They can be people with a media background who have produced programmes over years, who understand how it works.  For each person who is trained, they are given a mentor for six months.  The idea is not that that person is called by the trainee to ask if they should wear nail polish on a particular day.  It is a case of the person having something to say and finding out where that might be best placed, what is the best way of getting that information on air, what the programme might be and getting some suggestions.  That is done after a weekend.  Unfortunately, it has to be a weekend because we are a voluntary grouping.  We beg and steal rooms and people.  We have a great trainer in Ms Coyle.  Over those three days, every single person goes through everything.  They learn how to pitch what they want to say and that is turned that into a fearsome interview with Ms Coyle, who does the radio interview with people.  That is critiqued as a group.  The group basically almost empowers itself.  It becomes a unit in its own right.  Then it moves on to television, with a proper cameraman, who comes in, responds to all their concerns and does the interview.  That is critiqued again.  All the while, we are trying to give people the tools to do the job.  Then we give them a mentor to help them along that route.  It is all voluntary.  That is how it works.</p><p> We have a small amount of money from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, that helps us with some of it.  We are very happy to have the support of the BAI in that.  That is what we do. What we need is for more women to say that they need our training because they have something to say and they need some help with that.  We do the best we can.  Obviously, our resources are limited.  Again, it comes down getting the data and doing the research across the board.  That is taken out of our hands.  We cannot afford to do it.  We do not have the money or the expertise.  The committee does.  That information will engender change.  I have no doubt of that.</p></speech>

I admire their work in totally different ways.  I am delighted to see them here.  Ms Joyce and I previously saw each other at the parliamentary forum.  We were speaking again at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice regarding places of detention.  Deputy Bacik and I co-chair the penal reform group within the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  I was struck by something Ms Joyce said a while back about how Traveller women were just invisible until the end of the conversation.  I was in Limerick recently and we spoke about the particular difficulty that the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, has examined.  It has identified the particular prejudice that faces Traveller women in prisons, the massive over-representation of Traveller women in prisons, and the particularly difficult circumstances that many of them have experience to end up there.   I do not mean to start something negative, but it was only on Tuesday.  It is just that it did not come up at all.  I was thinking about Ms Joyce and what she had said at the parliamentary forum.  In a different, much more positive way, I was thinking, just as Ms Joyce was speaking there, that I cannot remember the last time I saw a Traveller woman on TV.  I do not know whether it is that I do not watch much TV or that I have been missing something.  In the broader cultural discussion, I just have not seen it.  It is really important what Ms Joyce has highlighted today.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses from Women on Air to forgive me because I have been in and out between this meeting and another committee meeting.  I would like to understand a little bit more deeply why the witnesses think there are so few women on air.  To the witnesses from the 30% Club, one of the things that really concerns me is not so much board representation but executive management representation and women at that level.  That is where the decisions are made and where money is to be made.  Also, crucially, that is where culture is set, at senior management levels. Those are my two questions, to begin with.</p></speech>

She may wish to comment on some of the earlier exchanges as well as Deputy Carroll MacNeill's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.709" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gillian Harford" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022102000002#J00500"><p>One of the tenants of the 30% Club is always focusing on changing the system, rather than feeling that we always have to change the women.  In addition to the great work that Ms Duffy does in training, we encourage senior women to make themselves available for comment.  However, there is an onus on the media outlets to support the women being commented on in terms of the content that they present, rather than how they are dressed or their accents.  We really see women being more likely to step up, which might partially answer the Deputy's question, when they see the media outlets acting as allies for women as expert speakers, rather than as tokenism.  As I said, when you see somebody stepping out of their comfort zone and commenting on sport, for example, and being criticised on social media for their accent, it is great when the media outlet itself steps up and says it supports them as an expert.  That encourages more women to get involved.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about women at executive level, we would support her view absolutely.  Our concern is that countries that have focused on quotas, and quotas on boards have not done anything at all to improve the lot.  That is why, within the 30% Club, we like to go on the basis of targets.  Organisations that are accountable for targets almost have no choice but to look at executive level, because that is what they need to feed the pipeline.  When the 30% Club started in the UK in 2010, it only focused on boards and many of the chapters around the world did the same.  When it came to Ireland in 2015, we saw that as a serious gap, mainly because we have a small number of listed boards.  We extended the remit in Ireland and said we wanted to focus on a minimum of 30% at C-suite as well.  The 30% Club globally has now retrofitted that into its initiative, but it has seen where we have focused on it in Ireland.  It is absolutely the way to go.  Decisions on governance and oversight are made at board level, but the critical strategic decisions, the culture of an organisation and the diversity approach in terms of customers, employees and procurement and wider stakeholders happen at the C-suite table.  We believe it is really important that women are equally represented.  It is more important that they are represented at that table.  That is what we work with Irish organisations to encourage.</p></speech>

Unless we specifically name Traveller women, sometimes the issues impacting them will not be addressed.  We need ethnic quotas in gender quotas.  We also need, within those nested ethnic quotas, targets for Traveller women.  Otherwise, political parties will not go the extra mile that they need to do in ensuring the efforts are being made by the parties and the resources and time being put into it.  The political and cultural shift that needs to change within the political parties and the State will not happen unless we have the naming of Traveller women specifically in the context of quotas and targets.  As the Deputy said, there is over-representation of Traveller women in prison, while we have under-representation across all of the issues we have discussed today.  That does not happen by accident.</p></speech>

For Travellers, racism in policing and racial profiling all lead to greater numbers in prison, just like every other ethnic minority across the world is over-represented in prison systems.  Also, much of that, in the context of women, is short sentences.  They are imprisoned for fines.  We have legislation in this country that prohibits judges from giving custodial sentences for fines.</p></speech>

Something we have found a lot is that it is an issue of confidence or feeling that they do not know enough.  They could have two PhDs on the subject but they still feel that they do not know enough.  If I may, I might ask Ms Coyle to give a deeper dive into that because she does the training and therefore is privy to the conversations with the women we do train where a lot of this is discussed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.720" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Pat Coyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022102000002#K00200"><p>Ms Duffy has made a very good point.  That is exactly the case that I have found with women in any area of the expertise they have.  All the women whom I have worked with have plenty to say but their confidence level is much lower when it comes to media.  They say they need to work this out and to do more research.  Without being stereotypical, a man will wing it more.  I have been told by people in business, academia or whatever organisation if there are a lot of men there that the men tend to say the man will do that and they promote the man.  It is a very good question because that is the kind of thing we want to look at if we are going to respond to this in the round.  It is not just a case of increasing the quotas, we must look at what issues Traveller women face when they come on air or they are asked to do something.  There are issues we do not even think about like transport or whatever else.  We just assume people can do certain things but they might not be able to do it that way.  That is what surprised me a lot when I started listening to women &ndash; it is the issue of who promotes them or who pushes them, which happens very little.  If someone gives a talk and there are men and women in the audience.  When they call for questions, how many men's hand will go up for questions before a woman's?  It will be a good while.  This bring me back to the point from the 30% Club, which is very important.  It is that the more woman we can get on air, modelling, the more that will break down as well because people think they can do it too.  "If she did that, I can do it."  There is a knock-on effect, in particular in the whole area of the sciences and science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, but also across the board.</p> <p>  It was said that women get criticised for what they wear or sound like.  I produced radio and TV programmes myself.  I remember that it was important for a woman to lower her voice because it was said that people did not want to hear a squeaky voice.  That was almost accepted.  Some people, including me, in the media got training to lower their voices.  I love the fact that there are one or two women on air &ndash; I am sure members know them &ndash; whose voices are higher, younger and more vibrant.  It is great.  It now means we do not have to go with the lowering our voice thing, but even something as simple as that is important.  The unconscious level of bias and sexism is there and even women themselves do not realise that they are suffering from it until they come together, sit down and talk.  That is why it is important to take a multi-strata approach to doing this and to get all the information so that we can respond to it on many different levels.</p></speech>

We cannot take away some of the negativity that is experienced by some groups of women, including Traveller women, when it comes to the media.  If someone has constantly been on the receiving end of that, it does make it more difficult to try to engage in those spaces.  At times we come in, and it is at the point where we have to defend ourselves, as opposed to being invited in to speak about wider issues that impact on us, not just as Traveller women, but as women in Irish society.  That is very important.</p> <p>  The final point I will add to that whole piece is the online media and hatred and licence to just put anything in there.  Even if we look at positive articles that are written in the print media, the amount of commentary in response that is derogatory, negative and racist is unbelievable.  The online backlash into personal lives is a very significant issue as well.</p></speech>

There was not an ounce of lack of confidence in the room.  I asked what they would all be when they grew up.  The sky was the limit.  There is no doubt that something happens between 12 and being grown up that is knocking women down.  It is partly about visibility and seeing examples.  Ms Harford's point that you can be what you can see is key in this regard and any help to enable that to improve will pay dividends in time.</p></speech>

Just be "the politician" instead of "the woman politician" or be "the CEO" instead of "the woman CEO" and say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to that sort of engagement and for that to be an acceptable feminist perspective as well.</p></speech>

We have time if the witnesses have time.</p> <p>  Could Ms Duffy from Women on Air elaborate on the year-long monitoring project and how that would work?  She says it would concentrate on a number of key high-audience programmes in public and independent sectors.  We all appreciate her point about how useful and valuable it would be as a way of gathering data and of illustrating the affinity bias we see that Ms Coyle referred to where men look to other men to endorse their points.  It would also illustrate Deputy Carroll MacNeill's last point that when there are relatively few women - fewer than one quarter of Deputies are women as there are only 37 of us - there is an undue burden on the individual women in terms of having to always step up to represent women in the media.  We must be conscious of that.  It is the same in any sector.  When women are under-represented on boards there is also an undue burden on the individual women in business.  I remember colleagues in academia speaking bitterly about the requirement for gender balance on interview panels and what a huge burden that placed on senior women in an organisation when there were very few of them in any university.  This is a real issue and we need to widen the pool, which is why the media training is so important to ensure that the burden does not always fall on women, as Deputy Carroll MacNeill has just noted.  How would the year-long monitoring project for Women on Air work?</p> <p>  My next question is for the National Traveller Women's Forum.  I want to ask Ms Joyce more about the nested quota model she talks about.  I presume she is not just speaking about that within a gender quota because, again, the bias falls on women to be more diverse as a group.  It is clear there is a real issue with lack of representation for ethnic minority men also.  How would that quota work in order that it would not just be nested within a gender quota but would apply across both genders, if one likes?</p> <p>  I take issue with the 30% Club's characterisation of quotas.  I am a little concerned about that.  The citizens' assembly was very clear in its recommendations under this heading, in particular recommendation 21 on boards.  They are looking for gender quota legislation whereby funding would be contingent on reaching a quota, just as they are clear in recommendation 20 on the need for quotas in political representation.  In 2009, I wrote a report on women's participation in politics for the justice committee that paved the way for the introduction of the quota legislation in politics in 2012.  In our report we identified five Cs, that is, the obstacles that hold women back from participation on the airwaves and in public life generally.  They are a lack of confidence, cash and childcare; an old boys' culture, which goes to the point made about cultural barriers, and then candidate selection procedures in political parties, which obstruct women's progress.  Our recommendations were all targeted towards addressing the five Cs.  What we found, on the basis of all the evidence we looked at and the witnesses who came before us, is that binding quotas would be required to enable women to rise above the existing structural barriers to women's participation.</p><p>The words "targets" and "quotas" are often used interchangeably but of course, the big difference is that a target is not binding or enforceable.  The witnesses have characterised targets as setting out a floor and quotas a ceiling.  In fact, our evidence was the other way around.  The quota is the floor.  That is the very minimum.  Our quota is a gender-neutral quota in politics, obviously.  It requires that political parties select no more than 30% - now rising to 40% - of their candidates of each gender.  It is modelled on a Belgian law that was clearly effective in increasing the representation of women in the Belgian Parliament.  It has already been effective in Ireland in increasing us from the abysmally low position of 16% up to the still far too low position of 23% in the D&aacute;il.</p><p> I say all this because we really did interrogate this issue.  The targets, by contrast, are a ceiling.  They are an aspiration.  Parties or companies are asked to aspire to reach a particular target.  There is no penalty or sanction if they do not.  Part of the success of gender quota laws everywhere, including Ireland, is that sanction.  Parties lose 50% of their funding if they do not reach the quota.  That is why all of us in political parties are really working hard to ensure there is a pipeline for the local elections in order that we can reach the 40% target of candidates in the general election, whenever it might be in 2024 or 2025.  The pipeline really works with the quota.  I really welcome the increase in numbers of women on boards, which the witnesses have illustrated.  That is clearly very impressive and that has been done through the voluntary model but the evidence we had and the work we did in trying to move the numbers of women in politics up was that quotas were going to be the only way to achieve this, certainly if we have buy-in like the Scandinavian countries.  Their big social democratic parties all adopted voluntary quotas and reached very impressive levels of women's representation.  The political will here among the parties was not the same and, therefore, the statutory quota had to be addressed.</p><p> The point was made about why quotas are so important.  As the witnesses said, even if we reach a sort of level of representation at board level, we still have the senior management level.  Again, work I have done on women's representation in the legal profession revealed that higher levels of women's representation can be achieved among the Judiciary, but at the level of partners and solicitors' firms and senior counsel at the Bar, you will still have really low levels of representation of women.  That is what we are seeing now.</p><p> I will make one final point.  We need to be careful when we talk about tokenism.  The argument that was always used against the introduction of the gender quota was that it would lead to token women.  I have never seen or heard a token woman on the airwaves and have never seen or heard one who has been elected in politics.  We have to nail that one.  Visibility is crucial, as Ms O&rsquo;Caoimh said.  The visibility of role models to those 12-year-old girls and that notion that if a person cannot see it, he or she cannot be it, is so important.  We need to have visibility of women.  There is no such thing as a token woman.</p><p> My great friend Kathleen Lynch in Cork used to say that all her life, she voted for mediocre men and that just once, she would like the chance to vote for a mediocre woman.  That is the reality.  That is why we need quotas.  I am sorry I have gone rather but I feel passionately about this.  The citizens' assembly clearly endorsed the quota model rather than voluntary targets.  Some comments on that would be welcome.  I will go first to Ms Duffy from Women on Air on that question about the year-long monitoring project.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.730" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Roisin Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022102000002#L00200"><p>First of all, this is anecdotal.  I have no degree in statistics, but this is what we sense is actually needed here.  When we talk about a year-long monitoring project, we are probably  looking at radio because we are still very much a talk-radio nation.  We still listen to radio.  We get joint national listenership research, JNLR, figures every year for radio programmes, which give us some insight into what are the most influential programmes.  I suspect many of them would be in news and current affairs across the island.  That is one way of determining what those programmes ought to be.</p> <p>  Another way is to look at focus groups and see what comes out of that.  Again, there are people with more knowledge than I have on how we go about that.  However, the first thing is to identify what we are going to monitor and then draw up a way of monitoring it.  There are many examples of how to do that.  I will again mention 50:50 The Equality Project in the BBC, which has a monitoring spreadsheet, for want of a better word, at programme level, which could be looked at to put in place a proper statistical way of monitoring women on air and what is and is not news critical.  You could then count a number of outcomes such as the total in terms of gender and the bit that is omitted.  If, for instance, the Taoiseach happens to be a man and someone is doing a story on something in which the Taoiseach is the central speaker, there would be some other data that would tell us that, if you know what I mean.  Again, I am not the person who can give the committee that kind of information but certainly, I think it would have to be radio.</p> <p>  We have done some preparatory work in looking at the mechanics of this, for instance, looking at artificial intelligence to help collect data for us.  We are some way down a road in that regard but again, it is dealing with universities.  We have not come to a clear conclusion.  We are aware that the project is too big for us.  We are a small voluntary board.  We are doing a lot of stuff but we know that without that central piece, we will continue to paper over the cracks, as opposed to actually engendering change as a society.  That is what I would say.</p> <p>  Even in the discussion today, Ms Joyce said Traveller women need to be in that process as a particular group.   That is giving us more cause for thought and that is really important.  There is a way to go on this but it requires the State to do it and to bring expertise from a number of areas to bear on that.  We would be very happy to be involved, clearly, because we have very strong views on the whole thing.  There are a number of expert groupings we need to bring together, however.  We need to have the possibility and the funding to make it work.  It is absolutely essential, however.  Otherwise, we continue to whistle in the dark.</p></speech>

That separation of gender equality from diversity has not delivered for Traveller women.  Therefore, we feel there is a strong need to go that step further and look specifically at nested quotas in the context of gender.  I will come back to the wider ethnic under-representation in a moment.  Looking specifically at nested quotas means the political parties and the State have to look at a more comprehensive approach as to what kinds of specific and targeted measures need to be put in place to try to address this.  We have created a kind of loose alliance with Women for Election and the National Women's Council of Ireland with regard to looking specifically at what nested quotas would look like in the context of gender quotas and advancing that work over the coming months into early 2023.</p> <p>  We might look at some European examples of where they looked at ethnic quotas in the context of ethnic minorities, which have not always delivered for women.  I am not saying measures are not needed in the context of Irish political life to ensure greater representation of all under-represented groups.  That includes Travellers as a whole, not just Traveller women.  In saying that, however, serious work needs to be done in the context of Irish politics.  When we look at a male-dominated profession such as politics, we must ask who are the males who are dominating that.  The majority are more privileged and are predominantly white.  There is very little ethnic visibility across any of that.  Measures need to be put in place to start looking at that.</p> <p>  The Different Paths, Shared Experiences: Ethnic Minority Women and Local Politics in Ireland report contains research we did with Dr. Pauline Cullen that looked at ethnic quotas in the context of some other European countries.  Those quotas did not deliver as such for Roma women; it was more for Roma men.  I am not saying you could look at something like that in the context of Traveller men but I am saying that in terms of trying to ensure the prioritisation of Traveller women in the context of political life on some of those bases, when there is such a focus in the context of trying to create parity with regard to women and men, that point around what women we mean is really important.</p><p>There is some pushback against me in a couple of the political spaces in the context of getting women who are electable.  That is unacceptable.  If men were saying that about women in wider politics, elected women would be fairly quick to jump and ask who is electable.  I do not want to confuse that with winnable seats.  If one goes for the easiest route, however, one will never bring those furthest from reach into the centre.</p></speech>

I have no doubt about the validity of the research that was done and the solution arrived at around quotas.  That was clearly the right thing in the field you are talking about.  I get that point.  Maybe we are looking at something whereby one size does not fit all.  I run a business in Ireland as part of a big global organisation.  Something amazing is going on in the business world right now that I do not think quotas would serve very well.  I can tell that by being in there.</p> <p>  Two main things matter.  First, it makes business sense to have diversity in teams.  Those teams are more innovative and come up with more ideas.  They just look at everything differently.  We all know we need diverse teams.  One can no longer send five of the same people along to a sales pitch.  One will not win the business.  It makes business sense to have diverse teams.  Second, our stakeholders are demanding diversity.  Whether it is our employees, shareholders, clients or customers, they are demanding that they see a company that is thinking in a deeper and more meaningful way about diversity.</p> <p>  I agree with you that there is no such thing as tokenism.  However, we are getting to the women earlier.  It is a bit like the school story except that, unfortunately, it is later.  We are training them up.  People are advocating for, sponsoring and bringing women up through.  Those women are getting there by earning it in their own right and on merit.  We need to think about the wonderful thing happening there.  Maybe it is not a one size fits all.  I know Ms Harford will do a much better job of giving a good answer-----</p></speech>

I will start at the end rather than the beginning, to echo Ms O'Caoimh's point.  Typically, we see the debate, especially when we talk about targets and quotas, as not the difference between what they are but the difference between merit and targets and quotas.  We absolutely support the view that there is no expectation that targets and quotas do not count merit.  Whether a woman is appointed through a target, a quota or a totally non-designated process, it is on the basis of merit, especially from an organisation point of view.</p> <p>  I will not claim to comment here as an expert on the electoral process but as a citizen and a voter.  The two scenarios are slightly different.  One scenario involves multiple parties - excuse the pun - with one outcome.  When we look at targets and quotas for business, one entity is looking at making decisions on many outcomes.  Having only one entity puts far more pressure on it with regard to employee, investor and competitive expectations in the procurement world.  The business has an incentive.</p> <p>  What our experience in the business space shows us is that quotas become the ceiling.  Once an organisation has met the quota, it is managed within the compliance world and the box is ticked.  What we see is that when organisations are encouraged to think about the business benefits - actively encouraged by the wider business community - by initiatives such as balance for better business, it becomes a starting point because as soon as they get to 30, the next question is when they will be at 40 or 50.</p> <p>  Until we have evidence that shows to the contrary that countries that have gone very far down the quota route that it improves aspects for women especially in executive roles, we still see that targets as where one goes until they fail.  We still do not have evidence of countries that have gone beyond listed organisations which is a challenge.  If Ireland were to go down this route, we would be trailblazing in an area where there is already evidence that in listed organisations, this has not been overly successful.</p> <p>  We are in 18 chapters around the world.  I speak to colleagues in many different countries.  We see Australia, Canada, the UK and Ireland sharing where industry is stepping up to change the landscape.  We talk to colleagues in France, Germany, Poland and Italy and we still see diversity as part of the compliance conversation rather than the business conversation and we think that is what would make the difference.  If business has to step up, not because it is the good or right thing to do, but because it makes absolute business sense, that stops it being a ceiling and turns it into a floor from which business stretches.</p></speech>

If people are struggling to reach the target and only have the option to put who they might deem unelectable women on the ticket, they are doing something wrong and the quota is actually just the light shining in on a problem, rather than the solution or the problem.  The issue of the quota is very much like what Ms Duffy talked about earlier about the data collection in that the quota is a form of data collection.  If political parties have unelectable women, they are doing something wrong in all of the other areas, rather than not achieving the quota.  We need to look at quota plus.  Rather than looking at one level of success, we need to look at all of the other things.</p> <p>  Someone said that politics is all waffle and that then one day it is just maths, namely, the day of the results.  It is just maths in that one needs X number of votes to get elected.  Business is exactly the same in that there is considerable talk and strategy buzzwords but on one day at the end of the year when the year-end accounts are done, it is maths.  A crude mathematical solution in politics works and a mathematical solution might also drive the conversation in business.</p> <p>  I will ask all three witnesses about the tech sector and social media.  In many ways, when it comes to pillars of democracy and decency, the social media world is the wild west.  Stuff is happening there that would just not be tolerated on a broadcaster or in any other sort of publication.  It comes down to platforms' views that they are not publishers.  I very much believe that they are publishers.  Many of these companies are accused of being very holistic in that all their services are on the campus, which just turns into a drive to the employee being on the campus all the time and having no balance.  I represent Finglas and Ballymun and we often find that our communities are demonised by one story that does not represent our wider communities.  I have no doubt the Traveller community feels that even worse again than communities such as mine do.  Will Ms Joyce comment on some of the sensational programming by some TV stations on Traveller culture and especially on social media incidents of violence and so on and how that impacts on the perception of Traveller culture?</p> <p>  With regard to the Future of Media Commission, traditional media is constantly battling with this wild west.</p><p>Is there anything specifically in the gender space that the representatives believe we need to deploy?  There is no point in us having balance on traditional media, such as radio and so on, which we talked about, when large percentages of the population never consume traditional media but are consuming it all online.  Those are three questions.</p></speech>

We struggle in Ireland in respect of data on private companies.  Even that, as a first step, would be fantastic in terms of action.</p> <p>  On where modern organisations are at, we see employees struggling with the concept of work-life balance.  In the modern world, the idea of clocking in, clocking out and then work stopping no longer applies.  We see organisations starting to talk about work-life blend.  If an organisation really wants to keep talent, particularly in the faster-growing sectors, we actively encourage it to be open to the idea that its employees have a life.  If organisations want to encourage men and women equally into their workforces, especially into higher-value roles, they have to allow for a level of agility.  We saw that probably the best thing to come out of Covid, if there ever was a best thing, was that overnight, organisations which had said they could never allow their employees to work in a more agile or remote way had no choice but to do so.  That argument has already been made but that was just an argument about technology.</p> <p>  When we work with all our industry groups now, we say to them that agility is about giving employees more control over their day, their location and what needs to be done, whether they are in manufacturing or in an office role.  While the requirements are different, if organisations do not understand that their employees have a life that is built as integral to work, then they will lose the talent and lose to their competitors.  That is-----</p></speech>

There are numerous examples of sensationalist media.  "Big Fat Gypsy Weddings" was just stereotypical and sexist - the entire gauntlet of words - as regards Traveller women.  I do not know if I am in danger when mentioning names or whatever, but we have also seen this when a presidential candidate came out on the anti-Traveller ticket, and what he exposed and the approach he took when he was lagging behind.  He was last at that point in the race and then came out to make those comments.  The coverage that got right across the media, whether it was against or for the comments, was like a feeding frenzy in the way it all got managed.  It is not just about the sensationalist tag lines.  It is the way in which the media come in around some of that which further impacts on it.  That has a very detrimental impact on the community as a whole, as does any kind of media coverage that stereotypes the sexism within that community, or demonises or portrays a whole community as criminals because it sells papers or increases viewership.  Those kind of things have to be held to account in the context of media in Ireland.</p> <p>  I will make one further point.  I am very conscious that we have talked about quotas.  In our submission, we named some wider issues that need to be addressed because they should be part of a package.  It cannot be just the quotas themselves, as important as we see them to increasing the number of women in politics and ensuring a space for Traveller women in electoral politics, for example, reserved seats for Travellers.  We need something that will instigate instant change to build on what needs to be done, alongside all the issues that were talked about today.  I am also conscious of the issues that were talked about in more detail by this committee at its meeting on 13 October, including sustainability and all of that in the context of politics.</p> <p>  Looking to other examples in Europe, such as the Malta version discussed at the committee meeting on 13 October, when all that maths was added up and the seats were filled around the table, the right to have 12 seats for under-represented groups was reserved.  That would bring instant change.  Let us be honest about that.  It would require legislation but there is no harm in doing that.  We go down legislative routes when we need to.  We need to look at this and prioritise it as part of the legislative process.  If that happens, I hope that those seats for under-represented groups will be reflective of all Irish society, including Travellers.</p></speech>

Gender monitoring needs to happen when it comes to digital offerings, especially on digital platforms.  That is not just about who has come or who is quoted but also the pictures that are used.  Everything, including the complexion of the page, almost like the page of a newspaper, needs to have some level of gender balance.  Quite often, it is just a lack of being conscious of the fact that a platform has three generic pictures of men in uniforms or whatever.  It just means platforms have to be more creative.  My experience of this is that as soon as it is mentioned, people see it and they work to change it.</p></speech>

I forgot to mention social media, even though I made a note of it.  Social media, in the negative sphere, has vilified Travellers and Traveller women in this country.  This is the other side of accountability and it is so important that it is addressed.  It is also about political accountability to stand over the fact that we have these companies in the Irish context.  Although they bring in a lot of money to this country, that does not take away from the fact that stronger protections and measures need to be brought in, even if that is in the context of the EU, which is something we have not discussed today and that has made various contributions in respect of social media.  Let us make no mistake that social media has vilified Travellers.</p> <p>  There were a couple of Traveller women in Killarney - maybe I should not have mentioned Killarney - who took a case under legislation that I cannot recall but that we hope will be replaced by incitement to hatred legislation.</p></speech>

The hate crime legislation is hopelessly inadequate.  The Traveller women in Killarney took a very good case against a social media platform but it was thrown out by the judge who did not make the nicest comments himself.  Social media needs to be encompassed by all those processes, including the legal and incitement to hatred processes.  Otherwise, things will not change.</p></speech>

I talked to a woman recently who is very high up in the corporate world.  I was talking to her regarding her child not getting a seat on the school bus service.  She raised the issue that the lack of support from the State affects her being able to hold onto her job, and the gap that exists between announcing new policy and the delivery of it.  I ask Ms Harford to give some information on how these companies give women practical support.</p><p>It is still a fact that the imbalance of care falls on women.  That is not always men's fault.  Sometimes it is our kids' fault as well because kids want mammy when they are sick.</p><p> I disagree on the floor and ceiling.  Encouragement is all very intangible and abstract and quotas cannot be achieved without will.  We had no gender quotas in the North but Sinn F&eacute;in was able to get 50% female representation in the Assembly without a quota because the will was there.  Without getting women up at the decision-making tables, I worry about how we are going to change the will and the culture of corporations.  Ms Harford mentioned when quotas were introduced in Norway.  I ask her to give me a bit more detail on that because I do not understand how that happened.  I am not afraid to say when I do not understand something.</p><p> I have another question for Women on Air.  There is a recent study to which Senator Boylan has made reference.  It showed that 65% of female journalists have experienced violent threats, sexual threats and intimidation but 31% of them experienced that in their workplace.  What kind of support is there in that regard for women working in journalism?</p><p> My last questions are for Ms Joyce.  I referred to the gaps in the supports the Government can provide.  What are the specific and immediate needs of Travellers and other minorities in order that we can get that joined-up policy delivery and all that?  Ms Joyce mentioned a few cases.  I am not going to mention any cases but normalising prison sentences in any family is appalling.  It should not be happening.  That is something we should be looking at.  As well as the inconvenience of mammy not being there because she is in prison for not paying a fine, prison becomes normalised for their kids.  It is just appalling.  We absolutely need education for judges on that.</p></speech>

Norway moved very early on the idea of quotas for companies listed on its stock exchange.  If they did not meet the quotas, they were delisted, which had implications for the company.  The hope was that it would increase the number of women on boards but also increase the number of women in executive positions.  The outcome was that it increased the number of women on individual boards but it reduced the number of board positions overall because so many companies delisted as they knew they were not going to be able to meet the quota.  Women were also plucked out of executive positions and moved onto board positions, and maybe took three or four positions to try to help companies fill the quota.  Instead of actually improving the pipeline, it disimproved it.  Norway is now looking at ways it can increase the number of women in executive posts and it is struggling because companies focused on quotas rather than thinking about how they would build the pipeline themselves.  That is the situation that has occurred.  We have seen the same replicated in some other European countries as well.  It has not done what was expected in respect of the general uplift and that is why we talk about it as a ceiling, rather than a floor, but it is all architecture at the end of the day.</p> <p>  I identify with the Deputy's other question, having reared two children myself while holding down a career.  It is something organisations and women in organisations still struggle with.  We are seeing a greater appetite among men to have a greater share in parental responsibilities.  Organisations are stepping up in their policies around family leave, recognising that employees have different needs at different stages in their lives.  We see an opportunity there and perhaps this committee could consider how we look at this in a more integrated way.  We should look at where policy can help organisations but also where organisations can help policy.  It is not just a case of looking at childcare over here, paternity leave over here and maternity leave over here.  It is about looking at life in the round and working out where policymakers and business can work together.  Organisations are stepping in, being creative and trying to think in a more modern way, even if that means they are a step ahead of the legislation.  We need to see more of that.</p> <p>  Instead of thinking about the role of a father, mother or parent, we should be thinking about what our children need.  We need to think about birth leave as opposed to maternity leave, the needs of immediately-born children and the needs of young children.  All of that cuts across policy and what organisations need to do.  It is about making sure that is more inclusive for any parent, any partner, and for lone parents and then making it more attractive.  The biggest challenge organisations have is that they might have incredible policies but they struggle to encourage men and women to avail of them equally.  In our research, we still see men saying that if they avail of a form of family leave it could impact on their career.  We need to change that through senior leaders acting as role models and companies encouraging men and women equally to avail of family support systems.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about specific things that can be done now and what supports are needed overall.  Politics and women in politics are not in isolation from the wider social determinants.  Implementation of positive Traveller policy development is essential.  We have policy context in of health that looks at the stark inequalities in health outcomes.  To take two top headlines, Traveller women live over 11 years less than the settled majority and we have higher rates of infant mortality.  According to the 2016 census, 30% of Traveller women are still responsible for care in the home.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.781" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022102000002#O02000"><p>Many of those issues have been highlighted by local primary healthcare programmes right across the country.  It is also about where the gaps and deficits are.</p><p>On that point about education and literacy issues, part of the programme for Government currently has a Traveller education strategy.  We need to see that developed and rolled out.  We need to address the greater impact of mental health issues and higher levels of suicide rates among Travellers.  For women alone, it is six times higher than the national average.  We need to see a mental health strategy, which, again, is a programme for Government commitment for Travellers, that we have not seen yet.</p><p> We need to see the stark unemployment issues addressed.  More than 80% of Traveller women are unemployed, but also more than 80% of men.  We, therefore, need to see implementation and further development of that kind of policy context to identify where the gaps are.  We also need to see the resources being put back into community development in this country.</p><p> There were massive cuts right across the board in the community and voluntary sector following on from the recession.  They have not been restored.  This is in the context of national Traveller organisations but I am talking in particular about the context of restoring those to pre-recession levels at local level.  That is important.</p><p> It is important that where we have pieces of research, they do not sit on the shelves.  I am talking about the Traveller policy.  Much work went into developing research entitled, Different Paths, Shared Experiences: Ethnic Minority Women and Local Politics in Ireland.  That report makes good recommendations for the State, the Oireachtas and the political parties.  That will be another piece of research that sits on the shelf.  It is not being resourced to implement.</p></speech>

I sat on the local Traveller accommodation consultative committee, LTACC, in Kildare County Council.  The witnesses are talking about Traveller women even being present in the room.  Is there any way that local government could help support women?  I just do not mean getting elected but by having them on different committees.  Traveller women are only on the LTACC.  It was hard; they had no support.  There were no travel expenses or anything for them to go to those meetings.  Could Ms Joyce comment on that as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.784" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022102000002#P00300"><p>Of course.  They need to step up to the plate in the context of the wider role of local authorities, and the engagement of Travellers and Traveller women across that and the additional supports that are needed.  When we look at engagement in politics, a person's economic situation also has a key role as to whether there will be success.  That is a significant barrier for any woman coming from a lower socioeconomic background.  With a more than 80% rate of unemployment in this country and significant issues of poverty, that is going to have a significant impact on Traveller women.  Traveller women are engaging and have engaged, however.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the LTACCs.  They have continued to engage in those spaces for more than 20 years.  As a woman who sat in one of those spaces, I can tell the Senator that they are not easy spaces in which to sit in terms of sexist and anti-Traveller remarks.  Elected officials sit at that table in a consultative space to advance Traveller accommodation and then when they are out in the media sphere, they make really anti-Traveller comments on accommodation and housing.  That is not helpful.</p> <p>  There is, therefore, a huge amount local authorities need to do around breaking down some of those barriers in direct supports and engagement, but certainly also in looking at the policies and spaces in which Travellers are engaging.  They must make sure they are anti-racist and anti-sexist spaces, and that significant training is provided to all staff on cultural competency, Traveller cultural awareness and equality and human rights in terms of how they engage with Travellers.  This should be done at an individual level, but also in the context of how they are engaging in those committee spaces and political spaces.</p></speech>

If it is agreed, we will continue the rota whereby we rotate and change the order of speakers for every meeting.  The order will be Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, SDLP, Green Party, Sinn F&eacute;in, Labour Party, Independents and Aont&uacute;.  We will allocate 15 minutes to each speaker - I understand Mr. Bertie Ahern is happy with that - and at the end of 15 minutes we will move on to the next questioner.  We will try to ensure that everybody gets a fair opportunity to ask questions.  No doubt, our distinguished guests will have the opportunity to reply.</p> <p>  I will read the notice on parliamentary privilege that has to be read at every meeting.  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does, and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter should be given.  They should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to that person or entity's good name.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in meetings.</p> <p>  Before I call Mr. Bertie Ahern to make his opening statement, I acknowledge the fantastic work he has done as Taoiseach and previously in bringing peace to our country, and that he is one of the main architects of the Good Friday Agreement.  His insights will be very helpful to this committee and to the country as we face into a very difficult situation, especially in Northern Ireland, with no assembly meeting, no North-South bodies and difficult east-west relations.  Bertie, if I may call him that, is very welcome.  I invite him to make his address.</p></speech>

I am very grateful to the Cathaoirleach for the invitation to appear before the committee as part of the hearings it is holding in preparing a report to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.  The initiative it is undertaking is a very important one and most timely as well.  At one level, its work is about marking and recalling the Good Friday Agreement as a historical document but at another it is, of course, about reflecting on the ongoing role of the agreement as a living charter that continues to impact significantly on relations within Northern Ireland today, between North and South in Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.</p><p>So, while its mission is, correctly, placing a focus on what happened a quarter of a century ago, it also has continuing deep relevance for all of us today.  <br/><br/>The Good Friday Agreement was the work of many hands.  It required the tireless efforts of international interlocutors such as George Mitchell, Harri Holkeri, John de Chastelain, Cyril Ramaphosa and Martti Ahtisaari, all of whom spent long periods away from their friends and families.  Of course, the contribution of former US President, Bill Clinton has rightly been lauded.  He was remarkable.  The agreement also required the Northern Irish parties to work together, even when they could barely stand being in the same room with one another.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to them for ultimately rising to the challenge, an opportunity that the moment represented in 1998.<br/><br/>Leadership was shown.  It was shown by David Trimble and his colleagues in the UUP in working through the risks involved for unionism in agreeing a settlement.  It was shown by John Hume, supported by Seamus Mallon and their terrific team at the SDLP, in fashioning many of the concepts that came to underpin the agreement.  It was shown by Gerry Adams, Martin McGuiness and their colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in, in acknowledging that the future had to be driven by exclusively peaceful, democratic means, and working tirelessly to promote that reality.  It was also shown by the Alliance Party, PUP, UDP, Women&rsquo;s Coalition and Northern Ireland Labour group, all of whom made critical contributions during the long months of negotiation leading to Good Friday 1998.<br/><br/>I know that I am in danger of being accused of running off lists saying what I have just said, but today&rsquo;s occasion is about the record, and I feel it is important for me to record my acknowledgement of the pivotal role played by all those I have mentioned in arriving at the historic outcome we achieved in 1998.  Of course, the particular leadership role of David Trimble and John Hume, as the leaders of the two largest parties at the time, was internationally recognised by the awarding to them of the Nobel Peace Prize that December.  <br/><br/>There is one other factor that I must mention, and that is the close collaboration of the British and Irish Governments.  Without that, quite frankly, agreement could not have been reached.  When I became Taoiseach in June 1997, I knew that my core priority was to find common cause with my also newly-elected British counterpart, Tony Blair.  My observation of the evolution of the Northern Troubles from 1969 onwards was that it was only by the two governments working hand in glove that progress could be made on Northern Ireland.  Luckily for me, I found in Tony Blair somebody of precisely the same view.  Over the following ten months, we lived that shared view on literally a daily basis.  In recording that, I also pay tribute to the tremendous support we got from our ministerial colleagues and the very fine officials on both sides, who worked might and main to deliver on the outcome, which was never guaranteed but which we all knew was worth straining every fibre for our being for. <br/><br/>And so, the settlement was hard won.  As John Hume remarked, in his Nobel lecture, &quot;There will be no victory for either side.&quot;  The compromises on decommissioning, the release of paramilitary prisoners, and on changes to the Constitution were difficult.  In some cases, we were asking people whose families had suffered personally in the conflict to accept the release of the person responsible for the murder of their brother, sister, father, or mother.  The committee has heard from others of the huge challenges and flux of the closing weeks and days of the negotiations, particularly after George Mitchell announced his deadline of 9 April.  Everybody was torn in pretty much equal measure between the scale of the risks involved in accepting the compromises required, and at the same time, the prize available if agreement could be secured.  Things ebbed and flowed right down to the wire until the deal was finally done, a day late for George&rsquo;s deadline, but providentially on Good Friday, 10 April 1998.  Six weeks or so later, there was another red letter day when on the 22 May, the agreement was ratified by the people of Northern Ireland and those in this State in simultaneous referenda, a profoundly important feature of its terms. <br/><br/>Nothing about securing that agreement was easy.Members do not need me to tell them that nothing about its implementation has been easy either, but let nobody say that it has not made a difference, and a huge one at that.  Today, almost 25 years later, we can look back on a generation of peace, a generation in which the guns have been largely silent and a generation in which a life unimaginable over the previous three decades has been possible for everybody in Northern Ireland.  To paraphrase John Lennon, peace has been given a chance, and the results have been remarkable.  By the same token, we have also learned that closing the deal, so critical in its own right, in many ways was politically just a beginning.  The years since Good Friday 1998, while bringing many dividends, have also been characterised by continuing political turbulence, particularly over the past six years since the fateful decision by the UK to leave the EU, and as the implications of that for Northern Ireland unfolded.  I am out of active politics for a long time now, so it is not for me to prescribe this or that strategy from the sidelines to those in office today.  I remember how much I used to love when that happened to me in my own day.  <br/><br/>I wish everybody involved today very well, the two governments and the parties.  I do not envy them the task they have, but I hope, as an old-timer, that I can be allowed a few words of general advice, and I put it no more strongly than that.  It seems clear to me that, as we approach the 25th anniversary of the agreement, we use the opportunity to remind ourselves why it was necessary in the first place and the principles that lay at its heart.  That means focusing on continuing its work, building and strengthening its institutions, redoubling our efforts on reconciliation and mobilising the support of new generations around its promise.  Above all, I suggest we must continue the focus on the agreement&rsquo;s core value - the respect for, and accommodation of, difference.  Shortly before his sad death in January 2020, Seamus Mallon published his fine memoir, entitled <i>Shared Home Place</i>.  Those were his words to describe that principle that he and John Hume had been promoting for decades, that the only way forward is in solutions that work for everybody.  That was the spirit at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement and it is clear to me that it must be the spirit at the heart of how current difficulties are resolved,whether one is talking about the Northern Ireland protocol, the restoration of the Executive and Assembly, legacy or the range of other challenges facing us.  That will require leadership and risk-taking by everybody, and it will involve compromise.<br/><br/>Just like my generation was able to do nearly a quarter century ago, I feel sure that the leaders today will be able to rise to that challenge.  I said, at the outset, that the Good Friday Agreement was a living charter.  More important, it remains the settled will of the people of Northern Ireland, as expressed in that referendum of 1998.  I have full confidence that those two realities mean we can all face the future with confidence, guided by the principles and spirit agreed nearly 25 years ago and that remain our enduring compass points.  I thank the Chairman for this opportunity and I look forward to the conversation with the committee. </p></speech>

He paid tribute to the political parties in the North that took risks to ensure that an agreement was reached, and to the international parties who played a huge role as well.  There is one point that the former Taoiseach mentioned that I want to focus on, which is the close co-operation between the British and Irish Governments.  I suppose it is no secret that the current relationship between the two governments is far from ideal and is probably at its lowest ebb in a quite a number of years.  Does the former Taoiseach think that the Tory Government is undermining the Good Friday Agreement, particularly the human rights aspects of it?  It has resisted bringing in human rights legislation and it has also subverted aspects of the agreement concerning victims of the conflict.  It has refused victims access to inquests in court and has given amnesty to members of its own armed forces.  I ask the former Taoiseach to dwell on the importance of a good relationship between the two governments as co-guarantors of the Agreement, and to comment on whether he thinks the Tory Government is undermining the agreement with its legacy legislation.</p></speech>

The fact of the matter is that, since last October, the EU has been trying its utmost to propose comprehensive positions - they may not have been solutions, but at least they were positions - to the UK Government.  That was a year ago.  There were a few brief talks in February, but they did not come to anything.  It has only been recently that we have seen some progress with the new ministers involved.  I was going to say the "British Prime Minister", but I do not know who the British Prime Minister is.  It changed on the way in.  Whoever the British Prime Minister is, I hope that he or she will take a proactive position.  What the British Prime Minister of yesterday said was not helpful.  Whoever is there tomorrow might say something different.  Yesterday, the British Prime Minister said that, even if there were negotiations, what was in the legislation would be the bottom line.  I never tried to negotiate where I had declared what the bottom line was before going into the negotiations.  That is clearly not going to solve anything.</p><p> That said, at least the British Government at official level, and some of the outgoing politicians before Mr. Steve Baker and Mr. Chris Heaton-Harris came to office, put together a comprehensive paper on what the EU was offering, what their position was, where the compromises might lie and where they would not compromise at all.  At least that work has been done.  The negotiations that started last week with Mr. James Cleverly and his people should be going somewhere.  Let us be honest, though, the British Government's focus on anything over the past ten days has probably been poor.  I hope to see developments in the coming weeks, but all that we have seen over the past week is the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland saying that he would call an election next week.</p></speech>

The EU did a good job last October.  It was a good opening position, one on which we could have seen serious negotiation.  I was at a meeting in Brussels approximately a month ago that was organised by Mr. Barry Andrews, MEP, and attended by all of the parties in the North.  They spent a full day and the night before with Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi discussing the issues.  The EU had set out in good detail what it thought were fair issues.  It had dealt with the issue of medicines - that was out of the protocol altogether - and it was prepared to make changes within the protocol.  It had examined the trusted traders initiative whereby there could be a red box to try to deal with the internal trade position, which seemed to be the DUP's difficulty.</p> <p>  There are many positives, but to answer the Deputy's question directly, it takes two to tango.  If the British Government does not enter into discussions, it is difficult to see an outcome.  I hope the next British Prime Minister and the relevant officials can get down to the renegotiations.  Realistically, though, it is difficult to see much happening before Friday week.  We will have to see where that brings us.</p></speech>

It sounds extraordinary and I never saw it happen.  If legislation that every political party is against is foisted on Northern Ireland, it will be unhelpful.</p> <p>  I have stated my position publicly many times.  Deputy Flanagan was the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade during the Stormont House Agreement, which was an agreement between the parties, and I was a great supporter of it.  It took great effort to achieve that agreement.  As with much in recent years, though, everyone agrees until one group says "No, we are not having it" because the group has changed its mind afterwards.  We have seen that from Boris Johnson, Secretaries of State and foreign ministers.  Everyone agrees and then nothing happens.  From the legacy point of view, I am still a supporter of the agreement that Deputy Flanagan achieved at the time.</p></speech>

An important aspect of the Good Friday Agreement was the protection for unionists in the time ahead, where people had the choice to be Irish, British or both.  That has played its part as time has passed.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Ahern believe that the Irish Government needs to set up a citizens' assembly now?  There seems to be a rallying cry for that at the moment.  It would play an important part in leading us towards the future.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Ahern agree that planning for a referendum on Ireland's future would involve inclusive and comprehensive planning for the time ahead?  It is not something into which we can rush.  It is something that needs to be dealt with in a very mature way.  Consider the Brexit result in Britain.  The majority of people may not have known what they were voting for and the outcome was based on racism, xenophobia, homophobia and whatever other phobia one might want to name.  People were not aware of what they were voting for.  The surprise on Boris Johnson's face when the result was announced probably said it all.  I believe he was ambivalent on the question, but he was certainly surprised at the result of the vote.  If we are going to have a referendum, people will have to understand what they will be voting for.  The future of Ireland is important to every generation.  What are Mr. Ahern's views in this regard?</p></speech>

Everyone has now moved away from that.  I agree with Mr. Brady that the work has to be done.  It has now commenced.  There is some good work being done academically.  I know of at least three universities that are working their way through the question of how to bring a new Ireland together and how we would deal with the legislation.  That is good.  Much of the work is focusing on administration as well as on legislation relating to security and so on.  Nothing is being done on the economic side yet, but I have learned this week that such work is to commence at one of the universities in the new year.  There will be North-South collaboration on that.  It is currently trying to pull together the resources to do that work.  This is good and important.  It is good that such work is being done academically because the universities have no axe to grind.  They are doing the work professionally and in an academic way, and it will be used by everyone.</p> <p>  As the Scottish referendum proved, any of the SNP people you might talk to will readily admit privately if not publicly - I believe they admit it publicly as well, though - that, while the SNP got a great deal right, it did not address finances.  At that point, the SNP was up against Gordon Brown and the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Alistair Darling.</p><p>It was buried on that issue and probably lost the referendum because of it.  The financing end is not the only issue.  There are whole lot of questions, such as how we would bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI together, and how we would bring together the courts, local authorities, and the National Health Service and the HSE.  These are all big questions but they are doable with work, preparation and planning.  Otherwise, and not everyone agrees with this but I was asked for my view, if we hold a referendum while saying we do not know how we will deal with the National Health Service between the North and the South or how we will bring An Garda or the courts together, I will tell you now what the result would be and I will not charge anything for the advice; it will not have a hope in hell of passing.  There are some people who think that it would.  I do not because we would have a debate, we would be here debating it and people would see after a few days that it is illogical to do that.</p><p> I readily admit that the citizens' assembly has probably sorted out some thorny issues in this country in the past decade.  Would I like to see a citizens' assembly of 100 people?  I was before the citizens' assembly recently talking about an elected mayor for Dublin.  I enjoyed the morning with those present and we had lovely tea and all that.  I do not think we solved much but we will see what happens.  I am not too sure about putting the national question we have been talking about for 100 years into the hands of 100 people.  If I was one of the 100 I might have a different view, but I am not sure I want to hand that over.  It should be debated within political parties and civil society, and at the annual conferences of all the organisations, but I am not too sure about handing that over to just 100 people and a chairman.  I am not saying, "No way".  Maybe when all the work is done, then we could hand it over to somebody.  Personally, I would like to see D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann having a role in that.  I would like to think that the people we go to the trouble of electing will have a big say.</p></speech>

The other point is, when we talk about a citizens' assembly in those terms, it would have to be an integral part of the process.  I am not suggesting for a moment that 100 people make very major and important decisions but we need to look at the context.  We live in a country of approximately 6.5 million people with two of everything, none of which work particularly well.  It would be relatively straightforward to sit down to talk about how these things may be brought about.  When I was canvassing during the last northern election, a couple of people asked me about their pensions but transitional arrangements will be made for all that.  The pension suppliers will presumably sort all that out.  That is important.</p> <p>  I will finish on this question.  I have come across this issue because I deal with the unionist population every day in my constituency office.  It is my view that civic unionism is way ahead of political unionism.  Does Mr. Ahern agree with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.810" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bertie Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022102000002#D00600"><p>As Mr. Brady knows, I am very involved with the George Mitchell institute in Queen's University Belfast and spend a lot of time there.  I am up and down there like a yo-yo.  I hear the views of all sectors.  I definitely feel that on the ground people are frustrated, want solutions and want to move forward.  They see the benefits of the Good Friday Agreement and the protocol.  They readily admit there might be issues with the protocol that need to be addressed.  Nobody wants people having to do eight pages of checks.  We have to be realistic.  These issues can be resolved.  Business, trade unions and civic society in the North are certainly anxious.  From what I detect, nobody particularly wants an election, certainly not in Christmas week, unless they are all mad and I do not think they are.  It would not solve a lot either, for that matter.  It is a case of Tweedledum and Tweedledee.  We might get a few changes here and there but will it fundamentally change where we are?  I do not think so.  Mr. Brady is correct.  People in society generally want to see progress and compromise.</p> <p>  I will go back to the point I made in my opening remarks.  I am the first to say that despite the success of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace and progress it has brought, it has not reached its full potential.  We all know that but of all the things that were achieved, the agreement was achieved because people who were of different views and who did not particularly like each other, for understandable reasons no matter what side they came from, were prepared to compromise and prepared to find the middle ground on the basis of goodwill.  That is still necessary.  The only way things will be resolved, as people in this House know, is by people talking, discussing, deliberating and trying to find solutions.  If people do not sit down to talk, we will not find solutions.  That is my worry.  The success of what we collectively did 25 years ago, and for the ten years after that in dealing with these issues, was the fact that we worked together.  It did not mean we all loved each other and we all agreed and so on, but people genuinely tried very hard.  People stretched themselves, especially our northern colleagues, and worked extremely hard to carry people with them to find ways of doing that.  We still need that, which is the big challenge as we go into the years ahead.</p></speech>

We are delighted to have him before us as part of the work the committee is doing.  Senator Currie and I were adamant that we get stuck into this piece of work during our programme year.  From my perspective, I have a strong sense that if we do not learn the lessons of the past, particularly around the Good Friday Agreement and the working up towards that agreement, and get an understanding of how hard that was to achieve and learn from the complexities involved, it will be very hard to get agreements in the future.  This is a very interesting piece of work that will result in us putting together a great report.  Some of Mr. Ahern's former colleagues who were involved across the different parties have given some great contributions.</p> <p>  I am coming from that perspective of going back 25 years ago and all the effort Mr. Ahern put into Northern Ireland and building relations.  I ask him to give us a picture first and foremost of why he saw the need to do this.  What was his drive?  Did he believe it was just a moment in time where he could see an opportunity to make something happen?  What was the thinking?  I sat in a church with Mr. Ahern a couple of months ago at David Trimble's funeral.  I will never forget that day because during his eulogy the clergyman talked about one politician, David Trimble, who was held in high esteem by Mr. Ahern.  That gave me a certain insight into Mr. Ahern and the relationships he built over the years.  It is very important for us as a committee to learn why it is so important to build those relationships.  In Mr. Ahern's view, why did he put so much time into building relationships with individuals like David Trimble and other politicians, not just on the unionist side but on the nationalist side as well?  Why did he feel the need to invest time in particular relationships?  What rewards did it reap for him?</p> <p>  I was in Belfast last Wednesday night at the launch of Tommie Gorman's book, which was launched by Michelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster.  Mr. Gorman is an individual like Mr. Ahern who has built relationships.  It is unusual to see the high regard in which a journalist is held by politicians on both sides of the divide in the North.</p><p>People like Mr. Ahern have so much insight into those relationships.  He referred to relationships a lot.  Relationships are key because it is by developing them that we can find a way forward and start resolving issues.</p></speech>

I also remember 1968 and the civil rights movement.  We watched it all our lives from down here.  We discussed it many times in this House.  Many things happened.  There was always that sense of hopelessness that if we did not get everybody on board, we were never going to get anywhere.  I always thought that the Sunningdale Agreement in 1974 and what happened in 1985 were good efforts.  I never want to take away from the people involved in both those efforts because they worked very hard to achieve them but there was a fundamental difficulty with them.  They did not make a lot of difference in the end because everyone was not involved.  They were not inclusive.  If you did not have an inclusive position, you were never going to stop the Troubles.</p> <p>  What Tony Blair and I set out to do more than anything else was to try to stop the violence.  In 1995 and 1996, when we were working together when in opposition, along with Mo Mowlam and others involved, such as David Andrews, we were trying to find a way to reach out to and work with everybody.  That was a long path.  The Downing Street Declaration was in 1993 while the ceasefire was announced in 1994.  It broke down in 1996.  All the time, we were trying to build up relationships and to understand the people.  I always thought my job was not to blind them with science or tell them I was right and they were wrong.  That was not it.  We were trying to see where we could find common ground and make progress.  Some people here know that it involved plodding along with all the parties trying to see what the issues were, where compromises could be found, what could be achieved and who could carry people with them.  Many of these matters were very difficult.  David Trimble and I ended up getting on and being great friends.  I can tell the committee that the shouting matches during the process were unbelievable.  I started from a very different position to that held by Mr. Trimble but we worked our way along.  Much of the time, it involved talking to my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, bringing those arguments back, talking to loyalists, bringing those arguments back and trying to see where we could make progress.  The reality was that David Trimble made significant changes.  Martin McGuinness, as chief negotiator at the time, made significant changes.  It was give and take.  The negotiations were tough.  The only way you could do it was to talk and talk.</p> <p>  This is what I worry about now.  If a document was drawn up last October and there has been no meeting since then, what happens?  We used to pass each other out having meetings but it was necessary to do that.  It was necessary in order to analyse and comprehend where we could go and talk to people actively involved in the Troubles and people with different points of view.  You could talk to the SDLP, which was against violence of every shape.  Seamus Mallon would always give us lectures.  He would give out to me for talking so much to the others and then we would talk to him.  That was the name of the game.  You had to try to bring people into an inclusive process, which was what we succeeded in doing.  In my view, if the two governments and the parties did not continue this, a solution that left somebody out would not have worked in 1998 and it will not work in 2022.  This is the difficulty.</p> <p>  I am often asked, particularly on UK programmes, whether I am saying we should bypass somebody and, if they are difficult, go ahead.  You feel like doing this sometimes but it is not the solution.  This tends to be frustrating and difficult.  The reality at the moment is that the US President is on side, the British Government is kind of on side, the EU is on side, the Irish Government is onside and most of the parties are on side but one group is not but that is the challenge.  The challenge is to try to convince it and see if you can get there.  It can only happen if there is intensive dialogue.  That is the issue.  It will not happen if there is no intensive dialogue.  The reason I spent such time is because that was the only way.  There was no alternative.  We would have failed in 1998.  It was not Tony Blair and me; it was Tony Blair and me and everybody else.  We were a group.  The group represented the key people and backroom people of all the parties who slaved away.  We did lose people in 1998.  We lost the DUP.  The DUP was out the door shouting at us from over the wall and we had to wait a good few years before we got it in but it was worth it.</p></speech>

As someone who was 16 when the Good Friday Agreement was signed, I did not think it was possible but we had that day and that celebration.  We made tough sacrifices.  It was not easy.  There were conversations around people's kitchen tables about changing Articles 2 and 3.  It was not a simple "Yes" vote but people rowed in because it was the only game in town.  It was the only path to the future.  On a very personal level, my granny was in a hospital bed next to Mr. Ahern's mother.  They had long conversations about the peace process before the Good Friday Agreement was signed.  She was so proud of him and granny as a Fianna F&aacute;iler and a republican would ring home every day and tell us about the conversations about Bertie and Bertie's mammy.

In Ireland, we never like to take up awkward conversations and always let things go.  However, I think we have now let things go a little too far.  We need to ensure our youth remobilise behind the Good Friday Agreement in the same way that I, as a 16-year-old girl, was behind the Good Friday Agreement.  Over 90% of those in the Republic of Ireland who voted were in favour of the agreement.  What is Mr. Ahern's opinion on that?</p><p> I was glad to hear Mr. Ahern mention the ongoing research because it is the only game in town in respect of how we bring the two states together to ensure we have the necessary police force, courts, education and health systems.  Much work has been done.  Mr. Ahern was right in what he said about the shared island unit.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI; the National Economic and Social Council, NESC; and many other organisations and universities are being funded through the shared island unit by the State to do research.  I am a big fan of that.</p><p> One problem that Mr. Ahern also mentioned in his speech is that we have failed to implement all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.  That is one of the sad points, 25 years later.  I have a problem with people who other the North.  People say the North needs to do this and that.  They say that the Governments in Dublin and Westminster need to come in and do something.  There is a great and growing independence of thought.  There are still shortfalls in Northern Ireland.  There is not an integrated education system or integrated communities.  How can we support that from Dublin, for want of a better description, but not in such a way as to other Northern Ireland?  We need Northern Ireland to come together in the conversation, for example through a citizens' assembly in Northern Ireland.  We cannot dictate; we can only support.  The 100-person citizens' assembly that Mr. Ahern mentioned earlier might say it would love reunification of the island - that all being well and good, it would be lovely.  All of those on my side of the House would love that reunification.  However, that is no good unless everyone in the North comes together.  I would like to hear Mr. Ahern's thoughts on that point.</p></speech>

The Senator asked very good questions and I am sorry for interrupting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.824" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bertie Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022102000002#F00500"><p>We all agree that the preliminary work is now being done by several organisations.  The Senator mentioned NESC.  There is also the work of the shared island unit and there is academic work.  The work of all those groups and bodies is good and it all feeds in.  Ultimately, it must feed into the centre.  As the Senator suggested, the Government has to pull this together because it must form some cohesive programme along the way.  That is the first point.  It is crucial that Northern universities and bodies are involved in that work.  It cannot be otherwise, academically, for fear that a particular view is being taken.</p> <p>  It is a sad reality that some of the things we hoped for did not come to pass.  While business and tourism are good in the North, I still think it was a great pity that David Trimble did not agree, despite my best efforts to convince him, to put Invest Northern Ireland and the IDA together.  We took a joint approach to tourism and I thought a combined effort would have worked well for business.  Mr. Trimble saw the sense of it, in fairness to him.  He was a politician but he was also an academic.  He saw the sense in the argument but was unable to deliver it.  Invest Northern Ireland is doing a review of its work at the moment, which is important.  I know IBEC has also been doing a lot of good work.  It is important that these bodies are there.</p> <p>  With regard to the analysis, I do not have the figures but I have read them.  While the South has experienced difficulties in the past 25 years, including a period of recession, the reality is that if one compares the movement in the economies of the South and the North, the North is way behind.  In terms of growth and development, Northern Ireland has done well but I would have hoped 25 years ago that the rising tide would have lifted all boats fairly equally.  That did not happen.  It is still a challenge.  That point applies particularly to some areas, for example in Belfast but also in Derry, where people feel they have not seen the lift they should have seen.  The United States remains very important because it can still have influence.  We need to do that.  We want nationalist, republican, loyalist and unionist communities to be able to see the benefits.  That is a challenge that comes with the Government's work with businesses and trying to give them a break.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about the rising generation, which has got used to peace.  They do not see it as a bonus because they were not around when there was trouble although they know about it.  They have to see other benefits.  They have to see benefits in their communities, including infrastructural benefits.  They have to see Northern Ireland's place within the European Union, hopefully, as well as in the union or out of the union.  That is why the protocol was so important.  I say constantly at Queen's University that the reality for now is that Northern Ireland has the best of all worlds.  It is, for all intents and purposes, in the European Union and the customs union.  It has internal trade, which is so important to some politicians in the North.  They refer to the UK internal market, so let us agree to that.  Northern Ireland also has trade with the South.  Let us also agree that there are still some difficulties that have to be ironed out with the protocol in terms of the form filling and all of this.  The point that is always missed is that business nowadays is not a matter of trucks driving up the road with bananas or oranges in the back of them.  Big business nowadays is technologically advanced.  It is the movement of technology.  All modern technology is making finance, insurance and trade operate.  That does not involve a boat moving across the sea.  As I continue to say, some people think there is a guy on a boat somewhere in the Irish Sea who has a flag and stops boats to check them.  That is not what is going on.  Trade is trade, and the opportunities are immense.  For the rising generation, we must show that reunification would mean good jobs and education, and a good future.  We must show that we can harmonise things as best we can on this island.  We must show we will all look out for each other and develop ourselves.  As was said earlier, there are now 7 million people on the island.  We are no longer small.  It is a big and significant country now.  We have caught up with many of our European partners in the size of our wealth and opportunities.  For the period ahead with the protocol, whether its terms are amended or not, the opportunities are immense.  I have done my best in meeting loyalist and unionist groups to point out that fact.  One gets so far before they stop and say it is a different matter.  There are, however, enormous opportunities.</p><p>We have to convince the rising generation that this is good; that what we did 25 years ago, updated to now, is good.</p><p> There is another point that is very important.  You often hear people misguidedly saying the Good Friday Agreement needs to change or that we did not think of this or that.  There is a review clause in the agreement that if at any time the parties want to sit down and make amendments, they can do so.  We did that with the St. Andrews Agreement 16 years ago.  It has not been done since.  People are mistaken to say this was forgotten about and we cannot do anything about that.  Sometimes I even hear some journalists saying the Good Friday Agreement is finished and does not apply.  If somebody has good ideas about changing it, that is all they have to do.  They can review it and amend it and there is no big deal about that.  That is what we have to do for the rising generation.  Many people who are graduating this year with masters degrees would not have been born the year we negotiated the agreement.  They are the ones who are now coming into the workforce as highly qualified people.  There are opportunities to build on it, if we could get the political parties to get the Executive and the institutions up and running.  I was delighted during the pandemic to see Northern Ireland did well.  The Executive did well.  It worked well.  Its members dealt with the challenges.  They had big challenges but they handled it well.  There were a few spats but there were millions of spats down here.  I thought the Executive did very well.</p></speech>

I am going to bring in Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  I am conscious of the importance of Mr. Ahern's replies and the points he is making about people working together.  Deputy Carroll MacNeill will be followed by Senator Currie, and Senator McGahon may wish to contribute as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.827" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022102000002#G00300"><p>I thank Mr. Ahern for coming in.  We are very pleased to have him in and I thank him for the work he did.</p> <p>  A normal amount of spats is the normal type of politics Mr. Ahern and others were aiming to achieve in Northern Ireland in the 1990s, instead of what was there.  He has said clearly the primary goal for him and for the British Government was stopping the violence in the first instance and building a set of structures that would enable reconciliation in particular.  We get this sense from the conversations we have had over the last while that stopping the violence was a primary goal, as was reaching an agreement and that you must stop somewhere, as in you must stop talking and reach agreement at some point.  Recognising that time pressure, was there anything else Mr. Ahern feels could have been brought in or is there anything he regrets about that stop point?</p> <p>  Linked to that is this question of reconciliation.  Mr. Ahern has this morning described people straining every fibre of their being to try to reach a resolution with people they did not even want to be in the same room with.  One of the fears we have, in particular the way the politics is constructed, is that it is directly contrary to reconciliation.  It deliberately pulls people to the poles as opposed to the centre.  The opportunities, as Senator McGreehan was talking about, for integrated education as the norm and for cultural reconciliation as integration becomes more and more normalised over a period of 25 years, do not seem to have happened in the way people hoped or expected they might.  What is Mr. Ahern's view of how reconciliation has gone over that period?  Does he have a view on how the politics is constructed and how the institutions are constructed and whether that enables or hinders reconciliation in any way?</p></speech>

For the record, I feel the institutions should be worked very actively.  I do not want to say more actively or criticise what is happening but we went through a long period where the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference did not meet at all.  There were maybe one or two meetings.  The whole idea was the British Prime Minister was to turn up to those and I do not think Boris Johnson ever went to the one or two that were held.  He did not attend at all and the idea was the British Prime Minister would be there.  The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference is vitally important.  Sometimes I hear people saying we need a new model so we can meet, as the British are no longer in Europe.  We do not need a new model; all we need to do is implement the model we have, which is the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  It should be meeting regularly.  It does not have to meet at Prime Minister-Taoiseach level.  It could be four meetings a year: one quarter with industry people, one quarter with education and so on.</p> <p>  Our civil servants are not meeting and at one time they tended to meet every week.  They used to meet at various committees in Europe.  As the Cathaoirleach knows, there was huge close contact between our public servants and it is gone.  It is the same with North-South bodies.  I finally agreed with David Trimble what the North-South bodies were going to be.  We always had a view they would be incremental and we did not have to write down exactly where we were going to have co-operation.  The co-operation on cancer services works very well.  I do not think that was ever written down, so there are lots of things you can do that you do not have to write down.  It should be more active and if we get the institutions up, we need to be looking at other areas and new areas.  As for the idea that 25 years ago we said these were the areas and 25 years later we are still saying these are the areas, I am sure the Deputy could think of 20 areas where we should be having North-South co-operation.  It is vital to do.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right about where I felt things would have developed.  I honestly thought we would have far greater integration of various organisations working closely together and making far more progress together.  There are some people.  Our farmers are great at North-South work.  The only time the Rev. Ian Paisley used to ring me when I was Taoiseach was when it was something to do with agriculture.  Then he would abuse me about something else.  Anyway, our farmers have an incredible way of working together and that should be across many other areas.</p> <p>  On education, integrated education is probably working.  I met a former principal of a Presbyterian school in Belfast and he told they were not changing their charter or any of their long-held views and rules but then he went on to tell me a third of their pupils were Catholic, so they are coming into the schools.  They are not going to say it is an integrated education but they are now coming into the schools.  That is a slow process but you have to keep on driving.  I thought things like that would work far better.</p> <p>  The area I am most disappointed by is around the employment and training bodies.  It is the reason I wanted Invest Northern Ireland and IDA Ireland to work together.  I did the early negotiations with Intel and a lot of the companies way back.  On all the trips and trade missions I went to, and I am sure it was the same for the Cathaoirleach or anyone else, none of the companies ever asked were Belfast and Dublin separate or were Derry and Buncrana separate.  They saw us as a unit.  We would never go in, even in the worst, early days, and say we are not going to help that Northern Ireland crowd.  That never happened.  I never saw an official or Minister doing that.  I had hoped we would have seen far more investment into poorer areas and into ones that did not feel they had benefited.  That is something we still need to do.  I am aware there are some initiatives now, there is some progress and efforts are being made but you must get the person on Sandy Row and on the Falls Road to see this is really good for me, that this is progress for me and that I have a better chance of a job.</p><p>Unfortunately, people in loyalist areas, as distinct from nationalist areas, think that they did not get the benefits from it.  If that is case, then it is our job to prove to them that there are benefits.  Until we do that, people will be linking themselves to paramilitary groups and the wrong kind of society.  I have seen it in my own constituency down the years and I have seen how it can change.  For example in the International Financial Services Centre today, there are children of people who at one stage came in as cleaners and doormen, and are now working as economists.  It can change.  The challenge for us is to make people in Northern Ireland see that.  That means enabling reconciliation and being positive in the message.  It means people of all political persuasions must hold out the hand of friendship to the other side to help them.  If you only hand it out to those on your own side, it does not work.  </p></speech>

As he has said himself, the progress that has been made is remarkable.  In my view, all roads lead back to the values of Good Friday Agreement, no matter what the future holds.  For us, this project is about really getting under the hood of the Good Friday Agreement 25 year later and looking at the good, the bad and the ugly from where we are at the moment.  There is lots of good and lots of bad and there has been lots of ugly too.  I have a few questions and I will try to be as quick as I can.</p> <p>  A lot of attention has been focused on what happened after the women's football team's success a few weeks ago.  It is an awful pity for them that their success has been overshadowed but in my view, it reflects on where we are 25 years on from the Good Friday Agreement and the lack of progress when it comes to reconciliation or the understanding of it.  To me, reconciliation is about empathy for other views, situations, backgrounds and history.  Where does Mr. Ahern believe we are in relation to that side of reconciliation?  I do not want to focus on what happened with the women's football team.  On where we are and people's mindsets around reconciliation, does he think we need to have a conversation about what reconciliation actually means?  It strikes me that people have different perceptions of what reconciliation means and that is a problem in itself.  Not only are people coming from different viewpoints about what might have happened in the past but now we have new generations with different understandings of reconciliation.  Do we need to have a conversation about that?</p> <p>  The former Taoiseach mentioned the St. Andrews Agreement.  People point to that agreement as a reason for there being entrenched silos in Stormont.  When Mr. Ahern was working on the agreement, did he anticipate that?  Would he change the agreement at this moment in time?  Through this process, I have come to see that the Good Friday Agreement was never supposed to be about putting all of our eggs into one basket in respect of power sharing but about working the three strands equally, like the three legs of a stool they are.  Has it become apparent, since Brexit, that we just did not invest in those strands enough for that stool to stand as firm as possible?</p> <p>  We talk about the relationships with the British Government and their importance but fundamentally, the UK is on a different path to us at the moment.  It is on a path that is about deregulation, divergence and disintegration, rather than convergence.  How does the former Taoiseach see the relationship developing on that basis?</p> <p>  Finally, if social media had been around at the time of the Good Friday Agreement, would we have had it?</p></speech>

I doubt it.  It would have been very difficult.  I am not sure how members do anything these days with social media.  I wish them well.</p> <p>  Going back to the Senator's other questions, the UK is on a different path.  The big difficulty was Brexit, albeit not so much the vote itself, which was bad enough.  I think it was in her Lancaster House speech when Theresa May said the UK was leaving the Single Market and was against the European Court of Justice.  We all knew that.  However, in the same speech she stated for the first time, and it had not even been debated, that she was against the customs union and wanted to pull out of it.  It is the customs union bit that has created the problem in the North today.  I would hope that somewhere along the way, Britain will come back into that because it can be out of the Single Market but in the customs union.  They were separate issues.  I think Theresa May is a good person and she did a lot to try to be helpful in her proposals but that one was not helpful.  Since then, they have been on a track and we have all seen what has gone on in Britain over the last five to six years.  The politicians are very slow to admit that this started with Brexit.  Some day, some of them will be brave enough to say that it was Brexit that created their difficulties.  I do not expect them to change their minds and to join the European Union tomorrow but they could start co-operating and integrating things that are in their interests, which are in our interests as well.  I think that is where that could happen.</p> <p>  On the issue of the North-South bodies and the institutions, I agree with the Senator's point.  The three strands of the agreement should be worked very actively.  I have mentioned the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference already.  It is in all our interests to put time and effort into that.  It has not moved at anything like the pace that I would have expected.  There should be far more action and interaction.  I know that is not easy when one side does not want to turn up to meetings.  It has been disappointing. Hopefully, we will get the institutions up and running.  </p> <p>  On the St. Andrews Agreement, it goes back to the issue that I mentioned in response to the Chairman's question.  We can make changes to the agreement at any time.  The reasons that we made changes at St. Andrews was because we were trying to get the DUP on board.  I remember Martin McGuinness bending over backwards to try to help ensure that the positions of First Minister and deputy First Minister would be on an absolutely equal footing.  It is funny to see the DUP now being so interested in trying to convince people that they are different, when the whole argument was to ensure that they were on an equal footing.  At one stage, I had a list drawn up which set out all of the tasks of the First Minister and of the deputy First Minister.  We tried to see if there was any distinction between the two, other than the title of the office.  Perhaps we should not have used those titles.  Ms Gildernew will recall that Martin McGuinness even offered using the same title for the two offices but that offer was rejected.  As I said to Alliance people recently, if changes are to be made all we need is a review.  Proposals can be put forward.  I must say that 25 years ago I did think that we would ultimately see government and opposition, which would grow incrementally.  I wondered how we would get government and everyone in opposition working together.  The Chairman can imagine trying to do that in these Houses.  It would be difficult.  Now is not the time to do that nowt.  We cannot do it now because it would cause more problems than it would solve.  Hopefully, we can do it further down the road, if the institutions are working.  I emphasise the point, however, and it is important to put on the record, that if people have difficulties with the agreement or see something in its workings, all that can be dealt with in a review.  You do not have to change the basis, structure or the fundamentals of the agreement.</p><p>I will not speak to them all, but I can think of about five or six things that should be changed, but time will tell.  Maybe we should have a fixed-term parliament where one you can only pull out after 15 years or so, and where everyone has to stay working together.</p></speech>

The women's groups are working very hard to get over issues and to make progress.  It has to come from within.  People have to feel they want to reconcile.  I would like to see more and more.  Imagine a position here in these Houses, whereby for some reason or another we were not sitting - other than during a pandemic - and we were a non-functioning Government.  The parties would definitely be working themselves to try to make these things happen.  It is a pity that all of these years on, and sometimes with people who maybe should know better, they are not prepared to get into those discussions to try to find solutions.  We cannot expect to sit around here waiting for Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi to find solutions, or whoever the next British Prime Minister is to find solutions, or for the Government down here to find solutions.  All the parties in the North have to try to do this.  This happened in Christmas 2019 and Christmas 2020, when Mr. Julian Smith, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the parties got together for intense discussions, and they got the institutions up and running in early 2020.  I would like to see that kind of intensity again, but some people do not want to engage at the moment.</p></speech>

It is really useful in this project to have someone who was there for the negotiation and the implementation.  I apologise that I have missed parts of the meeting and that I am not there in person.  Unfortunately, it is all moving very fast here today.  It would be nice to be in a parliament that does not use physical coercion, as has happened in the one I am sitting in today.</p> <p>  I want to pick up on some of the questions I heard from others.  There was a point that nobody has really come up with a better solution to the challenges in Northern Ireland than partnership and compromise and the architecture to deal with those.  Some of the change and evolution that has happened to the institutions has been for good and for ill, and while the St. Andrews Agreement has not necessarily all been positive, the creation of an opposition is one of several things that can lead us to move to a more constructive politics.  How does Mr. Ahern believe it would be best to manage some of that review?  We have not had a structured strategic review built in.  There are mechanisms within the agreement but there has not been a timetabled way that we collectively look back at what can be improved.  Generally, it has happened on the basis of crisis and perhaps has been done as a kind of side deal and over the heads of the people rather than taking a more co-ordinated look, including some of the things that could improve operation and could remove the veto culture.  What is Mr. Ahern's view on how we could best approach the reviews that might happen if, for example, we find ourselves unable to form an Executive in another few months?</p> <p>  Did we miss in the early years of the agreement the structures as a way to address legacy of the Troubles and as a way to put in place mechanisms for justice and for support for those people?</p> <p>  This committee is seeking ways to engage constructively in the conversation around constitutional change, and genuinely to curate that, as envisaged in strand three, as a contest of ideas of two legitimate constitutional aspirations rather than potentially as a committee diving towards one outcome and maybe undermining the intent in that.  What does Mr. Ahern believe would be a useful way for this committee to progress the conversation about constitutional change in a way that brings in different voices and which does not give the impression we are only interested in that part of the agreement, which is the part that would result in constitutional change?</p></speech>

If we start the debate on the review we could be here for God knows how many Christmases.  It is better to get the institutions up and then try to deal with that issue.  As I pointed out, it is 16 years since there was a review.  Times change, views change, and circumstances change.  I do not believe there is any problem with having review if the institutions are up and running.  The review could look across the three strands.</p> <p>  On the third strand, which is the east-west one, there is a change because the United Kingdom is no longer in the European Union and because there is not the attention or the close contact since 1973 there was between the Irish Government and the British Government, and that certainly is something that now must be looked at.  It is different now.  One thing we never discussed in 1997 and 1998 was the United Kingdom not being in the European Union. We discussed everything else, up every chestnut tree and everywhere about every issue, but we never spoke about that. The context of that dramatically affects strand three.  Given there is not the interaction and the contact between the Irish Government and the British Government, clearly that is an area that should be looked at.  I spoke earlier about strand two that we never said 25 years ago we were just going to have North-South bodies for these areas and then no change.  There are so many other areas that should be looked at.</p> <p>  On legacy, I made the point that I was a big supporter of the Charlie Flanagan initiative with the Stormont House Agreement, and I still am.  That is in the document.  I supported it then and the parties worked very closely at that time.  The parties all agreed with it then, and I believe they agree with it now.  That blueprint is there.  Somewhere along the way the British Government decided that was not something it was prepared to implement.  The parties did work very hard to agree it and to achieve it at the time.  I still believe the legacy and justice issue is somewhere close to the Stormont House Agreement, and certainly not bringing in legislation that nobody agrees with, because does not get anywhere.</p> <p>  I should mention, just as an historical fact, that we did look at the South African models in 1998.  We looked at the idea of having the truth and reconciliation commission.  We looked at that but there were no takers for it in 1998.  It is not that we did not think of them.  I floated the idea but nobody wanted it at the time.  Maybe it was just too early.</p><p> My view on constitutional change is that we should not put the cart before the horse.  The ongoing work with various groups - the shared island initiative, the NESC and the universities - and the academic work is at least under way now.  Perhaps more people will be pulled into those discussions from all sides and from civil society.  At the moment it is very much people from the academic world who are getting involved in the discussions, and that is good.  Experts from abroad are involved.  That is good.  I spend a fair bit of my time on UN stuff nowadays.  Several hundred constitutional changes have happened around the world.  There is a great database as to how those changes happened and how they were brought about and brought in.  I spent three or four years working in Papua New Guinea, where a constitutional referendum occurred.  I looked at the UN stuff.  There is a really good database of information, so we do not have to reinvent the wheel now that the academic institutes are bringing this forward.  It is far better they do it because we cannot blame any political party then.  It is brought forward and can be debated from there.</p><p> Ms Hanna probably missed the point I made earlier about the broader debate and consultation involving everybody and the views of these Houses and the views of Westminster.  Let people set out their views, but I am not convinced about citizens' assemblies.  I am not saying anything against them but I am not convinced.</p></speech>

Some people are joining us online and I will bring them in in the second round.  One point that strikes me is that some of us were recently in Belfast talking to community groups.  They were not political people.  They were in places like Turf Lodge.  The people there tell us that the discussions have ended, there is increasing isolation of the two communities, nothing is moving on the ground and that, perhaps because of the attitude of some leading unionists, there is hostility there now.  There are all these great ideas and all this wonderful, important and essential research being done but, returning to Mr. Ahern's point about having everybody involved, if we do not get that, we will not get anywhere.  That will be the end of it.  All our efforts, from my perspective, have to be on what Mr. Ahern spoke about there.  It is a matter of getting cross-party and community group involvement.  Young people in parts of Belfast cannot and will not associate - they are not allowed to associate, actually - with people on the other side of the peace line because of the atmosphere in some of the communities.  That is what is really damaging.</p></speech>

They will not talk.  They say that if they talk to us on an official basis, they participate in what we are talking about.  On the point about the progress made in North-South co-operation on health, and certainly on an all-island cancer strategy, having an all-island strategy for education threatens nobody.  You spoke about a job creation agency.  Can more work be done on that?  These are the things that can build this up.</p> <p>  As for our next speakers, I understand that Alliance has sent an apology.  We now move back to Sinn F&eacute;in and then Independents.  I acknowledge that Senator Black was present earlier, but she was not in the House so we could not take her contribution.  She was happy with that, though.  Deputy Lawless has to leave now.  The problem is that while people can attend here in the Houses or from elsewhere outside the Houses, if they are Members and they are outside the Houses they may not speak, which is a bit of a conundrum.</p> <p>  It is over to Sinn F&eacute;in now.  We will keep the contribution to 20 minutes if that is okay.</p></speech>

My generation, in particular, has benefited greatly from the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process over those intervening years.</p> <p>  I wish to focus on North-South co-operation.  I know this issue was considered at the time and that there have been conversations about northern representation in the Oireachtas.  I would like to hear Mr. Ahern's views.  In hindsight, does he feel that more consideration should have been given to allowing MPs or MLAs to sit in the Oireachtas or contribute to these Houses?</p> <p>  As a follow-up point, picking up on the constitutional conversation, there is growing momentum and growing support in that regard, and we see that opinion poll after opinion poll shows that support is moving in the direction of a unity referendum and that support is growing for such a referendum.  I want to hear Mr. Ahern's views.  I read an article in which he stated that the 30th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement may be a possible time for a referendum.  Is that still his opinion?  Does he still see that date as a possible date for a referendum?</p></speech>

We never got anywhere on the debate about representation in the Oireachtas.  We discussed that for many years but there was not great support down here for it.  People were prepared to go for committees but were not prepared to see people who were elected to the assembly participate in Leinster House.  We tried it for the first few years but there was no great support for it.  There were some constitutional difficulties as well but I do not think they were the main reason for the lack of support.</p> <p>  As for the date for a constitutional referendum, my view is that it should be as soon as the work is done and as soon as the questions that need to be answered have been answered.  I said this decade and I still think that is a reasonable proposition.  When I said that, very little work had commenced.  I think that was on the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, so almost five years ago.  We are in a different position now and, thankfully, there is a lot of work ongoing.  I do not know if Ms Begley heard me earlier when I said that if there is to be a referendum, we have to be able to say the institutions and the North-South bodies are up and running, we are making good progress and we are all working together.  The main issues that would come into a referendum, some of which I mentioned earlier, would have to be answered.  My view is that within a few years that work will be done.  I never put the question of finance up front but, as it happens, that is the last one on which work is to be undertaken.</p><p>It is starting in January.  I have always thought the figure the British Government put forward for grant-in-aid in Northern Ireland is not a real figure because you get slices of a whole lot of things into it.  When we are able to see a quantified figure done by professionals and academics away from the political system, it will be a far more interesting debate than it is in a vacuum.  We are not too far away from that, however.  It will probably be a few years.</p></speech>

I also wish to acknowledge his contribution to the Good Friday Agreement and as he recognised, the contribution of everybody involved.  It is a good opportunity for us today to look at this.  One thing struck me earlier this morning in Glencree, when we were talking to the Portuguese President.  He made the point that peace is always a process and this is a process on which we are still working now, albeit that we all want to work in a more focused way.  Obviously, the implementation deficit of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements cause the problems they do.  The Good Friday Agreement itself and the joint declaration set out the agreement to establish a charter of rights for the island of Ireland, which has not been done.  Could Mr. Ahern speak to how that might be done?  What role could he see the Irish Government playing now in doing that?</p> <p>  I want to ask about further and higher education.  For the first time, we now have in the Higher Education Authority Act 2022 explicit provision for North-South further and higher education co-operation.  We carried out a student mobility report recently because of how important student mobility in further and higher education is for opportunities across the island for embedding the peace process.</p> <p>  If we have time, Mr. Ahern might touch on the opportunity cost of Brexit.  How far advanced does he think we could be if it were not for all of the attention, resources and everything else being taken away in trying to deal with Brexit?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, there are conflicting arguments about why we do not have a bill of rights.  It was not contentious at all 25 years ago that we should have a bill of rights.  I was a big supporter of that.  As for whether that worked into a charter of rights, the whole idea was that if we had a bill of rights, it would take account.  It is a pity it was not done because it would have taken account of all of the European law.  It would have been helpful now because as the Deputy knows, since Brexit, the British Government has been trying to change some of these things whereas if we had a bill of rights, we could have said we have an agreed bill of rights and it would not be able to do that.</p> <p>  I still think a bill of rights is a good idea because it is far clearer rather than having to check this, that and the other legislation and other EU laws.  I am not sure the Deputy is happy that a charter of rights or bill of rights would literally be the same thing but I would say it is not too much different.  The Irish Government's position at the time was that it was totally in favour of the bill of rights, as was Tony Blair's Government, but it got lost subsequently.</p></speech>

I cannot remember what year but it was while I sat on the European Council so it was probably the year 2000 or sometime like that.  This was the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which the British Government fought tooth and nail.  It was not just the Court of Justice of the European Union.  This was nothing to do with Ireland.  The idea of a charter of fundamental rights was something the British Government opposed.  It had its charter and believed its charter was the way to go.  I do not know if we ever ended up with a European one but if we did, I would say it was probably watered down because of the British Government's huge opposition.  I recall those debates.  The British Government was quite stringent in its opposition to what were fairly basic things on which none of us would have much disagreement.</p> <p>  The bill of rights I spoke about earlier was not as extensive as that.  The British Government has an ideological position on these things.  As the Deputy knows, they still say on the Court of Justice of the European Union that it is not that they are for or against a court of justice; they just claim that their one is better.  I know we will have difficulties with that.</p> <p>  On higher education, one thing that is really good now, and has been for a number of years, is that there has been much collaboration, co-operation and integration of universities.  As the Deputy knows, because she deals with this all the time, they fight for resources but they have much collaboration.  One good thing was that when we brought EU funding into the university system, that kind of forced them to collaborate and integrate their efforts, which I think is good.  It is also very beneficial on an all-island basis.  Some of the work they are doing on the Constitution now is being done between the universities North and South, so those are good developments.</p></speech>

In fact, it has decreased or remained the same in the last quarter of a century.  That is the missing piece, if you like.</p></speech>

That is an area in which we should be trying to encourage them.  What happens is that they go abroad and do not come back.  Some people might argue the rights and wrongs of that.  From my perspective, that is a pity because we are losing good people who could well get jobs here.  We end up bringing people in internationally, rather than hiring people who were born and reared on the island of Ireland.  There is not great co-operation on that end.  We should make it more welcoming in that regard.  The last figures I saw were from before the pandemic, from 2018, but the proportion of students from the unionist tradition in Northern Ireland who were going outside the island of Ireland for their education was quite high.  That is a loss.  That is an area in which we should almost be encouraging them to-----</p></speech>

The British electorate made a terrible mistake and they are paying for it every day, and so are the rest of us.  I do not want to jump on today's difficulties but somewhere along the line, they should see that.  I know they will not change their mind but they should at least see the benefit of closer co-operation and working together with the European Union and stop arguing over things with which they really agree.</p> <p>  I have been around long enough to recall the Single Market in 1987.  I was Minister for Labour.  In those days, there was a Social Affairs Council, on which I used to cover education, welfare and labour.  You were acting on behalf of the Ministers for Social Welfare and Education, as well as the Minister for Labour.  The whole argument from the Tory British Government was that we needed better integration and we needed the Single Market; all the things it seems to fundamentally think are crazy.</p><p>They were sold a pup.  Unfortunately, they bought a pup somewhere along the way.  I hope I live to see it but I do think their way out of it is to closely associate with, if not rejoin, the customs union.  I do not expect to see them change on the Single Market or other issues, but they never put the customs union to the British people, and they did not have a clue.  I had better not say that.  It was never the debated, so there was no analysis of it.  The first we heard of them withdrawing from the customs union was January 2017, not 2016.  That is what has caused the problems, in particular the problem for Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

I also want to acknowledge his role in the peace process and the commitment he had to it.  We were lucky with the work Albert Reynolds did before Mr. Ahern and the work Tony Blair did.  We had an alignment of the right conditions to make the Good Friday Agreement work.  Unfortunately, what George Mitchell said at the time was right - that the easy bit was over, and the hard bit starts now.  Twenty-five years on, as Mr. Ahern knows, we still do not have full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.<br/><br/>There are certain positives.  I shared a platform on Monday night with Ben Collins, who has written a book, <i>Irish Unity: Time to Prepare</i>, and young Peter Adair, who is at Oxford University.  Ben was educated in Dundee and Peter is in Oxford.  Both of them left this country for an education and realised their Irishness.  They are now part of a growing voice of civic people from within the unionist community who want to engage and have dialogue.  Glenn Bradley is one of those people who has just been confirmed for the Ireland's Future event in November.  He referred to some of the abuse he is already getting on Twitter.  He said: &quot;They truly fear confident, free thinking minds capable of [their] own assessment and debate.&quot;  There are confident, free-thinking minds on this island - people who come from a unionist tradition who want to be part of the planning.  They want to be as much part of the birth of a new nation as we do.  Unfortunately, political unionism is holding them back in many senses.  We have some brilliant people coming forward and engaging in those debates.<br/><br/>Ms Begley asked a question about northern representation.  Sometimes the hardest conversations we have are down here with people from other political parties who have nearly as big a mindset against unification as what we deal with in the North.  The more work that we do down here, the more we get to know one another.<br/><br/>Mr. Ahern spoke a great deal today about dialogue.  More dialogue would be very useful in this building among us all, and in bringing people in from the unionist tradition.  I was very disappointed that Ian Marshall is no longer here as he did great work in the Seanad and I would love to have seen more of that.  We need to find a way to open up those lines of communication and keep the dialogue going in order that we can move forward.  If people want to make the case for the <i>status quo</i>, I would appreciate and look forward to that debate too.  The problem is that once people start writing their list of pros and cons, that list is very one-sided.  It is hard to argue the merits when we see what is happening in London today.  By way of a wee bit of information, the bookies have reduced the odds on Boris Johnson coming back into No. 10.  It is not getting any better.  When we look at what is happening and the turbulence we have had in Britain in recent days, it is very hard to make a strong case against unity.  Those are my thoughts.  If Mr. Ahern would like to comment on any of the, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

In terms of dialogue, co-operation and trying to work, I do not know what it is like in the Houses nowadays - I can only watch a certain amount of it on TV - but Northern Ireland discussions and debates and Question Time used to take up nearly all the time at one time.  I know there are a lot of competing demands nowadays for time.  The real dialogue can come from the Border counties in particular because they are dealing with the same issues relating to business, agriculture and trade.  There is no difference.  The more of that that happens the better.</p> <p>  In fairness, I think many of the young people coming up are open to debate and dialogue, but it is how the case is put to them that will be the challenge for the period ahead.  There is so much information nowadays.  Social media plays its part.  It fills so much.  It was easier to focus the debate into certain areas but now it is harder to do it.  I am confident.  Ms Gildernew is right.  There are a lot of people involved.  From my time in Queen's University, I know there are very good debates and dialogue about where people are going.  The only thing I would say is that we just need to be careful and not to over-scare people because they need to be pulled into the debate.  That is the big challenge.  I do not want to mention any names, but I try my best with politicians in the North and say to them that they should participate in the debate.  It is a hard sell to them.  They really feel that if they participate in the debate, they are being sucked in to something they cannot get out of, which is not the case.  We have to say to them that what we are trying to do is just have a debate about the future.  They should not feel the future is being orchestrated just one way.  There has to be balance in the debates because if there is not, they see it as being all one way.  I know people were trying to do that in the debate in the conference centre a few weeks ago but it is very important that these things are seen to be even-handed, and that people are given their right of audience and if they go along, they are treated with respect and dignity and everyone gets a chance.  If we get into the business of shouting people down, it just looks all wrong.  I know how that fits into the mindset of unionists and loyalists.  When we do have debates down here, we have to be careful how they are handled.</p></speech>

It is great to listen to him, as one of the principal architects of the Good Friday Agreement, and to listen to the great preparatory work that was done leading up to the negotiations.  He was very generous in his compliments to other people who participated and who played a very active and positive role in the negotiations.  Sadly, three of the main players are gone to their eternal reward - John Hume, Seamus Mallon and David Trimble.  On a day like this, I am very glad that Mr. Ahern paid particular tribute to their work.</p> <p>  Having been in the parliamentary party with Mr. Ahern during that period, we were broadly aware of what was going on but obviously not in any detail.  I mentioned previously at the committee that Mr. Ahern prepared our own party for changes because, as my colleague Senator McGreehan said, we were very attached to Articles 2 and 3 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  He did the preparatory work.  He met a large number of Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies and Senators in Ballyconnell in the early hours one morning prior to the conclusion of the negotiations.  He outlined for us what had to be done and what we would achieve by being willing to embrace change from the point of view of the constitutional provisions at that time.  As the Cathaoirleach said, it was painstaking work.</p> <p>  Having been privileged to attend an event in Belfast on the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in which President Clinton, Tony Blair, Mr. Ahern, George Mitchell and the other political party leaders in Northern Ireland participated, there was a message of respect for each other's tradition.  One message that I got that night as well is that there was a generosity, in particular between the British and Irish Governments, and an understanding of the other side's difficulties.  I recall that mention was made of the evening of the removal of Mr. Ahern's mother, when Mr. Blair rang him subsequently and said that he could not honour some commitment he had given Mr. Ahern to bring the broader unionist family with him, and Mr. Ahern had gone and got the broader nationalist community to buy in to some part of the negotiations.</p><p>It was explained that night by Tony Blair and Mr. Ahern that they were both understanding of the difficulties of the other.  The message I got that night was that in negotiation one has to be not only respectful but also generous to the other point of view, without losing one's core principles in any way.</p><p> Mention was made of the British-Irish relationships.  Sadly, they have been at a low ebb in recent times, particularly due to the unilateral actions Mr. Ahern referred to, including with regard to the Stormont House Agreement, the protocol legislation and the appalling legacy legislation.  Tinpot regimes in South America would not come up with such desperate legislative measures or proposals.  It is shocking that any parliamentary democracy would embrace such proposals.  Every party, every representative civic organisation group and the groups that have worked with victims in Northern Ireland, such as the WAVE Trauma Centre and other advocacy groups, are strongly opposed to those measures.  That shows how out of touch the British Government was in bringing them forward.</p><p> We are reaching the 50th anniversary of some of the desperate atrocities that were inflicted on innocent people, both North and South.  When speaking to some of the families who have never seen justice achieved in relation to the murder of a brother, sister, daughter or son, I often think that the grief intensifies as we go on and people realise their family members are gone to their graves and they have not got to the truth about the murder of one of their own.  Mr. Ahern will recall the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and he is more familiar with them than I am.  The 50th anniversary of the Belturbet bombing of 1972, a desperate atrocity, is coming up on 28 December.  Thankfully, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na announced a new investigation into that case yesterday with some new lines of inquiry.  Thankfully that is happening.  Those families have always acted with grace and dignity in campaigning not for vengeance or for people to be locked up and put in cells but to at least get the truth on the desperate atrocity inflicted on their family members.  On legacy, I am glad Mr. Ahern so strongly reiterated his belief in the Stormont House Agreement.  That was the blueprint to achieve progress in difficult areas.  Nobody will underestimate the difficulty in achieving progress on legacy issues but that was a good blueprint to which the political parties in Northern Ireland and the two Governments agreed.</p><p> On the business community, those of us who represent Border counties are familiar with trade between the North and the South.  Thankfully, we have a huge all-Ireland economy on this island today, one that has grown without any flag-waving and without people being attached to their political ideologies.  Businesses with the right environments have gone out and developed.  Enterprises that were sited in this State have parts of their business in Northern Ireland and similarly Northern Ireland business have enterprises here.  That has been wonderful from the point of view of increasing trade, generating revenue and, importantly, creating employment in Border regions where it is not easy to attract inward investment and people are dependent on indigenous industry.  The business community is concerned about the ongoing issues with Brexit.  It seems some people in the agricultural community do not to want to speak up on the political issues that are clouding the protocol issue.  That is a concern.</p><p> What has been Mr. Ahern's interaction with different civic groups in Northern Ireland?  What message is he getting from the business community on the protocol and on ironing out the difficulties?  In fairness to every member of the Government here, including the Taoiseach, and the European Union, they have repeatedly stated that there are some issues that can be ironed out.  The proposals the Commission published in October 2021 would reduce the necessity for inspections by more than 70%.  That is a message that needs to be communicated loud and clear.  I am often disappointed with how silent business is on these particular issues in Northern Ireland.</p><p> I have read transcripts of Mr. Ahern's contributions at committees in Westminster, particularly the committees of the House of Lords, and he has always got a warm welcome there.  There is a good understanding, particularly among former secretaries of state or people who served as ministers in the Northern Ireland Office, such as Paul Murphy, Peter Hain and others, on the craziness of Brexit and how it will adversely impact on this island and their own country.  We often want to pay tribute to the British Members of Parliament and Members of the House of Lords who have consistently been good allies of our country.  During the previous D&aacute;il, we had significant interaction between committees at Westminster and committees of this House.  I attended many of those meetings with different committees in Westminster, be it Hilary Benn's Committee on the Future Relationship with the European Union or the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, which was chaired by Tom Tugendhat at the time.  When they were making presentations here and when we were engaged in meetings with them, the British members were split 50:50.  Some 50% of the membership would have been anti-Brexit and 50% would have been pro-Brexit.  There is a sizeable community in Westminster politics who we should regard as friends of our country.  Some of them have stood out over the years as being active in supporting different Irish issues.</p><p> People often say the Irish Government needs to do more on Irish-British relationships.  More can always be done but we should never underestimate what is done through our diplomatic corps.  Everyone in this room will have had an opportunity to engage with Adrian O'Neill and his colleagues when he was ambassador in London.  They are always intensively putting the Irish case forward, which is a great credit to them.  When former senior civil servants from the Department of Foreign Affairs made presentations to this committee they were laudatory of the political leadership of Mr. Ahern and Tony Blair and of the role of US President Clinton and George Mitchell.  We also need to take into account the ongoing daily work at diplomatic level with people in Westminster.  That does not take away from the current difficulties or the need to make progress.</p><p> I sincerely thank Mr. Ahern for his fantastic contribution to achieving the Good Friday Agreement and his obvious work in recent years on Brexit.  He has met different groups, attended public meetings and has been accessible to groups form all political traditions, which is much valued.  I recently read about the meeting Barry Andrews MEP convened in Brussels in which Mr. Ahern, along with MLAs from all political parties in Northern Ireland, participated.  That type of dialogue is very important.  It is by dialogue that we can resolve these issues.</p></speech>

There are issues of implementation and I have talked to some CEOs who say it is still cumbersome and that there is too much form filling and too many delays.  They are more worried about the delays than the form filling, which is done online and does not take that long.  There are delays with products.  I do not want to mention names but some of the big companies that would be known to all of us and whose products would be in all of our houses say there are difficulties.  They are reluctant to get involved in the debate.  They see advantages and disadvantages but they do not want to play those.</p><p>I have not met anybody in Northern Ireland who is involved or who works in business and who has told me that he or she wants to leave the Single Market.  I have asked the strongest of unionists whether, following their line, they wished to leave the Single Market and I have yet to find one who wishes to do so.  We have been dealing with this matter for a good few years.</p><p> An agreement will have to be found with regard to the EU-UK customs agreement.  We are not involved in the detail of these things.  I do not wish to simplify the matter, but it seems that the red lane or express lane or whatever one calls it, is the way of dealing with it, and it looks as though the EU is up for that.  How does one deal with the companies and allow people in?  The term those involved like to use is "trusted traders".  If people are in the category of being trusted traders between the UK and Northern Ireland, there are only checks.</p><p> There were always checks.  I hate this argument about checks.  There have been checks since 100 years ago on health, hygiene and security grounds.  I hear some people in the North say there cannot be any checks.  If somebody thinks there is a whole load of drugs or explosives in a box, will the box not be checked?  Let us be real.  Checks have always happened.  They happen everywhere in the world.  Even banana republics check things when they think there is a risk.  It is not an argument.</p><p> The parameters have to be worked out.  There are higher risks with regard to the sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, risks.  They are not as easy to solve some of those things.  However, I think the EU is happy to have a broad definition of retailers and to extend the definition of "trusted traders".  I am nearly certain, from the conference hosted by Barry Andrews, which all the parties attended, that the EU said it would be prepared to go for one form per shipment.  Even doing that manually will not be too difficult.  Most of the big companies are doing it by technology anyway.  There is no form with that.</p><p> I am told the VAT issue is not a problem.  State aids are more difficult.  I am not sure what the solution is in that regard.  I am not competent enough, but there are difficulties with state aids.  The issue with SPS is that EU rules must apply.  There is no way that the European Union will set aside its SPS standards for the British or any other individual country's standards.  If it did, it would have war with every other country in Europe.  EU standards are considered to be of the highest international standard and have been copied by many other parts of the world.  There is no way it will drop or share those standards.  We also know about the European Court of Justice issue.  Those are the main issues.</p><p> I am sure that if the Cathaoirleach and a group of his colleagues were at this for a few days, these issues would be doable.  We are not dealing with the impossible.  It was far harder to negotiate parts of the Good Friday Agreement and many other things since than it will be to deal with these issues.  If there is a will, there is a way.  However, we have to leave a question mark in respect of that.  I know that discussions have started again and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach have been meeting the parties this week.  I also know that the EU is trying to get proper meetings with the UK.  Ongoing events are probably not helping that but I hope it will be able to do so.</p><p> Those are the areas around the solutions.  Medicines are out of the protocol.  The EU rules must be followed on the SPS issues.  The definition of "retailer" is broad.  Trusted traders are accepted.  Red lines and express lanes should be agreed.  That is where the solution lies, and the parameters relating to it are fairly clear.  I have been across this stuff for six years.  I do not think the task is insurmountable if people wish to solve the matter.</p></speech>

I was listening to Mr. Ahern and reflecting on my formative years, which were the years of negotiation leading up to the Good Friday Agreement when I watched his significant and important contribution.  What struck me was his regular contribution to politics in the North.  As Mr. Ahern said, it used to dominate the time in the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  I was thinking of a neighbour and friend of mine who passed away a few years ago, John Doherty or "Johnny Doc", as we knew him.  Johnny was a veteran IRA man who was interned as a teenage schoolboy in the 1940s.  His family fought hard to have him released because he was 15.  He was subsequently released but when he turned 16, they came back and interned him again.  I remember Johnny saying to a colleague of mine that he felt he was living in a united Ireland because there was not a day he did not turn on the TV to see the Taoiseach or the President in the city, both of them involved and engaged.</p> <p>  We have talked much today about building and restoring relationships such as British-Irish, unionist-nationalist relationships but there is also an island of Irish-Irish relationships that need to be rebuilt.  Ms Gildernew touched on it, and Mr. Ahern reflected on the sort of NIMBYism that exists in this institution with regard to speaking rights for elected representatives, not to vote on legislation or finance, but just for scrutiny roles similar to this committee.  I asked something similar of other witnesses in this round of meetings regarding how the State could act in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement in the context of delivering.</p> <p>  Mr. Ahern led the charge on Articles 2 and 3 at the time.  Some people think that Articles 2 and 3 were scrubbed when, in fact, they were replaced.  There is an obligation to ensure that everyone born on the island has the right to be part of the Irish nation.  I am keen to get Mr. Ahern's view on how those articles are given effect to, as opposed to its being inserted and that being it.  How does the State and the Government do that with regard to speaking rights on non-contentious committees?  I am sure this will surprise Mr. Ahern, if he is not already aware of it, that we had a Joint Committee on Autism on which parties in this House voted against having MLAs and MPs.  Autism affects people throughout Ireland.  The cross-Border autism centre is based in Armagh.  It receives funding from the Executive.</p> <p>  How does Mr. Ahern think practical effect will be given to Articles 2 and 3.  How will we get to the point again whereby the Government will be respectful of all views and will not brand views around constitutional change as being divisive?  A notion has crept into the vernacular, of Ireland and Northern Ireland, as if Ireland ends at Dundalk.  There has been a recent change in tone.  How do we get the Government and the State to act and think nationally?  How do we get it to be present and engaged nationally?</p> <p>  Mr. Ahern will be shocked to hear that I am not from a Fianna F&aacute;il family.  The reason I mention Johnny Doc's statement from way back when is that a constant memory of mine is watching the news reports at the time and seeing how people in the community and city I come from saw Mr. Ahern - and his predecessor - as being their Taoiseach.  It is safe to say that Mr. Ahern saw us as his fellow citizens and countrymen.  I do not know if that is a prevailing feature of the current Government.  I am interested in how we meet in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and the replacement Articles 2 and 3 in order to get back into a situation-----</p></speech>

This is where strand two comes in.  Remember where we are at.  The internal Northern Ireland position should be maintained until there is a change by the people through a vote.  There is also the east-west relationship.  Strand two, however, was designed and meant to be the place where we would have debate and interaction.  We had the longer list of North-South bodies, as the Senator knows, which we placed first for discussion.  When that was not agreed, strand two was still there for us to follow through on.  That is where Ministers, both North and South, deputations, officials and other people could be brought in.  That is how I saw the North-South bodies evolving.  It worked for a while, although it has not worked at all for a long time, and that is where I see it.  The North-South bodies should almost be a daily issue, where we are discussing matters and affiliated groups are involved.  That is where that debate should be.  There is lots of scope to do that.</p> <p>  In my time, we were at it in respect of health and agriculture.  I watched the fisheries discussions that went on in the past year or so.  These were ideal matters for proper activity involving North-South bodies, where people could get involved.  It does not have to be just at ministerial level.  It can involve Members of this House or organisations being brought into those discussion.  That is the spirit of the constitutional change we brought in.  That is how I envisioned it.  Some years ago, I made a speech somewhere along the way about how that should evolve.  I admit it has not evolved that way.  I cannot help the Senator on that one.</p></speech>

There is a view that much of the criminality that has taken place since the Good Friday Agreement has been given a kind of blind eye.  It was part of the agreement back then, although it was not in writing, that there was an arrangement between the Governments whereby a blind eye was turned to some of the criminality that happened and continues to happen along the Border.  What is Mr. Ahern's view on that?  Was that the case?  Moreover, how do we deal with it because it is a particular scourge?</p></speech>

It was never sought or given.  Criminality is criminality regardless of who is associated with it or behind it.  We all agree it has to be stamped out with no protection offered.  It is always difficult if there are two jurisdictions and two different sets of police.  One of the arguments people will make is that if we had one jurisdiction, border criminality would be easier to eradicate.</p> <p>  Criminality is not confined to the Border.  As a constituency, criminals are good at some of that to this day at the port and other areas.  There can be no protections for that.  Practices have grown up over the Troubles for obvious reasons, because of the level of security that was on the Border and how policing was maybe not able to operate as freely, but I would like to think that, 25 years after the Good Friday Agreement, police on both sides of the Border can go anywhere and deal with criminality.  That has to be the case.  Nobody wants to condone criminality or threats.</p> <p>  There is a bigger issue in modern society that has nothing to with the North or the Troubles.  It involves witnesses who were engaged in crime.  It is not only an Irish thing.  I hope people who were engaged in crime get away from it because witnesses are intimidated and threatened.  That is not an issue to do with Northern Ireland but an issue to do with crime generally.</p></speech>

There is no problem.  The Senator has a right to speak; I certainly support that.  I am sure we all want to hear her.</p></speech>

We have heard young voices that have been incredibly powerful.  We have had a mixture of different voices.  Academics attended the last session, including some from the likes of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  It is incorrect to say we are not engaged in this conversation and putting it on the agenda.  We very much are and the Seanad consultation is part of that.  This committee will produce a report on it as well.  We have seen excellent papers coming forward from the likes of the ESRI under the shared island unit relating to anybody's starting point, which is the nuts and bolts of how things actually work in health and education.  We will build on that with the academic papers that have been referenced.</p> <p>  It should be everybody's priority that this conversation and the setting of the agenda is done in a generous and respectful way.  It is not helpful if parties are told they are not interested in having the conversation about unity or constitutional change because they do not necessarily agree with being bounced into a citizens' assembly.  There are other ways of doing that.  I worry about the broader impact that has on people who are hesitant about engaging with this conversation and that if they open their mouths about, or do not agree with, one party's version of how it is done, they will be shamed about it.  How can we have an inclusive outcome from a process if we cannot even agree there are different perspectives on an inclusive process to actually do it?</p> <p>  I was interested in what Mr. Ahern had to say about the citizens' assembly.  It is very important we engage youth and, as the Cathaoirleach said, we engage communities.  We are running engagement at community and political level.  I would be interested to hear what Mr. Ahern might think of an Oireachtas committee or the likes of the New Ireland Forum, which had a role in the past, that kind of approach to bringing in all the perspectives, and, critically, how we avoid people feeling their voices will be silenced and shamed if they do not share the same perspective as others.</p></speech>

There are a number of elements to what the Senator said.  We are trying to involve everybody in the debate.  Whenever I get a chance, I try to ask and persuade people from the unionist and loyalist traditions, even though I have no power, to participate in what they see as a new or agreed Ireland or find out why they are totally against it.  They might want to tell us why they think it is poppycock.</p><p>That would be fair enough but it is to try to engage in the debate.  However, if they see that when you do not agree with the line, you are in trouble - and I referred earlier to the recent conference - people are entitled to have their view because otherwise, it will work against the purpose.  I am aware it is not the organisers but people have to work very hard to try to get others to participate in the debate without fear or favour and to not intimidate them out of it.  That requires a bit of handling.</p><p> On the idea of a forum, I would far prefer a forum of elected representatives.  I would give a gold medal to everyone who has served in a citizens' assembly.  Fair play to them and I am not saying anything against them.  If, however, the committee is asking me whether a citizens' assembly is the way that we bring together the whole of the work that is going on, then I am not so sure.  That decision is not for now.</p><p> I am not a great lover of citizens' assemblies anyway about any issue.  I do not like the idea of 100 people gathering and getting papers and so on.  If I was on it and I could influence it then I might have a different view but when I am outside of it and if I do not see my view reflected then I am upset about it.  It is just how it goes.  I was at a recent assembly and when I gave an alternative view on the mayoralty issue, the chairman - who happens to be a good friend of mine, was the Dublin manager of the team that took six all-Ireland medals and is a man I hold in high regard - said to me that we were not at the assembly to listen to alternative views.  He said that they had been told in the terms of reference that the view was we are to have a lord mayor and that we were only there to discuss the structure.  I asked myself what was I doing there anyway.  I was coming with an alternative view but they did not want it at all because they just did not think it was a good idea.  If terms of reference are framed in a way that the decision has to be almost one way, then I do not like it.  As for any debate on an issue as important as the future of our island, the future of our country and how we are going to operate for the next 100 years, I would far prefer it to be taken by people who are elected to the chambers, rather than people whose names were tossed into a computer and pulled out like the lotto numbers.  That is not to take anything away from them but that is my view.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern might be interested in that.  It was not the political parties but there was participation by unionist voices.</p></speech>

It is a pity that the unionist politicians will not participate, even if they would like to come along to tell us that they think we are wrong.  In fairness to the McGimpseys in 1984 or whenever it was - they are still around - to their credit they came down and they participated in the forum all those years ago.  It would be important were they to come down.  I believe they are wrong, however, to take the view that they will not participate because that means they are sucked in to the outcome.  That is not what any of us are saying.</p></speech>

As a committee, we are going to Westminster - hopefully they will still be there in a couple of weeks' time - to talk about it.  That is a forum.  I have spoken to unionist elected politicians in the North.  They have a problem coming here.  They have the same right as anybody else to come in here but they do not want to come in here.  They have met us, however, and maybe it will be helpful to build up a relationship through that House of Commons committee, on which unionist MPs can and do sit.  This might be one way to a circular discussion.  This is something we can explore.</p></speech>

It is very important to us.  I thank Mr. Ahern for the contribution of his insights and experience, as well as his wealth of knowledge and contacts.  The whole history of modern Ireland is tied up with Bertie Ahern.  Northern Ireland is something where Mr. Ahern has been uniquely placed to bring about peace.  We must all acknowledge that.  We look forward to Mr. Ahern hopefully continuing to contribute to our national debate.  It is a role perhaps Mr. Ahern is happy to play, it is a matter for himself, but we are very happy to have Mr. Ahern here, to listen to him and to have his perspective at all times.  I believe this is a universal view at this table.  Thank you very much.</p></speech>
