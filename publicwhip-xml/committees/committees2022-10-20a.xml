Apologies have been received from Deputy Matt Carthy.</p> <p>  If attendees are contributing from within the committee room, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members of the committee who are attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of the Parliament.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the place the Parliament has chosen to sit.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Paul Southern, deputy director of audit, from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to examine the following matters from the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Account of the Public Services 2021: Chapter 3 - Vote accounting and budget management; Chapter 4 - the reallocation of voted funding; the format and content of the appropriation accounts; and the value for money and spending reviews.</p> <p>  The Department has also been advised that correspondence concerning the following may also be raised: the closure of the Benefacts database; the National Maternity Hospital; and a recent minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which is the official response to the recommendations in the committee&rsquo;s report.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the Department: Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General and Accounting Officer; Mr. John Kinnane, assistant secretary, expenditure policy division; Ms Niamh Callaghan, principal officer, expenditure policy division; and Mr. David Feeney, principal officer, corporate office.  You are all very welcome.  I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards reference that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means the witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#A00600"><p>As members are aware, central government Departments and offices deliver or oversee a wide range of public services.  Expenditure required in relation to those services is provided for each year under a number of voted Estimates approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  If circumstances require, additional funding can be provided through Supplementary Estimates.  Ultimately, the voted provisions are given legal effect in an annual Appropriation Act.</p> <p>  The Accounting Officer for each voted service is required to prepare an annual appropriation account within three months of the end of the calendar year.  This must conform to the reporting requirements set out in the relevant appropriation account circular issued each year by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The accounts are prepared on a cash basis, which means they report the actual cash transactions of the Votes in the year.  Some additional accrual-based information is also provided, in notes 1 and 2 to the accounts.  The accrual basis is the standard method for accounting.  Broadly, it aims to report the true costs of an economic activity in the period of account, and the value of any related assets and liabilities at the end of the period.</p> <p>  The Department determines the framework and basis of accounting for annual financial reporting by all public bodies.  In addition to the accounts circular and other guidance set out in Public Financial Procedures, the Department has issued the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, and the Public Spending Code.  Collectively, these represent the specific public sector standards and expectations against which my office carries out the audits of the accounts and financial statements of the bodies within my remit.</p><p> Chapter 3 deals with Vote accounting and budget management in the aggregate.  The chapter aggregates and summarises the results of all 45 appropriation accounts for 2021.  My office compiles this report each year because there is no other published source of aggregated appropriation account information.</p><p> The Appropriation Act 2021 provided for spending on voted services totalling &euro;76 billion.  This was to be funded by the issuing of up to &euro;73.1 billion from the Central Fund of the Exchequer and the use of certain expected Vote receipts, referred to as appropriations-in-aid, of up to &euro;2.9 billion.  In addition, unused capital funding totalling &euro;710 million was carried over from 2020 for spending in 2021, bringing the total available Vote funding to &euro;76.7 billion.</p><p> A Department or office may not spend more than is legally provided for a Vote.  In 2021, total gross expenditure for all 45 Votes amounted to &euro;74.5 billion.  The aggregate surplus for the year was almost &euro;2.5 billion.  Some &euro;819 million of the surplus was approved for carryover to 2022 and the remaining &euro;1.7 billion was liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.</p><p> Within each Vote Estimate, the funding approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is allocated to various programmes and subheads and the appropriation accounts must report on spending at that level.  For practical reasons, as set out in public financial procedures, there are arrangements to vary the allocations between subheads within an individual Vote.</p><p> When underspending on an individual subhead is anticipated, the key principle is that the Exchequer has the first claim on the saving.  However, there are two formal mechanisms in place to allow for voted funding to be reallocated between subheads during the year.  These are the passing of a technical Supplementary Estimate by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or a process called virement, which is usually used for lower-value transfers and requires the prior approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p> In the course of audit of the appropriation accounts for 2021, a number of cases were identified where there was reallocation of voted funding between Vote subheads but where the prescribed transfer procedures did not appear to have been complied with.  Chapter 4 outlines the circumstances of four such cases.</p><p> The total amount transferred through the virement process by the four Votes referred to in the chapter was more than &euro;1 billion.  The prior approval of the Department had not been obtained in all cases where required, resulting in the need for so-called retrospective sanction.  Additionally, there is an evident requirement for better documentation of virement decisions.</p><p> Some of the amounts reallocated using virement were substantial by reference to the original subhead provisions, which in effect represent the level of spending envisaged by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The principles in public financial procedure indicate that a Supplementary Estimate should be used for such large transfers.  This would allow the relevant sectoral committee of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, in a timely way, to examine the reasons for both the emerging savings and the planned additional expenditure and to make recommendations in that regard.</p></speech>

As set out in the invitation, he has five minutes.  I know his statement is quite long because I read it yesterday evening.  Could he please summarise it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me.  I will just briefly address each of main items on the agenda.</p> <p>  Turning to chapter 3 of the report, the total gross expenditure outturn for 2021 amounted to &euro;74.5 billion.  This level of funding supports the provision of a wide range of public services, infrastructure investment and income supports.  There were a number of expenditure developments within 2021.  Covid-related restrictions had a significant impact on the lives of Irish people, requiring a continued Government response.  Some &euro;13.5 billion was spent in 2021 on Covid-related measures.  This level of expenditure reflects the funding allocated to support people, businesses and public services with the challenges posed by the pandemic. </p> <p>  There was capital carryover, or deferred surrender, in 2021 amounting to &euro;819 million, sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for use in 2022.  In addition, &euro;1.7 billion was surrendered back to the Exchequer.  These developments are due to a combination of factors, including slower than anticipated progress on capital projects driven by closures of the construction sector in early 2021 as a consequence of public health restrictions and supply chain issues, and also lower than expected uptake of core current services, for example, in the Department of Health, again, driven by the pandemic and public health restrictions.</p> <p>  Chapter 4 of the report refers to instances found in the audit relating to the practice of virement and raises issues as to whether, in some cases, Supplementary Estimates should have been used.</p> <p>  Virement between subheads in a Vote is possible because the Oireachtas, in appropriating money in the annual Appropriation Act, does so by specifying in the Schedule to the Act only the ambit of each Vote.  The Act does not give legal effect to the various subheads, as to do so would almost certainly result in considerable overestimation and would disrupt the smooth working of the financial system.  Accordingly, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has discretion to vary the allocation for each Vote between its constituent subheads.</p> <p>  Public financial procedures recognise that the judgment of the Department in respect of virement is a wide power and provides guidance on instances where the Department may refuse virement, for example, where the additional expenditure: is on a new service, is novel or contentious; is large in relation to the original provision or although relatively small, likely to involve significant liabilities in future years; or arise from a major change of policy. </p> <p>  Within the overall financial parameters and where possible and appropriate, the Department is willing to consider the virement of sums from subheads to other subheads.  The Department considers such cases in the context of the public financial procedures and where it is considered proportionate to facilitate a Department to deliver its policy objectives.</p> <p>  As outlined in chapter 3 of the Comptroller and Attorney General&rsquo;s report, the Revised Estimates for public services provided for a total net fund of almost &euro;67.7 billion across 45 Votes.  After taking account of further Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates, this increased to &euro;73.1 billion in the Appropriation Act 2021.  This increase of &euro;5.4 billion, or 8%, reflected decisions by Government to allocate significant additional funding for measures to respond to Covid-19.  By way of comparison with the last pre-Covid financial year, the increase in net voted funding set out in appropriation account 2019 relative to that year&rsquo;s Revised Estimates was &euro;0.6 billion, or only 1%, of the difference.  In these circumstances, with Government having presented significant additional sums for approval to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in order to respond to Covid-19 and with savings emerging on core expenditure programmes and projects driven by the impact of the pandemic, the Department considered it appropriate and in line with public financial procedures to utilise the virement process to reallocate funding to facilitate delivery of priorities across Departments.</p> <p>  Decisions in relation to granting virement will always, as the public financial procedures make clear, rest significantly on the judgment of this Department.  It would be counterproductive to the goals of both supporting the smooth operation of the Government financial system, and indeed to the operation of the D&aacute;il, if artificial benchmarks were created in respect of the monetary thresholds which if exceeded would require Supplementary Estimates rather than virement.</p> <p>  Briefly on the format and content of the appropriation account, correspondence received by the Department from the committee in November 2021 highlighted a number of issues.  In response, the Department made a number of changes as per the request from the committee in terms of the presentation of the legal </p> <p>costs note in the 2021 accounts.  We provided for the disclosure of the Accounting Officers salary scale or equivalent in a note to the account.  In May, the Department committed to examining changes to the remuneration disclosure, but due regard was needed to the request for disclosure of actual remuneration of officers.  Accordingly, my Department sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  That advice has now been received and is being considered by the Department.</p> <p>  The Department is now reviewing changes that could be made in the appropriation account for 2022, including providing for the disclosure of the accounting officer gross salary and details of pay band analysis.  The Department recently provided an update to the committee on these issues. </p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the Department is also progressing the financial accounting and reporting reforms programme for central government Votes.  That will change the basis of the reporting of the financial statements from a cash to an accrual basis, in line with international public sector accounting standards.</p> <p>  Finally, turning to the value for money and spending reviews, the Department not only focuses on fiscal sustainability, but also the transformation of public services, supporting excellence in service delivery, strategic policy making and public governance structures.  To achieve these goals, it is vital that public expenditure is managed in a planned, balanced and evidence-informed manner to support Ireland&rsquo;s economic, social and climate goals.  This is progressed in a number of ways, including through day-to-day management of resources and regular engagement with Departments throughout the year on their funding.  It is also progressed through a range of important budgetary reform initiatives, including the spending review process.</p> <p>  Spending review is a key platform for the development and publication of evaluation output and the promotion of evidence-informed policy across the Civil Service.  It works in tandem with broader initiatives, such as the establishment and development of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, to develop capacity and enhance the role of economic and value for money analysis in public policy making.  It is with this more complete understanding that policy-makers can work towards the achievement of value for money, efficiency and effectiveness. </p> <p>  I thank the committee members for their attention.  I look forward to our discussion on the agenda items.</p></speech>

There were particular circumstances in 2020 and 2021 related to Covid that impacted in three ways.  First, the closures impacted on capital spend; second, the Government took decisions on supporting businesses and households due directly to Covid but, more important, and maybe most important from the point of view of virement, a lot of ordinary day-to-day services spent less money because people could not access them due to Covid.</p></speech>

The Covid-related restrictions and the unpredictable elements of Covid were much smaller this year than they were in either 2020 or 2021, so we are working to get back to a more normal situation post-Covid.  Normally, we do not really support virement in ordinary circumstances because savings are often time-related savings.</p></speech>

Reallocating those costs this year is no good because you have then spent it and you need it again next year when you have managed to hire people.  During Covid it was slightly different because though the savings are themselves temporary and related to the closures due to Covid, so were the Covid supports they were then used to support.  From our point of view the context for virement in 2020 and 2021 was very different from other years.  One of the things we strove to do was to ensure we did not have &euro;1 billion of extra money from the Oireachtas that was not required.  In fact, because of the unpredictability of Covid and of events as they rolled out through the year we ended up, even with considerable virement of existing allocations, with a very large surrender to the Exchequer at the end of the year.</p></speech>

I am glad Mr. Moloney has raised it.  I am concerned it is being spent at the end of the year in a sort of heavy way on a range of different projects, including the purchase of turnkeys, which the Department says helps finance the development of those properties.  That is fine except there is a willing market out there already looking to purchase homes.  I am interested in Mr. Moloney's Department's oversight relative to the capital spend relative to profile and its capacity to do that.  I understand his Department has that oversight role and that it has somebody liaising with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on its capital spend.  It does, does it not?</p></speech>

What is his Department's capacity to test how the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is doing relative to profile and in its decision-making?  For example, does Mr. Moloney's Department have any engineers, chartered surveyors or any people with professional expertise in the industry or is it somebody else who is supervising it?</p></speech>

If Mr. Moloney's Department's objective is to ensure capital projects are delivered on behalf of the State and it provides the funding for that, in order to be able to effectively oversee that delivery his Department needs to at least have the capacity to test what other Departments are saying to it about delivery of the projects.  A key part of that is the capacity to test it technically as much as from an accounting perspective.</p></speech>

It is not enough to give a big pile of money to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the Department of Transport and to fail to have an oversight mechanism for the State to ensure those Departments are actually being tested externally in some way to ensure those projects are delivered.  The sense one has is there is an awful lot of money in the State but things are not happening and not getting delivered.</p> <p>  I will give a different example with the local authorities.  It is a continual source of frustration in this room that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not able to audit their accounts.  They received, I think, &euro;5.8 billion funding and we have no capacity to test how that is being spent on the delivery of capital projects, whatever about the management of the housing assistance payment or anything else.  The authorities essentially audit themselves and the Comptroller and Auditor General can only go so far.</p> <p>  My question is really about Mr. Moloney's Department's capacity as the ultimate overseer on behalf of the State to technically and expertly probe the management of different projects without having to resort to your KPMGs, your Deloittes or anything else.  Does Mr. Moloney's Department just give the others money and wait for them to come back at the end of the year when each either has a return or it does not?  How can the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform be sure the projects are being A, delivered, B, delivered efficiently, C with the best value for money and that whatever is being learned - because there is always something to be learned on any engineering project - is being captured by the State system for the following capital projects?  Where is the Department's expertise on that, or does it just pass on the money?</p></speech>

I understand the OPW may have rectified the absence of qualified engineers, chartered surveyors and so on, because this came up at this committee before.  It obviously needs a measure of technical expertise to be able to manage projects and so on.  However, that is in respect of the OPW itself.  My suggestion to Mr. Moloney is his Department also needs such expertise.  We have raised legal costs relating to the accounts.  Mr. Moloney raised in his opening statement that the Department is now including legal costs and so on but we still regard that as insufficient, having regard to the Department's own code of practice for what needs to be included in the accounts of State bodies and indeed from a legislative perspective what we have said private bodies need to do.  It should be in the appropriation accounts.</p><p>There should be information concerning temporary agency staffing.  Crucially, it should include gender.  Let us turn, however, to what I am talking about, which is expertise and the question of the expertise available to the State so we do not have to outsource every thought to KPMG.  We are more than well able to do it ourselves.  To be able to properly oversee the delivery of projects funded by the taxpayers and that the Oireachtas has voted money towards, I suggest it is the Department's responsibility to ensure these projects are delivered and that to do this it requires a measure of technical expertise to be able to probe the delivery of these different projects.</p></speech>

We demand business cases for projects and we look at those.  We have a major projects advisory group for very large projects.  We have, therefore, means of assessing these projects.  Again, however, we do not have engineering or other technical expertise and I do not think the Department needs to duplicate that type of expertise.  Quite rightly, the Deputy mentioned the OPW.

I am not suggesting that the Department should get into project delivery.  What I am suggesting is that when the Department is testing how the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is doing in respect of delivery, it should have somebody who can ask probing questions about the delivery of different projects.  The spending of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the example given, is now 30% under profile three quarters of the way through the year.  Were this trajectory to continue, we would say it will be 40% under profile by the end of the year.  Now, we both know that is not going to happen because that Department is going to spend like billy-o at the end of the year.  The question, however, is what this money is going to be spent on.  Are officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sitting down with those from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and asking this question now?  For example, if this money is going to be spent on turnkey developments all over the country, is this what the Government intended would be done or was it intended that housing would be delivered in a different and sustained way throughout the year?  Is this a satisfactory way of managing this endeavour?</p></speech>

There is constant communication.  At all stages, we have a fairly good oversight of how much money is being spent and where it is being spent.  We grant sanction for that spending.  There is an ongoing and detailed conversation in this regard.  We do have visibility regarding where the money is going, if that is the question.  This is what we focus on.</p></speech>

The Department has visibility of where the money is going, but it does not sound like there is a conversation about whether that is enough spending, whether it is correct and whether it will deliver at the end of the year.  If there is constant visibility, is spending of 30% under profile acceptable?  Are other Departments under profile?  Which Departments have spent above profile at this point in the year?  This is an important year from an inflationary management perspective.  We want to spend capital that is there for a range of different reasons.  Which Departments are spending over profile now?</p></speech>

Departments have faced significant challenges this year and last year, first, because of Covid-19 and then due to supply chain disruption related to the war in Ukraine.  There have been considerable challenges, particularly in rolling out new programmes.  As the Deputy will be aware, the national development plan represents a considerable uplift in our capital ambitions.  There is a certain amount of catch-up in the face of Covid-19, supply chain disruption and, as the Deputy said, inflation.</p></speech>

That is a considerable gap and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not testing how it is spending.  Officials are not sitting down with an engineer and asking what the projects are, which are behind and what is not getting delivered.  At the end of the year, as happens at the end of every year in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, it will get caught up somehow.  I appreciate that 2021 was a year affected by Covid-19, but nearly all the Department's money was spent.  Something like &euro;116 million was surrendered, which is a very small proportion of the &euro;5.1 billion the Department had to begin with.  It all got spent at the end of the year because there was a rush to spend it.  My contention is that this is not an acceptable way to manage this within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage itself or for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as the overseer either.  The latter needs to strengthen its expertise to be able to ask more probing questions.</p></speech>

There are far more worthy things, I would assume, that the Secretary General could have come up with.</p> <p>  I have a question on local government.  I may have to get this in writing.  A sum of &euro;5.8 billion is significant.  Has the Department a lack of oversight regarding amounts of central funding of that nature - nearly &euro;6 billion - being allocated?  Especially, when, in Wexford, my local authority got sanction from its councillors to increase local property tax last week, in a cost-of-living crisis, by up to 15%, has the Department an appropriate oversight of the spending of local authorities?</p></speech>

I will start with the Department's dispute over the amount of the postal charges due to An Post for the 2016 general election.  It has been reported that the Department paid &euro;14.1 million to An Post in May 2016 and it disputed the liability of the Exchequer to pay the balance, which was &euro;1.5 million.  Will the Secretary General explain the reason for withholding this money from a State body such as An Post?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.181" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#E06000"><p>That is broadly correct.  In 2011, the then Department of Finance and An Post signed an agreement covering the cost at a discounted rate of election communications for candidates in the 2011 general election at an agreed discount price.  When the 2016 general election came along, An Post charged a higher price than had been agreed for the 2011 general election but that price had not been agreed with the Department of Finance.  Therefore, I suppose, in fairness, a dispute arose as to what the appropriate level of charge should be.</p></speech>

The view that the Department of Finance at the time took was that there had been no agreement to increase the charge.</p><p>That is where the dispute arose.  As Deputy Dillon knows, general elections take place at short notice.  There was not an agreement in time to allow communications to go ahead.  It was not viewed as feasible to stop the communications, so we had a situation where a service was delivered but there was a dispute about the price.  The amount we paid at that point was based on the 2011 price.</p></speech>

It was agreed to split that, so we paid &euro;367,000 of that.  We made a further contribution to the cost of arbitration, which I think the Deputy is referring to, of &euro;92,000.</p></speech>

That is part of life.  Regarding lessons learned, we now have an agreement in place with An Post that covers until 2026.  The way around this happening again is to have longer term agreements in place so that we are not caught on the hop by an election or such.  I think the agreement lasting until 2026 means that this will not arise.</p></speech>

That is not always possible but, in the main, public bodies would seek to settle these differences outside of a court or legal case framework.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Moloney give an indication of the spending reviews for health?  What findings, conclusions or recommendations have been taken on board with regard to health spending?</p></speech>

Initially, they were mostly done by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  More recently, they have been done in collaboration between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health, or by the Department of Health itself.  Some of the significant issues that were covered and informed policy in the area included work on the nursing homes support scheme, which is called the fair deal scheme.  That has fed into the review of costings for that scheme.  We have negotiated agreements on pharmaceutical pricing.  IGEES did work which the Department greatly informed.  As I said to Deputy Verona Murphy, IGEES has been around for ten years.  The Government Economic Service, GES, in the UK has been around for 50 years.  It is in a phase where collecting data and using those data to inform policy is at its core.  Over time, it will become even more impactful.</p></speech>

This arises in particular when the HSE and the Department of Health are before the committee to discuss their financial accounting systems.  There are concerns about accountability for and traceability of the use of public funds and about the value for money reports.  We are very light about how we assign funds to areas in health where funding is required.  There is frustration at this committee when the HSE and Department of Health come before us.  Have any recommendations been implemented to date in 2022 that Mr. Moloney can share with us with regard to value for money or spending reviews in health?</p></speech>

There are other examples.  We have looked at various aspects of primary care and at care for the elderly.  Much work has been done.  The work by the IGEES economists and policy analysts in Government Departments has brought much greater clarity to what is being spent and what it is spent on, which greatly facilitates value-for-money assessments and how money is allocated within the health service.  As the Deputy knows, there are considerable limitations in the information available about financial management in the HSE.</p></speech>

We are told it could take four or five years before the HSE is able to roll it out.  I know procurement has finished and a contract has been signed to implement the system, but I am sure the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform wants to get this up and running as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It made progress before Covid.  Post Covid, we are told that the current timeline for the project is that 53% of all the HSE's directly-run services will be on the integrated financial management system, IFMS, by the end of 2023.  It will be at 82% by the end of 2024 and 100% by mid-2025.</p></speech>

Will they be put on the system first?  Are the HSE and Department of Health telling the Department which areas they will pick?  Is the Department working with them to address where the scrutiny and traceability need to be focused?</p></speech>

The legacy system is derived from the old health boards.  To a large extent, the programming was dictated by the old legacy systems in the health boards, which were primarily regional.  The prioritisation of the programming was focused on where the greatest weaknesses in the legacy systems were.  The risk assessment fed into the timing and sequencing for the move to the IFMS.</p></speech>

I want to turn to the Department's role in establishing remote policy across the Civil Service.  Remarkable things were done during the Covid pandemic with regard to seeing what was possible to do through remote working.  Thousands of social welfare payments were processed in a manner and from places which we would probably never have sanctioned or predicted.  I think the same work was carried out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  How has the Department taken that learning and applied it to a new policy?  Will Mr. Moloney talk to us about the Department's policy on remote working and how it applies to the broader Civil Service?  How does the Department take account of our climate action targets in that same policy by reducing commuting times and so on?  How do the new provisions for flexible working fit with the Government's policy on work-life balance?</p></speech>

A huge amount was done in the Civil Service, public service and private sector when the pandemic landed in spring 2020.  IT resources were quickly put in place to make remote working practical in a way we never thought it was before.  As we discussed earlier, there are some trade-offs with that.  There was a level of disruption in 2021 with such an unplanned move.</p><p>As we look to the future, however, we have seen there are benefits to remote working.  There are benefits as an employer of choice and there are benefits to the people who work for us and with us.  We have seen that large areas of work can continue uninterrupted and at high quality within a blended working environment.  For the Civil Service as a whole, the Minister has charge of the Civil Service blended working policy framework and we have a blended working policy framework that has been agreed by the Government in terms of general principles.  That has been discussed and supported by the Civil Service Management Board.</p></speech>

There is a sense that because Departments are currently piloting different types of blended working schemes, it is the experience of individual Departments that will matter most.  I suspect the review will take the form of the collection of the experiences of individual Departments, perhaps in the context of the Civil Service Management Board.</p></speech>

There are energy saving initiatives across the civil and public service.  There are guidelines in respect of heating and light within each Department.  We have supported policies to reduce use.

I specifically refer to the value for money process in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, particularly with regard to the value for money sought for the procurement of housing.  Does Mr. Moloney believe that model is sufficiently broad to balance also the spending in the Department of Social Protection, for example, on the procurement of housing through schemes such as the housing assistance payment, HAP?  Sometimes there is too narrow a focus on value for money in the procurement of a particular unit or set of units and account is not taken of the broader value for money in terms of it not having to be spent by another Department.</p></speech>

That view across Government is something we need to strengthen in terms of our value for money approach.  In terms of housing, we take into account the money spent by the Department of Social Protection as well as the money spent by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage when we consider those issues.  In recent years we have moved a lot of the spending that was formerly in the social protection Vote into the housing Vote so that there is greater consistency of approach.  We are conscious of that and we are aware how important it is to take it into account to the full.  In any value for money assessment or business case, the full costs to the Exchequer should be taken into account and, indeed, the full benefits in terms of the access to services should be as well.</p></speech>

That holistic approach to housing is important.  In particular as we now start to look at procurement, there is going to come a point when viability is a major issue for housing, even social housing.  Last week, Dublin City Council had tenders with which it cannot proceed because the costs for social housing are deemed to be too high, yet we know the cost of not doing it is far greater.  That broader aspect of how we apply value for money in housing is key.</p> <p>  I refer to the delay to the process that often results from value for money auditing.  Local authorities would say they are almost constantly, at each stage, coming back with value for money reports, and that is adding to the overall delay in the provision of housing.  Has the Department examined that issue?</p></speech>

There are two points we would make in that regard.  One is that the development of business cases and value for money justifications at an early stage in a project are a key signifier of the success of that project.  Where that basic work is not done at the start, the project has a much higher chance of going over budget and over time.  We do not see it as a delay.  There are challenges in different State agencies in the context of remembering and taking it into account in their planning.  Nobody goes out to buy a suite of houses next week.  These things are all planned well in advance, and the value for money aspects need to be built into the planning by purchasing authorities.</p></speech>

The value for money is evident regardless of what the house costs.  I am not saying we should pay any amount, but the cost of it is dwarfed by comparison with the cost the State is incurring in the context of emergency provision of accommodation.</p></speech>

An issue that has come up many times at the committee is that the people who are procuring one of the largest amounts of spending, namely, HAP, are some of the most vulnerable people in Ireland.  They are the procurement manager for their own rents, yet the State is spending millions in the private rental market with a resultant disproportionate impact.  Has the Department examined the impact of HAP and the idea of who is procuring the service?  In my experience, it is often the most vulnerable people - those who need housing - who are negotiating on behalf of the State, to put it that way.</p></speech>

It was very useful for internal audit, for example.  Tusla, for example, expressed an interest in its continuation for precisely that reason, the internal audit process.  Was anything done to assess the impact of the loss of Benefacts on Tusla and how that might manifest?  Funders such as the Department of Health, the HSE, the Department of Social Protection and a couple of local authorities contributed to the pilot project that was Benefacts and its information was comprehensive.  There can be no accountability without transparency, and here was a very transparent database that was open source.  It was very usable for internal audit purposes and Tusla expressed an interest in its continuation.

We canvassed quite widely.  It was a pilot, or pathfinder, project and it was clear from the start it was not part of our core mandate.  Part of our approach in reform issues is often to start with a pilot project and then to find a home for it.  Among the most likely State agencies - Tusla was certainly one and the CSO was another - we asked whether they wanted to take over Benefacts and they did not.  It did not align with their data needs.</p></speech>

We have this supposedly open Government approach but I do not see how that can manifest without tools such as this one, which was working, usable and being used and which had potential other uses.  When it comes to value for money, starting a project, getting it to that point and then ceasing it seems to be the opposite of that.</p> <p>  Did the Comptroller and Auditor General's office have any reason to use Benefacts?

I am sure taxpayers, along with ourselves on the committee, and the Department would be eager to ensure value for money when it comes to the scheme.  The national development plan had allocated &euro;202 million for 2022, but as of August of this year no deep retrofits had been completed.  Has the Department raised concerns with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications about the scheme?  Some &euro;40 million, or almost 20% of the total fund, was reallocated from the scheme to other purposes this year.  Would Mr. Moloney consider it a red flag that the scheme is not working or is not being implemented as expected?</p></speech>

She obviously knows that the retrofitting scheme is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in the first instance, but of course, we do take an interest.  It is a large amount of money, and it is a big part of the NDP and a significant commitment within it.  The challenge in the context we discussed earlier in terms of the broad capital programme, post-Covid supply chain disruption and all the rest of it is probably amplified in the case of retrofit because the ambition in the national development plan is to create a whole new retrofit industry.  My understanding is that Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications is optimistic that progress is being made in that regard, and that the underspend we see in retrofitting will be addressed over time.  Many people are now going into the industry and there is a lot more interest, in particular with the price of energy going the way it is.  The Minister anticipates a greater interest in the scheme.  We do look at it.  Internationally, the big problem with deep retrofit is that it is costly and disruptive, so there is a good deal of inertia.</p></speech>

It is concerning that as of August of this year there were no deep retrofits completed.  When the Department was doing the budget for 2022, did the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications say it would be able to spend that money?</p></speech>

Every year a certain amount of funding is allocated, and it is never spent because the Department does not recruit sufficient staff.  At what stage does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform ever take the Department to task over that, or is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform happy to take whatever is said and to allocate the funding?  My concern is that it is going to be the same for this scheme.  Where is the oversight and the assurance that it has provided value for money, and that the moneys allocated will be spent?</p></speech>

From our point of view, in terms of value for money, it is fairly well established that retrofitting does provide value for money in the long term, given our climate targets in particular.  That is well established.  Deputy Munster made a good point about whether income levels then start to determine how much of that a person can do.  That is one of the reasons the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has a number of different schemes that operate at different levels.</p></speech>

We accept that it is a lot of money.  The demands of Covid-19 and the need to provide for Covid added more than &euro;5 billion to public expenditure in 2021.  Our concern was that we would not add &euro;6 billion when we did not need to and that if there were savings on budget line, those savings would be used in the first instance to fund the temporary Covid measures.

My apologies for arriving late but I had other meetings to attend.  On the overall expenditure by the Government, part of that expenditure is funding that is provided by the relevant Departments to local authorities.  Does the Department believe there is enough scrutiny of how local authorities use that money?  I know they are accountable to the councillors but there is not the same level of scrutiny.  For instance, we cannot invite a local authority before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Do the witnesses believe we now need to change the legislation to deal with that issue?  It is a substantial budget, between all the local authorities.  Is it time to look at that whole issue of how we can get better value for money?  We have talked about that.  Does the Department feel we can do a lot more in scrutinising that whole area?</p></speech>

Earlier, we promised to provide a note on that to Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  The Deputy is quite right that we are constrained, in that the accountability for local government funds is dealt with separately.  The legislation and legal provisions dealing with it are separate.  Instead of having a role for the Comptroller and Auditor General, there is a role for a local government auditor.  I suppose I am precluded from commenting on that, as it is the policy position, but we have agreed to furnish the committee with a note on the issues and what flows from them.</p></speech>

I know there is a local government auditor but have concerns been raised with the Department in relation to this issue?</p></speech>

One of the problems that is arising now is the timeframe from the time a project is started to the time it finally gets approval.  For instance, the documentation on the new elective hospital for Cork was submitted by the South/Southwest Hospital Group in January, and we still do not have a decision from the Department because it has to go through the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The figures given in January are in real terms a kind of estimate of what they would be now.  It is not necessarily saying that it was an inaccurate estimate.  The figures are now completely irrelevant because the whole issue of costs has changed substantially.  Does the Secretary General not think that it is time now for all Departments to look at the way we assess projects and the timeframe it is taking to do so?  I will give the Secretary General one example.  I know of a project in my own constituency which started off as planning for a school.  A Government agency objected to the planning and took it all of the way to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Its argument was that the local sewage treatment facility did not have capacity, even though it was an existing school which was already connected into that system.  The people gave an undertaking that the school would not increase its numbers but the appeal still went all the way to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p> Does the Secretary General not think that we need to look at this whole issue of the delaying of projects and how we can deliver them more quickly, especially where the decision-making process needs to be looked at?</p></speech>

There is a concern about the length of time projects are taking to get to implementation stage and that is being addressed in a number of different ways.  A review of planning legislation is at an advanced stage and is being undertaken in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.</p> <p>  I currently chair a group which is looking at the public spending code to consider how much of that can be foreshortened, where appropriate.  We are aware and conscious of the need to minimise any delays caused by regulatory decision-making.  </p> <p>  I made a point earlier is that all of these projects take a long time;from having the idea, to getting the planning permission, to finding the funding.  On the value-for-money pieces of that, those pieces can generally be done alongside the planning for the project and perhaps the thing that needs to be done most is that alongside the planning for a project, the value-for-money pieces and the business cases need to be factored in and done alongside it.  They do not need to be a surprise or a delay at a particular given point.</p></speech>

We are now talking about a completely different budget to what we were talking about ten months ago, and we still do not get an explanation as to why it is taking so long.  Some clarification needs to be given as to why projects are taking so long.</p> <p>  I am aware of another project, which is about ophthalmology care, where the building has been sitting idle for the past six months but adequate funding to fully equip and staff the facility has not yet been provided.  Why does all of this happen?  We have made a decision that we need to improve a service but when we take that decision towards its implementation stage, it is just not happening fast enough.  How does the Secretary General believe we can change that?</p></speech>

We are looking at planning permission and at our own processes.  It would be appropriate for all State agencies to look at their own processes.  We discussed the underspending of capital earlier on also, so at this stage, with a greatly expanded capital programme, it is very important that all public sector agencies look at their procedures.</p> <p>  On the other hand, I have to go back to the reasons we have many of these procedures, which are twofold.  First, we have had problems in the past, in particular with major projects.  Second, all of the evidence shows that planning around detailed specification and proper business cases at the start makes it a quicker process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#M00500"><p>I fully understand that but the problem I have is that on this elective hospital issue, it has taken ten months.  The decision had been made that we need it but the two Departments have not signed off on it.  We have not even gone to planning stage or started that process.  Why does it take ten months to come to a decision where everyone already accepts that we need to build this hospital and in the meantime, a huge cost has been added on to it.  It is likewise with school and housing projects.  It is about the time from when the local authorities make a submission to the Department to getting the response back from the Department.</p> <p>  If one takes the Glashaboy flood relief scheme in my own constituency, the tender was submitted but in the time the Department took to accept the tender, the price had gone through the roof because there was too much of a delay in accepting the tender that had been submitted.  In planning permission, a decision has to be given within a certain number of weeks.  We do not seem to have the same timeframe in respect of tenders.  When a tender comes in, is there a timeframe within a Department at the moment by which a decision must be made as regards who is awarded the project?</p></speech>

The Secretary General of the Department of Health appeared before this committee and I was advised that the decision on the elective hospital in Cork would be made in mid-October and this is on the public record.  The Secretary General is now telling me that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform did not receive the documentation from the Department of Health until 27 September.  In fact, I was misled and I had been advised earlier that the decision would be made at the end of July.</p></speech>

Clearly, on the consideration that has to be done for any of these projects, the engagement with external experts, and so on and so forth, timescales do change, but the information I have is that we received this documentation on 27 September and we expect the MPAG to complete its review in mid-November.</p></speech>

There are timeframes within which local authorities have to comply in respect of planning.  From the time tenders are accepted and are actually submitted, and where, for instance, there is a deadline set for 1 October for all the tenders to be submitted, what is the deadline within Departments for a Department to come to a decision in respect of to whom the contract will be awarded?  Do we have deadlines within Departments because I have seen delays of five months to six months in Departments in respect of deciding what tender the Department is accepting.  Is it not now time that we would set down for every Department a timeframe, from the time a tender is to be submitted to a Department and within which a decision has then to be made?  That can be four weeks, six weeks or eight weeks but at least to have a timeframe.</p></speech>

There have been some substantial infrastructural upgrades done over the past number of decades.</p><p>In that context, I wish to ask about cases where there may be a level of collusion between companies that are tendering.  In July, six Spanish construction firms were fined &euro;200 million by the Spanish regulator for colluding on bids for public-private contracts, or public private partnerships, PPPs, as we know them.  The regulator found that their behaviour resulted in fewer and lower quality bids being received.  The Spanish state has moved to ban these companies from winning public contracts for the foreseeable future.  Five of those Spanish companies have won contracts for PPPs in this State.  Was Mr. Moloney aware of the situation that arose in Spain and the decision of the regulator there?</p></speech>

Dragados, which is a part of the ACS Group, was fined &euro;57.1 million, FCC Construccion was fined &euro;40.4 million, Ferrovial Construccion was fined &euro;38.5 million, Acciona Construccion was fined &euro;29.4 million and Obrasco Huarte Lain was fined &euro;21.5 million.  The sixth company, Sacyr Construccion, was fined &euro;16.7 million.  This story was reported by Reuters on 7 July.  The Spanish regulator found that, between 1992 and 2017, the companies had met weekly to analyse which public projects they were planning to bid for, plan a common strategy and share technical documents between them.  The regulator found that this had affected many construction bids, leading to fewer and lower quality bids.  The regulator viewed this as a serious infringement of Spanish and European competition law.  We are under the umbrella of the latter, as Mr. Moloney is well aware.  The Department is not aware of this situation or has not been alerted to it.</p></speech>

She has sought a more sophisticated data system - I will come to the Department's role in a moment - to monitor for potential abuses.  I understand that the CCPC is currently examining the waste and motor sectors.  She outlined that the CCPC was relying on whistleblowers to detect wrongdoing.  It has been estimated that wrongdoing may be adding 20% to 30% to the cost of contracts.  On 14 August, she was reported as saying:</p> <blockquote> 	We've had various complaints over the years, and we've done various investigations, but we haven't had a successful prosecution.  We need to improve the data, the evidence base for what we're looking at. </blockquote> <p>She added: &quot;International experience would tell you that [public procurement] is something that tends to be very prone to cartel activity, and particularly to bid-rigging&quot;.  I understand that she and her office have written to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to make the case for a data analytics-based system, which would make it easier to track activity.  In this regard, she has stated:</p> <blockquote> 	At the moment in order to detect bid-rigging we'd be reliant on a whistleblower ... But we also know that the Irish State could use software a lot more cleverly than we do at the moment to kind of detect patterns like that ... [and] to look at the historical pattern&quot; </blockquote> <p>I am not alleging wrongdoing, but the Department needs to be alert to this.  When I became aware of the Spanish case, it alerted me to the situation.</p><p>Dragados, which Reuters reported was fined &euro;57.1 million by the Spanish regulator, was awarded the New Ross N25 bypass contract, which was worth &euro;230 million.  It was also awarded the Gorey M11 contract, which was worth &euro;350 million.  From the Department's point of view, have issues arisen with any of these contracts?</p></speech>

One of the bidders was BAM, Dragados was another and FCC Construccion was a third.  It was reported in July that the latter two had been caught colluding in Spain.  I am not alleging that there has been collusion in Ireland, but there are substantial opportunities for companies internationally.  What I am saying to Mr. Moloney, as the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is that we are signing multimillion euro public contracts - in some cases, they are worth billions of euro - when there are issues arising internationally to which the State, the Department and our committee need to be alert.  Has Mr. Moloney any concern that there has been price rigging on public contracts?  I do not mean the contracts I mentioned, but public contracts in general.

What happened as a consequence of that?  Have any measures been put in place to assist in that regard?  The CCPC raised the matter again this year.  My concern is that these two things happened within a month of each other.  The chair raised the issue of the inability of the CCPC to examine these matters because of the absence of a sophisticated database and the technological means to look back and monitor.  Has the Department engaged with the CCPC on that so far?  Can any of the officials indicate whether there has been any level of engagement?</p></speech>

Is Mr. Moloney concerned about the potential in this area and the need to be extra careful where big contracts are being awarded?  The Spanish case worked its way through to a conclusion and some damning findings on those five companies are being reported.  This shows the potential.  We all wonder about that, maybe in relation to smaller contracts at a more local level.  Issues arise sometimes and allegations are made, many of which are wrong.  False allegations are sometimes made by people who have a gripe or for some other reason.  Perhaps they lost out in a bidding process.  Is Mr. Moloney concerned about this and does he feel we need to keep a good eye on it?</p></speech>

Mr. Moloney is the accountable person and someone in his position in the public sector or in a public sector body has an ongoing obligation to demonstrate to this committee in particular that what is happening with Government and public spending is good value for money.  I have not heard anything today that demonstrates how he does that or what his benchmark is.  I understand the line of questioning from Deputy Carroll MacNeill when she asked about expertise.  What does Mr. Moloney benchmark value for money against in the housing sector?</p></speech>

Gathering the data showing the outputs is a very important element of that but, fundamentally, the Accounting Officer for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is responsible for value for money for housing.

I know it is the system we have and without extra supply, we are not going to overcome it.  Would Mr. Moloney believe that several people have contacted me pointing out that the housing assistance department in Limerick has been writing to them on a monthly basis - for years in some cases - to tell them their tenants have not paid their portion of the rent.  The landlord wrote to HAP to say their tenant has continually paid their rent.  The letter comes monthly to say the department is stopping the HAP payment.  It is a monthly letter and no matter what form of communication the landlord uses to say the department is incorrect, that letter still arrives.  It still comes on a monthly basis and the tenant has missed no payment.  First, the letter says it is stopping the HAP payment, which it never does, and, second, it comes monthly, which obviously means there is a postage cost.  Was Mr. Moloney aware of that?</p></speech>

How would the Department identify that?  I do not know how many cases of this there are.  It is clearly a huge waste of money on postage.

I have read a huge amount in preparation for this committee meeting and many of my colleagues and I are of the opinion it is time to reintegrate the two Departments.

Mr. Moloney previously mentioned that the equivalent body in the UK has been in existence for 50 years.</p><p>Unless Mr. Moloney has proof that the Department has saved in excess of &euro;50 million in reforms, it is not really worth our while.  It is a waste of money.  We are paying two grade 1 Secretaries General.  I do not see the level of expertise there.  Can Mr. Moloney tell me categorically, for the benefit of the committee and the people who pay their taxes into the Exchequer, that his Department is value for money?  I am not talking about him personally.  Is the Department worth those 650 people and taking up this committee's time?  Has it generated savings in excess of &euro;50 million in the years since it was established?  It it ten years now?</p></speech>

This is an issue I have raised with Graham Doyle, the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  At the moment, we are in a housing crisis.  I am approaching this in a constructive way.  I am not making a criticism but it is one of the issues that I fail to understand.  We have to mass-produce houses, particularly social housing.  I am not talking about low quality housing but good quality affordable housing and cost-rental housing.  The State has, thank God, at last moved to doing that but personally I would like to see it on a larger scale.</p> <p>  As I recall, around 2002 local authorities were instructed that all local authority housing be architecturally designed.  Up to then it was done in-house.  Nice, good and practical local authority houses were built that were very easy to maintain.  I will not go into it because I have said all this before.  Looking at examples of houses built before that period and ones built after, the ones built after are totally impractical and awful looking.  They are not all awful looking but some of them are terrible.  I am not sure what the move to architecturally designed houses did.  I could rattle off some bad examples of where there were maintenance problems afterwards but that is for another day.</p> <p>  A couple of years after that I was chair of a housing strategic policy committee, SPC, and the cost of architecturally designing was 7% or 8%.  One senior local authority figure told me recently that it is now up to 10%.  I mentioned the 7% figure and they said it was closer to 10% now.  We built a lot of houses in the 1930s.  I am not arguing for them.  I pass them coming in here in the morning.  They are okay.  They are fine.  I lived in a house like that for a good few years, no problem.  I am not arguing that we should go back to those two-up, two-down houses.  What I am saying is that one of the reasons we were able to build those is that we did not mess around by starting with a blank canvas for every site.  We started with a drawing from the local authority.  The houses I pass are in Sligo, Portlaoise, Donegal and Waterford.  I have seen them all over the country.  If we want to build houses on that scale, that is what we have to do.</p> <p>  I am raising this in the context of the pounds, shillings and pence of it.  It is taking up 5% or 10% of the cost, which is outrageous.  Graham Doyle would say to the committee, and I accept this, that there is now a standardised framework within the Department but that is not the same thing.  That is not what I am talking about.  What I am talking about is a standard design.  In other words, the only blank canvas should be the actual site.  Obviously there is a need for different types of housing.  There is a need for single-storey housing for elderly people and people with disabilities.  There is a need for apartments, and houses with one, two, three or four bedrooms.  There is a need for rural housing, semi-detached houses, terraced houses and so on.  I get all of that.  There is only way we can do that.  I will give this example.  There have been situations where decisions about the hood over the front door or the type of windowsill have gone back and forth between the local authorities and the Custom House.  This has been going on over the last number of years.  The people in the Custom House have a job to do but that is not their job.  They could give the money to the local authorities but the local authorities are strangled trying to deal with this.  They did not have the staff, although there have been some improvements there and I welcome that.  The Government has moved on that but the Department needs to move further on it.</p> <p>  One thing holding up all of this and costing more money is this ludicrous situation where we have different designs for every development.  We have good examples of good houses built in the last two or three years.  In the case of social housing, we should use those examples and just build the bloody things.  It is the same for affordable housing.  People in Laois or Cork are not worried that there is someone in Donegal living in the same type of house as them.  This includes people who want to buy an affordable house.  Most people are priced out of what is called the market and we need to get people into a position where they can buy an affordable house.  It is a good scheme but we need to accelerate it.  It is not even in first gear yet.  That is the problem.  I am asking Mr. Moloney, as Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to take this up with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I have raised this with previous housing Ministers.  I have raised it with Secretaries General.  Graham Doyle said he would talk about this again.  Maybe there is an openness there now to do it.  Can Mr. Moloney raise this now with the Minister?  It is not a policy issue; it is procedural issue.  Shuffling papers back and forward from local authorities to the Custom House and adding up to 10% extra onto the cost is absolutely bananas in the middle of a housing crisis.  I ask Mr. Moloney to give me a view on that.  What can be done about it?</p></speech>

It is certainly an issue I can speak to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage about.  We are involved in a number of working groups under Housing for All, which seeks to simplify the processes around the approval and delivery of housing, and social housing in particular.  It is made more complicated by the preference for mixed-tenure developments, which would not have been there in some of the instances the Chairman has described.  There could be scope for making further progress on that matter.  I am happy to take that forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#P02000"><p>It could be done in mixed-tenure developments.  The estate I live in is private but there is local authority housing in it.  People driving in cannot see the difference.  There is no difference.  Nobody even knows who is living the local authority housing, although I would know as a former councillor.  There is no need for this duplication and this rigmarole, and the extra cost.  I am saying this to Mr. Moloney as the head of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and a senior official.  He is the Accounting Officer of the Department.  Someone somewhere needs to take action on this.  I am saying this out of frustration.  It annoys me to think that any money is being wasted on architecture.  That is nothing against the architectural profession.  If we need to perfect some of those two-up, two-down houses, three bedroom semis, or one or two bedroom bungalows for people who have disabilities or pensioners, that is fine.  Let us do that.  The only blank canvas there should be is the actual site layout with the infrastructure in place.  We cannot have a blank canvas for each individual house.  It is absolute madness.  The Department talks about this framework it has of a certain size for rooms, the energy requirements and all of that.  That is all fine.  That is not the issue.  It has to go a step further by using the same house.  I would not see any problem with it.  If Mr. Moloney was on the housing waiting list, trying to buy an affordable house or get a home, would he have an objection to living in the same type of house that I was living in?  Going back maybe 30 years to when he would have been trying to get going with a house, would that have bothered him?  I do not think it would bother anyone.  It would be irrelevant.  If people out there on the market want to buy something that looks a certain way or they like the look of a house, that is fine.  This would not stop any of that.  That happens and that is legitimate.</p><p>If the State, as the player, is trying to get housing moving, it cannot be done with one foot on the accelerator and one foot on the brake.  That is the point I am making.  Will the Department come back to the committee with a note on this, if it can be addressed directly with the head of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage?</p></speech>

It is not the intention to stop a project.  The intention is to be very clear about the specification and as clear as possible about the costs from the outset.  We are very much informed by a lot of the work the committee has done on particular projects in terms of what can go wrong.  We are also very informed by international experience, which suggests, as I said before, that the better planned and specified a project is from the start, the better hope we have of delivering that project on time and on budget.  The public spending code has that emphasis.</p></speech>

As I have said this morning, capital projects, particularly major capital projects, take a long time to plan and execute.  There is no reason the timeline for their planning and execution could not run alongside the timeline for ensuring value for money.

Investors from abroad look at Ireland at the moment and they express concern about the pace at which we can develop our infrastructure.  The NDP is under the auspices of the Department.  I cannot see how those projects are going to be developed within a respectable timeframe, as has been demonstrated with projects such as metro north and past projects that have either been shelved or cancelled as a consequence of bureaucracy and red tape.  I want to get an insight into how the Department intends to get those projects done, particularly given what happened with the Galway ring road, where, effectively, an independent State agency, electable by or accountable to pretty much no one, which has been proven to be the case, is able to go in and strip Government-backed decisions that have been made to build road infrastructure.</p></speech>

Obviously, the planning issue is subject to national and European law.  We would hope that, as we look at all of our approvals processes, that we constantly look at them with a view to foreshortening them and making them more efficient and more effective.  We are concerned about delivery.  We have very ambitious delivery targets within the NDP.  As we discussed earlier, we are behind profile in capital spending at the moment, although we are ahead year on year.  That is a concern for us.  At every stage, we are trying to look at our decisions and approvals process with a view to speeding that up and making it better.</p> <p>  We would have to say that we do not accept that the application of value for money rules and the public spending code is, of necessity, a delay in that regard.  It does not have to be.  It just needs to be incorporated into the planning at an early stage.  We believe it can assist in the delivery of projects.</p></speech>

With regard to the funding envelope for the NDP as described, I want Mr. Moloney to bring that away and to look at the State agencies.  There is An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the relevant Department, the local authority and now, to add insult to injury, the Office of the Planning Regulator seems to be increasing its interventions, for example, in county development plans.  All of these are essential, along with Cabinet approval and, therefore, there are six major steps when it comes to getting a capital project effectively on the road.  Does Mr. Moloney think that process could be streamlined to potentially save the taxpayer billions of euro?  I will give one example.  If we were to implement a strategic policy unit within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the delivery of capital projects, with a representative from the relevant Department in each area, for example, the Department of Transport, and people from the local authority in the relevant area where the project is happening, does Mr. Moloney think that would be appropriate or could be done from a statutory point of view?</p></speech>

To be fair, I am not trying to be smart with Mr. Moloney.  I am just trying to figure out how we can deal with the issues we have in this country, where we seem to be tying ourselves up in knots when it comes to delivering capital projects.  I am even hearing some reports from Irish Rail that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is delaying some of the projects it has ongoing, and it is waiting for months to do what should realistically take weeks when it comes to the delivery of new infrastructure.</p><p>I wish to make the following point to the Secretary General of the Department that provides the entire funding needed for these projects.  It is outrageously slow to develop a capital project in this country and I want to develop an understanding of how we can improve upon that.  Has he any suggestions?  </p></speech>

It cost that much for plans and for everybody to have their say but we have nothing except that a defunct organisation called An Bord Plean&aacute;la overturned the decision.</p> <p>  Last week, I made a speech in the D&aacute;il about regulation and regulation has been mentioned here today.  To my mind, regulators in this country are appointment by the Government in order that the Government and the politicians in government are once removed from having to be accountable.  They instead put in a regulator.  Consequently, we have an energy regulator that could not foresee the energy crisis.  We have an aviation regulator that could not foresee the crisis at Dublin Airport.  I am well known for commenting on how the Office of the Planning Regulator does its business.  We have a planning regulator who clearly could not identify the difficulties in An Bord Plean&aacute;la until they were published by an online magazine or another media outlet.  In terms of value for money, how much will all these defunct regulators cost the State?  In the case of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I assume that at some point we are going to have huge legal fees on top of the ones that we already have incurred, which are upwards of &euro;20 million for the failed strategic housing development, SHD, process.</p> <p>  I struggle to identify what the &euro;50 million spent on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does, so please explain.  Perhaps &euro;500 million has been saved but we have spent it already with defunct regulatory organisations.  Has the Secretary General any act or part to play in advising the Government to get rid of or stop appointing lame ducks?</p></speech>

Obviously regulators are set up under legislation and the legislation on which they are established is passed by the Oireachtas.  That legislation often reflects EU legislation.  We have a part in resourcing those regulators.  There clearly are concerns about some regulators.  Those concerns need to be address and will be addressed.</p></speech>

Did the Department learn anything from the banking fiasco and regulator?  Has the Department anything to say after all of these instances?  It is like the Department is arriving breathless to the scene of the accident when everything has occurred and nobody foresaw what was happening, even though we have all of these regulators.

Last weekend, I heard that a private nursing home gets &euro;950 per week per bed, whereas a public nursing home just a little further down the road cost &euro;1,900 per bed per week.  The problem at the moment is that private nursing homes are closing and 16 have closed since January.  I understand that one Department has something like &euro;47 million or &euro;49 million available to the private nursing home system to assist them but the homes do not know when that money will be made available, even though the funding is in the budget.  The whole issue about public expenditure is to make sure that where someone provides a service, because that person is unable to get adequate funding then that service is no longer available and the service comes back then under the control of the State or the State must step in.  Why would a Department delay a process that really needs to be sorted very fast in order to prevent the closure of essential services?  This aspect does not just relate to nursing homes but can apply to other areas as well where, due to delays in Departments in dealing with an issue, there are huge consequences, which is exactly what has happened in this case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.470" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#R02600"><p>It would be very undesirable if delays in Departments caused the closing down of essential services.  By and large, the fair deal scheme works very well.  The scheme is administered on behalf of the Department of Health.  There are differences between private and public within the scheme.  Some of those differences relate to the complexity and composition of care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.471" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#R02700"><p>That is not correct.  For example, if a private nursing home decides to take in someone today and the health of that person deteriorates over the next three or four years, then the standard of care provided and time required to provide that care will increase but the home does not get any increase in the payments to it in three or four years' time, whereas it is a different scenario in a public nursing home.  I do not accept that there is a difference although there is some difference in certain cases.</p><p>However, we have a scenario where 16 private nursing homes have closed because they could no longer provide the service with the funding they were getting.  We also have a situation where a Department has &euro;49 million in funds which is designated for private nursing homes and the private nursing homes have not been told how that is going to be administered and when, all while they are under pressure.  It should be remembered that a private nursing home has a good deal of expenditure that a public nursing home does not have, for instance public liability insurance, whereas all the public nursing homes are covered by the HSE insurance.  Private nursing homes have commercial rates which must be paid to local authorities.  The average 50-bed private nursing home is paying out on average &euro;120,000 per annum between those two items.  There is funding available in the Department but the Department is not saying how it is going to deal with the private nursing homes.</p></speech>

The responsibility for looking after the people who are now in private nursing homes will then come back to the HSE and the public nursing homes, which may not have capacity.  We also have the other problem.  For example, I spoke to a person yesterday whose family member has been in a hospital bed for nine months because they cannot get a care facility to take on the person who needs a certain level of care but does not need hospital care.  There is a huge cost.  The average cost in a hospital is &euro;8,000 per bed per week.  We are talking about nine months of that and the problem is still not resolved.  The question is about timing and about getting funding out to where people are prepared to provide the care.</p></speech>

Where that is not operating, that is a considerable concern.  We can follow up on the specific question with the Department of Health.</p></speech>

I regret to tell the Secretary General that I am very worried by the presentation and the answering of my questions earlier, and Deputy Murphy built upon it.  Mr. Moloney needs to appreciate that, from our point of view, the public has no confidence in our State's ability to deliver on capital infrastructure.  I cannot blame the public for that.  If we look at all the major public transport infrastructure projects in the country that have been proposed, shelved and cancelled and all the issues that have arisen with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the planning system itself, there are so many problems.  It is hard to know where to start.  Above all else, it is hurting the economy.  The Department has had, between 2015 and 2017, a review of more than &euro;40 billion in expenditure and more than 80 spending review papers.  In regard to the questions I asked today, while Mr. Moloney answered them, I regret to say he did so very poorly when it came to those efficiencies.  I am particularly interested in capital infrastructure which, outside of the Department of Health, is one of the biggest users of the capital in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it is where we can make efficiencies.  Will Mr. Moloney take another opportunity to tell the Committee of Public Accounts how we are going to deal with the extraordinary mess our country has when it comes to building basic infrastructure such as roads and rail?  Will he give us any further outline of what is underway and what is being proposed rather than giving us sentiments that something needs to be done about it?</p></speech>

The spending review papers predominantly relate to current expenditure, so they are probably not as relevant to the national development plan, NDP.  Within capital expenditure, we have the public spending code which requires business cases to be created in regard to particular capital projects.  That is important.  We have seen from international evidence that setting out planning correctly and specifying and costing a project at an early stage is a very positive indicator of delivering that project on budget and on time.  We know that is very challenging in regard to bespoke or megaprojects.  It is less challenging in regard to more standardised projects.  We are very conscious of that.</p> <p>  In regard to the issues raised by the Deputy on planning, I accept that planning is an issue that needs to be constantly reviewed and overseen.  I have pointed out that there is a major project on planning currently being undertaken by the-----</p></speech>

There was a focus on four areas.  We received a minute from the Minister in reply to those recommendations, as would be normal, on 7 October.  We normally get a response saying "Yes" or "No", it can be done, will be done or why it cannot be done.  In this case, however, we did not get any answer in regard to two of the issues, nor did the Department give a commitment to provide any further responses.  That minute would have been signed off by the Minister who was presumably advised by Mr. Moloney.  I noted that in regard to recommendation 2, which was about the corporate governance division of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media and which recommended that it should continue to monitor RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s response to the findings of the Eversheds report, which related to the classification of employees at RT&Eacute;, and report to the committee on its views of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s responses to the findings of that review, the Department did not accept or reject the committee&rsquo;s recommendations, nor did it discuss providing the recommended report to the committee.  As I understand it, in my time as a Member, that is without precedent.  Is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform satisfied with that response to recommendation 2 in that report?</p> <p>  Recommendations 6 and 7 called on the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media to provide a report to the committee on the means of generating extra income for the Exchequer in regard to broadcasting and exploring measures for RT&Eacute; to reduce its dependence on Exchequer funding.</p><p>The Department did not accept or reject our recommendations nor did it discuss providing the recommended report to the committee.  Is this an attempt to brush off the Committee of Public Accounts?  This is what it looks like to me.  What accountability do Departments and public bodies have to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the implementation of committee recommendations and responses to them?</p><p> What is the view of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the responses provided in the minute of the Minister given that none of the recommendations have been accepted or rejected and no explanation has been given?  This in the context of circular 01/2011, Revised Instructions for Preparing Material for Inclusion in Minutes of the Minister for Finance on Reports of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Mr. Moloney signed off on this as the assistant secretary at the time.  I am speaking about a response to the committee.  When the committee does a report and makes recommendations, we do not want to waste our time.  These are important issues.  We expect that at least note is taken of the recommendations.  If they cannot be implemented, we want clear explanations as to why.  If they are being implemented, that is good news and we want to hear about it.  It is not acceptable that such a response as we have received would come back.</p><p> Circular 01/2011, which Mr. Moloney signed off, states the committee may consider minutes in public session and if it is not satisfied with the responses to the recommendations it may pursue the matter further with the Minister for Finance.  The circular also states the committee may seek to debate the matter in the D&aacute;il.  There should be a response to every recommendation stating whether it is accepted or not and why.  The circular was signed off by Mr. Moloney.  Appendix 1 states every recommendation should have a response stating whether or not it is accepted and the reasons.  This has not been done.  As Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, what is Mr. Moloney's view on this?  The committee is basically being told that its report and recommendations are irrelevant.  They are being neither accepted nor rejected.  There is no engagement or explanation.  What is the opinion of Mr. Moloney on all of this?</p></speech>

This is not to mention the licence fee that it collects.  It has responded to us.  Mr. Moloney has a role as Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  His Department has accountability to ensure these issues are dealt with.  The Department with responsibility for media has clearly decided, for whatever reason, that it does not have to give us any meaningful response on this.  It has not said "Yes" or "No" to the recommendations.  We made recommendations in good faith after giving these matters serious examination.  The Department has basically brushed us off.  The committee will consider this later.  At this point I do not want to speak for the committee, and committee members have their own views on it.  What I am saying is that we will not let go of this.  This is not acceptable.  As Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, I will not tolerate it.  I want Mr. Moloney to take this up with the Department.  I want him to examine the matter.  I want him to come back with his response to it.  I, and I am sure other members, will revert to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to inform it of this.  Does Mr. Moloney want to make a comment on this?</p></speech>

We can follow up on this issue in whatever way the committee wishes.  Perhaps the issue has not been fully set out in the replies.  It is unusual not to accept or reject a recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is usual to accept such recommendations.  I believe the reason for how the reply is phrased is how various Acts are being interpreted.  We can come back to the committee with more detail on this.</p></speech>

I do not expect it to micromanage RT&Eacute; but it cannot have a hands-off approach when significant amounts of taxpayers' money are being administrated.  I am alerting Mr. Moloney to this.  I would appreciate if he came back to us on it and followed up on it.</p> <p>  That concludes our business for today.  I thank the witnesses for joining us, the departmental staff for the work they did in preparing for today's meeting, and the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for attending the meeting.

This is with regard to the Eversheds Sutherland report on RT&Eacute;.  There is of gun to the head of the staff for this Friday.  Pension entitlements, maternity leave and all the other issues have not been fully worked out.  We should contact the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as a matter of urgency to say this is not fair.

For the Deputy's information, I raised the issue of the RT&Eacute; report and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications in her absence this morning with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The proposal is that we notify the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications that the committee has done work on this and we are concerned about the fact that workers have to make a decision by Friday and want more time.</p></speech>

It received a qualified audit opinion.  As a health body, the accounts give a true and fair view except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements of staff only as they become payable.  That is a standard issue I have pointed out in relation to many health bodies.</p> <p>  No. 2 is the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority. This is a new body and this is the first period of account.  It covers the period from 1 February to 31 December 2021.  This is an 11-month account.  That received a clear audit opinion.  No. 3 is the Arts Council for 2021.  It was a clear audit opinion.  No. 4 is the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund.  That received a clear audit opinion.  No. 5 is the Environmental Protection Agency for 2021.  That received a clear audit opinion.</p></speech>

The Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority is a new body and the State relies heavily on approved housing bodies, AHBs, to carry out functions that might be more correctly performed by the State.  As AHBs are not full State bodies, we should bring in the regulatory authority to work through that and how it will operate, including what the layout of its assets is.  Substantial public funds go into AHBs, and I am very supportive of them, but it would be remiss of us not to keep a very close eye on that area and the regulatory body.  I propose that this be added to the work programme in some form?</p></speech>

The AHBs are now major players in the provision of housing and their regulator is important.  Is Can we agree, therefore, to note this under the financial statements?  Agreed.  As usual, this will be published as part of the committee's minutes on the web page.</p><p>I propose to move on to correspondence.  As previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee meetings and published on the committee&rsquo;s web page.</p><p>The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-up to committee meetings.  No. R1496B is from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 5 October 2022.  It provides information requested by the committee regarding the catering contract to provide meals for Ukrainian refugees.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I had flagged this for discussion.  There was one particular issue with that.  I will bring the Comptroller and Auditor General in on this.  The correspondence in response to our letter states:</p> <blockquote> 	  	<font color="#00201F">The awarding of the specific contract as referenced in your letter is a matter for the relevant Accounting Officer.  The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform includes the provision of guidelines ... [but] does not have a role in evaluating such transactions.</font>  </blockquote> <p>In relation to the tendering process and so on, does Mr. McCarthy wish to comment?  What kind of tendering process was used there?</p></speech>

I suggest that we write to the Department to ask for its view of it, as we are 12 months into this, and to see if the Department has a comment to make on it and how it is operating to date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. R1497B from Mr. Paul O'Connell, on behalf of Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 6 October 2022, provides information requested by the committee regarding Benefacts.  We will note and publish this item.  These are internal working documents, and there was a request that they are not published.  We had agreed that we were going to deal with it in public.  The clerk was speaking with the Department about this and I had a discussion with the clerk yesterday about it.  The Department is okay with us discussing it now, so we will discuss it.  Deputy Catherine Murphy had it flagged for discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.532" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#EE01000"><p>Deputy Murphy is not here.  I am aware that she had a particular interest in Benefacts, on which I supported her.  I note we are not publishing the correspondence but I can refer to it.  Both Deputy Murphy and I were trying to understand why Benefacts was being brought to a close in real terms because we were not funding it any longer and we sought more information about why that might be.  I will not read directly from the document but I will refer to it.  It seems there is a recognition in the Department that the Benefacts service was worth preserving.  It seems the discussion was that it did not have sufficient scope or control over the project and this is why it was unhappy with the grant system.  Having read through it all, it is not clear why we have decided to truncate or end that service.  It does not seem that what is being proposed is similar or equal.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy is not here, perhaps we could roll this discussion on to the next meeting.  There is more work to be done here.  We are losing an important service in the context of transparency and, reading between the lines here, I believe civil servants recognise that.  There is a recognition of that in the correspondence.  There is more work to be done here.  I do not know what the work should be.  If the Department does not want us to publish the correspondence, can we even have this matter on the work programme?  I am not sure.</p></speech>

The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform this morning confirmed that he had referred to and used the service in the past.  He said that other Departments and bodies have benefited from it as well.  This matter puzzles me because the cost of Benefacts over six or seven years was roughly &euro;6 million.  My concern is that the proposal to replace it is through Pobal.  Again, I am open to correction on this but Pobal is saying clearly that it does not have the resources or staff to deal with this.  In any case, to get a database like Benefacts back up and running again would result in a time lag.  What happens in the interim?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.534" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022102000002#EE01200"><p>That gap will end up costing us money if we are to resource that system.  I understand the point about Pobal.  I understand it more now that we have seen this correspondence insofar as the Department believes there is a gap in oversight or a gap in the scope of sufficient control.  I do not have any serious evidence here to argue with it over that but it is not immediately obvious to me that Pobal would be the organisation to bridge that gap, or that it would assume this role, because I am not aware that it has done this kind of work in the past.  We should keep this matter on the books because I am not happy with this answer.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The funding for Benefacts is a small enough amount of money relative to funding for many other areas.  The service was widely used and to lose it like this is a loss to the State.  We will put it in the work programme for next week.</p><p> The next item of correspondence is No. R1498B from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 7 October 2022.  It concerns the minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to our report on our examination of Vote 29, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, programme B, broadcasting, for 2019, and Vote 33, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media for 2020.  The minute of the Minister is the official response to the recommendations of the committee.  We raised this matter with the Secretary General this morning and it is clear the minute is not in line with the Department's own circular, which I quoted to him.  That circular, which was signed off by Mr. Moloney, provides that the minute should respond to every recommendation, stating whether that recommendation has been accepted or not and the reasons for same.  That has not been done in regard to any of the recommendations in our report.</p><p> It is open to us to take this matter up with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We could also write to the Accounting Officer for the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and request an explanation for the poor quality of the response.  In addition to failing to comply with the circular, a number of the committee's requests are not directly addressed.  That is the situation and, as I said, I raised it with Mr. Moloney earlier.  Do any members wish to comment?</p></speech>

Members might reflect on the correspondence and the minute of the Minister, which were circulated, and we will come back to them.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is R1501B from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 10 October 2022, providing further information requested by the committee in regard to the summary report on climate action plan targets.  Deputy Catherine Murphy flagged this item for discussion.  I also want to raise an issue relating to the estimated cost of the climate action plan, which, according to the report produced by McKinsey &amp;amp; Company, is &euro;119 billion out to 2030, much of which will come from the public purse.  We looked for more information on that and what we got was a two-page summary document that gives headline figures.  The question that arises for me is whether this is really the only breakdown the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has.  It seems to be very scant.  We are dealing with expenditure of &euro;119 billion by 2030.  If this breakdown is the basis for rolling out the climate action plan that has been adopted by the Oireachtas, I am concerned about the lack of detail and information.  There is the question even of how the information has been arrived at.</p> <p>  The document seems very light on detail, facts and specifics, as I said, and I wonder whether we should look for more information on it.  Members will see the figures on pages 1 and 2.  The &euro;119 billion estimate covers the total investment required for the next nine years across electricity, transport, built environment, industry and agriculture.  It also includes investment that is redirected, including spending on electric vehicles and adaptation of internal combustion engine vehicles, as well as incremental investment in retrofits.  Does anyone wish to comment on this?  What we got is very light on detail.</p></speech>

A point to note is that there is not a lot of discussion around the impact of land use on the plan, which is a major part of it.  When much of this was agreed in the past few months, there was a suggestion the land use aspect would come about in the next 18 months.  There definitely is a lack of information.  We should, as a committee, be expecting a bit more detail.</p></speech>

Under electricity and power generation, which is one of the big headings, it looks like a very low figure of &euro;1 billion or less out of the &euro;119 billion is given for backup capacity.  I wonder whether we might probe that in the context of energy security to see what the figure is based on, whether it is sufficient and if there is more detail on it.  It seems from the graph on page 2 that there is &euro;1 billion for backup capacity, which I presume is what is meant by the reference to dispatchable power.</p> <p>  I propose we write back to the Secretary General seeking more detailed information, specifically in regard to the agriculture aspect.  Deputy Hourigan wants more information on land use and I assume members would also like details on afforestation.  I propose that we also ask for further information on backup power and capacity in electricity generation, including how much is pencilled in for that, what it is based on and how much of that would come from the private sector and how much from the public purse.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

If we look at the building industry at the moment, its workforce is way below the numbers we had in the period from 2000 to 2008.  We cannot deliver a whole lot of projects without having the workforce in place.  I do not see any Department dealing with that issue.  We have talked about training more apprentices and so on but I am not clear that enough is being done to respond to this issue, which we will need to do if we want to deliver on the whole area of building, retrofitting and all of that.  I have spoken to people who applied to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, for instance, and it is only two years later that they are getting a response because of the workload the authority has.  Departments need to look at that issue.  It is grand putting everything that needs to be done in a plan but there is no point in doing so if we know full well it cannot be delivered without a workforce.</p></speech>

However, he makes a fair point.  There are 27- and 28-month waiting lists for some of those schemes.  It is clear there are workforce pipeline issues and I think there is a policy issue in this regard.  I do not have a problem asking in our letter for the view of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this matter.  As Deputies, we need to raise the issue in the D&aacute;il as well to try to flag its importance.  I and many others have raised the need for more apprenticeships, not just in the traditional trades but right across the board, which would be more like the German model.  People should be able to learn a trade instead of having to do degrees in third level institutions that might not get them into employment as quickly.</p><p>That is not to play one off the other.  It is recognised that there has been a shortage of apprenticeships in this State.  We missed the opportunity from 2008 to 2019 or 2020 to start doing this in a serious way.  I do not know the figures off the top of my head but I know there has been some improvement.  We can include that issue and flag it with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  From a public expenditure point of view, we can ask what consideration the Department gives to workforce planning and pipelines in terms of people being trained when it makes decisions to allocate money.</p></speech>

It recommends that carers be added to the eligible group for work permits.  The recommendation is that 1,000 work permits be issued.  I imagine that strategic group is working across all sectors.  We should at least try to find out if that is the case.</p></speech>

Under the Department's approach to section 56 and section 39 organisations, the national pay agreement does not automatically apply to staff in that sector.  In the longer term, this poses challenges to recruitment and retention in those areas.  Deputy Burke made a valid point that, beyond apprenticeships and such, it is about the broader package of how we retain and attract people to public bodies.</p></speech>

The figure given looks like &euro;23 billion, with between &euro;9 billion and &euro;13 billion under another heading of electricity generation, with &euro;1 billion for backup generation.  It is proposed that we also raise the need for availability of workforce training and a pipeline of people coming through and ask if this is being taken into account.  It is also proposed to ask if the Department has had discussions with the relevant Departments that come under the headings of electricity, power generation, transport, buildings and industry and agriculture.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1502B and is also from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is dated 11 October and provides the information requested by the committee on the proposed building standards regulator and the national building control management project.  This arose from our consideration of the minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which responded to the recommendations in the committee's report on its examination of the appropriation accounts for Vote 34, housing, planning and local government.  It is proposed to note and publish that correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 4 is the work programme.  At last week's meeting, we agreed to proceed with a schedule of engagements to Christmas and the secretariat is working to make the necessary arrangements.  We also agreed to schedule a meeting with An Bord Plean&aacute;la after Christmas.  Next week, we will engage with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p> <p>  Deputy Hourigan asked that we add a meeting with the regulator of the approved housing sector to the work programme.

I am the reform manager and I am joined by Dr. Niamh Lally, principal investigator for the service reform fund, SRF and action research programme.  I will talk about how Genio has developed a methodology for the training programme to support system reforms.</p> <p>  As part of the SRF, Genio advised on reform strategies, supported the implementation of change and provided resources from a fund of &euro;45 million comprising public and philanthropic resources to implement change across the fields of disability, mental health and homelessness.  Flagship projects of the SRF include Housing First in homelessness, individual placement and support in mental health and people to moving from congregated settings to communities in disability.  These have all been rolled out nationally.  The way we work is to support change over a specific period of time, build capacity and then step back.</p> <p>  All of Genio&rsquo;s work has two core features.  The first is the voice of the person.  People using services and supports should be at the heart of the design, implementation and evaluation of services.  Central to everything Genio does is the belief that services and supports should be shaped to the greatest extent possible by the people using them.  This co-production not only ensures that services have more impact, it can also help to accelerate social service reform processes by articulating clearly the expressed will and preference of those using the services.</p> <p>  The second feature of Genio's work is a methodology for enabling change within complex, challenging systems.  Realising rights can be a challenging process.  Large, complex social and health services often get stuck in inappropriate models of support.  Negative perceptions of people using services as lacking capacity and being vulnerable can result in people being excluded from mainstream society and being denied the relationships and sense of self-fulfilment we all take for granted.  Genio has developed a model of intervention to help services re-orientate towards community-based, self-directed supports and to overcome deeply institutionalised practices.</p> <p>  We will concentrate our statement on the component of the SRF which focused on supporting people from ten large congregated settings to live fulfilling lives in the community.  This work of the SRF was carried out between 2016 and 2022 hand in hand with the HSE national disability team.  The methodology was based on approaches Genio has been supporting service providers to implement since 2008. These ten sites were prioritised by the HSE as many had received highly-critical HIQA reviews and were considered to be in need of urgent interventions.  The focus of this programme, in line with Government policy, was to build self-directed, community-based services for these people in accordance with their will and preference and to support them to move from congregated settings to mainstream communities. </p> <p>  Prior to the SRF, the Genio Trust supported a large number of demonstration projects on community living and developed evidence on the impact and efficacy of community-based living.  In 2013, a team led by an international expert in disability studies, Professor Roy McConkey, produced a report analysing the impact of supporting people with intellectual and physical disabilities and people with significant mental health challenges to move from congregated to community settings.  The study followed the lives of 160 people over three points in time and found that the personalisation of accommodation had significant impacts on the people's degree of independence, social integration and anxiety.  One of the key findings was that staff and families were often supportive especially once they saw these significant improvements.</p> <p>  In response to the challenges of implementing change to transform congregated services to community-based, personalised services Genio has developed training courses in supported self-directed living, SSDL, over the past six years.  This training radically changed the assumptions that front-line staff held about people they supported.  SSDL is an intensive approach spread over nine months where staff engage in discovery around people's wishes and supports them to achieve a good life as much as possible with other people in society.  SSDL was adapted from social role valorisation in the US.  It was central to our capacity building programme under the SRF as we provided training, information and expertise to individuals, families and service providers.  The HSE identified having &ldquo;change teams&rdquo; working within services who have dedicated time to implement and lead new models of supports, as central to the successes of the SRF.</p> <p>  The number of people supported to move went far beyond the original targets with 370 people moving from these ten facilities over the period against an initial target of 163 people.  Perhaps more importantly, the people were supported in ways shaped by their expressed will and preference in line with international best practice.  The key to this was an intensive, rigorous process of training for staff, many of whom became champions of change in this process.</p> <p>  In 2016, the SSDL training was redesigned for senior managers and front-line staff due to a tight timeline and because ambitious numbers of people were to be supported to move into communities as a result of the HIQA reports.  Therefore this training was tailored to the specific challenges in the these congregated settings.  In many ways this training restructured how staff viewed the people they were supporting.</p> <p>  Stories were recorded and proactively shared during the time we supported them under the SRF.  One example I will share is that of a man from the south of the country who lived in a large institution for more than 30 years and is a wheelchair user.  This man has now retired.  During the discovery process as part of the SSDL training, staff got to know this man in a different way as they were able to spend one-on-one time with him to identify his will and preferences.  His wishes were to move back to his home town community to be near his siblings and to have a garden where he could have his own plants and grow some vegetables.  A suitable home was identified in the community and staff supported this gentleman to make weekly visits to the local area, make connections and get to know the area facilities such as the post office, library, etc.  This gentleman has now moved to his new home in the community.  He has also joined the local choir and regularly attends the local GAA club to support his local team.  He has learned to cook for himself and enjoys spending time in his wonderful, colourful garden, where his family comes to visit him regularly.</p> <p>  In addition to the SSDL training, an action research approach was used to support and inform the expansion of a community-of-practice, focused on overcoming the challenges of implementing reform of services from congregated settings to community-based services.  Interviews were conducted with staff who had been involved in closing congregated settings and establishing community-based supports.  A case-study was developed and leaders who had implemented change provided guidance to others on how to overcome challenges and transform their services.</p> <p>  Criteria-based funding was developed in partnership with the HSE national disability team and approved by the Genio Trust to finance the "community connection" component of the change process.  This funding enabled staff trained in SSDL to explore ideas with individuals who were being supported to move to the community.  In partnership with the HSE, regular visits were facilitated to the ten services to monitor and review progress and payments were only made when agreed targets and milestones were reached.  Many of the services moved from being heavily criticised by HIQA to receiving praise for the quality of their community-based services.</p> <p>  We have learned three lessons from the implementation of change in supporting people to move to mainstream, community-settings.  One was clarity of purpose.  The SRF employed assessment criteria to access funding and required supports to be self-directed and provided in mainstream community-settings.  It was an ambitious programme to help services transform the way they support people.  The fact that the funding was tied to specific targets and quality of engagement enabled a creative pressure for change.</p> <p>  The second lesson relates to changing ingrained beliefs and practices.  It must be recognised that shifting models from group-based, medicalised, congregated services to community-based, self-</p> <p>directed services is highly challenging.  Staff needed to have the opportunity to consult with the people using the services in their everyday practice for meaningful engagement.</p><p>When afforded this opportunity with a robust evidence based engagement methodology, the reform programme paved the way for front-line staff to see the people they support in a new light.  Through this process staff biases and assumptions about the people they support were brought to light in a constructive way.  Across the programmes participants expressed cases of being astounded and shocked at the change in their perception of people&rsquo;s capacities and capabilities.</p><p> Finally, I refer to adapting to overcome challenges and sharing lessons.  Individual services need to build their capacities to be able to avoid challenges.  The change teams that led the change processes within services learned from each other in communities of practice about how to avoid challenges emerging from human resources, finance and sourcing accommodation to implement the high quality reform work.  During the lifetime of the service reform fund, many workshops, information sessions and webinars were held by the HSE national office and supported by the Genio action research team to share the learnings.</p><p> I again thank the committee for inviting us.  We are happy to discuss this programme of work further and answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

At Crann we have a unique solution focused on a co-ordinated care plan and wrap-around services for the whole family, enabling them to not only deal with these issues but to thrive.  This is our two generation, 2Gen, approach.  The Crann Centre, based in Ovens, County Cork, was established in 2014.</p> <p>  Our clients include children, adults and families living with spina bifida, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, arthrogryposis, acquired spinal injuries and stroke.  These are complex conditions which significantly impact on the fabric of the family requiring lifelong clinical care and intensive in-community supports.  There are more than 7,000 people in Munster living with a neuro-physical disability.  In addition, there are more than 20,000 family members whose lives are impacted, all requiring services and supports.  Nationally this number increases to almost 100,000.  We currently support 300 Munster-based families and our strategic vision is to support more than 600 families in the next three years.</p> <p>  Our services focus on six key areas comprising health and continence; psychological well-being; mobility; education and career pathways; community and networks; and independent living.  In a few moments our colleagues at Ascend will share details of the 2Gen approach and how a network of organisations across the United States use it to help improve family well-being.  Crann is the first organisation in the Ascend network and the first in Europe to adapt this 2Gen approach for disability services.  Why?  It is because disability affects all family members and if the person with the disability is to thrive, it is not enough for them to get the supports they need.  Their parents, carers and siblings need supports too.  This is why our 2Gen approach works, because it serves all family members simultaneously.</p> <p>  Our key strategic priority is building a sustainably-funded organisation.  We are totally reliant on fundraising.  We do not receive any annual statutory funding.  An equitable level of statutory support is a key priority for us.  We have submitted a comprehensive business case to the HSE for a service level agreement, SLA, for our continence clinic.  This service is recognised by the HSE team, consultants, urologists, clinicians and community health doctors as being a unique and vital addition to services for children, adults and families.  Our referrals are increasing weekly.  Without the modest annual funding set out in the business case, we cannot guarantee the future of this vital service, which is not available elsewhere.  We know that our services are saving the HSE significant money, up to &euro;100,000 for each pressure wound, which we prevent from ultimately requiring hospitalisation.  We recently completed a social return on investment evaluation, SROI, which showed that for every &euro;1 we spend on services our clients receive &euro;4 in value, a 400% return on investment.</p></speech>

It is an honour to join the Chairman, Deputies, Senators and colleagues from Washington DC on the ancestral land of the Piscataway people.  On behalf of our founding executive director, Anne Mosle, and our managing director, Marjorie Sims, along with our network partner colleagues at the Crann Centre, I thank the committee for this opportunity to speak about Ascend at the Aspen Institute and the two generation, or 2Gen, approach.</p> <p>  In 2010, in the aftermath of the great recession our founder, Anne Mosle, set out to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty and intentionally foster the well-being of children and the adults in their lives together.  Our work from day one has honoured lived expertise and encompassed racial, gender and economic equity with an intersectional lens.</p> <p>  Ascend at the Aspen Institute brings together diverse leaders working across systems and sectors to create a society where every family flourishes.  We have been building a national network to surface and spread innovative 2Gen approaches in communities across the United States.  Today, the Ascend network includes 479 partners in every state in the US, as well as DC and Puerto Rico, and now reaches across the globe through our only European partner, the Crann Centre, and two other international partners.  Together this movement of parents, practitioners, policymakers and philanthropists are working to transform systems impacting more than 10 million families.</p> <p>  Many programmes focus solely on the child or the parent, but 2Gen approaches do not focus exclusively on either a child&rsquo;s development or isolate an adult&rsquo;s needs, because their wellbeing is interconnected and interdependent.  2Gen approaches aim to integrate services and supports to move the whole family forward, benefitting both the child and the adults in their lives.  2Gen approaches recognise whole family units, as families define themselves.  By design, we seek to understand the multiple dimensions of family life and consider a variety of pathways for promoting effective outcomes for everyone.  We work with families as experts and meaningfully engage parents and caregivers in designing policies and programmes that affect them.  Our goal is to develop holistic, integrated and equity-focused solutions.</p> <p>  A 2Gen approach can take many forms in policy and practice.  One example of such an approach would be a care centre providing young children with early childhood education opportunities while also offering a workforce development programme for parents and caregivers.  The Crann Centre is undertaking this important work by recognising the needs of both children with disabilities and their caregivers.</p> <p>  In 2012, in partnership with a group of philanthropic partners, Ascend published the Two Generations, One Future report that laid the groundwork for the growth and development of the 2Gen field.  Over the last decade of accomplishments and learnings from our network, Ascend has advanced 2Gen approaches with more than ten US Governors' Cabinets, more than 100 fellows from across human services, non-profit, and philanthropic systems, and has engaged more than 60 parent advisers to translate their lived experience into new policies and programmes.  We are thrilled to be partnering with the Crann Centre on advancing 2Gen for families with disabilities and creating a new way of working to lift up these families' strengths and centre their voices in the systems designed to serve them.</p></speech>

I have not been on this committee for long and I am trying to learn what is happening across the country.</p><p>When I was listening to the statements, I got the impression that much of this is Munster based in terms of the activities.  There is much philanthropy in terms of support and funding.  Applications have been made to the Departments to get more stable funding, which is essential for all of the organisations.  I found the 2Gen approach interesting in that it takes in family members, including the person who has the disability.  I would like to hear a bit more about this because it seems to be a very good approach.  My experience has been that in many cases when people who have a disability, whether an intellectual or a physical disability, get older, we often find that those around them die or move on and they are left on their own.  They have no family supports around them.  I often see this in my constituency.  While much of what we have heard here is about the structures around that person, I find that people are left isolated.  How do we deal with that?</p><p> In terms of housing, as was mentioned, research was done on people who were living in complexes, where there would have been a significant number of people with disabilities, and who ended up in the community.  I refer to HAIL Housing, for instance, which provides mental health and others supports.  I would have thought that was a good model.  However, the witnesses focused on trying to get people back to the areas they are from.  I am curious about the attitude to these types of complexes and what people think of them.</p><p> Many of the things I have heard here are new to me.  The 2Gen approach is very interesting and it has come mainly from America.  It has been imported here through Crann.  Are there any plans to expand this further?  Obviously, the economic issue is a big one but are there plans to expand this?  In Munster, it has grown from 300, with a target of up to 600 over the next couple of years.  Maybe the witnesses will explain to us whether it is possible to expand this over the next while.</p></speech>

The 2Gen for Ireland is a new model.  It is very well proven with ten years of evidence-based work in the United States.  From the Crann perspective, it has been a great privilege to work with Ascend at the Aspen Institute to adapt the 2Gen to serve people with disability.  In terms of numbers, first and foremost, it was about establishing the project and bringing value to lives, the lives of all the family.  Second, it was about creating the model of care that we can evidence base ourselves, or proving the model.  That was stage two.  It was about serving the families well and proving the model.  On the idea of expansion, the answer is very much a "Yes".  However, we need to get to proof of concept for this model first.  We need to be able to show people and service users that this is a very good way and a better way to serve people.  It is cost effective and it works in the community.  The answer to the question on expansion is "Yes" but in time.</p></speech>

They would have worked with people who were interested in moving into the community and their families.  They would have put in applications to us which were assessed against specific criteria.  Once the funding had been received, staff were employed to work with those individuals in a different way to source suitable accommodation in the community for their needs.  The services then had the challenging piece of unbundling funding within the services to support that person in the community.  Some people have quite complex needs and sometimes many adaptations were required in the home.  The services would have worked with each individual around that piece in terms of sourcing what they needed.</p> <p>  The important thing around the training that was provided, in terms of supported self-directed living training, was that staff were trained to support and work with individuals in a different way.  It was not the medicalised model.  It was more around the preference and needs of the person.</p> <p>  We started small and then we grew bigger.  With the service reform fund, we look at whole large institutions around that reform piece.  We started small.  We became champions for change and learned from experiences and used the stories to help and support other people who wanted to move.</p></speech>

I listened to the questions Deputy Ellis put.  Members find that at times, there is a huge difficulty for people with disabilities, in that there are no clear pathways as to how they can get the supports they need to live independently.  I do not know how this can be dealt with but there is a repeated request for people to prove they have a disability.  There is not a standard way of assessing people's needs across the country.  It is different in different locations.  How can we have a more caring and understanding approach to people with disabilities?  Part of this is that we are trying to provide supports to everyone without trying to provide individual supports to people who need them.  It is a difficulty, in that we are taking a one solution fits all approach, which does not work with disabilities.</p> <p>  There are huge gaps.  The idea of having people living independently, having a set up for them and what is being done in Cork is great.  How does that become national policy?  How can we help it become national policy and become a standard?  How do we track the success or otherwise of the project as it evolves?  If the service was to grow, how could it be monitored to make sure it is still delivering a high-class service and doing what it was set up to do?  As we roll things out further and do them nationally, they get lost and we do not get the results for people with disabilities.</p> <p>  This may be is a cultural change we have to try to get around, and I am getting around it, but instead of looking people's disability, we should look at their different abilities.  How do we harness that to have people living independently?  One of the biggest fears families, especially parents, who have a member with a disability have is around what will happen when they pass away and who will be the person's guardian.  Those are my thoughts.  I thank the witnesses who may have some responses for me.</p></speech>

Everyone is unique and individual and every support system is really different.  Our model of support entails putting a lot of training into supporting staff to work and support people in a different way in the community.  That is not only for paid staff.  We look at natural connections within the community where people can link into communities where they came from and with family members and friends.  It is not only about moving from an institution into the community; it is also about that ongoing support and review to make sure people's preferences have been listened to.  Our model of support is in terms of that ongoing capacity-building for staff because they are the people in the community who are paid to check in on individuals as well as friends and family.</p> <p>  One of the things we have done to ensure it is long-lasting is that we have supported the HSE through funding to continue supported self-directed living training.  In other large institutions, staff can now commence this training.  We also bring staff together on a community of practice so that they can learn from one another and share ideas.  It is very important that everybody who  moves into the community has that ongoing natural support and paid support, if needs be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.568" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niamh Lally" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022102000002#E00200"><p>The questions raised about that national policy, how it can be monitored and safeguarded and how one tracks success is very much about embedding a sense of curiosity within the system and among the practitioners and the staff who are within and run the services and who are very passionate about them.  Part and parcel of what we do in Genio is really about that process.  Everybody in this room knows that decongregation or shutting down long-term institutions, not just the buildings, but the institutional practices and ways of working, is very difficult.  It is a very challenging arena to be working in.  Part of the process that we bring in Genio is that curiosity through an action research process.  That is very much about asking people how they are experiencing their service, what their lives are like and about their practices and putting those at times undiscussable things back on to the table, that is, things that go unsaid and the practices that are not unearthed.  In this arena there are very strong and very different views because there are so many stakeholders involved.  However, it is about giving people that airtime and that sense that they are being heard and that they are contribution is valued.  It is really about tapping into the expertise that is already there.</p> <p>  Much of the time there can be a policy implementation gap.  There can be fantastic policies but it is about how you embed them on the ground.  That is very much about tapping into the expertise in the room, working with that coalition of the willing and exposing people to each other and to all that richness that is there in terms of how people want to live their lives, how people want to live in the community and their will and preference and their rights.  It is about trying to bring people who have that expertise together, that, is, the people with lived experiences, the people in use of services, the people with disabilities, the staff, the policymakers and the people with oversight.  It is really about how one co-designs a way forward together, although not necessarily a solution because, as Ms Doheny said, not one solution fits all.  The question is around how one co-designs it and how one can people be brought together.  It is really about embedding that in a way that one can have those fast-paced loops and feedbacks we have with the HSE and the National Disability Office.  It allows us to feedback to them quickly, in terms of what is happening on the ground, what are the good practices and what are the things that are blocking them, so that people can move together in a way that is solution-focused and that moves forward.  That is what one gets in terms of that sustainability piece, that change in practice and that breaking down of institutional barriers.</p></speech>

Is there data to back that up or is it just a softer approach than that?</p></speech>

The process side of things is the action research side of things where one is finding out what is happening on the ground now and feeding that back up, so that we can feed into that loop.  As Ms Doheny mentioned, with the service reform fund, there were criteria attached to that.  There was funding attached to that.  Not everyone got the same funding.  It was weighted differently, depending on the area of the country and on the community health organisation.  That was monitored and tracked over a period of time.</p></speech>

As Dr. Lally said, we did not just divide the pot of money between the organisations or CHOs.  Applications were put in to a grants committee.  Family members sat on that committee and reviewed proposals.  Money was divided out and awarded, based on those proposals and on how many people were going to be supported.  After money was awarded, monitoring and progress around how those individuals were progressing in the community was very much tracked over the three years.</p></speech>

"Disability" is one word but there are many different types of disability, so the one solution does not fit all.  Our model of care in Crann is about looking at people with a neuro-physical disability and how with our wraparound service we bring all the family into that situation and ask what its goal and plan are for the future.  Fundamentally, with the families we meet, what is really of concern to them is around what happens in the future if something happens to them.  We look at that from a whole family perspective and support the family around that.  We also look at the needs of the person with the disability and the needs of the family.  Then with our model and our wraparound services, we build towards giving them skills to achieving those goals.</p> <p>  One of the key areas for us in our service offerings is an independent living module and that develops those life skills from a very young age.  Often people with disabilities may have been over protected as a young child.  Then when they get to the age of transitioning on to third level or on to further education, they do not have the life skills.  Suddenly they are looking to live independently but they do not have the basic skills.  We work with the family from a very young age in bringing on those skills.  We look at adaptations that need to be made, so they can achieve the successes and the goals they want in life.  Another big part of that, and a part of what we do in our model, is around researching that and evidencing that.  I will let our colleagues in Ascend or Mr. P&aacute;draig Mallon speak to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr P&aacute;draig Mallon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022102000002#E00700"><p>Measurement is built into the 2Gen approach and our colleagues at Ascend can talk about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.574" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarah Haight" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022102000002#E00800"><p>I can share a little bit about the evidence behind 2Gen approaches.  There is a strong and growing body of evidence in the United States.  We know the return on investment in early childhood programmes is as high as 13%.  We also know the greatest predictor of a family's overall economic mobility is the parents' educational attainment.  We know now from brain science that people's brains change and adapt when they become parents, just like babies brains.  This is true of mothers and fathers.  These bodies of research inform 2Gen approaches.</p> <p>  One example of its impact in the United States is Tulsa, Oklahoma, where there is a large early childhood centre called Cap Tulsa.  The leaders at Cap Tulsa realised that many parents of children who were enrolled were seeking greater opportunity, namely, better jobs and wages.  They created an employment training programme in the health field, training parents in nursing and health technology.  In studying the impact of this 2Gen approach, researchers found that the children of parents enrolled in job training had higher rates of school attendance and the parents themselves reported lower rates of stress.  This is applicable to this conversation because what we are seeing is that when the whole family is addressed in its need, in this instance, it is an educational and economic need, there are improved results for both generations.  We like to say that you cannot give one member of the generation a balloon and the other a dead weight.  These types of efforts are gaining momentum across the US and they demonstrate both the effectiveness and the efficiency of 2Gen.</p></speech>

We recently undertook a social return on investment initiative, a valuation of four of our key services.  As we said in the opening statement, that captured from the service users themselves what value the services were delivering for them.  The value they attached to the services they are receiving from the Crann Centre is four times what it costs us to deliver those services.  For every &euro;1 we spend they get &euro;4 in value.  That sort of fiscal-based evidence hopefully points to a situation where you are not just looking at the qualitative aspects of the improvements in terms of life improvements and health and well-being improvements.  We are really focused on measuring that too, and that is why social return on investment analysis is a very effective tool.  It asks the stakeholders what value they would put on the service if it was not available and they had to pay for it.  We are talking about thousands of euro in value for services we would offer, which could be an opportunity to meet with peers.  For families, children and adults, our service provides the opportunity to come together.  Isolation is one of the key issues for people with a disability.  The value they would place on that would be upwards of about &euro;6,000 for a programme that enables them to come together and meet with their families.  We feel very confident that we are able to track and show clear evidence that there is a return on investment by philanthropy or the State.  I think that is rooted in Deputy Canney's question as to how we know that approaches are working and how we can prove that we are delivering value for the funds coming in.</p><p> Social return on investment is one tool among others, but it happens to be quite effective in hearing the voice of the stakeholder and understanding the value to them.  There is no point in delivering services if they do not ultimately deliver value for the person who receives those services.  Not alone is it important to deliver good outcomes but it is also important to be able to evidence for them as well.  That is why the 2Gen approach and the methodology established over ten years through Aspen and Ascend is attractive to us, because it gives us a strategic framework in which to deliver great services but also commitment to measuring and evidencing.</p></speech>

It is important that we continue to highlight the social return on investment, and that if money is being invested, people are benefitting from it and the social return is there.  I say well done.</p></speech>

I read through the opening statements last night and I have a couple of questions.  Moving people from congregated settings is very important work and it is obviously time to move on from congregated settings as the targets were not reached there.  The witnesses talked about the staff in institutions and how being trained to look at things differently and engage with the residents has meant that they looked at their work completely differently.  Would the witnesses say that initially people in congregated settings were being treated almost as patients rather than as residents and that that has changed?  How much more work has to be done to move more people from congregated settings into the community?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.579" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara Doheny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022102000002#F00400"><p>The training was very important.  When we set out with initial pilot projects back in 2018 and when we put out applications for funding, we very quickly realised that staff were not equipped to work with people and to help them move to community in a different way.  They had been used to working and were trained to work in a specific way within the large institution.  They did not have the time to work with people individually to see what their will and preference was.  This was something that we found in the very early days so we consulted with the services and brought some of them together.  They told us they needed training because they wanted to see people move on and wanted to work differently.  Not everybody came on that journey in the early stages, so we engaged in social role valorisation training and over the years that developed training into the nine month training.  That was a key ingredient to help staff understand and learn more about the people they were supporting, not only in a medical model.  We were given some examples when out on visits where some people would have been on medication and then through the new discovery process, they had reviewed medication and that person no longer needed it.</p> <p>  Some of the most ingrained staff in institutions who are now the best champions for change went on that journey in the training.  Not everybody stayed, some people felt this was not for them.  We have to realise as well that within the large institutions there are cleaners, cooks and gardeners.  Some of them came on the journey and did the training as well, so they were community connectors.  That is what they were seen in terms of supporting people in the community.  If they needed support medical support, they go to the local GP or the local nurse to get that support, but certainly the key ingredient was that training.  I refer to the community of practice that came out of training and the learning from the other services of what was and was not working.  Small things came up like how we work petty cash and transport when we move to community.  All these small things were huge when they were moving from an institution out to community living.  They were all issues that had to worked through and ironed out.  The staff themselves worked that out.  There might have been another service further along the tracks that was able to help and provide support.</p> <p>  For people who have now moved to the community, it is really important that that ongoing support, monitoring and review in terms of the discovery continues for the individual people.  Everybody's needs change over time, so it is important that staff are trained to recognise that and to continue to review.  The Deputy is right that there are more people in large institutions and training needs to continue, and the HSE national team is continuing that training through the service reform fund.  That will be finishing up next year for the next cohort of people moving out of the large institutions.</p> <p>  Obviously there are some barriers around housing access, and suitable housing at the moment.  That is a huge challenge.  However, when we started this journey through the service reform fund we were fortunate there was accommodation available and the people were able to move in and we were able to use to the stories around the successes to support and to share with others.</p></speech>

There are many different routes as to how people access our services, because of the range of services we offer, particularly our continent service.  That has gotten a referral pathway where the hospitals, consultants and local health services refer into our continent service.  People can self refer, but as we have grown over time and people have begun to know us, they certainly come more and other people like rehabilitation centres are referring to us to support the family because of the services we offer.  We are not just a medical model.  The range of services we have, because we are living and following the Aspen 2Gen model, really focus on the family, so quite often we have people who maybe have a child or older adult with a disability but we would support their family as opposed to just supporting that person.  Many of our services are supporting the parents and siblings, and maybe supporting the carers in the community or the special needs assistants in the schools.  This is all to support the family unit to make life that bit easier for them.</p></speech>

In the last 12 months we have grown 75% in terms of people.  As we are becoming known and as our services are growing, the demand is certainly increasing.  We are currently serving 305 families but if you average that out at about four per family and if we are serving the whole family, which we do, you could be talking more than 1,000 people that we are potentially servicing.  They are accessing our psychological support services, our continence service, our occupational therapy, OT, services and our independent living services, as well as our community services.</p><p>We were fortunate this year in that we opened our first inclusive, fully-accessible playground where all the family can come together and play.  That is really important because many parties or similar events cannot happen because the kids cannot go as they are not accessible.  We have kids parties where the whole class can come and play as a unit along with the family.  It is the ripple effect.  That is our model.</p></speech>

When this project began in 2014, it started with the research.  We hired a research doctor to do a needs assessment because the core part of this project from day one has been the voice of the stakeholder.  Once we identified the stakeholders' needs, we developed a project in response.  I looked for a model of care that could respond to what the research showed us.  The original piece of research completed in 2014 or 2015 was a revelation.  It showed that the primary concern for our stakeholders, which I thought would be clinical, was not clinical, but was social isolation.  I then began to look for a model of care that addressed the whole family, because social isolation was affecting the whole family.  It meant they did not engage in the community they lived in and instead of being proactive members of the community, they were marginalised.  I found the Aspen 2Gen model of care in the United States from a connection I had with United Way in central Indiana, which was using the 2Gen model.  It was my eureka moment.  We are the first to employ the 2Gen model for disability in Ireland.  We would love to prove the model of the evidence-based platform of data and for people to copy us or expand the programme.</p></speech>

I support people with disabilities living in their community.  It is important and it is great that we have that focus.  Will Ms Buckley describe her experience as the parent of a child with a disability and how the Crann Centre supports her to live in her community?  Will Ms Jarvey speak about her motivation for founding the Crann Centre?  What needs is she addressing that are not being met by other organisations?  Deputy Tully touched on that.  Ms Cahill referred in her opening to the SLA for a continence clinic.  Will she describe this service and what contribution it makes to care in the community?  To go back to Ms Jarvey, what was the basis for adopting the 2Gen model?  What evidence does Ms Haight have to support the effectiveness of the 2Gen approach?  What are the long-term impacts?  That is important as we go forward.  It is all about learning.  I am in CHO 5, so it is important for me to listen and learn today.  What does the future hold for Ms Buckley's family and where is Crann in that?</p></speech>

She has spina bifida and hydrocephalus and she is a full-time wheelchair user.  We were probably the first people at Crann's door when it opened.  From when she was born, our biggest hope was that she would be as independent as possible and achieve her full potential.  When we knocked on Crann's door, it was fantastic for the entire family.  Crann's doors opened at a transition phase for Niamh.  She was moving on to secondary school, which was a time of huge stress in our house because she was moving from a very small school to a much bigger school.  She had also moved into a wheelchair full-time at that point, which brought its own challenges.  She did not know how to use a wheelchair properly.  Straight away, she undertook a mobility programme that taught her how to better navigate her environment.  She also undertook confidence training to ensure her voice would be heard and that she was confident enough to express her feelings.</p> <p>  There were many supports for my family and for me.  My other daughter was approaching the end of her secondary school education at that time and she was hugely worried about Niamh starting off and how she would manage, but those fears were alleviated through the mobility programme.</p></speech>

As the Deputy rightly said, we have made a business case for an SLA within the HSE.  Speaking to Ms Jarvey's point on the research carried out, the need identified by the stakeholders was the lack of community support around bowel and bladder continence services.  We set about addressing this at Crann.  We set up our continence service, which is the only community continence service that covers both bowel and bladder.  It is a sensitive area for us, as a nation, and in our culture to talk about, but it is the elephant in the room when it comes to disability.  If you ask a person with a spinal cord or another type of injury, continence is the biggest factor that causes a lot of ripple effects.</p> <p>  Our continence service has grown exponentially.  In the last year alone, we have seen 75% growth in people attending our service, which is quite substantial.  What we provide is support to the individual.  It is a human right to be able to manage your continence and to go out.  It affects families because they plan their trips and journeys based on where the next toileting facility is.  For the service we provide, we bring in and meet with families and work with them over a period of time.  Our nurses, Eimear and Ita, work with them to come up with a programme that works for them.  Many of our referrals come from hospitals and community settings because we can give the time to provide that support.  The reason it works so well is that, while we have our health and continence service, we are not just a medical model, as Ms Jarvey said, and as came out in the research.  We also provide psychological supports that can go around having continence issues.  We have mobility and occupational therapy services, so if seating or positioning is an issue we can bring that service in.  It is a wraparound service.</p><p>We discovered through working with families that there was a gap in that SNAs in schools were not being trained so our team, including Ita and Eimear, took that on.  Eimear developed an SNA training programme to align with the hospitals.   We are currently the only setting providing SNA training for continence in Ireland.  We have trained 120 SNAs in the past year and a half.</p></speech>

We have recently been accredited by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI so we are now training nurses.  So far we have trained 20 nurses.  Training SNAs is our ultimate goal.  We are providing the service for all of these people free of charge and we are not funded for that.</p></speech>

They are early childhood services; post-secondary or what we often call college or workforce development services; economic assets which includes what kind of public benefits the family might need; social capital including access to networks, individual and institutional supports; and health and well-being.  The Crann Centre's two-generation approach focuses on the health and well-being component but by applying a two-generation lens, it also considers the economic and social needs of the family.  As I noted earlier, in the US we have a lot of evidence about those components, such as the return on investment from early childhood programmes and the knowledge that parents' educational attainment has the greatest impact on the child's overall economic mobility.  We also have evidence of the concept of mutual motivation, which refers to when a child is learning and developing and the child can motivate the parent.  Equally, when a parent is learning and growing, he or she can reinforce subjects and ideas for the child.</p> <p>  We are seeing emerging evidence that children who are part of two-generation approaches are more likely to attend school regularly and read by third grade.  Parents who are engaged in their own dreams and aspirations and who are seen not just as parents, but as whole people with economic and educational aspirations, are more likely to have living-wage jobs and more economic stability for their families.</p> <p>  When we think about evidence, we also think about this from a systems standpoint.  In states and counties in the US where there is a two-generation lens, we see more co-ordination and alignment among systems that aim to serve families.  That results in faster services; services that are more tailored to the unique needs of families; and more dignified treatment of families, recognising their strengths, which we believe will result in better long-term outcomes for those families.</p></speech>

I am a lifelong philanthropist.  It is sort of in my DNA as I hail from the Lilly pharmaceutical family and philanthropy is a strong family tradition so I suppose I am hardwired to be a philanthropist.</p> <p>  I came to live in Ireland in 1997 and was looking for a project that could bring value to lives, prove it was a good way to serve people and eventually provide systems change.  Through personal connections I discovered that services for persons with disabilities in Ireland were fragmented and difficult to access.  Stress on families was compounded by this fragmented care.  That was when my ears pricked up and I thought perhaps there was a project in this area.  We hired a research doctor to carry out the preliminary professional needs assessment in which the voice of the stakeholder was honoured and shone through.  The project then moved forward in line with what the stakeholders needed and wanted.  They told us that, like the rest of us, they do not live in silos and asked that their care not be delivered in silos.  They said that their clinical care should not be separated from their health and well-being because that is not how they, I or anyone lives.  They have disabilities and complex medical needs demanding clinical care but these are all interwoven into people's health and well-being.  That is when the two-generation model came to my attention and I was fortunate to have Ascend take me under its wing and mentor Crann to adapt the two-generation model for disability, and here we are today.</p></speech>

Enabling people to exercise that right requires complex supports, crucially suitable housing and interconnected physical and social facilities.  The HSE's strategy Time to Move on from Congregated Settings: a Strategy for Community Inclusion is moving much too slowly.  The most pressing issue is the more than 1,300 people aged under 65 who are forced into nursing homes because the State will still not support them in community settings.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for helping us to understand how their organisations operate and how their models of support can and should be applied in other settings to help as many people as possible to live independent lives actively in their communities.  As a Cork TD I am familiar with the incredible work that Crann Centre Ireland does in Ovens, County Cork.  Its use of the two-generation approach that recognises whole family units and integrated processes responds to many of the issues that are raised on a weekly basis at this committee.  In his opening statement, Mr. Mallon mentioned that collaboration between a whole series of actors is important in the development of the two-generation approach.  I am aware it has been elaborated somewhat already, but from its experience in the US and Ireland, will the representatives explain some more about the significance of the co-operation?</p> <p>  One of the issues disabled people face here, as the witnesses have mentioned, is a siloed approach with some responsibilities falling under the HSE and others under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Transport or local authorities and so on.  Consistently we see people falling through the cracks.  Will the representatives of the Crann Centre elaborate on the particular challenges faced by people with disabilities living in rural Ireland?  What are their key recommendations to create systematic change?  Can they comment from their experience on what work can be done to simplify and make Government services more accessible?</p> <p>  We are all struck by Genio's emphasis on having the people who will be using the services and supports being at the heart of the design.  That should not be striking.  It is clear that on average the implementation and evaluation of services in Ireland are in no way close to that model.  Ms Doheny mentioned research findings that the personalisation of accommodation had significant impacts on the degree of independence, social integration and reduction of anxiety of people moving from congregated settings.  Will the representatives from Genio elaborate on that point?  How does that approach function on the ground?</p> <p>  Genio's work in helping people to move from congregated settings under the service reform fund in tandem with the HSE is positive and welcome.  From the lessons it has learned in that process, what is the potential for that approach to be rolled out on a much larger scale to support the hundreds of people who are still unfortunately in congregated settings?  Genio has correctly identified that this overall process can be challenging for everyone.  As public representatives we come in contact with cases in which people living in communal settings and their families have a preference to stay there rather than to be moved to community living.  Will Genio share its insights into situations that it might have encountered?</p></speech>

On the last question about how challenging this process is, Genio has been involved with all ten accelerated sites, hand in glove with the HSE and especially with the staff tasked with implementing de-congregation.  What we see from the findings is that it is very challenging.  The Deputy is correct that these congregated settings are in violation of many human rights including the UNCRPD.</p></speech>

It is like going to war and the closure of these places is very difficult.  We are asking people to change long-standing institutional beliefs and practices that have been there over a very long period of time, as Ms Doheny pointed out earlier.  It is not today or yesterday that these congregated settings have been there.  They have been there for generations.  We are asking people to change, to take on new roles, to develop new relationships, new values and very much new behaviours in how they work and how they approach that work.  We are asking people to unlearn many behaviours and when people are managing that kind of change with staff, they can no longer be that buffer.  There has to be that questioning and that time for discomfort.  They have to be able to feel the pinch of that backlash that is coming.  As one can imagine all of that is a highly emotive and an emotionally charged arena to work within.</p> <p>  What we have found from that is that it really is about capacity building, as Ms Doheny said.  It is really about the person at the centre of that and sometimes the person gets forgotten at the beginning of this change process because everything is coming at one.  There are HIQA orders, closure orders and media attention and rightfully so in that context.  When one begins to unpack it and unpack the layers, there are very ingrained beliefs and practices that have been there and have served a purpose for a long period of time.  To bring people around, the staff really need an opportunity and ability to work their way into reform.  Whether that is through fidelity to a model, such as social role valorisation or the supported self-directed living, SSDL, model, Ms Doheny spoke about, they have a life boat and a way of being able to look at it and to change their practice by doing and not by theory, not by a nebulous concept or not by necessarily following a policy about which maybe all staff do not all know, that is, that policy implementation gap they are living in.  That gives them the life boat and that is very much from the person-centred approach, that will and preference of the person.</p> <p>  As Ms Doheny also identified, it is about the time to do that for staff, the resource available and the training required and that the person is at the centre.  All of a sudden one is spending a huge amount of time with an individual.  One staff member told us she had worked with a lady for 30 years in the same setting.  She said that it was only in the last six months that she realised who that lady was.  She said she knew her as a client or as a patient but she never knew her as the individual she was.  That was very telling.</p> <p>  The other aspect is that staff are transformed.  Staff go on this journey but the person is at the centre of it.  The person is the catalyst and the one pushing the agenda, pushing their will and preference and their right to move out into the community, to go back to their families and to go to the local GAA match, all of the things we take for granted.  That gives staff their own journey of discovery and their own way of acting into it.  It is that transformation among staff who have been there for a long period of time.  Much of the time they can have the greatest challenges in moving in this way but when they move, we have found, whether from the research or the service reform fund, they move fundamentally and that transformation can occur.  Again the person is always at the centre of that.</p> <p>  As regards how challenging it is, the research has definitely uncovered just how challenging it is but in terms of how to move that forward, there are many lessons to be learned.  Through the research, we took cases of decongregation, where they were in the middle of it.  They were in the middle of the fire.  We took the lessons learned from persons in charge, community connectors, heads of service, heads of social care and everybody who was in this who had a skin in the game.  What we took from those lessons was around what one does.  As I said, there is no one way to do this.  It is very complex systems change.  There are many voices in the room and there are problems with different solutions.  Using the business case and the Harvard business model, we took a teaching case and we brought people back into the room and told them what had been learned.  It was not about the lessons learned or about the model.  We said that if one is at a fork in the road and one takes the right turn, there are pluses and minuses to that route and that if one takes the left turn, there are pluses and minuses to that route.  We asked what the least harmful scenario within this was.  It was very much taking a business case and taking people around the country and, prior to Covid, bringing them into that workshop facility.  We had huge sessions with 70 to 100 people from different organisations represented.  For the people in the room it was very real and very raw but they could relate to it.  That relatability is very important when people are in the midst of that change.  It is taking the research and taking the lessons learned but making it very applicable and relevant to people.  It is incremental change, so they are able to do something on Monday morning and are able to enhance that practice.</p> <p>  Through Covid-19 we moved those sessions on to webinars and again we ran six sessions in collaboration with the HSE national office so There is that feedback loop going back continuously.  We found that there is no one way to do this but in order for that to sustain and embed it is incremental changes that get made.  It is not very sexy or overly attractive it is that hard grind a lot of the time on the ground with the people.  However it is the transformation in the lives of the people who are bring supported that reall,y staff have said "I am happy to go to work.  I have hope.  I know my practice was less than and very much less than previously.  But I had an a-ha moment and I am able to move forward with that".  They go on a journey then together.  They leave the congregated setting and a lot of the time we say that is really the start line.  People feel that they have arrived and are there but it is really the starting point in terms of community living and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in particular.  I hope I have answered some of Deputy Cairn's questions.</p> <p>  During Covid-19, we moved those sessions to webinars and we ran six sessions all in collaboration with the HSE national office.  We have that feedback loop going back continuously.  We found there was no one way to do this but for it to be sustained and embedded, incremental changes are made.

Three members from that team worked with us hand in glove, as Dr. Lally said.  We turned up to every meeting together so they picked up all of our tricks of the trade at the same time.  When we set out the criteria for funding, we worked very much in tandem with the HSE.  We said these were the criteria and we asked how these would land with the community health organisations, CHOs, and the senior manager within of each services.  They obviously knew what funding the HSE service providers were getting, so they were able to say when applications came in that they were already getting funding for that and that there was no need to double fund.  Funding was an important aspect of this as well.  I remember going out to one of the services one time.  It said it just could not buy a bus for this.   We said that this was tied to people moving into the community.  We need to be able to track people and see how it is going.</p> <p>  The HSE was involved in the training with us all along.  It came with us on the journey, so it has the skills to continue with this work. As I said in the opening statement, the SSDL training is continuing through the national HSE office and the community practice.  This is an excellent resource to have.</p> <p>  As for people and families who do not want to move, a key thing we ingrained in all the staff was that everybody had the opportunity and chance to work with a staff member in an individualised way and to say what they wanted and that they wanted to explore it.  In the early days, we worked with people who really wanted this and with families who said they wanted a different type of service.  As more  people started to move, other families or individuals who were not maybe as keen said that people had their own house and that they had visited them and asked when they were getting their house and when they could move into the community and do X, Y or Z.  That had a ripple effect.  However, some people said it was not for them and that this was not what they wanted.  Other arrangements were made in terms of moving into other group homes and so on. If there was a HIQA closure order and the building had to close, other arrangements were made.  One thing we said at the outset was that everybody had to have the opportunity to do that one-on-one discovery, or that piece.  That was a key as well, so that nobody got left behind.</p></speech>

She knew of us in Cork, which was good to hear.   In terms of simplifying the services, I would like Ms Buckley to talk about that.  What is really difficult for families, and Ms Buckley will speak about it from experience, is that the search for services and supports and the energy that needs to be put into that.  There are challenges there.  I agree with Deputy Cairns on simplifying the services and maybe Ms Buckley could talk about what it is like on a day-to-day basis trying to find, and get access to, a service.</p> <p>  Ms Cahill will talk about what our model does because we have a wraparound service and we also have that co-ordinated care plan.  We develop a care plan for children, adults and families where they can be signposted to other services.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Cairns's point about collaboration and not duplicating services, Crann has two key founding principles.  We do not duplicate services.  If a service already exists, we do not duplicate it because there is no added value.  Nothing happens or nothing changes for the family; it just adds to that confusion of whether they go to A or B.</p><p>Ms Jarvey commented on the founding of the organisation.  One of our founding principles was that we would not duplicate services.  That has helped us to add value and important services into the mix.  Collaboration is a key principle for us.</p><p> We began offering services in earnest in 2019.  In the beginning when we had a team of two people we recognised we would not be able to do this alone so collaboration was hugely important for us.  We are fortunate to collaborate with Ascend which are attending the committee remotely.  That is an international collaboration which has helped us in giving us a strategic framework.  From the initial contact, we had a ready-made strategic framework which we adapted, so we know the value of collaboration.</p><p> Locally, Ms Cahill and our team collaborate on a day-to-day basis with all the actors in the space offering services and supports for people with disabilities.  Sometimes putting the energy into those collaborations can make a real difference for parents because - Ms Buckley will speak about this - they often do not know where to go next and if we can make a connection for someone through professional contacts, that can alleviate stress.</p><p> In the past three years, we have put a huge amount of energy into developing collaborations with organisations that provide services.  We work with University College Cork, UCC, which gives us access to practical support from the therapy schools.  UCC has helped us to expand our research and in practical ways.  An example of our collaborations with organisations to deliver services involves one of our major initiatives this year when we developed an accessible co-working space for people with disabilities.  As we all know, we have all moved in the past couple of years towards remote working and working either in the home or away from the office.  The Department of Rural and Community Development invested significantly in that area through the National Hub Network.  We looked at that and asked ourselves what we at the Crann Centre could do to provide support and a model where people with disabilities could have access to that new world of work and to the opportunities to collaborate in starting or accelerating their businesses or to work in a business where people want to come together in such a setting.  We were fortunate to be able to collaborate with Cork County Council, Cork City Council, the Open Doors Initiative, Ballincollig Business Association and the rubicon centre at Munster Technological University, MTU.  Through those efforts we managed to bring together a successful co-working space that is purpose designed for people with disabilities.  People with disabilities are now using that space to work in a setting alongside others and grow their businesses.  As we invested energy in collaboration, we were able to make those connections and bring in the local enterprise office.  Sometimes those connections are the key enabler.  Those principles of collaboration, trying to simplify as much as possible and not duplicating services, add value.  Perhaps Ms Buckley can elaborate on that simplification.  It would be interesting to hear the voice of someone who is working in that space every day and trying to find services for her family.</p></speech>

Many appointments were only about the child and when we walked into the Crann Centre, it was as though a light came on.  The entire family was taken care of and looked after.  My daughter was very well taken care of and she participated in many different services.  She gained independence and resilience.  That she would be able to be the best version of herself was important for us as a family.  The setting is wonderful.  It is now the one-stop shop for everything for our family and it is continuing into adulthood.  We are in another time of transition now.  My daughter is in her leaving certificate year and we will be knocking on the door of the Crann Centre for a long time to come.</p></speech>

We work with the whole family and the Crann Centre does not have an exit strategy.  We do not discharge people at any point.  They can come in and out of services and avail of them as needed.  That is the beauty of the service we offer and of our model of care.  In the generational approach, we support one generation who will support the other generation and that has a ripple effect.  That is all.  Ms Buckley has said it.  We are the wraparound service.</p></speech>

Ms Buckley's family lives in the country.  Transport and accessing services is a significant part of the work for all of us.</p> <p>  As Ms Jarvey said, isolation is a significant issue for families, especially for children, teenagers and adults with a disability, whether in a congregated setting or in the home.  We provide the simplest of programmes where we bring people together for a summer camp or to take part in our successful drama group that meets every Saturday morning.  The drama group works with both children and adults with disabilities and the facilitators find that the value is not so much that participants are learning how to excel in Hollywood or on Broadway, but that they have the opportunity to come together and be around peers.  They value that more than anything else.  It is also an opportunity for parents to come together, so one simple activity such as the theatre group has a multiplier effect.  The child or adult has the opportunity to participate, their confidence and networking skills grow, they learn how build social capital from an early age but, most important, for the parents who drop them off or choose to stay around, there is a significant upside for them because they get the opportunity to meet people like me, or I mean like-minded parents rather than people like me.  The opportunity for people to come together, share experiences and grow is of huge value.  The rural challenges that were mentioned are significant.  Isolation is a real issue for many people but it is more pronounced in rural settings.</p></speech>

It has been interesting to hear about the work of the Crann Centre and Genio.  I must applaud Ms Jarvey for her incredible benevolence.  I wish we had more people like her.</p> <p>  We all understand from the research that there is strong evidence to show that people with disabilities lives improve when they move to more home-like settings.  That is the big challenge.  Approximately three or four years ago a friend of mine who was director of nursing in a congregated setting told me a story.  A young man who had only known this setting all of his life was in tears and the staff had to physically try to put him in a taxi to bring him to a new place.  All of the staff were crying.  He and all the staff members were bereft.  While it clearly works in most cases, we must be cognisant of those who wish to stay.</p><p>It is all about that choice.  <br/><br/>I come from County Kildare and I have seen evidence from the new community settings through the work of Care and the Muiriosa Foundation.  Most of those houses are in Rathangan, Monasterevin and Newbridge.  The integration has been top class, particularly in Rathangan and Monasterevin, because they are small communities.  That is so important and hats off to the community because it is about that cultural shift and about hearts and minds.  It is so important.<br/><br/>Going back to the drama Mr. Mallon spoke about, in Kildare Youth Theatre we are lucky to have drama for people, particularly young people, with intellectual disabilities.  We have a Hollywood star.  Conor O'Donnell, a young man with Down's syndrome from Newbridge, is in &quot;Bad Sisters&quot;.  I know his family very well and was on that metaphorical journey but could not tell anybody when he was going over and back to England to participate.  I completely agree that it is just phenomenal how people's lives can change through those opportunities.<br/><br/>My questions are about new types of service delivery around individualised supports and personalised budgets and how that can help.  The Independent Living Movement Ireland, ILMI, and Inclusion Ireland spoke at a previous meeting about the really difficult application process for people with disabilities and the fact it is different in every county.  It is not transparent and it is very repetitive and complicated.<i></i>I find form filling complicated.  How can we have uniformity and make Government services more accessible?<br/><br/>I love the two-generation, 2Gen, approach at the Crann Centre.  As for independent living, there is independent living within a house in the community but there is also independent living staying within a family setting and that is where the complications arise from a rural point of view, which Ms Buckley talked about.  How can we ensure that we support the individual and the family, particularly in situations where parents are older and in their 70s and 80s?  Quite often it is older women who have been widowed and have one child with a disability.  There may be a family network around the person but it is still so important that if that is the best place for that person, they have all of the wraparound services.  I think that is where we need to be going and that is why I really like what witnesses are doing.  Could they outline how they decide what supports a family receives?<br/><br/>My last question is about what ILMI and Inclusion Ireland said here about the recommendation that 7.5% of all new social and affordable housing be ring-fenced for disabled people.  They are also looking for a centralised list so it would not just be county-by-county.  Do witnesses have any thoughts or recommendations they could make on that?</p></speech>

Quite a few staff from there undertook the SSDL training and the community connector training, so I would be very aware of those services.  What strikes me about the specific services the Senator mentioned is that there is an ongoing community of practice for the staff, so it is not just the move and then everything is left.  It is very evident from the data we gather.  That ongoing support is very important.  Some 973 front-line staff, managers and families have completed SSDL training to date and that has been accredited through Athlone Institute.</p> <p>  It is not one-size-fits-all.  There needs to be a menu of options so that when front-line staff are supporting individuals, they can look at what that person needs.  We start with the person and work outwards as opposed saying we have a house and they need to fit in there.  We all know that type of service delivery does not work.  In terms of the support we have heard about, some people move back to their family home and are supported that way.  There is an array of different types of community living supports available.  However, I agree with Senator O'Loughlin that it is very important we have that drop-down menu of options, so that individuals can make an informed choice and sample things as well.  I remember when I was at the front line a man wanted to live in an apartment and I kept exploring it with him.  When he moved to an apartment, it did not work.  The reason it did not work was that he only wanted to move to an apartment because all the nurses who worked with him lived in apartments.  He was from the west and ended up living in a wee country house that was very similar to his home, so that was a lesson to me around exploring the reasons.</p> <p>  Services hold a lot of the moneys as well. They get a large amount of funding and they need to unbundle that funding to suit the individual needs of the people they support.  Personalised budgets were mentioned and some people want to have more control over their budget, so that option should be available to people if they want to explore that.  It gives people more choice and control over their life if that is what they want to do.</p></speech>

Crann does not operate like that.  We do not have a residential setting as such.  We come from a different approach.  The families we work with are predominantly with a physical as opposed to intellectual disability.  However, at the same time, life skills from a young age are really important.  Our programmes are designed to give them life skills in terms of budget management and being able to make a sandwich for themselves, or the life skills and adaptions that might be needed within their environment to ensure they can cope.  Kitchens and so on can be set up in such a way.  If one is a wheelchair user, one needs the counter to be at a certain height, so it can be accessed.  They are the types of things but we work with the whole family on that.</p> <p>  Senator O'Loughlin talked about how we decide what a family needs.  It is very much based on our two-generation approach.  Based on our model, in our intake process, we very much look at what they want and we ask them.  The stakeholders lead our services and we very much follow.  They talk about what they want and we look at how we can support them to meet the needs they want for their life goals.  As was said, people might not all want to leave home and might be quite happy to stay with their mammies or whatever.  It is working towards what they want.</p> <p>  One thing we are working towards is talking to the families about end-of-life and about whether they have thought about what happens to their child or adult in terms of inheritance and who is going to care for them.  We have those conversations and we do that from a legal perspective but they are educational sessions.  We refer some of what arises out of that to other services which are a better fit to look at supported living for them.</p></speech>

I will start by saying it has been a really fascinating and important conversation.  I also support people with disabilities living in the community.  It is an invaluable way of empowering people to realise their full potential.  I have experience of that in my constituency where we have Stewarts Care and Peamount Healthcare which do incredible work empowering people with disabilities to live both in congregated settings but also, critically, in community-based settings.</p> <p>  I listened to Senator O'Loughlin talk about the Hollywood star in her constituency.  We do not have a Hollywood star that I am aware of but I know that one of our Stewarts small screen stars appeared on "First Dates Ireland" recently.  It is fantastic to see things like that.  It is a real glimmer into people's day-to-day lives.</p> <p>  Crann sounds like an incredible organisation and while I was so pleased to hear of what it is doing in terms of training and supports from a continence perspective for special needs assistants, SNAs, and teachers, I was also disappointed because I cannot believe this is falling to it and that it is not Government-funded.</p><p>How can we offer that level of training right around the country?  What funding do we need?  Is it something that Crann could roll out?  Is it something that we would need to do in partnership with others?  It is soul destroying to think that the State does not provide SNAs with the necessary training to support some of the children they are working with, or that nurses require additional training that is not provided by the State in order to facilitate respite care.  I would love to get under the hood of that and what we need to do to rectify it.</p><p> I was particularly interested to hear Ms Buckley speak about the transition period when her child was starting secondary school, and starting in a wheelchair.  The supports provided were such a benefit to her, to her child and to the entire family in terms of the mobility programme, including the confidence training which every young person could benefit from.  It got me thinking.  It is probably an ideal world scenario but does she think it would be helpful or beneficial if we could pinpoint particular periods in people's lives that are likely to be key transition areas - for example, if they are starting secondary school, if they are moving to a wheelchair as the result of disability and or if their family is separating?  Unfortunately, in many people's lives there are going to be many key traumatic experiences in childhood.  Maybe we could map those a little better and increase service support at that time.  It strikes me from Ms Buckley's experience as something that might have a long-term and lasting impact.  I know she benefitted from wraparound supports that unfortunately not every family has, but I think her testimony has shown why it is so valuable and why we need to reach a point where every family gets that.</p><p> With reference to 2Gen, the research cases and analyses are always most compelling and it is really fascinating to hear what the witnesses had to say.  In terms of Genio, it also works so well when projects are built around the need and the voice of the client.  I would be interested to hear what the key challenges are but also what advice the witnesses would give to the committee, which has the opportunity to put the relevant Ministers under pressure from time to time.  What advice would the witnesses give us to try and help our public services to be better at this?  We know the constraints in terms of resourcing, retention and recruitment of talent.  What specific advice would they give us that we could pressure the Minister with to try to increase this area to make it better?</p><p> My question for Crann is really around support for SNAs and teachers, and what it is already providing and how it could roll that out further.  For Ms Buckley, my question is about that transition period and whether in an ideal world it would be worth mapping out those peak periods of stress, so we could support people better.  I apologise if people can hear my office phone ringing in the background.</p></speech>

That is a big focus for us in Crann.  Our transition through life stages from toddler to child and our education and career pathways module in our service offering speaks to that and it is an area on which we are putting a lot of emphasis and focus in terms of support.  We find in many cases that transitions in school are instrumental in life for any of us, not just for those with a disability.  Transitions are huge.  Having extra supports feeds into the training of the teachers and SNAs.  Teachers work really hard in schools but do not often get released in terms of doing modules and understanding the needs of a child with a disability in the class, because they have so many different disabilities.  You are talking about physical disabilities and the needs of a physical disability, and then the learning needs as well.  We are addressing some of that through some of the transition pieces within our education piece, but a lot more needs to happen on that nationally as well.</p> <p>  Coming back to the Deputy's question with regard to continence and SNA training, and the teachers and the nursing training, she was right and I agree it is a bit disappointing that it is falling to us in Crann to deliver that.  At the same time, we need to be fair and acknowledge that the nursing services and those providing training and supports in terms of continence and so on to families do a fantastic job.  I have come from that background, so I know you do your best in that environment but you have big lists and you have a lot to do.  The difference with what we are providing is that we are able to tailor it.  We understand the families we work with, so we are able to deliver that training.  For the SNAs and teachers, that training is really specified.  They get the extra layer of support that maybe in a hospital setting you might not be able to give because there is such demand on the services across many different areas.  All support to roll it out nationally would be greatly appreciated by Crann.  We would love that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-20a.626" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Padraig Mallon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022102000002#M00600"><p>It may be helpful to quantify and put some money on it to provide some context.  Our current continence service is provided by two nurses working 1.5 whole-time equivalents.  They share the role and we can provide the service in CHO 4 for just under &euro;175,000.  To amplify and increase the service next year, we are looking at about &euro;210,000.  To move to three whole-time equivalents would cost just under &euro;300,000.  The number of families we could reach with that would be really significant because the demand is huge.  As Ms Cahill said, for every family that has a child with a physical disability, particularly a neuro-physical disability and is in a wheelchair, issues of continence and self-management are going to be one of the primary concerns.  We can significantly impact on that through our service, so it is really cost-effective.  Our social return on investment tells us that for every &euro;1 we spend, the stakeholders tell us that they are going to receive &euro;4 in value.  Not only is it effective but it is cost-effective.  We can demonstrate and are happy to prove the value of it and our stakeholders will tell you that it has a high value for them.</p></speech>

As we said in our opening statement, we have presented a business case to the HSE locally for this.  It is very supportive but it is a matter of funding.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has been very supportive but we need to move it along because, as we said in our opening statement, this year the service is going to serve 260 families.  We are without funding for this service.  We are highly concerned that we will be able to continue.  Ms Cahill has demonstrated the value and innovation of it and how we are working with SNAs.  The multiplier of working with an SNA in a school, where several children have a disability, means the reach of that back into the family home is really significant.</p><p>Yes, it is a significant issue that it is not being offered elsewhere but Crann is set up to offer it.  We do not currently receive any annual statutory funding for any of our services.  That is a situation which we are really keen to change.  Being here today affords a real opportunity to raise these issues but one can also see how practical it is.  For less than &euro;200,000, 260 families get really intensive, practical support which enables them to enjoy better health and wellbeing, opportunities to participate in society and a huge increase in quality of life.  This applies not just to the person with the disability but also to their family.  As Ms Jarvey mentioned earlier, self-management really is a human rights issue.  The capacity to be able to manage one's own continence goes to the core of a person's being.  It really governs a person's opportunities for equitable participation in society.  In terms of money well-spent, this would be really significant to us and would deliver huge value for money.</p><p> To come back to the transitions, this year we were delighted to receive funding through SOLAS and the mitigating against educational disadvantage fund, which is a really important one.  We have submitted an application to work with the Cork Education and Training Board on an initiative which, thankfully, it saw the value of.  It focuses on mentoring and supports parents and students to give them the right support at key points of transition.  Most importantly, that mentoring helps the parents and students to make the best and the right choices for themselves.  It also enables them to understand that their disability does not necessarily need to limit them in education.  We have been able to deliver supports for 15 learners and their families and we will have the data that will evidence the effectiveness of that coming through over the next couple of months.</p></speech>

There are always lots of challenges.  We were fortunate to have been learning from our demonstration project back from 2008 to 2013.  We could see from those initial small grants what worked and what did not work.  When we moved into the service reform fund phase, we scaled up the programmes in </p> <p>terms of looking at the larger institutions and supporting that work.  What Genio brought to the table was private funding.  We were able to set out in terms of the conditions what we wanted and that was the voice of the service user and bringing improvement to their lives.</p> <p>  When we sat down to look at an invitation for funding to go out to the services, we sat down with the HSE.  The two areas that were awarded the most funding were the stakeholder engagement piece and sustainability.  In terms of the stakeholder engagement piece, people applying to the fund had to illustrate how they conducted the stakeholder engagement and how they worked within their community healthcare organisation, CHO, or within their service on what people wanted.  In terms of sustainability, we could not allow people to move to new living arrangement where they did not have the funding worked out at a local level.  This was quite challenging.</p> <p>  This was huge shock to the system for many organisations in terms of having to talk to finance and HR within their own service.  We were quite adamant that these were the things that we would not budge on.  When the applications for funding came in, there was a grants committee, made up of the funding partners and family members.  These applications were scrutinised very heavily and not everybody got funding.  We had people calling us to say they did not get funding and that they wanted to be on the list.  Some services said they needed to be on the list to be seen to be doing well but our response was that they did not demonstrate how they were doing that through the application process.  They also had to detail in their budget what they were going to spend the money on and how many lives were going to be impacted.  These were all challenges.  The way we overcame them was in terms of the private funding.</p> <p>  We lifted the rock people often do not want to lift around unions and how congregated services can be dismantled.  We did this in partnership with the HSE and at all times we had it with us on this journey.  There were difficult conversations.  Sometimes we had to ask for money to come back because a service was not employing the community connectors to do the piece of work that was agreed on.  We had grant conditions and contracts with each of the services.  We outlined the conditions and one of these was training where services sent their best and brightest and their champions of change on SSDL training.</p> <p>  What happened very quickly was that two teams developed within the services.  The change team was ring-fenced to do the work.  This was not an add-on to the everyday job.  Everybody was so stressed in their normal day-to-day job so the change teams led out in this new way of working.  One could very quickly see the benefits for the individuals.</p> <p>  I refer to the visits.  I remember the first visits we went on everybody was almost rolling out the red carpet.  It was not meant to be like that.  It was more of a support visit in terms of how could we help.  From those visits around the country, we could hear that people were all saying the same thing.  They had now employed many connectors but they did not know how to support them within their structures.  They said they needed training and to be connected to other services.</p> <p>  Pre-Covid, services did day visits to each other to learn from one another.  People came in and told their own stories.  We started to video some of these and captured the journey of people.  It was not all roses.  An awful lot of heavy lifting had to be done but it was done in partnership, with the service user at the centre of that.</p></speech>

I also thank Ms Haight and Ms Toze who joined us from Washington DC.  We are delighted they joined us and gave us their insights.  My job is to wrap up the meeting and to thank the witnesses for coming before us.</p> <p>  The discussion we had was on supporting people with disabilities leaving their communities.  The most important thing is the lived experience and Ms Buckley gave us that in a very sincere way and we thank her for that.  It is not easy for families to put on the public record the challenges they face.  The witnesses gave a sense of thinking outside the box and challenging the different silos.</p> <p>  I picked up on a couple of words.  The 2Gen model is so important because we need to have a family focus.  The social model is important because for so long, people with disabilities were treated under a medical model.  A social model is so important for society as a whole in terms of integration.  Those were the challenges.</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about the training of SNAs.  It is a huge indictment on the State that there is not a service there.  That is a basic human right for kids when they are going to school.  That is something that we will continue to raise and reflect on.  I refer to the silos, the flexibility and the greater social good, which is to ensure people with disabilities are integrated into society.  It is not just the person with the disability; it is their families and their communities.  Some communities can be absolutely fantastic while others do not embrace it as much.  Our challenge is to do that.</p> <p>  I have been working with Crann over the last few months.  I think Mr. Mallon rang me on a Friday afternoon in February.  Much has been achieved.  Deputy Higgins mentioned the Stewarts project.  There is one common thread between the Stewarts project and Crann and that is Mr. David Doyle, who is consulting with the Stewarts project in developing the equine centre.  We are eternally grateful to the Crann Centre for the sponsorship of the land.  We cannot say enough about what has been done for us.  It is going to be a very exciting project and a fantastic project for the CHO 4 and for the area.  Both Crann and the Stewarts project should continue to challenge the system.</p> <p>  I refer to the various mindsets in regard to people with disabilities.</p><p>In the late 1960s when community groups and organisations came together to set up the section 38 and 39 organisations, that was one of the major developments for people with disabilities, but it is now time to further challenge the situation.  I urge the organisations to keep challenging the system.  The committee is charged with trying to make the lives, families and communities of people with disabilities better.  We hope that we do that every Thursday morning.  We will continue to do so.  I sincerely thank all the witnesses for coming today.  They gave us very enlightened information and a lot on which to ponder as we continue with this module of engagement on the UNCRDP.</p><p> Members are practising bilocation every Thursday morning.  At one stage, they are in the Chamber and at another stage they are sitting here.  Sometimes we might wonder, but when members come on they know every single thing that has happened in the meeting, so they are listening to the meeting while they are doing something else.  I thank members for their continued effort.  It is only through the strength of the questions from our members and the genuine interest they have in the subject matter that our committee can be strong.  I urge them to them to keep up the good work, although I know they have competing challenges.  I also thank our team who keep us all on the straight and narrow and keep things ticking over.</p></speech>
