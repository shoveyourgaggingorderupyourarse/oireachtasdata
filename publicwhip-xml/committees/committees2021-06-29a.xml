You are all very welcome to the meeting this morning.  We received your opening statement and it has already been circulated to members.  We are limited on time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions.  The committee has agreed that the opening statement will be taken as read so that we can use the full session for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website, and publicly available.</p> <p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting who are in locations outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I now invite questions from members.  Deputy Collins was first to indicate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#A00500"><p>I thank the committee for creating a slot so that we could bring in the SFPA this morning.  This is something I have called for since it previously attended the committee and I welcome our witnesses.  There is a crisis in the fishing industry which has been going on for quite some time.  In the past 12 months, in particular, we have stumbled from one crisis to another, leading to what we have seen in Cork and Dublin, that is, peaceful protests, but great anger.</p> <p>  There is a very strong belief within the fishing industry that the SFPA and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are not fit for purpose, and we must, as a committee, try to bridge that gap between the industry and the SFPA and others.  There needs to be a rebuilding of relationships and the only way that this is possible is if we try to have monthly meetings with the SFPA to iron out issues that need to be ironed out.</p> <p>  The attempted ramming - I accept this is not what this session is about - of a vessel off the coast at Castletownbere, by a Spanish-registered vessel which was illegally fishing in our waters, raises the question as to why it took so long to get a Naval Service ship to the rescue of the fishing crew from Castletownbere.  Why did it take so long to arrest the skipper?  What are the procedures when an Irish boat is attacked in its own waters?  Why is there no protection for Irish fishermen?  If it was the other way around and if an Irish boat had acted in the way this Spanish one had, the feeling out there is that there would have been much swifter action.  Why do Irish fishermen feel abandoned?</p> <p>  I have quite a lot of questions, but I respect that I have only so much time because other members need to get in.  I will ask questions and perhaps the SFPA will be able to answer a number of them.  Maybe I will get in again later, but if not I will write to the SFPA and submit questions to it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#A00700"><p>When you hear how many questions I have, you might be in shock.</p> <p>  I will go through as many as I can and maybe I will come back in later so as to give other members a chance.  On the weighing crisis, the SFPA submitted a draft new control plan in December 2020 and again in 2021 further information was submitted.  This was four or five months before any control plan was revoked.  Was that the case?  What was going on here?  The SFPA did this without consulting the industry.  It never told the industry why.  In its evidence the last time it appeared before the committee, the SFPA said it consulted continuously with the industry.  I can not understand why the SFPA did not give some indication that there was a problem and start working towards a solution.</p> <p>  Did the SFPA inform the Minister at this time?  Did it share a copy of this plan with anybody, a group or a Department official?  Did the SFPA inform the Department?  Why did the SFPA consider it necessary to submit this draft control plan?  There is no evidence that anyone asked it to do it.  Has the SFPA shared this draft control plan with the industry, since it has become public knowledge just four weeks ago?</p> <p>  When did the SFPA get the initial reply back from the European Commission following it completing the 2019 administrative inquiry?  Was any of that correspondence shared with the Minister or the Department?  Why did the SFPA confirm the findings of the 2018 audit with the European Union to the administrative inquiry especially when, at that time and since then, the details or contents of these investigations have still not been shared with the industry?  The Commissioner stated the SFPA confirmed the findings of the audit reference to the letter of 13 April, informing it that the control plan is revoked.  It stated the SFPA confirmed the findings.  Was that wise?</p> <p>  Does the SFPA think it is fair that sanctions are imposed on the entire fishing industry and yet not one fisherman has seen any evidence or any information that has been compiled by the 2018 audit or the 2019 administrative inquiry, which the SFPA carried out?  Why withhold evidence and yet proceed to punish an entire sector?  Has the SFPA written to the European Union seeking the information to be shared with the fishing industry?  Did the SFPA share a copy of this 2018 audit with an NGO such as BirdWatch Ireland, or other such organisations?  Where are the details regarding the contents of the 2018 audit coming from?  Is there an internal discipline problem in the SFPA?  Internal leaks are out of control.</p> <p>  The last time the SFPA was before the Oireachtas committee it stated that the decision to revoke the plan came as a shock to the SFPA.  How credible is that statement now, if four months earlier it was submitting a draft control plan to the European Commission?  Has the SFPA made a blunder on the basis of the information it shared with the European Union as part of the 2019 administrative inquiry?</p><p> Record-keeping in the SFPA, according to the 2020 PwC report, is poor, or non-existent.  Did the SFPA make the Minister aware of any correspondence in the run-up to April 2021?  Does the SFPA accept that this is sharp practice, first, not advising that it submitted a plan and, second, leading us to believe that the decision to revoke the control plan was a shock, while all the time the SFPA was exchanging plans and correspondence with the European Union for months in advance of that.  </p><p> Does the SFPA accept that submitting a control plan is in fact a matter for the Minister?  Does the SFPA accept that it is the Minister who submits the plan to the European Union as per statutory position?  Since the revoking of the plan on 13 April 2021, the official at European Union level dealing with Irish queries was not available, being either on leave, or having left, or so the SFPA informed the industry last week.  How long was the position vacant?  While it was vacant, who was the SFPA liaising with, and since when?  Why has it taken 77 days, or two months and 16 days, to get to a position where finally it is accepted that a control plan is being submitted for all fisheries, shellfish, whitefish and pelagic fish?  When will this plan find its way to the European Commission?</p><p> Realistically, we need to be fair and open here.  Ireland could be without a control plan for another six to 13 months.  That has the potential to take in two landing seasons.  Does the SFPA realise the chaos this will cause?  Submitting the new control plan to Brussels does not fix it for fishermen, because they still have to operate the weighing piers until such time as the submitted control plan is accepted by the EU and every coastal state.  That could take months.  Has the SFPA submitted an interim plan to allow the weighing in factories?  It was able to submit a draft plan earlier without advising anyone.  Has the SFPA addressed the crisis of having no plan at European level?  If not, this madness will continue for months, leading to the destruction of the Irish fishing industry.</p><p> We do not accept that the SFPA cannot do this.  If the SFPA had appealed the original implementation decision on 13 April, it would have acted to save the industry.  It would have negotiated the position for Irish fishermen.  That decision, of 13 April 2021, should have been appealed.  It was a savage attack on the Irish fishing industry by the EU.  It was blunt and draconian.  It nailed every sector of the Irish fishing industry.</p><p> The SFPA and the Government have an opportunity now, after all that has happened, to rebuild a relationship with the industry and put in place measures to allow the fishing industry to restore normality in fish processing, by making a case for restoring weighing in factories before the delay in getting the plan adopted by the EU.  Reason needs to prevail.  Weighing whitefish and shellfish in the open air is not practical or sensible.</p><p> On 4 June 2021, the SFPA lost a case in the High Court, taken by the industry for the right to use a weighing machine at the pier in Killybegs.  The  industry paid for this device.  Costs were awarded against the SFPA.  That has a potential cost to the State of about &euro;500,000 to &euro;600,000.  Why was the case allowed to go ahead?  Mr. Justice Simons found that the SFPA acted unlawfully.  That is a damning judgment against the SFPA.  Is the SFPA going to have an internal examination on this issue?  Does the SFPA believe, that as Ireland's chosen, competent authority, responsible both for the implementation of the European Common Fisheries Policy and the regulation of sea fisheries and seafood production, it is able to carry out its duties as the competent authority to protect the quality of seafood and to ensure it is fit for human consumption by providing a health certificate for seafood?  Would the SFPA agree that the current practice of weighing fish on the pier degrades the quality of fish?</p><p> Thank you, Chairman, for your patience.</p></speech>

However, I am going to give you the opportunity to answer questions raised by Deputy Collins.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Susan Steele" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chair.  I think I have notes on all of the questions apart from the fourteenth question.  I thank Deputy Collins for the invitation to come back so quickly.  I am aware of the issues in the fishing industry.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to the committee and address some of the questions.  Deputy Collins mentioned that he was going to write to the SFPA.  The SFPA would like to extend an invitation to him, as we are based in Clonakilty not far from the Deputy.  He will always be welcome.  We prioritise meetings with Members of the Oireachtas and the fishing industry.  We are very happy to attend those meetings.</p> <p>  If I miss questions, I apologise.  We will come back to the Deputy in writing.  We are happy to go through a number of the questions.  Starting with the control plan, and the draft control plan, when the SFPA was responding to the 2018 and the following on administrative inquiry, as part of that work there were draft control plans.  They were for discussion with the Commission rather than a control plan that was being submitted.</p> <p>  One question was about how a control plan is submitted.  The key thing is that the control plan is submitted through the SFPA.  We have discussed this, and this was what happened previously in 2012.  It is absolutely essential for Ireland that we have a new control plan.  Following the revocation of the control plan, the SFPA prioritised working with the industry to bring into compliance its situation of weighing at landing and then working on control plan submission.</p> <p>  Initially the SFPA drafted and went for public consultation, which ended on 18 June 2021, for a control plan that covered all demersal landings and excluded pelagic landings.  The decision to consult without pelagic landings was undertaken, as they are the risk scenario singled out for enhanced controls with the Commission implementing regulation.  The intention was to submit the control plan in order to deal with the current issues which are being experienced by the demersal fishers with weighing prior to transport.  However, following the consultation process and consideration of the submissions to the consultation process, the authority decided that the greater than ten-tonne boat pelagic landings will be included in the control plan.</p> <p>  The SFPA is prioritising the development of a revised plan that acknowledges the specific risks that have been identified and led to the Commission's decision to revoke the previous plan and provide enhanced controls.  This will not be fast, however.  The commission and the Ireland desk are going to work with us on the reviews, and we will be working closely with them to ensure the plan provides the assurances they require to minimise the risk of systematic manipulation of weighing pelagic catches in Ireland, and under-declaration of catches by operators that are highlighted in the decision to revoke the plan.</p> <p>  The SFPA is prioritising this and aims for a submission as soon as possible.  The Commission review time will be a minimum of ten weeks following the submission of the documents.  As the Deputy said, the SFPA is looking at the pelagic fishery and the ongoing fisheries for the demersal without a control plan.  There is a pelagic working group working with the SFPA to look at the practicalities going forward.  That is in answer to the first question.</p> <p>  Regarding the administrative inquiry, and the questions on who was informed and with whom the information was shared, as the SFPA went to the administrative inquiry, the correspondence from the Commission was with Ireland, not with the SFPA.  The Department and the Minister were aware of the status of the administrative inquiry.  The responses to the administrative inquiry have also been sent to the Department.</p><p>We informed the industry in consultative committee and other meetings that we were meeting with them and there were significant concerns being raised as part of the administrative inquiry and of the audit.  Those are in response to the Deputy's questions Nos. 1 to 5.  With regard to the sharing of the audit and the audit findings, we have put it in our opening statement and said it the last time we were in front of the committee.  We always have it formally on record we believe it would be of benefit for all EU member states' audits to be public.  This happens in other areas in the Commission but not in the Directorate General, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, DG MARE.  That is written into the opening statement and I reiterate it here.  However, we will follow in with the Commission on this and the responses and the audit from the commission is its material so we will not be sharing it until the commission does.</p><p> Before I move on to other questions, I think I have taken Nos. 1 to 7 there, I am not sure if Mr. Kinneen or Mr. O'Mahony have anything they want to add in there.</p></speech>

Deputy Michael Collins has offered us a lot of questions there and we have taken note of them.  I repeat the invitation to him and to other members of the committee.  The committee will be aware that section 68 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 is explicit with regard to the duty the authority has to account for the performance of our functions to the committee.  We are happy to engage with it at any time and any level to hear members' concerns or what they might wish to offer us on how we might do our job better.  To reiterate that, there is a statutory basis for our relationship.  We like to show the committee every respect in terms of our attendance here and we view it as a privilege to have an opportunity to put our position on different matters on the record.  We are very happy to engage, just to confirm what Dr. Steele has been saying to the committee on that point.</p> <p>  There are a lot of issues of concern to the industry at the moment, many of which we are aware of through bilateral meetings with industry representatives.  Deputy Michael Collins has mentioned the public and peaceful protest conducted by the industry to get public recognition for the many pressures it has.  Some of them are wider than our remit but very much part of that has been the industry's concerns coming out of the issues with the control plan, the absence of a control plan currently and having that in place.  We are doing everything we can in terms of having a credible - and it is very important it is credible - control plan to present to the Commission as quickly as possible.  We have now established a channel for this work, whereby we can work bilaterally with the Commission on the development and improvement of the control plan without adversely affecting the other bilateral discussions taking place between Ireland and the Commission with regard to the administrative inquiry and the potential for the clawback of alleged under-declared landings and so on.</p> <p>  For the Deputy's information, it is not that we have endorsed the Commission's findings wholesale.  We have taken issue with some of its conclusions and methodologies that apply to doing calculations of the quantity of under-declared fish.  We have offered advice to our parent Department, and by that route to the Commission, on where we perceive there may be shortcomings in the reliance of the Commission on dipping data to extrapolate our potential alleged under-declaration of our landings.  There have been certain issues that are a matter of fact.  We have spoken to the committee about some of these in the past.  These include the proven case of weighing systems being interfered with and that has been tested in a court of law and is a fact.  Along with other matters, which are a matter of record, as well, we have, as we are required to do under Community law, co-operated with the Commission in providing it with the data it requested on the details of pelagic landings into Ireland over a six-year time period.  We had no discretion in that matter.  We felt it was in Ireland's interests overall to engage with Commission and provide that data, which is a matter of record anyway, on the landings and on the ancillary information our front-line officers would have gathered when attending those landings.  It is not as if we put a rubber stamp on the Commission's view of Ireland or what its audits are.  It is much more nuanced than that.  We have always tried to ensure there is accurate information in place.</p> <p>  I support Dr. Steele's view that we are in a position where we are following.  For the most part the correspondence from the Commission has been from the Commissioner to the Minister.  We have not been at liberty to divulge that while matters are in process, particularly the discussions on estimated alleged under-declared fish.  What we have done is offer every assistance both directly to the Commission and to our Minister to ensure they have the best technical information we can provide as to the reliability or otherwise of certain methodologies.  We hope we have been honest brokers in this.  We are not at liberty to divulge this into the public arena at this stage but we have offered opinion where we felt something needed to be corrected or where there needed to be counterbalancing information.  We have done everything we can to make sure that has been the case.  As I said, we have established a direct route with a Commission official and officials to work on the development of Ireland's control plan.  There have discussions already with that individual and they have covered a wide range of issues that are of concern to the Commission at this stage and that would have to be attended to in our control plan, as we submit that to the Commission, so that it would be credible and be deemed worthy of consideration and approval.  There are a wide range of issues there, such as the Commission wanting us - which was not entirely the case with the earlier control plan - to adopt a risk-management approach to how we resource and systemise our control in the major ports and so on.</p> <p>  I do not know if we are in a position to comment to the Deputy on the vacancy in the Commission except I can confirm that up to a certain point, when dealing with the audit and the administrative inquiry we were dealing with a particular Commission official.  That official's tenure at the Commission came to an end.  I cannot give the Deputy dates; I am not privy to the internal workings of the Commission.  That individual's contract came to an end with the Commission and they have now been replaced with another individual and we are liaising directly with them to ensure we are dealing with matters as they are arising.  I welcome and hear the Deputy's comment on rebuilding relationships.  Part of that rebuilding is for us to offer what we sincerely believe to be true.  In our meetings with the industry, its representatives have tried to be constructive and creative regarding solutions that might address the situation Ireland finds itself in with regard to the absence of a control plan.  We have listened carefully to what they have been saying to us but we are somewhat at a loss in that there are no provisions in the Community legislation that we are aware of that provide for transitional arrangements, a quasi-control plan or whatever it might be.</p><p>It is an on-off switch in terms of the legislation that is there.  There is either a control plan with sampling plans inside it that provides for the weighing of fish after transport or there is not.  If there is no control plan in place, we will go back to the default position where all fish must be weighed before transport.  We have tried to mitigate the effect that has had on the industry.  We are very conscious of it thanks to the feedback we received during consultation and meetings we had with those working in the industry.  </p><p> The effect on the industry is not universal.  We are not saying there is no effect but it differs in different scenarios.  For example, for landings into our major fishery harbours such as Castletownbere, Dingle, Rossaveal, Killybegs, Dunmore East and Howth, much of the weighing of fish is taking place as it did heretofore under the control plan insomuch that we have defined a footprint area of the harbour in which fish can be weighed.  To give an example of what the practice might be, in Castletownbere much of the fish is being weighed in the weighing systems of the co-operative, which are hygienic, covered, proper and, in every way what people would desire to manage and handle fish of this quality.  </p><p> As you move away from the major harbours, there is a greater impact on smaller operators.  We concede that and have done a lot of work with these groups to see how we might help them.  As part of that work, we looked at what equipment operators are using to weigh fish and engaged the expertise of the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, to see how we might help them to get type-approved systems in place and so on.  I emphasise to the Deputy that there is an effect on the practices of the industry.  We have not come to the committee to claim that the de-icing and re-icing of fish is good for quality fish.  We were before the committee previously and we dealt with that matter then too.  We are trying to help the industry to deal with what has to be managed at the moment.</p><p> We would not like to leave the committee with the impression that members of the SFPA are attending every landing and standing over people to make them tip out their fish and so on.  That is not the way we do business.  In fact, we try to adopt a supportive and de-escalated approach, given the suddenness of these arrangements having to be put in place on foot of the Commission's decision to rescind Ireland's control plan.  I will leave it there.  I am sure we will come back to these matters as we speak to the committee.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Susan Steele" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#D00300"><p>I apologise to the Chair.  I only dealt with questions Nos. 1 to 8 and a number of questions are outstanding.  Mr. Kinneen has answered some of them but, if it is okay, there are a few more I will address.</p> <p> Question No. 8 was about the administrative inquiry and whether it looks like we agreed with it due to the language used.  I will state for the record that the agreement was reached through the information provided, which was substantial information to the Commission rather than an agreement by the organisation.  It is a discussion we have had with industry many times but it is just to be aware that that is the language.</p> <p>  On the question of whether we shared the audit with any NGOs or were there any leaks, I assure members that the SFPA takes its data duties incredibly seriously.  If we have leaks, we will look at them.  As we also take our protected disclosures and the whistleblower Act seriously, the answer to that question is "No".  There has been no sharing of the audit or breaching of any confidences by the SFPA.</p> <p>  On the decision to revoke the plan and how this was communicated, it is a matter of EU law and accepted within Irish policy that the ultimate decision maker allowing post-transport weighing is the Commission.  EU law does not delegate that to member states.  The Commission's powers are not qualified by consultation or advance notification obligations and, therefore, since the day of approval of the control plan the risk of its revocation has existed.  The SFPA forewarned the sea-fisheries consultative committee that the derogation was at serious risk.  The SFPA has also frequently emphasised to Irish operators the overall precariousness or, at least, the non-automatic nature of the derogation.  In many of the audits by DG Mare since 2012, the risk of post-transport derogations facing jeopardy was made explicit.  The potential for a post-transport weigh derogation has been clearly to the fore in all the SFPA cyclic discussions with the pelagic industry.  On notifying the industry of the Commission's decision to revoke the control plan, we began consultations with the industry immediately following publication by the Commission of its decision.  We ask Members of the Oireachtas to understand that, as a regulator, we operate within existing regulations and decisions and not in a speculative manner regarding them. </p> <p>  On question No. 12 about the PwC report, the SFPA is subject to periodic critical review under its code of governance, as are all State agencies.  The SFPA carried out a comprehensive review of the organisation in 2019.  It was the first review of its kind of the SFPA and it recognised the significant changes that have taken place since the establishment of the organisation in 2007 in terms of the expansion of our remit and scale.  The SFPA has grown from an organisation with 77 people and a budget of less than &euro;11 million in 2015 to a budget of &euro;24.8 million and a current staff number of 155 in 2021.  The PwC report and its recommendations provide a clear path for the changes required to ensure that the organisation can effectively and efficiently deliver on our remit.  In order to work with that, we have set up an advisory board, which meets with the authority monthly.  We have appointed a director of transformation who came before the committee at its last meeting to meet members.  Significant progress has been made on many of the issues raised in the review.</p> <p>  There were a number of questions about the control plan, its submission and the desk vacancy in the EU.  Mr. Kinneen has answered all those questions very well.  Again, on the building of relationships with the industry and our ongoing discussions with those working in it, I assure the committee that meetings have taken place and working groups have been formed.  </p> <p>  Another significant question related to the interim plan and whether we could submit a draft plan.  Deputy Michael Collins explained his frustrations with it.  To be very clear, we have no authority in EU or national law to derogate in any way or to put in place transitional arrangements.  We are aware that we face criticism for this.  We are a regulatory authority and are agents of the State who implement what is on the Statute Book.  We have no way to derogate from this.  As Mr. Kinneen explained, we have been working on putting in a description of where weighing on landing occurs.  In some ports and piers, that has led to an easing of tensions and good working arrangements.  We are also very conscious that there have been significant changes for some of the islands and rural ports.  </p> <p>  We are working very hard to rebuild the relationship with industry and the Commission.  The SFPA has to work hard to rebuild the relationship with the Commission following the audit findings, the administrative enquiry and concerns about pelagic weighing.  </p> <p>  I have noted a final question.  I apologise to Deputy Collins but there was quite a list.</p><p>As I offered, I am very happy to meet the Deputy at any point.  We will go back over this and will communicate with the committee in writing if there is anything I have missed.</p><p> Regarding the High Court case, the SFPA is committed to implementing the decision of the court.  As the regulator, we support the correct weighing of catches, regardless of where that takes place, where we can have confidence in the accuracy of the certified weighing systems being used and being mindful of learnings from past experience.  The approval process has been worked through.  What is involved has been communicated to the industry and we will be working through that as quickly as possible.   Regarding the details of the case, the judgment is available for anybody to read.  I will not go into the full detail of it because I am aware that other Deputies want to come in.  I am not sure if there is anything else I have forgotten from that significant list of questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1463" speakername="P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#E00300"><p>I welcome our guests from the SFPA.  I have a number of questions but first I want to acknowledge the 14-page substantial submission the SFPA has made to the committee.  I want to refer to a number of references in it and that will link in with my questions.  The authority welcomed the invitation for its representatives to appear before the committee but expressed frustration that it has not been able to discuss its responsibilities, one of which involves food safety official control, a matter to which I will return in one of my questions.  In its submission, the authority asserts: </p> <blockquote> 	Fishermen&rsquo;s declarations must reflect the outcome of fish weighing.  Under-declarations would defeat the purpose of catch limits (quotas) and make fish mortality assessment incorrect thus creating immediate fraudulent food provenance and damaging long term sustainability efforts. </blockquote> <p>Dr. Steele can take it that statement is agreed by members of the committee of this committee and the fishing communities with whom we, as elected representatives, engage.  Clearly, we need to sustain and properly manage our fish stock for future generations.  It is important we accurately reflect the catch.  The authority's responsibilities in that regard, which are very important, are taken as read.  The submission also comments on the problems with the pelagic sector.  Strong views are expressed regarding that sector.  The submission states: &quot;However, it is a matter of judicial record, and SFPA opinion, and Legal Metrology opinion, that these systems can also facilitate ... [incompetence] and the systems can be open to fraud&quot;.  The authority has strongly outlined its concerns in that respect.</p><p>I will outline the problem I have with this.  I have seen the current weighing systems.  The submission lays out the chronology of events that led to the current systems that are in use in places such as Killybegs.  I want to state what that looks like.  I am advised that the flow scale weighing system involves state-of-the-art technology.  It is sealed with cable ties to prevent it being tampered with.  There are CCTV cameras upon those weighing scales as the fish go over them.  It is important to weigh fish and not water, as stated in the submission.  The pelagic catch is stored in water of a certain temperature and when it goes to the factory it goes over the weighing system through a conveyor belt, it is packed as soon as possible and put into cold storage.  That is a critical to the cold chain.  That was referenced in the authority's food safety responsibilities.  Dr. Steele will appreciate that.  There is a CCTV camera on the weighing device and that information is taken by monitor directly to the SFPA offices.  I do not know of any industry where the regulator has direct vision on the system as it is happening.  The authority has full visibility on the weighing taking place.  The devices are sealed with cable ties.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, can inspect a device unannounced at any time.  The authority's officers can get full access to a factory.  If I am saying anything wrong in my testimony, Dr. Steele can feel free to challenge me in her response.  The SFPA officers can physically come in and inspect all of that but they are also observing visually from their offices.  At the back end of a factory, there can be boxes containing 20 kg of fish.  There can be a trolley carrying 60 boxes, which is 1.2 tonnes of fish, which can be easily checked.  It is possible to go into the frozen storage compartment and easily check it.</p><p>The authority has an important responsibility, which is why it exists.  It is important to demonstrate what fishermen say they catch is what they are catching.  We need more fish in our seas but whatever the fishermen say they catch they should prove that.  I have engaged with those in the industry.  They do not resist that and accept that needs to be done.</p><p>I have demonstrated the level of oversight the authority, as the regulator, has, which is unprecedented in Europe or in the context of any other industry here.  I challenge the SFPA to tell me where in Europe that level of oversight exists.  The regulator has got to that point because it has been seeking to reassure the European Commission of the integrity of the weighing system and the catch system in this country.  It has eyes, in the form of CCTV cameras, on the weighing system.  It can be inspected unannounced at any stage by the NSAI.  It is sealed so it cannot be tampered with.  The regulator has full access to any factory.  Yet, on the last day we engaged with the authority when I gave that testimony, its senior officer, Mr. Andrew Kinneen, still said that was not acceptable.  I will use the following analogy.  It is like a garda getting into a car with somebody and saying &ldquo;I am going to sit beside you because I think you are capable of speeding so I will sit beside you to ensure you do not speed&quot;.  The driver would be very uncomfortable with that.  That is a very high level of enforcement.  The driver says something and then the garda on the scene says &quot;I could be distracted by the beautiful scenery and take my eyes of you so I am going to say I cannot enforce the law upon you&quot;.  That is the level of oversight of this industry we have reached.  I cannot understand how we could have got to a point where the SFPA has ensured that level of oversight and how can that not be something we can demonstrate to the European authorities is enough to ensure the integrity of our catch?  I reiterate the statement the authority makes on page 2 of its submission regarding its responsibility and the job it has to do, with which I am sure every member of this committee agrees and the industry accepts.</p><p>I want to ask Dr. Steele's opinion on all of that.  I have a few more questions.  I will be concise in putting them but, first, I want to get a response on why that level of oversight and regulation is not enough for the regulator to have confidence in it, as Dr. Steele's senior colleague said at the last meeting we engaged with the authority?</p></speech>

We put a lot of work into writing it and I appreciate the detail he has gone through.  I also appreciate what he has expressed regarding the importance of the sustainability of the fishing industry and the importance of our role in that respect.  Rather than argue back with the Deputy, I will look at the map forward and I will then ask Mr. Kinneen and Mr. O'Mahony if they want to come in.</p><p>There is a significant opportunity for us in the control plan and in the work we will do on it.  We will have ongoing dialogue with the Commission and that will give us an opportunity to ensure that there is a level playing within Europe for operators in the country into which they land fish.   As stated, that will be important.  It is also important that we have accurate controls in terms of the weighing.  For me, there is a huge opportunity in the control plan and the work we are doing on it.  As mentioned, significant work has been done since the issues with the pelagic industry were first discovered to try to ensure there is better control.  However, the Commission view is we need to do better.  There is an opportunity in the control plan to do that.  We will look at that.  As I said, there is engagement and we welcome that the industry and the regulator want to work to ensure that we have good control.  I will hand over to Mr. Kinneen and Mr. O'Mahony at this point as they may have more to add.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Kinneen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#F00200"><p>To respond to Deputy Mac Lochlainn, I take the sincerity of his observations.  I want to put on the record that we would not want to tar everybody with the same brush.  We have challenges with some operators and we must be very vigilant and take every care to ensure they do not circumvent the legislation and, in effect, become unfair competition to those members of the industry who are doing their work lawfully and within the rules.  </p> <p>  The Deputy expressed a difficulty in regard to the belt and braces approach in terms of protection of weighing machines.  That is based on the good advice we get from the NSAI and other technical experts.  In that case, we are protecting the weighing instrument from interference by an operator.  In regard to the two flow scales that are on the equipment on the pier in Killybegs, we have been advised by the NSAI that they are state-of-the-art with regard to how boat fish can be weighed.  Those same group of experts and our own independent research into this area tells us that good and all as those devices are - they are very good in that we can download example logs to see if there has been any tampering or unusual patterns in the way fish have been weighed - we have been advised that that machinery, even the best on the market, is still vulnerable to physical interference and if not properly set up can be vulnerable to offline interference by electronic Wi-Fi-type read-outs.  I will give a specific example.  We have been informed that the weighing instrument will weigh what it is being passed over it, but if you have the means to tamper or adjust the belt-feed of the fish being put on the machine that gives you a capacity to distort the capacity of the machine to weigh accurately over time.  That is just one example.  We have been also told that if you put physical obstacles or devices on the belt-feeder coming to the machine it would have a similar effect on the accurate weighing of it.  Those are the two things of which we need to be vigilant.</p> <p>  With regard to CCTV, we very much appreciate that we can monitor these weighing scales with closed circuit television systems, but equally, and not with everybody but with some operators, we have had difficulty setting up those cameras such that they have sufficient viewing point of the weighing instrument, the meter recording the fish going over the weighing instrument and the portion of conveyer belt feeding the fish to the instrument.  We have some work to do with the industry in that regard.  I am heartened by representation we have received from the industry that it is happy to engage with us.  We will be doing some of that work this week.  On the question that everything is fixed and we are super vigilant and all over this, unfortunately Deputy we are not.  It is the unlawful operators that are setting the challenge for us and creating the difficulties for other operators who are trying to do their work and work lawfully.  It is a complex area.  We will always try to exercise and meet our responsibilities proportionately and appropriately.  We are in a process at the moment to try to re-establish where we should be in terms of monitoring the industry.  All good regulation comes with co-operation.  Where somebody does not to want to adhere to the law there is nothing much we can do.  We are mindful of the level of engagement we need from the industry to make this a success.</p></speech>

I recognise a great deal of what he has put on the table as thought processes I would have had 13 years ago when I commenced working with SFPA.  This is not rocket science; it is weighing dead fish.  Surely, that should be easy to do and easy enough to control but the reality is that it is not.  That is not stretching the reality; it is a factual statement based upon a great deal of experience.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned CCTV and the potential for unannounced inspections by the SFPA or the NSAI.  Each of those helps and each mitigates the risk but none, on its own or as part of an overall matrix, will sufficiently deter a concerted action by somebody who gets out of the bed in morning with the sole intent of landing undeclared fish.  That is the reality.  There is an element of trust involved and an element of us trying to find a balance of control versus commercial impediment.  I know the Deputy will respond about the commercial impact of these controls, but we are trying to find a balance. </p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned CCTV.  The CCTV views the read-out on the scale.  The only thing - it is a useful thing, but let us be clear it is a limited thing - that can do is show that that read-out is created in zero.  It most certainly does not give us the confidence that that read-out is correct.  It gives us the confidence that the scales is turned on and clocking something of greater than zero.  I am not belittling that; I am just delimiting it to what it is.  It is that and no more.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn mentioned the potential for unannounced inspections.  We can do unannounced inspections but the reality is there is only one gateway into each of these plants and things can change.  We have experiences of things being visibly changed rapidly as we walked into plants.  There are controls in place.  As I said, I would previously have held the view expressed by the Deputy that the totality of these add up to something that should be enough to assuage anyone's concerns.  The reality is they do not.  When the Commission digs it finds the potential for tampering is real.  The instruments can be tampered with.  Despite best attempts, there is more to do here yet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1463" speakername="P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#F00500"><p>I thank the witnesses.  My concern is there is no level of oversight that is good enough.  I note in the submission it is acknowledged that you cannot get into comparisons.  I believe our industry is the most regulated in all of Europe, that our fish producers and fishers are the most regulated in all of Europe.  This report was leaked in the national media earlier this year at a time when the industry was in serious trouble having lost a further 15% of quota under the EU-UK trade agreement.  The industry was in serious trouble and reports were in the media of tens of thousands of tonnes of over-fishing and potential fines of tens of millions of euro.  This presented a picture of an industry that was criminal in its responsibilities.  It was appalling.  The industry had no ability to defend itself.</p><p>As far as I know, there has been one conviction - one - in a court of law that followed the NSAI taking that prosecution, none as a result of the SFPA, despite it being a very strong regulator, arguably the strongest in Europe.  There was only one prosecution, yet it led to allegations of an industry that was criminal in its intent.<br/><br/>I put to all the senior officials in the SFPA before us that the relationship has to be reset.  The SFPA is regarded as the strongest regulator in all of Europe in the level of oversight on which it insists, and that is fair enough.  How can it be then that we have reports being leaked to the media, with the industry not being able to defend itself against the charge that it is involved in a massive criminal conspiracy?  There is something badly wrong about that, and I put it to the witnesses we need to reset the relationship between the SFPA and the industry.  The SFPA has a very important job to do.  The committee endorses that job, but this relationship has to be reset.  The trust is just not there.  The SFPA senior officials speaking today clearly do not trust the industry on the weighing of these devices.  That is the core problem that has got us to this crisis: a lack of trust between the industry and the SFPA.  I put it to the witnesses that the lack of proper engagement is the difficulty.<br/><br/>I will move on to my second question.  The witnesses have outlined that the SFPA's responsibilities include official food safety controls.  They will be aware there is a responsibility to ensure cold chain integrity for chilled or frozen foods.  It is a profound responsibility at the core of the fishing industry.  As for the authority's own legal framework, I will read out both Article 74.5 of the control regulation, that is, EC Regulation No. 1224/2009, and Article 98.4 of the implementing regulation, that is, EU Regulation No. 404/2011 because it is important they be read out.  Article 74.5 states:</p><blockquote>	Officials shall conduct inspections in such manner as to cause the least disturbance or inconvenience to the vessel or transport vehicle and its activities, and [this is key] to the storing, processing and marketing of the catch.  They shall, as far as possible, prevent any degradation of the catch during the inspection. </blockquote><p>Article 98.4 states, &quot;Inspections shall be carried out in a manner as to prevent to the extent possible any negative impact on the hygiene and quality of the fisheries products inspected.&quot;<br/><br/>There is serious concern in the industry that the SFPA has two responsibilities here as an authority.  One responsibility it has, which we endorse, is the responsibility to make sure the fishing industry is catching what it says it is catching.  We wish the SFPA well on that important job it is doing.  I believe it is doing it at a level higher than any comparable authority in Europe.  I am happy to be challenged on that.  That is the first responsibility.  However, the SFPA also has a responsibility relating to the quality of the produce, specifically, that it is not degraded in the inspection process.<br/><br/>I put it to the witnesses that what the European Commission has asked the SFPA to do as an authority in revoking this control plan impacts on the quality of the produce.  It is not doable.  The SFPA has also said in its submission that it does not have the ability to police every single harbour and pier.  It could have put in place an annulment by 12 June.  It could have annulled this.  It is asked to do two things.  It is asked to ensure the weighing and to ensure food safety.  I put it to the witnesses that the revoking of this control plan makes the other one not doable.  The SFPA needs to be honest as an authority and say that what the European Commission has asked of it is not possible, is not doable and should be revoked.  The problem is that the SFPA will submit a control plan, it will take months and months, maybe even more than a year, which is two fishing seasons, and that is not sustainable for the industry.  Surely to God there is straight talking to be done by the SFPA directly with the Commission, and indeed between the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Commission, to find a solution to this.<br/><br/>My final question is the following.  I will not ask any more questions just now because it would be unfair to my colleagues.  Do the witnesses agree that the relationship between the SFPA and the fishing industry has to be reset?  The trust is not there on either side.  That is the truth.  It has to be reset, and that is what has led us to this crisis.  Even though the SFPA is the strongest regulator of its kind in Europe, somehow it is being accused of not doing its job and of being weak.  That is the substance of the leaks that have been made to the media, which I do not believe are true.  I reject utterly any suggestion of a criminal conspiracy among our fishing industry.  That is deeply unfair and damaging, and the industry has not even had a chance to defend itself.</p></speech>

It is not a matter of being either strong or weak but of being effective.  I hope that in all our lifetimes we will never see any fish stock collapses.  I say that for all of us in the coastal communities and throughout Ireland.  The role we play is very important, so I thank the Deputy for the endorsement, although not necessarily as the strongest regulator.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a couple of issues.  The questions he asks were raised in the meeting we had with the industry.  That is one of the reasons I asked Dr. O'Mahony to attend with us today.  He is the chief scientific officer so he has looked at the detail of this.  I will ask him to respond to the Deputy on that.</p> <p>  There is just one thing I wish to raise.  Regarding a reset of the relationship with the industry, it is normal for the relationship between an industry and its regulator to be strained at times.  The most important thing, however, is that we keep communication going.  I assure Deputy Mac Lochlainn and the rest of the committee that we are prioritising that.  As Mr. Kinneen said earlier, we are keeping very regular meetings going with producer organisations, industry working groups and any member of the industry who wants to meet with us.  We have been prioritising that.  It is about trust but, with regulation, and given that in the pelagic fisheries one landing can have a value of &euro;500,000, it is also about having an assurance.  As for the development of that assurance, we have put in place a number of measures but have not got it right yet.  It is to be hoped that as the new control plan goes forward and as we deal with the Commission, we will get measures that are correct.  There are lessons for everybody through this process.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Mr. O'Mahony to talk through the detailed legislative points Deputy Mac Lochlainn has inquired about.  I am not sure whether Mr. Kinneen will want to come in after that.</p></speech>

I will start somewhat narrowly on the very nub of the Deputy's question, then get a little broader and then circle back again.  I will start by agreeing with him on the generality of the point he makes.  We will not sit here and say the weighing of fish at landing, or SFPA controls of the weighing of fish at landing, are a step towards improving fish quality.  That is simply not the case, to get that out straight away.  The words "quality" and "safety" are put about.  The Deputy spoke about the fisheries control regulation and quoted from Article 74 of the Council regulation and Article 98 of the implementing regulation.  Fisheries control is what the SFPA does.  Fish weighing, fish quality maintenance and fish safety maintenance are what the industry does.  Our role is the official control.</p> <p>  Without being too philosophical about it, "quality" is one of those terms that means different things to different people but, ultimately, it is the sum of the good points about food and what we want in our food.  That is what food quality is.  It is what people are willing to pay for and what people want.  One aspect of quality is freshness.  It is one of the aspects people want.  People want flavour, safety, ecological credentials and sustainability credentials.  There are a lot of aspects of quality, but I think the focus here is on the freshness of fish.  Quality is perhaps a continuum, with good, bad and middling.  Safety is more of an absolute concept.  Something is either safe or not safe.  It cannot be a little safe, just as you cannot be a little pregnant.  That is the philosophical point.</p> <p>  To get to the more direct point, the Deputy mentioned the control regulation.</p><p>It deals with those rare events that the SFPA is physically present to inspect.  There is a much broader issue of having to weigh fish on the pier regardless of whether the SFPA is present.  What fishermen do when we are present should be no different from what they do when we are not.  Our presence should not meaningfully alter what is happening to those fish.  The same thing should be happening to them regardless of whether we are present.  As such, I do not accept the construct based on those control regulation articles that there is some kind of conflict or undoability.  All of our controls do not have a positive impact on quality and everybody should be trying to work to minimise the impact of that.  I will cite the example of food coming into Dublin Port today from third countries.  Some of those shipments are opened and inspected.  No one is saying that that is good for quality, yet it is a necessary part of the regime.  The same applies to the fishery management system.  Society has said that it wants to ensure that the quantity of fish that is landed is checked, so a requirement to have the fish weighed is put in place.  No one is saying that is good for quality, but it is necessary from a fishery management perspective.  As such, we do not accept the Deputy's construct of the control regulation somehow being in conflict with our role in quality and food safety.</p><p> Quality deteriorates from the point the fish is killed.  From the point it dies, its immune system stops working and the quality of the fish deteriorates because the environment around it attacks it.  Part of the skill, lore and craft of being a fisherman is to minimise that and make every step a minimising step.  It is the same with weighing.  Fishermen have to do many things with a fish - get it from the sea to the coast, from the landing point onto the truck and from the truck to the consumer.  In all of those steps, they have to have an eye towards quality and safety, and every step within that should be a minimising step.</p><p> When we get there, we observe what the fishermen are doing.  That is if we get there.  We inspect approximately 20% of landings, depending on risk.  There is a one in five chance of being inspected.  When we get there, fishermen should not be doing anything differently.  They should be weighing the fish regardless of whether we are there.  The view that this has somehow changed with the revocation of the control plan is very difficult to accept; I do not accept it.  In many ways, it would have been a greater intervention for us to arrive in a control plan era than in a non-control plan era.  I can expand on that further if the Deputy wishes.</p><p> Ultimately, ensuring fish quality is the role of the fisherman.  It is entirely possible to weigh fish with appropriate quality maintenance at landing.  It is challenging - I am not saying it is easy or optimum, but it is possible.  Our role would be to make the minimum possible intervention to comply with the Articles 74 and 98 requirements, which the Deputy read out verbatim, in order to minimise, insofar as is possible, any deleterious impact on the quality of the fish.</p><p> I will probably draw a breath at this point.  I do not know whether the Deputy wishes to respond to any of the points I have made.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#H00300"><p>I welcome our guests.  We are an hour and a quarter in this debate and it has been helpful.  I acknowledge the contribution of Dr. Steele and her team to this meeting so far.</p> <p>  There are serious issues in the fishing industry.  The weekend before last, I spent most of Saturday in Castletownbere and Union Hall.  The following day, I was in Kinsale meeting fishermen.  It is felt that there is a disconnect between the Department, the regulator and the industry.  As has been mentioned at this meeting, that disconnect is a major issue.  There will always be tensions between a regulator and an industry.  That is the case in most industries.  How to ensure that those tensions can be worked through in a proper forum is what I wish to discuss.  I would like our guests' views on how there is no forum where the three sides sit down together and thrash out issues.  Maybe a policy should be formulated, by this committee in particular, on how such a forum could work.  There does not seem to have been a dialogue of any significant nature that has brought everyone together.</p> <p>  Regarding Mr. O'Mahony's view on food quality, he made a significant point about where a regulator steps in and what impact the regulator has on the quality of the fish.  I am slightly concerned.  All of us in the food chain have a responsibility to limit the damage done to food's quality from when it is harvested to when it is consumed.  How we interact in that food chain is important.  It is the interaction that the fishing industry is talking about.  This is not about the 20% level, but what happens at that level, which the industry says is having a negative impact on the product's quality.  From an agricultural point of view, it would be akin to requiring that, when milk is tested, it is at 3 oC instead of the 1 oC it is normally at when it goes into the bulk tank.  We must determine how to formulate a plan that limits the damage done to quality.  It is the damage done to quality from catch to consumption that we must discuss.  We must see how we can engage the fishing industry to ensure it has confidence in how the regulator reacts at that stage.</p> <p>  Regarding the future control plan, what will be different compared with the previous plan?  What will the major changes be?  How will those affect matters, in particular the weighing on piers?  What does the SFPA propose will be the key elements that ensure joined-up thinking between the Department, the regulator and the fishing industry in order that the plan is workable on the pierside?</p></speech>

He was in Castletownbere, Union Hall and Kinsale.  I am grateful for the solution-seeking view that he is bringing to us.  We are open to having any meeting or dialogue.  There is the consultative committee, which was set up under the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act.  It comprises the industry and consults with the SFPA.  We have met the industry on these issues, but as part of the review, we are resetting that relationship as well.  We are open to the Senator's suggestion in his first question because promoting compliance is a key part of the role of any regulator.</p> <p>  If it is okay, I will deal with the Senator's third question next before dealing with food quality issues.  Regarding the proposed changes to the control plan, we placed the plan on the website for a consultative period.  The control plan will involve post-transport weighing, which means it will be back to how it was before April.  Weighing will be able to take place on premises when that control plan goes through, thereby removing weighing at landing.  For us and the industry, the control plan is a very high priority.  Following submissions from across the breadth of the industry, we will include pelagic fishing in it.  The control plan will be key.  We will need to work as quickly as we can, which will involve a series of meetings with the Commission.  It has met us already and expressed its openness to working with Ireland on getting a good solution.</p><p>The first thing is to give an assurance that that is the way it is going forward.</p><p> In regard to the food quality questions, when we were before the committee the last time, we acknowledged the quality issues that were raised by the committee.  To reiterate what Mr. O'Mahony said, both before and after the European Commission's decision the weighing of catches remains the responsibility of the industry and it is distinct from the SFPA&rsquo;s landing inspection process in that it occurs whether or not we are present.  All weighing of fish, wherever it occurs, whether it is on the pier or in the factory, has the potential to impact on cold chain and hygiene maintenance.  Weighing in an exposed environment with small-scale equipment will require active attention by operators to manage such concerns.  I know there has been significant engagement with the SFPA and we would like to express huge gratitude to the industry for that engagement, where the industry is looking at solutions.  We wish to highlight the continued availability of sample weighing for fishery products and standardised boxes.  For most whitefish, with some exceptions, this involves weighing relatively small sample numbers, leaving the vast majority of fish boxes fully iced and untouched other than to ensure allocation to traceable lots.  It is an important part of our remit to ensure food business operators identify and manage responsibility for food safety risks, and this is a particular focus of our attention in our ongoing consultation with the industry following the revocation of the control plan.</p><p> On a point I should have mentioned earlier, when we submit the control plan, we will also be submitting a revised sampling plan.  As part of that, one of the issues raised at the last meeting with this committee was in regard to monkfish, which was not in the previous sampling plan.  It is our intention to look at sample weighing for monkfish, so there is opportunity in this as well.</p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Kinneen and Mr. O&rsquo;Mahony, who may want to come in on some of those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.43" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Kinneen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#J00200"><p>I thank Senator Lombard.  The Senator asked a very focused and fair question on what will be different in the new control plan.  To preface the remarks I will offer, we have this channel opened up with the Commission and we will be having broad discussions on what the points of concern might be from its perspective in approving a resubmitted control plan from Ireland.  Some of the areas of discussion are interesting.  As Dr. Steele mentioned, we are going to look at the sampling plan and how that is geared, the number of boxes to be sampled and weighed, and so on, with a view to any possible reduction in those numbers to make sure Ireland's sampling scheme is in line with other member states.  We had some encouraging preliminary discussions with the Commission on that earlier.</p> <p>  We will also have to look at joining up the dots on risk management of different fisheries and the landing and transport of fish into different port areas, and so on.  That is a broad approach but there are principles that we are going to have to look at to make sure they can be adopted in terms of our control plan and the management of inspection resources.</p> <p>  Now that we are including the pelagic sector in the revised control plan for the Commission, we also have to consider the issues that arose in terms of the audit and the ongoing dialogue in the initial inquiry with the Commission on points of concern.  As I said earlier in this meeting, we are encouraged by feedback we have had from the Irish Fish Producers Association, IFPA, in terms of the written submission it made to the SFPA as part of our consultation with the industry.  It clearly indicated it is well disposed to looking at the measures we have in place and whether it needs them refined or improved, again, in a proportional way but in a way that will ensure we have a credible platform when we present the control plan.</p> <p>  We would tend not to look to radical changes to what we had heretofore.  What we sent out to the Commission in the past was well considered and is probably not likely to be changed radically.  What we submit will reflect best practice on what is available in terms of technological developments and practices in the industry, and other points of view the industry has very kindly offered us in terms of our consultation with it.  Much of it will be familiar, some of it will be amended with a view to improvement and there will be a few new elements.  We also hope there will be elements that will be less burdensome to the industry in terms of sampling and the way the sampling is carried out.</p></speech>

As an Oireachtas Member, I am conscious there are other interested parties out there, such as environmental NGOs and a range of people who are interested in the marine.  I have been a spokesperson for my own party on fisheries and the marine for about a year and I have engaged extensively, including with the SFPA, to try to get the wider perspectives.  I find the situation astonishing and I really want to reiterate this point.  The SFPA has increased its budget, increased its staff and increased its capacity over the last number of years.  It is not a story of weak regulations and a feckless industry in Ireland.  It is actually a story of a very strong and well-resourced regulator and an industry that is the most regulated in Europe and the most compliant.  There may well be individuals who are not meeting those standards, and that has to be accepted in all industries.  However, I believe that as we speak in 2021, we have a very well-resourced and effective regulator - it is arguably the most effective and strongest regulator in Europe - and an industry that just wants to go out and fish and earn a living.  We have got to a point where we need to reset that relationship.</p> <p>  I am going to say again that the recent episode dealt with in the High Court decision is a worrying sign in terms of that relationship between the SFPA and the industry.  This is an example from Killybegs, and I can speak now that the court decision has been made.  There was an attempt to find a workable arrangement on the weighing of fish.  The judges decided that the approach of the State was outside the law, and a legal challenge was undertaken at considerable cost to the State.  What was sought to be achieved was a weighing system that was acceptable to the SFPA and the European Commission that would minimise the impact on the quality of fish.  It was a very noble objective but, sadly, at a point in time, the SFPA walked away from that process.  Again, there is reflection for that organisation and its authority in what happened there.</p> <p>  The industry has to reflect too.  I am going to say here that any fisherman around the coast would acknowledge that when there is no oversight and no law - this is the same across the world &ndash; and when nobody has eyes upon them, people will take shortcuts.  However, I believe that what we have got to in our country right now, and we need to say this out loud, is a very well-resourced and strong regulator when compared to the industry.</p><p>I am told by fishermen that what they encounter when they come into Killybegs harbour, which is our major harbour, is unlike anything else in Europe in terms of oversight, regulation, accountability and systems.  How is that story being misrepresented and not being told to the national media?  How is it that a leaked report, to which the industry has not had a chance to respond or have sight of and that presents it as some sort of mass criminal enterprise, is given to the national media?  This deeply untrue and unfair.  We have a responsibility as Oireachtas Members, therefore, to stand over the important work the SFPA does but to also not allow our industry, which is heavily regulated and held to account, to be misrepresented in the way it has been.</p><p> Do the witnesses agree with my assessment?  I do not think they have responded to my point.  I believe the SFPA is the most effective and strong regulator in Europe and that our industry is the most regulated in Europe.  Is that agreed?  Can we get a response to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.49" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Susan Steele" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#K00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I wish I could agree with him.  The issues we have with the audit and the audit findings would say there are issues in the industry and in the regulator.  The audit, unfortunately, does not support that argument for being the strongest regulator in Europe.</p> <p>  I would like to bring attention back to the resourcing of the organisation, which we mentioned at the outset.  I will run over it again because it is one of the keys.  The key areas are the actual roles of the SFPA.  Our remit is the regulation of the commercial sea-fishing industry in compliance with the CFP.  We also regulate official controls for food safety for all wild and farmed fish, including classification of wild and farmed mollusc areas, and approval of Irish food processing establishments.  That is a significant amount of work as well.</p> <p>  We do food trade controls including catch and health certification of Irish fish exports and import controls; a role which has grown and expanded substantially due to Brexit.  We also look at the control of compliance with marine environmentally protected areas and infrastructure provision to facilitate both fishermen and vessel operators' compliance with their obligations, including development and support of their on-board IT systems to facilitate their statutory declarations.  We cover these significant remits, which have important potential impacts for fishing today and for future generations but also for the Ireland's reputation with regard to seafood safety and Ireland's trade.</p> <p>  I will use the language "Keeping the wheels on the bus" to describe how we went through the exit of the UK from Europe.  I would actually argue that we are not a well-resourced regulator.  We would be well-resourced if we had one of those roles.  In the Killybegs office, we have 18 fisheries officers who work incredibly hard.  The Deputy will be aware of the size of County Donegal, however.  We welcome the fact that we are opening a new office in Greencastle but those 18 fisheries officers are carrying out vessel inspections in pelagic and demersal landings.  They are carrying out all the food safety controls, all the mollusc sampling and sampling areas, all that import trade, for instance, catch and health certification of Irish fish exports, and then also doing the additional Brexit workload.  They are looking at the marine protected areas and also working with the infrastructure provision for fisheries with regard to data and IT systems.  We could act as a regulator in reducing what could be future risks for Ireland with the remit we have.  We are grateful to the State for the resources as the remit has grown.  I would not use the words "well-resourced" for us, however.</p> <p>  With regard to effectiveness, we have committed staff who carry out every aspect of the remit to the best of their abilities.  It is not just pelagic landings they are dealing with.  They are dealing with a huge number of different issues that can blow up at any time of day or night in different areas.  I thank the Deputy for his words on the role of the SFPA.  There is a perception that exists.  With what we are looking after, however, and the value of the seafood industry we regulate and potential sustainability and reputational food safety damages that can occur, I would not necessarily say we are as strong or as resourced as we should be.</p> <p>  Regarding the industry, again, I am very grateful, which I said in my previous appearance before the committee.  I have worked with the fishing industry and aquaculture industry for my entire career and in the vast majority of cases, there is significant compliance.  Rogue operators or those who seek to get economic benefit from breaking the rules, however, damage every person who is in the industry.  It is, therefore, important that we are resourced.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised questions about the judicial review.  I am nervous about summarising it.  I know he summarised some of it.  It is a comprehensive review.  A number of factors were taking part here.  The SFPA was delaying approval while waiting for confirmation and clarification from the commission.  That was at the grounds of it.  We are working, of course, within what the courses recommended going forward.  I hope I have addressed some of the items raised by the Deputy.  I do not know if Mr. Kinneen wants to come in on some of the points.</p></speech>

We do not have that in fisheries control, however.  We repeatedly put on the record that we would support that ability to see where we are.  We keep hearing people talk about level playing fields.  In reality, some of those people are pointing at the lowest dip and lag in that playing field and telling us all to head down into that puddle and wallow around there.  That is not what we want.  We want the level playing field whereby fishers experience the same control regime wherever they land or wherever they fish in Europe.  In the absence of publication of the audit reports, however, we cannot answer the Deputy's question.  We would like to be able to answer his question but we cannot.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#K00700"><p>I will be brief because other members want to come in.  The sanctions have been imposed on the entire fishing fleet, yet not one fisherman has seen any evidence or shared any information that was compiled by the 2018 audit or the 2019 administrative inquiry, which the SFPA carried out.  Why withhold evidence and yet proceed to punish the entire sector?  A real dangerous situation is happening here.  The SFPA said that it has not shared any copy with anybody outside of its own remit, as such, but then there are leaks all over the place.  Nobody is accountable for leaks.  Nobody is answerable for where the leaks emanate from and who is responsible.  This is damaging good, hardworking, honest inshore pelagic fishermen, however, whether they be from Castletownbere, Union Hall, Schull, Wexford or Galway.  Severe damage has been done.</p> <p>  The witnesses will also be aware that senior politicians have put on record, as have others who have fallen out the side doors, whether that is from the Department or wherever these leaks are coming from, that our fishermen are reputed in Europe - in the halls of the European Commission, Parliament and European Council - to be pure pirates who spend their entire working lives ripping off the CFP illegally.  This is the perception being put out there with the leaks.  This being the case, one might image that the European Commission reports would reflect this misinformation, disinformation and pure propaganda.</p><p>The witnesses will therefore be surprised to learn from the content of the latest research and working paper from the Commission on the EU sanctioning system, dated from January 2021, that Ireland hardly features at all.  This paper makes it clear that Ireland hardly features at all on the offenders list.  The truth is that Irish fishing boats are responsible for 0.8% of all European-wide offences against the Common Fisheries Policy.  From the leaks that are coming out, which look as though they are orchestrated leaks, it would appear that the fishing industry is up to every sort of meddling.  The reality is that the EU is saying that is absolutely not the case.  In Ireland we are making it look as though it is an issue and a major crisis.  What is wrong? Where did the leaks come from?  Why and how did this happen?  Is there any investigation going on within the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, within the Department or within the Minister's office as to how these leaks came about and why were they put out there to discredit the fishing industry?  The industry has worked so hard to work within the regulations, which are crippling against the Irish fishers whether they are inshore or pelagic fishers.  I would like someone along the line, it does not need to be the Minister, to launch an inquiry as to where these leaks came from and why we found out afterwards that as far as the European Union is concerned Ireland is at the bottom of the ladder with regard to rules being broken.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.56" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Kinneen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#L00200"><p>I will offer a few comments that might be of assistance to Deputies Collins and Mac Lochlainn.  Deputy Collins highlighted the issues arising out of reports leaked to the media or information coming to the media that is detrimental to the reputation of the industry and so on.  The SFPA can certainly speak for itself and we engage with media, as we should as a public organisation, but we never leak confidential material.  I can give that assurance directly to Deputy Collins and to the committee.  That is not our trade and function.  We try to respond to freedom of information requests, the information access requests and the press queries.  We try to engage to the level that we can.  We are not in the business of leaking or briefing on the basis of confidential information.  I give Deputy Collins every assurance on that point.<br/><br/>With regard to the judicial review, there are concerns coming from the contributions at the committee that we have been less than careful with taxpayers' money when we engaged with this judicial review, and around a lack of proper procedures on our part.  I will offer some background to the committee for the record.  A member of the pelagic fishing industry wrote to the Commission to complain about the levels of checks and controls and the difficulties arising with regard to the weighing of fish on the pier.  The response from the Commission to that individual in the industry - it was circulated to us, so I can talk to the committee about it - was to offer the view that privately owned or operated weighing equipment was not appropriate given where we were with the administrative inquiry, the audit and so on.  This point was made by the Commission to a member of the industry.  The industry did not challenge the Commission on that.  The SFPA found itself in the invidious position where we were trying to assess weighing equipment to try to hopefully sustain Ireland's status of having a control plan with the Commission.  Being in a very difficult position, we sought from the Commission on several occasions more detailed information on how it would take the view and substantiate it in European law.  In the meantime the industry, as it is entitled to do, initiated one of two judicial reviews involving the SFPA, one in particular involving the weighing equipment on the pier.<br/><br/>In general terms I would agree with the Deputy's remarks on the quality of that initiative.  Hopefully, we will get all of those matters sorted.  We are not in a position to engage in the approval of that equipment, as might be required under the statutory instrument and as we are required to do with the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI.<br/><br/>As a result of the Commission's opinion, and we are waiting for that to be clarified, the judicial review proceedings were initiated.  Mr. Justice Simons gave very clear consideration to the arguments offered by both sides and said that the SFPA was acting <i>ultra vires</i>in not going into an approval process on the basis of the Commission's opinion.  We could not support the Commission's opinion of pointing to legal precedents.  We have now had direction from the court.  We are very mindful of the costs of those court proceedings.  Again, that is not a matter of our choice.  We engaged in those proceedings with every sincerity that we would work with the court, offer our affidavits and submissions and hear very clearly the outcome of the judicial review.  We have given our assurances to the court that we would be following the judge's direction very clearly.  We are not the author of any of this.  We try to be bona fide actors in the process as matters go ahead.<br/><br/>This week we are in a position where we will be looking at a review of the equipment on the pier, in co-operation with the NSAI.  We have also done thorough work on our own internal procedures and documentation of those procedures with regard to the management of applications, not just for this equipment but for weighing equipment in general.  We have tried to learn from the experience in order for it to have a benefit for the taxpayer also.<br/><br/>I hope this helps to allay some of the Deputy's concerns with regard to the judicial review.  It is a matter we did not take the initiative on but we certainly engaged fully once it arose and we are following the judge's direction very carefully at this stage.</p></speech>

I had to pop away from the meeting for a few minutes to do a radio interview and I may have missed some of the questions.  I apologise if I repeat some of the questions.  The witness may already have answered some of them.</p> <p>  I would like clarity on the control plan that is being submitted.  Will this include the demersal and pelagic sectors?  Is it a control plan for both?</p> <p>  There were many references in the opening statement to the weighing equipment and the methods of weighing fish in the factories by the sector.  Will the witnesses talk me through the process and the equipment the SFPA, as the regulator, uses for the weighing of fish in order to do checks and so on?  I would be interested to hear that.</p> <p>  One of the functions of the SFPA, as stated in the opening statement, is food safety controls.  With the removal of and the absence of the control plan, and given the situation whereby the sector is being forced to weigh fish on the pier, in this interim period can the SFPA guarantee the high quality and safety of our product, for which Ireland has become renowned?  Where fish is being weighed on the pier can the SFPA give those guarantees?</p> <p>  My final point has already been touched on by some members but I have yet to hear a resolution, a solution or a proper answer.  It is about the relationship between the SFPA and the sector itself.  I have been a Deputy since February 2020, which is not that long I have been getting to know the industry and how everything works.  In that short space of time, it has become very apparent to me that the relationship between the SFPA and the sector is at an all-time low.  I mean rock bottom.  There is no point in skirting around this and pretending it is not the case.  I am not sure if the witnesses have seen any of the images of the peaceful protests in Cork and Dublin by the industry.</p><p>Some placards were visible at those protests, which referred to the SPFA.  It demonstrates how the industry feels it has been let down by the SFPA.</p><p> It goes both ways, however.  In the written submission we received from the SPFA, paragraph after paragraph related to fraudulent methods, methods by which in-factory weighing can be circumvented and the potential for fraud.  Reference was made to the one proven case and to the other case in the courts.  Yet, and I will double-check this, little or no reference was made to the overwhelming majority of those engaged in this industry being completely compliant.  That sets a narrative and an attitude of us and them.  It appears that way to me as someone trying to represent people and who is an onlooker, an outsider almost, and not involved with the SPFA or the sector itself.  Would the witnesses agree that the relationship in this regard is at an all-time low and that something drastic must be done to mend it?  I refer to healing wounds, opening dialogue, reaching out to the industry and starting afresh.  The relationship now is fairly toxic and this is getting us nowhere.  I would love a response to these questions, and particularly regarding that last point about the relationship between the SFPA and the industry.</p></speech>

Some of these questions were touched on earlier.  As it will not take long, I will go to some of them again.  The first question asked concerned the control plan.  The SFPA drafted and consulted on a control plan, and specifically excluded pelagic landings in this regard.  We logically took that decision to consult without pelagic landing as they were the high-risk scenario singled out for the enhanced controls within the Commission implementing regulation.  The intention was to submit a control plan to deal with the current issues that the demersal fishers are having.  These issues have been raised in this committee regarding weighing prior to transport.</p> <p>  We went through a written consultation process and we also had several meetings with the representatives of the industry.  The authority has now decided that pelagic boat landings greater than 10 tonnes will be included in the control plan, and we are prioritising the development of a revised plan.  In that revised plan, we will acknowledge the specific risks which have been identified and that led to the Commission&rsquo;s decision to revoke the previous plan and provide enhanced controls.  This is not going to be an easy process but we have already engaged with the Commission and we will continue to engage with the Irish desk in the Commission to move the process forward.  This will have a high priority and an internal team in the SFPA will be working on this process.  The aim is to ensure that the plan provides the assurances the Commission requires and that the SFPA, as a regulator, requires to minimise the risk of systematic manipulation of weighed pelagic catches.  We are aiming for a submission as soon as possible but the Commission review time will require ten weeks following submission of the documents.  I hope that assists in providing some clarity on that point.  We had one intention originally, but we have changed that following on from the consultation period.  We have indicated that to the producer organisations and we are now indicating it to the committee.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's second question on the processing and weighing of fish, it is important to state that the onus and responsibility is on the operator for the weighing of the fish.  We put a great deal of work into the communication of this aspect.  Again, if we have not dealt with questions on the website or if information is not available there, and in the same way as I responded to Deputy Michael Collins, we are not far away from Deputy Christopher O&rsquo;Sullivan at all and we are happy to meet him at any stage.  We are happy to sit down and go through the questions posed to him when he has been out in the ports and harbours and to provide clarification on anything he would like.  We would be very happy to do that.</p> <p>  We have laid out the situation with the processing and weighing of fish as clearly as we can on the website.  We have also taken questions which arose during meetings with representatives of the industry and posted relevant answers into a frequently asked questions, FAQ, section on the website.  A huge amount of proactive work has also been done in the ports by the SFPA and the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI.  We are very grateful to that organisation, which has been working with us as we are assisting the industry to come into compliance in this regard.  The message we gave earlier was that the weighing is done on the sample weight.  For most species, then, there is a sample weighing.  Fishery products are weighed on landing in accordance with the sampling matrix.  The figure resulting from the sample weighing on landing is used for the landing declaration, transport documents, sales notes and take-over declaration.  It is for-----</p></speech>

They are in the organisation.  They are NSAI weighing scales.  Regarding the context of fisheries control, however, the onus lies with the operator.  However, we do have weighing scales at the same standard, obviously, as the NSAI-verified scales and approved scales with the industry.  I hope I have answered the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  We do have scales available.</p> <p>  Two other questions were asked by the Deputy.  Turning to the food safety controls, I will return to this point last and hand over to Mr. O'Mahony to respond.  He gave a detailed answer in this regard earlier and he can recap on some of the key points for the Deputy.  Regarding relationships with the SFPA, there is always tension between a regulator and an industry.  However, it is important that dialogue is opened and a fresh start made.  It is also very important for us to emphasise that we are very grateful to those who are compliant and who work within the rules.  We are very happy to take on board any suggestions in this regard.  We are proactively working with the consultative committee.  We have had an internal review and the director of transformation, Olive Loughnane, is working with the consultative committee to examine how we can improve existing relationships.  My undertaking today is to state that we are always happy to meet with representatives of the industry and to meet the Deputy.  We want to open dialogue.  We believe strongly in our role in promoting compliance and in working with the industry in that regard.  Returning, then, to the Deputy's question about food safety controls, and because Mr. O'Mahony gave a good answer earlier on this subject, I will hand over to him now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.62" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Miche&aacute;l O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#M00500"><p>The direct question asked by Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan concerned whether we can guarantee the quality of product.  It is a matter of statute that fish should be weighed.  It is also a matter of fact that fish weighing has the potential to have a negative impact on quality.  Another fact is that the only wing of the State which recognises this reality to the extent of writing a control plan to get away from weighing on landing is the SFPA.  Therefore, our recognition in this regard is manifested in the authority having worked on a control plan in 2011 to ensure that the norm for fish weighing would be in the sheltered environment of a processing establishment.  Therefore, we accept the central contention of the Deputy&rsquo;s point and that acceptance has been manifested in our actions.  It is not a silent or empty promise, but a real testament to what we have done in this regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about guarantees.  It is not our role to guarantee fish quality.  It is the fishermen&rsquo;s role to weigh the fish, and when they are weighing the fish, they should also have an eye to quality to ensure that they do that weighing as quickly as possible to maintain the cold chain and to do it as accurately as possible to obtain the best possible accuracy from that weighing.</p><p>That is not an insignificant challenge and we acknowledge that it is more difficult at landing.  However, it is possible at landing if due regard and attention are given to the detail or the balance of maintaining the cold chain, maintaining hygiene and getting an accurate fish weight.</p><p> All interventions have the potential to impact on quality and weighing is among those.  Senator Lombard drew an analogy earlier with dairy production, which resonated with me.  It is the same thing.  Fish come out of the water at 12&deg;C or 15&deg;C and milk comes out of a cow at 37&deg;C.  From that point forward the producer, either a fisherman or a dairy farmer, is trying to get it cold and keep it moving.  There are things we do to food that are not necessarily the best thing for quality and not everything we do to food passes the test of being a good thing for quality.  The SFPA does not have the luxury of picking what is not optimal from a quality perspective and choosing not to implement those measures.  We are agents of the State and creatures of statute so we are obliged to implement what is on the statutes, which require fish weighing.  There have been repeated calls for an interim arrangement or something like that but we do not have that luxury or power.  It has not been delegated to us or to anybody in Ireland.  It is neither ours to give nor to withhold.  I hope that is a useful answer to both members.</p></speech>

We are after having an extensive question and answer session and a number of issues were dealt with comprehensively.  This is a hugely important issue for the fishing industry as we saw with the huge turnout at the protest in Dublin last week.  On behalf of the committee, I thank the representatives of the SFPA for coming in again and providing clarity on issues raised by the members of the committee.  Hopefully an amicable solution to this can be found and that we will not have to revisit the issue.</p> <p>  I propose that we suspend until 3.30 p.m., when the joint committee will meet to discuss the collection and recycling of farm plastics.

Our first witness is not yet online so while we are waiting, I will give an update on my visit to the Littleton recycling plant on Monday.  Members have an open invitation to visit.  It will facilitate everyone, but because it is operating a Covid pod, it can only facilitate one person at a time.  There was a misunderstanding about that over the weekend and I apologise for that.  If any member of the committee wants to go there himself or herself to see the recycling plant at first hand, he or she will be accommodated and arrangements can be made.</p> <p>  The plant is up and working.  It is handling farm waste plastic.  It is dealing with about 3.5 tonnes an hour and the end product is in the form of pelleted plastic which is being used to make recyclable plastic bags.  There is another plant to be built on site at the back end of the year which will take the plastic at a different stage of processing and will be used to make wax which can then be reused in the remaking of film plastic.  They reckon they will be able to process 25,000 tonnes of plastic there, building to 45,000 over the next 12 to 18 months.  They will be looking for more than farm plastic, but also other plastic used by other industries, such as meat plants.  There will be a fairly significant appetite for plastic into the plant.  I saw the whole process where the water was squeezed out of the plastic and that water was filtered and recycled.  The dirt is used for top fill on landfill, taken away by AES.  I consider the plant to be working well.  An industrial loader loads the plastic into a big hopper.  They have a problem with foreign objects in the plastic and they hope to improve the sensors to stop that.  They found a bit of a front loader had gone in with plastic shortly before I arrived and it had damaged part of the machinery.  The line is up and running efficiently and it is hoped in time it will be a home-grown solution to our farm plastics problem.</p></speech>

I would say that they have to have a contract with an assembler of plastic.  I would not say they would be in the business of taking a tractor load of plastic off an individual.  I would say you would have to be supplying a certain amount of tonnage to them.  You would have the problem of collecting the plastic and delivering it to them.</p><p>They are charging &euro;38 per tonne to take in the plastic.  In terms of the economics, I am sure there is a question going through your minds.  This must be a good money earner.  I will be putting that question to the Irish Farm Films Producers Group.  There is a levy on the plastic at the point of purchase and a collection fee is being charged as well.  The cost for it to be taken to an assembly point for collection is &euro;50 per tonne.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The purpose of this session is to discuss the collection and recycling of farm plastics.  We have been joined by Mr. Liam Moloney, general manager, Mr. Tom Dunne, chairperson and Ms Geraldine O'Sullivan, company secretary, IFFPG.  You are all very welcome to the meeting.  I thank you for attending to clarify a number of issues for the committee.  We have received the group's opening statement and it has been circulated to members.  We are limited on time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions.  The committee has agreed that opening statements will be taken as read such that the full session can be used for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website, and publicly available.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to point out to witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting who are in locations outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I will now open the floor to questions from members.  As Deputy Leddin has indicated that he has another engagement I will allow him to go first.  He will be followed by Senator Boyhan.</p></speech>

This is a very interesting topic.  For the benefit of those following these proceedings I would like to point out that agri-plastics are the large plastics one sees on bales of silage.  Most members of the public will have at some point in the year noted them going up and down the roads.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  I get the sense that there is a significant stockpiling of this plastic that has not been processed and that there are issues and a number of difficulties in terms of how it is being processed.  This is not a blame game, but we need to fully understand the current capacity in terms of the management of agricultural plastics which are a difficulty commodity to deal with.  I am not sure if the witnesses heard the Chairman's earlier remarks in regard to the end product as he viewed it at the particular plant he visited.  That is encouraging.  We need to understand that, the significant costs involved and the issues in regard to the environment.  Are the witnesses aware of large stockpiling of these agricultural-related industrial plastics?  If so, where are they?  In terms of their operation, what level of capacity does it have to stockpile, retain or store plastics for processing?  Do the witnesses believe that the industry has the capacity to deal with the problem?  It is a big problem.  We do not fully understand what is going on.  As part of the committee's work we are here today to tease out those issues with the witnesses.  We also want the witnesses to share with us their experience and, more important, their knowledge about this sector.  I ask the witnesses to address the stockpiling issue, the capacity to deal with it and the end product.  I would like them to focus on that and to share with us their understanding in that regard.  That would be very helpful to the committee.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the recycling market has been difficult over the past number of years because of the decision taken by the Chinese three years ago to stop importing plastic waste.  However, it has improved in the recent past.  In our case, we carried over 10,000 to 12,000 tonnes of waste from last year.  We expect to collect in the region of 30,000 to 35,000 tonnes this year at our bring centres and at the farmyard.  We are confident that the vast majority of that will be recycled in advance of the commencement of the 2022 season.  It is a difficult situation, but as far as we are concerned it is one that is being managed correctly and we are confident that we will be able to recycle all the material that we collect.</p></speech>

As I said, the situation is improving somewhat.  The material is being stored in our contractors' yards.  Currently, we have four contractors.  The material is stored in their yards.  Their yards are permitted by the relevant local authorities.  We are licensed by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Every year we submit a detailed operations report as well as detailed audited accounts to the Department .

I note, from the figures submitted by the Department to the committee on the indigenous waste infrastructure that was utilised, that in my own home town of Carrickmacross, ADN Material collected 925 tonnes, AES in Littleton, to which the Chair alluded earlier, collected 525 tonnes and Walker Recycling in Portlaoise collected 18,448 tonnes.  Walker Recycling is no longer under contract with IFFPG.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It depends a lot on how well the Irish plants perform.  If they perform very well, we might possibly send a third of what we collect this year to Irish plants and the rest will go abroad.  We have a policy of supporting Irish plants inasmuch as possible.  If the Irish plants can take more, we will give them more.</p></speech>

At the rate AES is operating, it might take 7,000 or 8,000 tonnes.  That is why we feel we will get a third of our material away to Irish recyclers.

It is extremely important that we get to the root of this and find out whether it is possible to have all of this plastic recycled at home in a way that is commercially viable and of value to everyone in the chain.

Going by the figures I am looking at, with what the Chair revealed to us and with collection and baling, I have a good general idea.  I do not want any figures from Mr. Moloney.  It looks as if things went well in this country this year there would be a surplus from what farmers are charged when they buy plastic without charging them at the bring point.

I understand it could cost &euro;70 or &euro;80 a tonne to export it.  I know centres in the UK charge &pound;50 to take it in.  I know what it costs to bale it because I have done a bit of research on the baling.  The figures are far more substantial than if we could do it here ourselves.  Why would we be charging more money if it costs us a good bit less?  Why do farmers also pay when bringing plastic to the bring centres?</p></speech>

The committee can look in detail later at how it is going for the farming community.</p> <p>  We are having this meeting because we were contacted about an issue we spoke about at our previous meeting.  At that meeting, I asked whether we have green plastic.  I was told it was put through a trammel and then went out as green waste, which looked like a great idea to be quite frank about it.  My understanding is that when Mr. Moloney came before the committee at our previous meeting he was aware of 20 containers that had gone out since January and, because of new EU regulations that changed everything, they were sent back.  Is this correct?</p></speech>

This was material that was sent back because, as the Deputy has quite correctly said, the legislation changed and the authorities did not consider it green listed any more.  Those ten containers went back to Dublin Port.  We were asked by the authorities to assist and we did so.  We moved those ten containers to Littleton where the material is being recycled.</p></speech>

Would it not be good to involve them?  I am looking at the make-up of the board.  In fairness to the IFA, there are six from the industry, two from the farming organisations and two independent members.  Is it not heavily loaded with plastics experts as against representatives of the farmers who are paying all the money at both ends?  The levy is built into the price of a roll of plastic and this is understandable.  They are also charged when they sell it.  Would the IFFPG not consider having a representative from all of the farming organisations?  Would it consider making up the board of half farmers and half industry at least?</p></speech>

In my 13 or 14 years with the IFFPG, we have not been approached by any other farming representative body looking for representation on the board.</p></speech>

In terms of our relationship with farmers, it is all about the service we provide to them, and that service is of a high quality.  Farmers have bought into our service and are very happy with it in terms of the cost and convenience.  The figures are there to support that.  We achieved an 80% recycling rate last year, involving 34,500 tonnes of material.  Farmers are very well represented on our board at the moment and are receiving a very good service from us.</p></speech>

In fairness to Mr. Moloney, I asked at the previous meeting about plastic coming in across the Border.  It is hard to put a figure on that, which I understand fully.  I assume he will agree that it would be a worthwhile exercise for the Department to look into that.  We need to know how much plastic is in storage all around the country.  Going by the figures I am looking at, there is a lot more that what Mr. Moloney has indicated.  He said there is only 10,000 or 11,000 tonnes and I have to take his word on that.  We need to get on top of this.  I assume the IFFPG is liaising with the Littleton facility to which the Chairman referred.  If that plant gets to the figures that are being talking about, I presume that will solve many of the headaches in the plastic industry.  Does Mr. Moloney agree?</p></speech>

Mr. Dunne said in his exchange with the Deputy that since our previous meeting, unfortunately, Walker Recycling Services has gone into liquidation.  However, that would not have affected the IFFPG in any way because, at the time of that meeting, it had ceased its contract with the company.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, all that money is required at the moment to recycle the volume of material we collect.  If the recycling costs reduce in the future, as we hope will be the case, then we will reduce both the levy and the collection charges to farmers.  That is how we will address that situation.</p></speech>

They made a decision to get into this market knowing what the conditions were.  They were playing the market and making money when things were good.  Unfortunately, the market dropped and now they find themselves in a difficult position.  That is nothing to do with us.</p></speech>

It amounts to 100% of the total tonnage in any given year.  That will surely reduce the costs.  How does Mr. Moloney see the additional money being distributed in that scenario?</p></speech>

That has happened in the past.  Some years ago, we reduced them quite significantly when the market was in our favour.  If the market comes back in our favour, we will make those reductions again.</p></speech>

If the Littleton plant does not meet those targets and the IFFPG still has to export a certain tonnage, and it has to be green, how does Mr. Moloney propose to put that plastic through a trommel given that the only company in the country with the trommel technology is now in liquidation and his organisation no longer has a contract with that company?</p></speech>

We have the capacity in place to do that.  We do not see it as a difficulty.

We are talking about a company that was contracted to the IFFPG for 15 years.  The director of that company, in his statement, said that on or around the morning of 18 May 2021, he was telephoned by the CEO of the IFFPG and verbally informed that the contract with Walker Recycling Services Limited was terminated, with no reason given.  Mr. Moloney, however, is telling us that the contract was terminated in early June, which is some three weeks later.  One of the two witnesses is very mixed up with their telephone calls.  Can Mr. Moloney clarify the date?  He and his colleagues appeared before the committee on a previous occasion.  It gets really annoying when different groups come in telling us different things.  Our purpose, as a committee, is to get the facts and ensure there is oversight of the expenditure of public money.  When the witnesses from the IFFPG came before the committee on the previous occasion, did they not think it worthwhile to inform us that, if Mr. Walker is correct, it had terminated his contract that same morning?</p></speech>

I have a funny feeling that we will be returning to this perhaps after next week.  There should be some evidence given.  My major concern is for the farmer.  He is paying for boreens and paying another tax for the purchase of farm plastics.  My greatest concern is for the farmer and the cost to the farmer.</p> <p>  My question is for the IFFPG.  There are several other farming organisations besides the IFA.  This has been mentioned already.  Why is there no one from these organisations on the board of IFFPG?  We are told that approximately 50% of farmers are not members of IFA but they have to buy new plastic from IFFPG members.  These farmers have a preference for farmyard collections provided by the independent contractors.</p> <p>  My second question is the only other question I have for now.  The independent collectors need the levy now.  This is because there is currently a market in Littleton incurring a gate fee of &euro;38 and a haulage cost of &euro;30 per tonne along with bailing and loading fees.  The levy would cover all these expenses and solve everything at no cost to any Department.  The IFFPG has this money.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We have not been approached by any other farming organisations expressing an interest in being represented on our board.  Therefore, no other farming organisations, apart from the IFA, are on our board.  The IFA represents farmers effectively on our board.</p> <p>  We made the point with regard to the levy clear at the previous meeting.  That levy is how we fund our group.  We are self-funding.  It is money we generate from our members and from farmers.  The levy is required in its entirety to run our scheme, which is highly successful.  No part of that levy is available to independent collectors.</p></speech>

The only issue I want to ask about is the so-called 30% or 20% left out.  Mr. Moloney stated that his group does a practical and resourceful job in ensuring that the group collects 70% to 80%.  In many ways, that is not the major issue in the current debate.  The issue in the debate is the other 20%.  We have yards in some parts of the country allegedly with hundreds if not thousands of tonnes of plastic stockpiled.  Whether that is the responsibility of the IFFPG - I sense by the response of Mr. Moloney that it is not - we need to find a solution to that problem.  It may be by amending legislation or going back to the Minister.  We need to work with all angles.  We need to work with the IFFPG in particular, which has a track record of picking up plastic and doing a sensible and appropriate job in recycling it and exporting it on occasions.  We need to find a solution to ensure that the 25% of plastic not going through the IFFPG formal system can find a home.</p> <p>  The argument all committee members are making is about what will happen.  If we do not have a scenario in place for the 25% to be delivered, collected, recycled or exported, then we are going to have a problem with the plastic building up.  I appreciate the previous response from Mr. Moloney was that it is not the baby of the IFFPG.  It is nothing to do with the group and the group is getting a 100% levy for collecting 80% under the legislation.  The real question is what we do with the 20%.  We have a responsibility of care and a duty.</p> <p>  Farming is in a different space.  We have a time-in-action element at the moment.  We all know the significant pressures we are under as an industry.  We have never been under the microscope like this before.  We need to find a solution not only for the plastic producers industry but for the sustainability of the industry.  That is the real point.  How can we find a sustainable solution to this issue so that, as the entire farming community, we can move forward?</p><p>Does the legislation need to be amended and strengthened such that IFFPG will have more control?  Should it be changed in order that there could be an open market and anybody who collects would get a percentage of the levy?  The current system does not work.  IFFPG does its job, independent operators do theirs and there is 20% in the middle about which nobody knows what has happened.  If we were to change legislation, should we strengthen IFFPG's hand or open the market to more participants?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.249" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#GG00200"><p>What we are achieving nationally, in terms of farm plastics recycling, is spectacular.  No country in Europe comes within reach of what we are doing at the moment.  We are achieving an 80% recycling rate for our waste plastic stream.  Currently, in the context of packaging plastic, for example, a 30% recycling rate is being achieved.  What is being achieved in regard to farm plastics recycling in Ireland is quite spectacular and that is because the key stakeholders - the producers and farmers - are working co-operatively in our scheme.</p> <p>  Separate to us, independent collectors made a commercial decision to go out and play the market.  They were entitled to do so; we have no problem with that.  They now find themselves in difficulty because the market has changed.  This is not a matter for IFFPG to address but rather for others, and we wish them well.  Farm plastics recycling in Ireland is a spectacular success story by any measure.</p></speech>

The 20% has been left in limbo because, as he said, the independent collectors played to the market and the market changed; we all know that.  We need to find a solution.  What does Mr. Moloney think that solution is?  Should the legislation be changed to strengthen IFFPG's hand to ensure it has more control over the market, or should there be a percentage share-out of the levy?  I am trying to get to the nub of Mr. Moloney's opinion of the solution.  The 80% figure is amazing, but we all know we are in a completely different space now.  Unless we are sustainable, we are not going to be there.</p></speech>

It is just not achievable.  We will collect as much as possible over and above the 80% recycling rate.  The independent collectors, I am going to hazard a guess, might have been collecting 4,000 or 5,000 tonnes per annum when they were collecting, but they are largely parked up now.  The reason a farm plastics recycling service is available to farmers in Ireland at the moment is we have a scheme that works, that is sustainable and that has the key stakeholders involved.  That means that from year to year, we provide farmers with a top-quality, cost-effective service.  The solution is us; we are the solution.  We see no need for a change in legislation.  There is a problem with independent collectors that got into difficulty but, as I said, that is for others to sort out.</p></speech>

On expanding the representation to reflect fully the farming community, will Mr. Moloney give a commitment that IFFPG will engage with the other farming representative bodies and invite them to put forward a representative to sit on the board?</p> <p>  On the Walker Recycling Services issue, I accept that formal notification was not issued until 4 June, but it is quite possible that there was some indicative conversation on 16 May.  Did IFFPG seek legal advice before it had any conversation with or issued that letter to Walker Recycling Services?  Given that it had operated with IFFPG for 15 years, the latter is probably its main contractor.  There is an implicit and implied contract with the company that would leave IFFPG open, in all likelihood, to having to compensate it for the termination of the contract.  Did IFFPG seek legal advice before it made that decision?</p></speech>

Let us be clear as to why that happened.  It was terminated because it was in the liquidation process.  It was no longer able to provide a service for us.  We did not terminate its contract before liquidation or that this made any contribution to the liquidation process.  It went into liquidation because it had severe financial problems, not because IFFPG was not supporting it.  As I said, we supported it to the hilt and gave it record quantities of plastic for its recycling plant.  There were eight counties in which it was providing a collection service and we could not have supported it any more.  Despite that, unfortunately, its financial circumstances were such that it went into liquidation, and subsequent to that, we terminated its contract.</p></speech>

Senator Lombard put it accurately in regard to the significant volume of plastic out there, with the levy paid on it, that is causing an environmental problem, although we can argue about the tonnage.  It is an issue that will have to be addressed.  Mr. Moloney has made it clear that it is not IFFPG's problem and I fully accept where he is coming from.  He made that clear and he has been distinct on it.  Nevertheless, it is an issue that will have to be dealt with and I hope we can get a resolution.  I appreciate the IFFPG representatives coming back before the committee today, after such a short interval, to give us an update on where we are.</p></speech>

I apologise for whatever went wrong in the beginning when I could not make contact.  I probably did something wrong with my computer.  I do not know but I apologise for that anyway.</p> <p>  I am a director of Walker Recycling Services Limited and my company is in voluntary liquidation, having a registered office at Clonkeen, Portlaoise, County Laois.  My company has been recycling plastic for upwards of 15 years.  Parts of our recycling facility include shredding, trommelling and other equipment purchased approximately four years ago at a cost of &euro;850,000 plus auxiliary equipment at a cost of approximately &euro;350,000.</p> <p>  The company has been contracted to the Irish Farm Films Producers Group, IFFPG, for upwards of 15 years and part of this work included the use of the aforementioned machines to shred and trommel plastic to clean it so it could be treated as green waste.  At the beginning of this year requirements in respect of green list waste changed and it is now necessary to establish any contamination of product at 4% or less.  This contamination could be water, grit or similar materials.  This cannot be hazardous waste but it is contamination, meaning the plastic would be classified as amber waste.</p> <p>  This resulted in a bond being required to export amber waste and the requirement for the volume recycled by Walker Recycling Services was beyond the financial capacity of the company.  We have been recycling waste for the IFFPG with these machines since their purchase and we also did it with earlier machines.</p> <p>  On or about the morning of 18 May I was telephoned by the chief executive officer of the IFFPG and verbally informed that the contract with Walker Recycling Services was to be terminated.  I cannot account for how such a decision was made, especially in circumstances where we had the only facility for trommelling waste.  With economic conditions in the plastics market worldwide and other economic restrictions, I found the company in a position where we were advised to hold a creditors' meeting, following which a liquidator, Mr. David Walsh, was appointed on 1 June 2021.  The company is not currently in a position to provide any recycling services.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Walker for coming before us.  I want to clarify some comments arising from what previous witnesses have said.  Mr. Walker contacted me from his hospital bed and apologised to me because it could have been a Saturday or Friday night.  He said it was late but I told him it was no problem.  That was a day or two days after the first meeting we had here and he said the contract had been terminated and he could not get bonds and the company would end up in liquidation.  Will Mr. Walker clarify that?</p> <p>  I drove to meet Mr. Walker on a Sunday evening after that to find out exactly what happened because we had only spoken on the phone.  He verified what he said.

They are very welcome.  We have received their opening statement, which has been circulated to members.  We are limited in our time due to Covid, so the committee has agreed that the opening statement will be taken as read so that the full session can be used for question and answers.  The opening statement will be published on the Oireachtas website and will be publicly available.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I want to read an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege with respect to the evidence you are to give to the committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting who are located outside of the parliamentary precinct are asked to note that the constitutional protection afforded to those participating within the parliamentary precinct does not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on all whether or the extent to which participation is covered by absolute privilege.  </p> <p>  I now invite questions from members.  Deputy Leddin asked me to let him in first on this earlier.  I will honour my commitment.</p></speech>

I wish to ask Mr. McDonald about the design of the scheme and alternatives.  We heard today and on previous occasions that the recycling rate for farm plastics is very high and stands at approximately 80%.  Farmers are to be commended for taking part in what is a very successful scheme.  Perhaps Mr. McDonald could indicate what might be the position if there was a fully market led system for the recycling of farm plastics, based on the experience of other sectors, and even jurisdictions, and whether he is aware of how such a system might compare in terms of recycling rates.</p></speech>

The farm plastic scheme is one of a suite of what we call extended producer responsibility, EPR, schemes.  This EPR model is an environmental approach whereby the responsibility for a product is extended beyond the post-consumer stage of a product's life cycle.  It has been a very successful model that we have used in a number of waste streams in Ireland over several years.  People may be familiar with the schemes for electrical equipment, packaging, end-of-life vehicles, tyres and so on.  The farm plastic scheme is run by the IFFPG.</p> <p>  From my reading of the matter going back over a number of years, the basis for the introduction of EPR schemes came from EU initiatives.  That was essentially because the market had not addressed the issue of this waste arising from waste streams, be it electrical products, tires and so on.  We found these schemes provide stability in dealing with a waste stream.  This is stability that one would not get in a privatised arena.  As we have seen from discussions at the committee earlier and back in May, if a market is subject to fluctuations that is very bad news for the waste arising from it.</p> <p>  As we have seen here, private contractors entered the market on the basis of a commercial decision that they would have made.  When that environment changed, we were left to deal with the issue being discussed.  EPR schemes were introduced to bring stability to a waste collection stream, a stability that they would not get if they were subject to standard market forces.  They have been successful in that. </p> <p>  The model we have in Ireland is that each EPR scheme is run by a system operator.  The operator is appointed on approval to the Minister and there are various targets and so on set out for the operator.  IFFPG has met those targets.  They were approved again earlier this year.  As the Deputy said, we are happy that the recycling rate approximately 70% - in the most recent report the figure was 80%.  I do not think one would get that level of performance if there was a simple private sector model.</p></speech>

How does the IFFPG scheme compare?  I understand that the legislation allows for a deposit and return type scheme, but I am not aware of any instances of that in this country.  Perhaps Mr. McDonald could discuss the potential for such a scheme.</p></speech>

The model that is used successfully by IFFPG is the EPR model.  As the Deputy is aware, we are considering DRS schemes in other waste streams, specifically plastic bottles and so on.</p><p>The model that is operating in Ireland is the EPR scheme, through the system operator, the IFFPG.  All of the system operators that operate these EPR schemes, including Repak, companies that operate end-of-life vehicle schemes, WEEE Ireland and others, must go through a rigorous process for approval approximately every five years.  The standard is quite high.  These companies are obviously run on a not-for-profit basis.  We like to think the bar is set quite high.  The approval is not just done on the nod.  Anyone who is looking to operate as a system operator has a relatively onerous list of things they have to show us they are capable of performing.</p></speech>

If I am buying a new fridge, I can leave the old fridge with the guy I am buying the new fridge from and he has the responsibility for disposing of it safely.  It is a similar situation if I am buying new tyres for my car.</p></speech>

Farmers pay &euro;160 per tonne.  That goes to one company but that company does not have an obligation to ensure that the product is safely disposed of and recycled.  The company has an obligation for 70% of that material and therein lies the problem.  I was taken aback by some of the comments considering the IFFPG is a not-for-profit organisation.  There has been a dismissive attitude towards the potential 20% or 30% that may be left outstanding.  I would certainly not support a privatised approach that would leave it to the industry but is the Department analysing other mechanisms by which this can be done more successfully?  This is a different type of waste, in that if it is not collected, it can land in our rivers and countryside.  It can be bulky and damaging to biodiversity, habitats and all the rest of it.  Even 20% can be a substantial amount of waste.  What level of examination of the process does the Department undergo?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.302" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul McDonald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#KK00600"><p>The approval process is where we examine the performance of the IFFPG and its running of this scheme.  The figure of 70% to 80% of collection for recycling is extremely positive.  It is probably unheard of.  We are not aware of a problem having arisen with the proper disposal of this material.  We are looking at an 80% collection rate, based on the amount placed on the market each year.  As the committee has heard at this meeting and at previous meetings, farmers do not deal with this product on a yearly basis.  If stuff is placed on the market, it is perhaps purchased and may not be brought for recycling for two, three or four years.  There is a roll-over effect in that regard.  However, an 80% collection rate is extremely impressive.  We are happy with how the scheme has operated.</p> <p>  The test of the scheme is done when the system operator comes in for its approval.  That approval process takes a number of months.  We go through everything from the accounts of the system operator, how it approaches governance and how it is performing generally.  It is only after that process has been gone through that we would recommend approval of a system operator to the Minister.  That is what has happened in this case.</p></speech>

We heard earlier about private collectors who are essentially doing the same job as the IFFPG but do not receive any portion of the levy that is mandatory for those who are purchasing the product.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.304" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul McDonald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#KK00800"><p>To my mind, this question of contravening competition law does not arise.  It is open to any corporate body that wishes to pitch for this business to seek approval to become a system operator.  It is open to anybody to do that.  Any such body would go through the normal stress-testing that is applied to the IFFPG.  Other EPR schemes currently exist.  We referred earlier to the scheme that applies for electrical equipment.  There are, for example, two system operators in that space.  Any corporate body that wants to set up as a system operator to rival the IFFPG would have to go through the same provisions from the point of view of corporate governance, contingency reserve funds and all of that type of stuff.</p></speech>

We can assume none of those collectors would be anywhere close to the IFFPG.  The difficulty I have is that far from being a polluter-pays system where producers have responsibility, producers are instead being let off the hook.  They collect the levy from farmers but once it goes outside the producers' gates, because none of them are collecting sale-and-return or deposit-and-return schemes, it becomes somebody else's problem.</p></speech>

When a farmer buys the product, he or she pays the levy.  When the farmer has finished using it and wants to present it for recycling, it is collected through the farm collection scheme or it can be brought to some of the bring centres.  As the IFFPG has stated, 100% of what is presented to them for collection is collected.  It is quite an efficient scheme.  We have also heard that the cost to individual farmers averages out at somewhere around &euro;65 or &euro;70 per annum.  It seems to be an efficient scheme for a relatively modest sum of money per annum.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021062900002#KK01100"><p>I will reiterate the point that the difficulty I have with the scheme is that a company, a not-for-profit company but a company nonetheless, is getting &euro;160 for every tonne of plastic that is sold without having the obligation even to attempt to collect it all.  There is no obligation on the company to collect it all.   The scheme, therefore, de facto recognises that a significant portion of this plastic is unaccounted for.  In the long term, that is unsustainable.  To repeat a question I asked earlier, is Mr. McDonald satisfied that it is appropriate that two thirds of that waste is potentially exported?</p></speech>

We support them in that regard.  We discussed that topic in detail with the IFFPG during the most recent approval process and its commitment to the circular economy.  We have a proximity principle here.  We try to ensure that as much of this material as possible is dealt with on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>  The waste action plan for a circular economy which we produced last September had a chapter specifically on the indigenous treatment capacity for waste material.  One of the commitments we made in that, and subject to provisions around state aid and so on, was that we would look to convene a meeting of the various stakeholders to try to see how we could push this out as much as possible to ensure that as much of this material as possible is dealt with here in Ireland.</p><p>On the figure for the levy, the levy is the levy.  It is collected by the IFFPG and it goes into the group's operating costs.  It is used, as Mr. Moloney has outlined, in its operating costs in running what is a very efficient system.  The target is 70% and the group has collected close to 80% in the last year.</p></speech>

To follow on, the current system has been in operation since 1998 and it has evolved over a period to where we are today.  While we cannot change the system here overnight does the Department, as the Department with responsibility for the environment, appreciate that the 30% of plastic waste on which there is no obligation on the IFFPG to collect would and could be a problem environmentally?</p></speech>

As I was saying earlier on, with this rolling-on of the farmers not presenting this for collection on an annual basis, and if that is what was done, maybe that figure is a little bit off.  If there is a gap there, we would like to establish where that problem is.  From what has come out in the most recent meeting today and the previous meeting, the nub of the problem seems to be a portion of this plastic has been collected over the last number of years by private contractors who, because of the market fluctuations, are now not in a position to deal with that.  There may be an issue there.  The figure of somewhere between 10,000 and 12,000 tonnes of this material lying around the country has come out.  That could well present an environmental threat, yes.</p></speech>

It claimed that today and the last day.  Its representatives are almost shouting from the rooftops that they hit 80%.  That leaves 20% of the recorded plastic unaccounted for now the private contractors have gone out of the market.  That is not to mention the illegal plastic, for want of a better word, that is coming in from the North and which does not have a code and is not being accounted for when the levy is collected.  On the environmental aspect of that, we will not go there; it should not be here and it came in illegally but it is here now and it is going to be a problem.</p> <p>  We all know why we are here today.  This is our second meeting on this matter.  The fact is that the market for exporting or moving this plastic on has collapsed.  The private contractors are going out of business.  There is nothing in it for them.  They were covering that slack and Mr. McDonald has admitted we were damn glad to have the private contractors because they were actually making sure the 25% to 30% we have not accounted for in our legislation or in our contract with the IFFPG was being looked after.  It is now not feasible for them to do that, for commercial reasons.  What is the Department's proposal to sort out that problem now, in the market we have today, and allowing for the fact there are thousands of tonnes stacked up in various yards or fields around the country?  We all know how we got here.  I hate the statement but we are where we are.  I want to hear from the officials what the Department is proposing as a solution to solve the problem and clear the blight, going forward.</p></speech>

I do not know why individual farmers and so on would have gone to the private contractors as opposed to the IFFPG.  I am not aware of what the pricing structure is but to use the Senator's own expression, we are where we are.  It seems, again, that there is 10,000 tonnes to 12,000 tonnes of this material.  The onus for dealing with that material rests primarily with those contractors.  It rests primarily with them to deal with it.  As I understand it, they all have waste permits and have certain obligations under that to deal with this material.  The onus for dealing with this material rests primarily on those contractors.

For the purposes of debate, could we park what is stockpiled and wind the clock forward to the 2021 baling and silaging season?  The private contractors, as we all know now, are gone off the pitch.  The IFFPG is going to collect 75% to 80% of the plastic.  When there are no private contractors on the pitch, who is responsible for the disposal or recycling of the additional 30% of plastic this year?  We should remember the farmer who will have it in his or her yard has paid a levy on it for the recycling and disposal of it.  Who in the Department's view has responsibility for that this year?</p></speech>

If that is the case for the next season, I do not know this for certain but I imagine the IFFPG has capacity to deal with an increased push on this.  I do not see it as the private contractors filling a gap that could not have been filled by the IFFPG.  I am not convinced of that.</p></speech>

As Mr. McDonald said himself it got a new five-year rollover approval last year.  When that is happening, is that position put out to public tender?  When the Department is rewriting the group's contract every five years or reviewing its performance for approval of the coming five years, do the parties have this conversation about the 70%?  Has the Department every suggested that perhaps, for the next five years it will try to set it at 80%, 85%, 90% or God between us and all harm, 100%?</p></speech>

It is not a licence as such but an approval.  It is quite a rigorous procedure.  We take advice from some of the experts within the Department and look at what is happening internationally to get a figure.  That figure was 70%, which is an aggressive, onerous figure in any recycling scheme or any extended producer responsibility scheme.  That it is an onerous figure would stand up to any objective scrutiny.  The IFFPG has performed well as a system operator in exceeding that.</p></speech>

It is a process that takes at least six months or thereabouts.  As I said in response to a question from Deputy Carthy, if a corporate body or individual seeks approval to run a scheme to operate as a system operator, that opportunity exists.  If such bodies or individuals can show the Department their ability to reach the bar set from the point of view of corporate governance, a business plan, contingency funds and all of that, on that basis there is no question and it is not provided for in the regulations that the approval must be advertised.  It is open at any stage for a corporate body to apply to become a system operator for this EPR scheme.</p></speech>

Is he concerned that a witness stated he has 6,000 tonnes of plastic belonging to the IFFPG, and the IFFPG stated in response it understood there were 1,000 tonnes of plastic involved?  Is Mr. McDonald concerned, in terms of carrying out the Department's checks and balances, there is a discrepancy of 5,000 tonnes of plastic on the part of an operator which was supplying the IFFPG?  Have officials visited the IFFPG's different collectors to calculate the tonnage involved, given the Department was awarding the system operator's licence?  I am an ordinary Joe Soap and one can argue as to whose product this is.  There are 25,000 tonnes of plastic around the country which will cause a major problem.</p></speech>

As I understood it, there was a conflict between what Mr. Moloney understood and what Mr. Walker understood.  That will take its course.</p> <p>  When we go through this approval procedure with the IFFPG or any of the other system operators, a relatively forensic examination is taken of how they are performing and what the general environment in their particular field is.  It is only relatively recently we have become aware of the problem of the stockpiling of material by these private contractors who-----</p></speech>

If we go by what Mr. Waker said, he was a supplier and that plastic he referenced is from last year, as none of that product has come in yet for this year.  There is a large volume of plastic in other yards around the country.  Is Mr. McDonald concerned about that?  If there are 25,000 tonnes of plastic around the country and 10,000 or 11,000 tonnes of it owned by the IFFPG, is he concerned about that?  Does he know the volume of plastic that is being brought across the Border given that it is two thirds the price there from what I hear?</p> <p>  I am a baling contractor.  I have to give a farmer the number for every bit of plastic I give them because it has to be done legitimately and when they go to a bring centre, they can produce that number.  I want Mr. McDonald to deal with this question separately.  If a private operator gathers plastic and has all the numbers attached to each roll of plastic, is there is not an obligation on that operator to collect the plastic when the levy has been paid on it?  Is a simple yes-no answer to that question.</p></speech>

I am not singling the IFFPG out but is there not an obligation on whosoever is the service provider or system operator to accept that plastic for the simple reason the levy has already been paid on it?</p></speech>

As was touched on, an enforcement brief is held by the local authorities and they would try to counter that.  A figure of around 5% was mentioned but it would be a matter of concern.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's second point, the Department does not carry out individual inspections of any of the contractors.  That comes under the approval of the IFFPG.  It would recruit its own contractors and so on and that would be part of the brief of its system operation approval.</p></speech>

I understand it revolutionised how they carried out their operations.  To have the benefit of a product like that, at an average operating cost of approximately &euro;65 per annum, represents good value.  On that basis, I agree with previous evidence given that the system operates well and provides a good service to the farming community.</p></speech>

We all appreciate that 80% is a good rate of collection but 20% of plastics is a massive amount to leave sitting around.  It is just not good enough.  The officials told us that the Department is setting a target of 70% for the IFFPG every year but that company is still getting 100% of the levy.  What would happen if I priced a house for Mr. McDonald and built 70% of it but took 100% of the money?  He would come after me for the other 30% to get it finished somehow.  It is not good value for public money that the Department is setting a target of only 70% for a company that is getting 100% of the levy.</p> <p>  We heard about Mr. Walker earlier.  Why are departmental officials so quiet about what happened in that case?  Have they anything to say about it?  Are officials worried that the waste management infrastructure, whether it is recycling or farm plastics, is falling apart?</p></speech>

Of the 100% that is placed on the market, if IFFPG collects 80%, it is not my understanding that the other 20% appears in ditches and so on or is illegally dumped.  There is a roll-over position whereby farmers buy for one year but may take up to five years before the plastic is presented again.  On the IFFPG figure, as its representatives stated, it collects 100% of what is presented to it.  I again emphasise that the Department engages IFFPG as a system operator.  It knows more about this business than I do.  Mr. Moloney stated earlier, and I agree, that a collection figure of 100% is just not attainable.  It does not happen.  The figure of 70% to 80% is a remarkably efficient one that is set for IFFPG and for which it accounts each year.</p></speech>

I have been working over the last week and I got someone to come to remove stuff for me.  If he had left 20% or 40% of what I asked him to move in my front yard but, while I was away, my wife paid him 100% of the money, by God, I would be fairly angry when I got home for the weekend.  It is time departmental officials started pushing a crowd like IFFPG, who are taking 100% of the levy while farmers are paying at both ends.  Maybe officials should start getting angry with the likes of the IFFPG.</p></speech>

I referred to the waste action plan for the circular economy that we produced last September.  A chapter in that is devoted specifically to the indigenous treatment of waste in Ireland.  We stress to all our system operators that they operate a proximity principle and to recycle as much product as they can in Ireland.  There are some issues around State aid and so on that we have to look at before we could impose any regime on this, but in the waste action plan we committed to engagement with all stakeholders to try to increase the amount of indigenous capacity for waste material in Ireland.</p></speech>

Taking that into consideration, over the 23-year period of the scheme has there ever been a situation where we had 110% recycling?  In that scenario, there would be 110% or 120% recycling going through the scheme.  Can Mr. McDonald give a breakdown, by year, of when we peaked in recycling?</p> <p>  I do not know much about Mr. Moloney and Mr. Walker.  I just sat and listened to their testimony.

There is difference of 5,000 tonnes.  Mr. Moloney and Mr. Walker came before an Oireachtas committee today.  Committees are a significant part of what we do in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and we have a major discrepancy in figures representing a huge amount of plastic.  The Department is the one with due responsibility.  He sat and listened to that testimony.  What steps will Mr. McDonald now take to clarify this situation as we go forward?  We will need to get clarity.  This committee deserves it, one way or the other.  As I said, I do not know the two individuals at all but we need clarity.  I will ask the Department and Mr. McDonald to correspond with the committee and to inform us about what they will do to ensure that clarity is provided in respect of that issue.</p> <p>  On the amount of plastic at certain locations throughout the country, mainly on private land - although this is not always so, sometimes it is on land connected to the scheme - is Mr. McDonald happy with these stockpiles of plastic?  I have heard stories of yards full of plastic throughout the county, although I have not seen it for myself.  What will the Department do about that issue?  Strictly speaking, it comes down to policy and the Department.  What will the Department do to ensure that this major issue is dealt with?</p></speech>

Following two meetings on this matter, the Department will be very aware that it is a serious issue for the committee.  There is a great deal of concern, especially in light of the testimony we heard from representatives of the two companies.  We accept, to a point, that 80% is a relatively good take-up but nothing short of 100% of collection of plastics throughout the country is an acceptable goal for us.</p> <p>  In summary, we would like to see ongoing engagement with the Department on this.  Given what we have learned during the past two meetings, this issue has been ramped up our agenda.  Regarding focus and how big a priority this is for the Department, and based on the concerns we raised, has this issue been scaled up by the Department to where it is seen as a priority?  What reassurance can we be given that departmental officials will go away from the meeting today and that we will see meaningful engagement on trying to meet that 100% target?</p></speech>

That was just to illustrate a point.</p><p>I do not believe the Senator, in referring to the rates of 80% and 100%, is dealing with exactly the same things because there is confusing input into the equation concerning the time farmers may take before disposal.  However, I fully take the point on whether the rate, at some stage, goes over 100%.  It may well have done.  I cannot say definitively whether it did but, considering the figures for what has been collected through the scheme and what some of the private operators may have collected, the amount in question well have been exceeded at some point in the year.  Again, however, it is something of a matter of mathematical confusion.  I was making my point just to illustrate that it is not quite as clearcut as it might seem.</p><p> On the point made on the discrepancy in the evidence given by Mr. Moloney and Mr. Walker, it certainly jumped out at me that there is a discrepancy.  We will certainly take that up.  I would be happy to revert to the committee to clarify how it might be rectified.</p><p> The stockpiling issue has come up relatively recently.  Regarding the problem concerning private contractors who had engaged in the practice, it is only relatively recently that we have become aware of stockpiling.  As Mr. Moloney said earlier, there may be stockpiles in some of the IFFPG facilities.  These are checked regularly by local authorities and so on and meet the standards so I do not believe they would pose an environmental threat.  That may well not be the case in other instances.  We will have to address that through our colleagues in the local authority sector.  We are aware of one stockpile that has been subject to a judicial process, in Waterford.  I believe there are over 5,000 tonnes involved.  The onus for dealing with the stockpiles rests primarily and initially with the private contractors.  It is their responsibility.  They would have committed to it under the terms of their waste permits.</p><p> To return to Deputy Flaherty, I am more than happy to engage on an ongoing basis with the committee on this.  This is an issue that has gained a lot of prominence recently.  We are happy to monitor it through our engagement with the system operator in the first instance and also with our colleagues in the local authority sector who look after the enforcement side.  The issue has a degree of prominence in the Department and this will continue.  I am more than happy to keep the committee apprised of our progress on that.</p></speech>

I heard Mr. McDonald say the plastic is not the responsibility of the Department.  There is a considerable amount of plastic to be dealt with.  It poses a monumental challenge.  Farmers have paid the levy on it.  I am aware that environmental conditions have changed for the people who collected it.  We are not going to start disputing that.  It was profitable to collect plastic in the past and now it is not.  I hope we will have a homegrown solution for our plastic in the very near future.  I was in the recycling plant in Littleton on Monday and I was impressed with it.  Its throughput will only improve.  We have a homegrown solution.  For those who have plastic stockpiled, the economic viability of being able to get it moved is very questionable.  The farmers have paid a levy and we do not want an environmental issue arising over plastics.  I strongly urge the Department to consider solutions as to how we can get this plastic moved and recycled.  We are here with no agenda today other than to make sure the plastic is dealt with environmentally correctly.  Therefore, I ask Mr. McDonald to listen to what the committee members have said today.  This issue has to be dealt with.</p></speech>

Any environmental threat posed by any waste stream is one that we would treat very seriously.  I listened very carefully to the evidence today and at the other meeting.  We will engage in a meaningful way to try to resolve this issue.</p></speech>

I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or to otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if a witness&rsquo;s statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, he or she will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  All the witnesses are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, so there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness who is physically present.</p> <p>  Members of the committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contributions to the meeting.  For anyone watching this meeting online, Members of the Oireachtas and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chair, and the necessary staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these circumstances, and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask that everyone bear with us should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  I call on Ms Finegan to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sharon Finegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021062900002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to the EPA to contribute to its analysis of how the targets in the Climate Action Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 will be met.  I am the director of the office of environmental sustainability in the EPA.  I am joined by my colleagues, Dr. Frank McGovern, chief climate scientist, and Mr. Stephen Treacy, senior manager with the emissions statistics team.<br/><br/>The EPA has a wide range of statutory responsibilities in the area of climate change and regards these responsibilities and their implementation to be a cornerstone of the both current and future climate action plans.  These include: preparation of national greenhouse gas inventories and projections assessment and reporting; development and implementation of climate change research activities, including leading on co-ordination of national research on climate change in Ireland, provision of a five-year assessment report, engagement with the EU Horizon Europe programme and chairing the pan-European joint programme initiative on climate; implementation of flexible market mechanisms established at EU and UN levels, including the EU emissions trading scheme; state of the environment reporting and strategic environmental assessment; circular economy and food waste initiatives; advice and assistance to local authorities; industrial and chemical regulation.  In addition, the EPA has responsibility for a number of other areas relevant to climate action including: the development and future hosting of the climate information portal Climate Ireland, which is to support the implementation of the national adaptation framework; raising public awareness of climate change issues through the national dialogue on climate change; providing expert support for engagement with EU and UN bodies dealing with climate change; representing Ireland at meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC; providing climate science support to the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications at meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC.  We would be happy to provide the committee with further information about these responsibilities if required.<br/><br/>Moving to national policy, in 2020, the EPA published our state of the environment report, which found that the overall quality of Ireland&rsquo;s environment is not what it should be, and the outlook is not optimistic unless we accelerate action.  The report identified the need for national and sectoral action and full and early implementation of plans and programmes.  It highlighted the need for an overarching national environmental policy position that integrates and delivers across multiple related strategies, plans and programmes.  This recognises that environmental issues and challenges such as climate change, air quality, water quality and biodiversity cannot be looked at in isolation as they are complex, interconnected and need to be tackled in an integrated way.</p><p>The state of the environment report contains a which concludes that change is now required in the sector to ensure its environmental sustainability, particularly in view of the fact that the sector is responsible for approximately one third of national greenhouse gas emissions and more than 99% of national ammonia emissions, and has been identified as the largest significant pressure on our water resources.  While the focus of today&rsquo;s discussion is climate change and, therefore, greenhouse gas emissions, the negative trends in water quality, ammonia emissions and biodiversity must be considered in tandem.<br/><br/>The EPA is responsible for compiling inventories and projections of greenhouse gas emissions for Ireland and for reporting the resulting data to the EU and UN.  The inventories and projections are subject to EU and UN expert review to ensure transparency, accuracy, completeness, consistency and comparability with those of other parties.<br/><br/>Preparing the EPA projections involves obtaining and processing key data sets such as energy projections, including, for example, projected fuel sales, animal numbers and emissions from industry, businesses and homes in Ireland.  The EPA produced two scenarios in preparing these greenhouse gas emissions projections.  Those were a with existing measures, WEM, scenario and a with additional measures, WAM, scenario.  These scenarios forecast Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions in different ways.  The WEM scenario assumes that no additional policies and measures beyond those already in place by the end of 2019, the year of the most recent national greenhouse gas emission inventory, will be implemented.  The WAM scenario assumes that in addition to the existing measures, there will also be full implementation of planned Government policies and measures to reduce emissions such as those in the Climate Action Plan 2019.<br/><br/>Last week, the EPA published its to 2a copy of which was provided to the members of the committee in advance and which is also available on the EPA website.  The projections show that Ireland is projected to have exceeded its 2013 to 2020 EU effort-sharing decision target by 12.2 Mt of CO<sub>2</sub>equivalent, but that it can meet its current EU 2021 to 2030 target with full implementation of the measures in the Climate Action Plan 2019.  This would result in a 2% per annum emissions reduction pathway from 2021 to 2030, and 24% less greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 than in 2018. <br/><br/>The projections show the impact of Covid-19 lockdown on emissions for 2020 and 2021 as a result of a dramatic decline in economic activity and travel in the short term.  To avoid a surge in emissions as the economy recovers, as a minimum the full range of actions already committed to must be implemented without delay.  It is projected that the sectors with the largest emissions in 2030 will be agriculture, transport and energy industries, with 39.7%, 19% and 13.3%, respectively, coming from these.  For each of these main sectors, the measures which are included in the projections and will give rise to the reductions to bring us in line with our 2030 targets are as follows.  In transport, almost 1 million electric vehicles, EVs, will be on our roads by 2030, including 840,000 passenger EVs and 95,000 electric vans and trucks.  This will help achieve a projected additional emission saving from the sector of 13.2 Mt of CO<sub>2</sub>equivalent over the period 2021 to 2030.<br/><br/>In energy, renewable energy will provide 70% of electricity generated.  This will give rise to a 25% reduction in energy industries emissions by 2030 requiring both onshore and offshore wind energy projects.  <br/><br/>In residential emissions, the installation of 600,000 heat pumps and the retrofitting of 500,000 homes for improved energy efficiency by 2030 is projected to reduce the energy used for space and water heating in our homes by 44% by 2030.<br/><br/>The agriculture sector contributed more than 35.4% of Ireland's total emissions in 2019.  This is projected to rise to 40% by 2030 under the WAM scenario.  Agriculture's dominant role within our economy contrasts with our European peers and is reflected in Ireland&rsquo;s current and future emissions profile.  Agriculture sector emissions arise from enteric fermentation, that is, methane emissions arising from the digestive process in livestock, manure management and nitrogen and urea application to soils.  In addition, fuel combustion from agriculture, forestry and fishing is included under agriculture in our summary national reports.<br/><br/>In 2019, the emissions of greenhouse gases from agriculture comprised 67% methane, 31% nitrous oxide and 2% carbon dioxide, with this proportion remaining relatively stable over time due to the relative importance of ruminant livestock farming in Ireland.<br/><br/>The data underpinning the agriculture projections are based the latest analysis undertaken by Teagasc of the projected national herd population, crop areas and fertiliser use which takes into account Food Wise 2025 policy targets and reflects international food prices and trends in agricultural production at the time of preparing the projected activity data.<br/><br/>The WAM scenario assumes a total of 16.5 Mt of CO<sub>2</sub>equivalent of mitigation over the period 2021 to 2030, attributable to measures in Ireland&rsquo;s climate action plan, largely the implementation of those measures included in the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve.  Some of the key measures include nitrogen use efficiency, use of protected urea products, improved animal health, extended grazing, reducing crude protein in pigs, low-emission slurry spreading and the inclusion of clover in pasture swards.<br/><br/>As referenced earlier, EPA data show that economic growth in the agrifood sector in recent years is happening at the expense of the environment, as evidenced by trends in emissions, water quality and biodiversity all going in the wrong direction.  Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a food producer with a low environmental footprint is at risk of being irreversibly damaged.  Business-as-usual scenarios will not reverse these trends.  New measures must go beyond improving efficiencies and focus on reducing total emissions by breaking the link between animal numbers, fertiliser use and deteriorating water quality.<b> </b>Developments in farming practices, technologies and efficiencies, which present opportunities for greater profitability, cannot be and need not be a trade-off for the quality of Ireland&rsquo;s environment, either now or in the future.  The adoption of a more holistic farm and catchment-level approach, encompassing all environmental pressures, will be fundamental to progress towards more environmentally sustainable and carbon-neutral food production.  Actions that can be adopted quickly and effectively to stabilise methane emissions should be underpinned by policy measures. Measurable, reportable and verifiable data and on-the-ground verificationof their use for inclusion in national emissions inventory and projection estimates is required and should be an action within the new climate action plan.<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s climate transition is about people, communities, businesses and regions.  Moving towards a climate-neutral and resilient economy and society can be successful only when the barriers to transition are understood and accompanied by effective communication and engagement across sectors and society.  This will facilitate the demonstration and realisation of the benefits and opportunities for the country as a whole.<br/><br/>We are happy to answer any questions that the Chairman or committee members have.</p></speech>

In the meantime, I will ask Ms Finegan or her colleagues to take us through the two scenarios, WEM and WAM.  Ms Finegan can correct me if I am wrong, but I am mindful that the EPA is looking at the measures in the Climate Action Plan 2019.  Has modelling been done commensurate with the new ambition, namely, the 51% reduction in emissions compared with 2018 levels as per the programme for Government commitment and the climate action Bill?</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague, Mr. Treacy, to talk the committee through the WAM and the WEM in a moment.  I will, as an opening position, respond to the Chairman's question about increased ambition.  The projections do not look at the targets but at the measures that have been identified to achieve those targets.  The process for the delivery of the projections is identifying and working through those measures and then quantifying the emissions reductions that are likely to be achieved.</p><p>We have not yet worked through that piece regarding the step up to 51% because we do not have the measures.  The measures have not been identified by the Government.  I will ask Mr. Treacy to talk the committee through the WAM and WEM.</p></speech>

These measures include combined animal-related measures such as the economic breeding index, EBI, beef genomics, etc., amounting to close to 14 million tonnes, and then measures on the nitrogen side such as a ban on urea fertiliser and increased use of inhibited urea and proposed fertiliser sales targets identified in the Ag Climatise strategy.  The combined fertilising measures add anything up to almost 5 million tonnes.  There are a number of other measures in relation to what is in Ag Climatise and the climate action plan such as liming and crude protein reduction in dairy cow and pig feed rations.</p> <p>  The existing measures scenario does not assume any of these measures so it is essentially a without measures for agriculture except for those elements which are already taking place and are in the inventory.  As Ms Finegan pointed out, the 51% reduction is not factored into any of these scenarios yet because the measures have not been identified to date.</p></speech>

This would be a key message, and was a key message for the agency last week in publishing those projections, that in order to realise those benefits we need to see full implementation.  It is important to set the target and to identify the measures through which we are going to achieve those targets, but it is the implementation that will realise the savings, which will then be seen in the inventories.  The inventories is the historic piece.  The projections is looking ahead to what we have quantified will be the outworking of the policy once it has been implemented.  Implementation is the key piece and that is an important distinction between the with existing measures and with additional measures.  The with additional measures have identified the steps the Government is going to take but they have not yet been implemented.  That is important when you consider the step up to 51%.</p></speech>

There was lots of grave information in it and I suppose it is only scratching the surface of the different scenarios and the situation that we find ourselves in.  If it is okay, I would like to focus on the agriculture element, and I know the witnesses touched on transport and energy.  I would like more information on some of the potential measures that could be used in order for agriculture to achieve reductions in emissions.  For many people, it is a very difficult conversation to have, that is, how we decarbonise agriculture and how we reduce emissions.  It is not helped by false information about what needs to happen.  What the witnesses outlined there seem like very achievable measures that can be taken and that would not necessarily severely impact farmers' income or the viability of farming.  Could the witnesses touch on them individually?  The ones mentioned were nitrogen use efficiency and the use of protected urea products.  Extended grazing was also mentioned.  What is meant by that and how would that contribute to a reduction in emissions?  The witnesses mentioned the reduction in crude protein in pigs but I assume there is cattle feed as well that can be amended or developed that would reduce emissions of biogenic methane.  I refer to low emissions slurry-spreading.  We often hear these terms but what do they mean?  How much is current slurry spreading contributing to emissions and how can the technologies change it to ensure that it has less of an impact?</p> <p>  I have not heard a full explanation about how inclusion of clover in swards, and mixed species swards, will contribute to a reduction of emissions.  If at all possible, I would like a bit more detail on those issues, as it would really help the conversation on how we form future climate action plans.</p></speech>

There were some great questions there.  What I might do, just to break the answer to this question down, is give some overall detail about what some of those measures might look like.  Then I might ask my colleague, Mr. Treacy, to give a sense of the contribution that each of these aspects make to our emissions inventories currently and to give a sense of the scale and the quantum.  I  might ask Mr. Treacy or Dr. McGovern to mention the feed additives piece because that is a complex piece.</p> <p>  I should say at the outset that Teagasc is the real expert in this area and really understands how each of these measures will interact with the inventories and the greenhouse gas emission impact.  On the use of protected urea, a key measure which will also enhance improved air and water quality is the use of protected urea in place of other less environmentally sustainable fertilisers.  The research from Teagasc shows that using urea nitrogen fertiliser offers the single largest emission reduction potential to Irish farmers.  Protected urea is reported by Teagasc as a cost-effective option so it is a win-win for the industry and its use is further supported by the marginal abatement cost curve by Teagasc.  It is essentially using a fertiliser which will have a less damaging impact on the environment.  We have already seen some benefits from that particular policy.</p> <p>  Measures for nutrient management add multiple environmental benefits.  Around that is education and training in conjunction with the national agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme.  Soil at optimum fertility at soil pH status recycles nutrients more effectively, which should lead to a reduction in inputs for the same or increased levels of grass and crop production, while also reducing nutrient loss.  There are wide-ranging positive impacts of this for environmental pressures and again a win-win solution from both the environmental and the economic standpoint and from the point of view of farmers.</p> <p>  In catchments with well-known nitrogen pollution, which is causing nitrogen emissions to water, it is essential that measures are implemented immediately and that reductions in nitrogen take place.  These measures go beyond improving efficiencies and must be focused on reducing the total emissions through breaking the link between animal numbers, fertiliser use and deteriorating water quality.</p> <p>  Feed additives comes under the heading of nutrient management.  I will ask Mr. Treacy to explain the numbers relating to some of those measures, and then we can return to the cattle feed piece.  Mr. Treacy or Dr. McGovern might talk about the clover in swards also.  It is down to the nutrient element.  I will pass over to Mr. Treacy.</p></speech>

We take their information.  We work closely with Teagasc to understand the impacts and to incorporate them into the projections and, ultimately, into the inventory.</p> <p>  In terms of the structure of agriculture, agricultural emissions are made up of: 65% methane, 30% N2O and about 5% carbon dioxide.  That number includes combustion emissions associated with use of tractors.  Therefore, one can see the measures needed to target those emissions.  Methane is the biggest part of it.  Enteric fermentation is just under 60% of the total emissions.  Manure management is about 10%.  Soil emissions are approximately 27%.  It is a combination of nitrogen and methane impacting measures.  We do not yet have full detail on the methane measures.  The 16.5 million tonnes saving identified in the Climate Action Plan is made up of approximately 14 million tonnes of methane measures.  The remainder comes from nitrogen, with some offsets for liming.  There are emissions associated with liming, but that will go the opposite direction.  However, liming has a net-positive benefit in adjusting soil pH and in allowing fertiliser take-up.</p> <p>  In terms of beef genomics, the breeder index and all of these things listed in the climate action plan and in the strategy for the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, that is about 14 million tonnes.</p> <p>  The urea fertiliser ban, increased use of inhibited urea and the level of the sales target limit proposed in Ag Climatise altogether add up to about 6.4 million tonnes over the 2021 to 2030 period.  Offset against that is the slight increase in emissions where stabilised urea is used instead of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, NPK, or other fertilisers that have a lower greenhouse gas impact.  There is an offset of approximately 1.5 million tonnes.  That is where I got about 5 million tonnes from fertiliser measures.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned other measures, such as slurry spreading.  Some of these measures are important from an ammonia perspective, and even more for greenhouse gases.  By slurry spreading, we do not mean splash-plate spreading.  We mean shoe trailing, slurry injection, or other methods that do not create the same level of emissions as the traditional splash-plate slurry spreaders.  Many of these are already happening.  In our 2019 inventory, we saw that low emission slurry spreading made up 16% of slurry being spread.  We also saw a fourfold increase in protected urea uptake.  These measures are beginning to happen.  We need to see them accelerate in the future so that the vast majority of slurry is spread that way, similarly with the uptake in urea.</p> <p>  Clover reduces the need for fertiliser because it fixes nitrogen itself.  That is where it comes in.  Some of these measures do not have a huge impact individually.  However, the targets for 2030 are challenging in nature and-----</p></speech>

That is a perfect explanation.  Does the use of clover in mixed swards impact productivity?  Do you get the same amount of productivity?</p></speech>

Productivity implications are a question for Teagasc.</p> <p>  The crude protein question is about dairy and pigs.  Crude protein in dairy concentrates has reduced from 19% about ten years ago to about 16.6% now.  In terms of dairy, the expectation in regard to this projection is that it will go down by approximately another percentage point from that figure.</p></speech>

On changing feed, amending feed and putting technology and science into it, how much emissions savings can be expected from those types of technologies?</p></speech>

Some of these measures are small.  It is about 13 kilotonnes in 2030 and 88 kilotonnes over the 2021 to 2030.  That figure includes both dairy and pig feed.  There are fewer than 100 kilotonnes in total for those two.  It is not one of the bigger measures but, given how challenging the targets are, all measures are important.</p></speech>

There is much active research in Ireland, Europe, and globally on food additives.  They can reduce emissions of methane from enteric fermentation.  Historically, the EPA has funded research in this area, but that research has been taken over by the likes of Teagasc as well as by commercial activities.  The key issues include the added costs of certain additives, and some additives are prohibited for food, health, and safety issues; the impacts on the flavour of food products; and the overall health of the animal.  Certainly, this is an active area of research.  Hopefully solutions will come from those investments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021062900002#D01000"><p>I thank our guests for their presentation.  It was stated that agricultural expansion is happening at the expense of the environment.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses elaborate on that.  The case has been made that Ireland has grass-based production and, as such, is environmentally superior to many of the alternatives, certainly within Europe.</p> <p>  It was also stated that there need not be a conflict and argued that we can break the link between the herd and the environment.  Again, I would like to hear more about that.  Last week, we heard from Professor Alan Matthews, who said that if the herd stabilised, there would be a 3% decline per decade in methane.  There seem to be differences in opinion on the exact implications for the herd on methane.  There are conflicting arguments on the short life of methane, as well as the implications that has.  As the experts in this area, could the witnesses shed light on this biogenic methane discussion?</p> <p>  The EPA argues for a measurable, reportable and verifiable holistic and catchment approach.  What new tools might this involve?  I know of the ones it has talked about, namely, fertiliser and the Teagasc MACC.  However, are the witnesses saying that we can entirely break the link through this holistic and catchment approach?  What exactly are we talking about here?  Are we talking about, as we heard last week, pricing, carbon, paying farmers to farm carbon and developing policy tools that pay for carbon sequestration?  Are these what they have in mind?</p> <p>  Can the EPA point to any countries where agriculture has managed the sort of transition that it describes, which we could perhaps model.  Ultimately, we want to see farmers having a good family farm income.  If farmers' incomes from traditional methods of agricultural expansion are to be curtailed, they will ask where new sources of farm income will come from.  It would be helpful to the committee to understand where the EPA sees new sources of farm income coming from.</p></speech>

The overall message is what evidence is showing us.  We made clear points about this in the state of the environment reports.</p><p>These suggest that the impact of current practices around agriculture are having this significant effect on greenhouse gas emissions but also across other markers for the environment in Ireland, whether that be water quality, air quality or biodiversity loss.  The key message from the agency in that regard is that what we need to see, at a very minimum, is full implementation of all current policies and plans, which is crucial.  The focus of today's meeting is thinking about that step up to the 51% but, from the point of view of the analysis that the agency has done, it is very much around the existing measures.  What we need to see there is the full measures that are identified both in the Climate Action Plan of 2019 but also in the Ag Climatise strategy, which really turned the Teagasc MACC from that sort of paper-based exercise to see what measures are needed into a suite of measures for which there was significant stakeholder engagement and engagement with the farming community about what was possible.</p><p> Another key point is that we cannot meet our overall contribution across the economy without agriculture playing its part.  An important message is that it is not an either-or, and we are not going to take measures in one sector at the expense of another.  The scale of the transition that is required is required across all sectors.  There has to be significant step change in what is done, and agriculture is no different.</p><p> I might ask Dr. McGovern to talk about biogenic methane.  What the catchment approach essentially recognises is that environmental issues are complex and interwoven.  We cannot look at them in isolation and we need to look at them in that interconnected way, and come up with policies which address that fact, such as some of the measures that Mr. Treacy was outlining in the last series of questions around nitrogen use, low emissions slurry spreading and so on.  Changes in those farm practices do and can realise very real benefits for improvements in regard to drinking water quality, for example, so the benefits could be derived across not just greenhouse gas emissions but those other markers as well.</p><p> In terms of the new tools and what else can be done, I will make the point again &ndash; I am sorry if I keep making it - that it is that full implementation of the additional measures in our analysis.  That is the basic first principle to get us to where we need to be for 2030.  A message there would be that the measures are known and have been identified to get us to 2030.  We know what they are, and Mr. Treacy has just talked us through some of the numbers around those.  We are not going into this challenge to deal with some of these issues in a space which is unknown and is not well understood by the farming community.  As I said, the Ag Climatise strategy came about, as I understand it, following extensive stakeholder engagement, so the farming community understands what needs to be done and they are taking steps.</p><p> In terms of that step up beyond where we are, our current level of ambition is to 2030.  We have to see the evidence of those solutions that have been identified in the climate action plan and those other proposals being fully implemented and verified.  That is very important because they will address those ongoing unsustainable air and water emissions.  Any further expansion beyond that would be difficult to sustain if we are not seeing and realising the benefits from those measures that have been identified in the MACC.</p><p> One point is around the question of the current model of subsidies and payments to farmers.  The agency would previously have articulated a view that perhaps the current model of subsidies and payments to farmers does not adequately support the addressing of environmental issues.  This is a point that was highlighted at European level by the recent Court of Auditors report which highlighted that measures supported by the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, have a low climate mitigation potential and that CAP does not incentivise the use of effective climate-friendly practices.  Therefore, it may be appropriate that direct payments are linked to land use and management activities that focus on co-benefits and ecosystem services, and that would encourage increased ambition.  If we were to do that, I think we would see a situation where we see farm incomes protected, provide that environmental protection and also foster appropriate land use.</p><p> Actions that can be developed quickly need to have that underpinning of policy education and awareness.  I spoke previously about the importance of the educational piece but also of financial incentives that provide the same certainty to farmers as those that are currently supporting sectoral expansion, or have done in the past.  I do not know if that fully answers the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  I will ask Dr. McGovern to cover the point on biogenic methane.</p></speech>

Obviously, the EPA is aware of the ongoing discussions and debates that are happening around methane.  It is a complex issue.  Methane is a relatively short-lived gas and has an atmospheric lifetime of approximately 12 years.  What matters for global warming is the amount of the gas that stays in the atmosphere because, by staying in the atmosphere, it traps more energy, causing the heating effects that are seen in Ireland and elsewhere around the world.  Given that it is a short-lived gas, on first principles, one would say that if we stabilise emissions to the atmosphere, then the concentration would stabilise after a period of a number of decades.  However, what does not stabilise is the climate impact of that concentration in the atmosphere, which takes time to work through the climate system.  It is a bit like boiling a kettle or a large container of water in that it does not reach the boiling point until a certain time.  Therefore, in order to address that latency effect, the science would suggest that in order to stabilise the warming contribution of methane, we would need to reduce emissions by about 3% per decade for at least three decades in order to stabilise its contribution to global warming.  I hope that clarifies the point.</p></speech>

I want to make the point that even with the same number of animals, the animals themselves are more efficient at producing milk, for example, and that also means they produce more methane.  As a result, herd number stabilisation itself does not necessarily stabilise methane emissions if there is growth in those emissions.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  Do the witnesses see an expanded role for the EPA in the time ahead and a growth in the importance its work?</p><p>In that regard, does the EPA have any asks of the Government in respect of that expanded role, its budget, staffing, the staff mix and the projection into the future?</p><p> To what extent are inventories and projections self-declared?  I ask because in my constituency, there is a concentration of waste industries.  There is a sense from the local communities that licences are in place but there is a question regarding oversight and the level of scrutiny.  What assurance can the EPA give to local communities located right beside the limited and very heavy industry we have for waste, incinerators, landfill and waste-to-energy plants?  What level of oversight, scrutiny and accountability is in place in regard to adherence to the terms and conditions of licences?  Are our guests satisfied that the EPA is sufficiently resourced in that regard for now and into the future?  We appreciate that this will be a role of growing importance in light of our climate obligations.</p><p> A related point concerns the assessment of agriculture admissions.  Notwithstanding the fact that every sector has to do its share of lifting, which is accepted by everybody, there is an argument from the agricultural sector that the equation is not being fully assessed and that the important work the sector does on sequestration and carbon sinks is not being appropriately assessed.  What is the EPA's opinion on that?  Is there a fair assessment with international comparisons at this time?  When might there be a better assessment of the overall contribution of the sector?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked whether we see an expanded role for the EPA.  I earlier gave a sense of the areas for which the EPA is currently responsible in this space.  There are many spaces in which there is a significant role for us, whether with the team I have with me today in the context of the preparation of inventories and projections or through the work we are doing on climate science.  More broadly, as the Deputy mentioned, the operation of the consenting regime for licensing throughout the State is in itself a mechanism for the reducing emissions within agreed and statutory boundaries.  Significant elements of the EPA's core function have meaningful and tangible impacts in this space.  As for an expanded role for the EPA, a number of measures have been identified for us under the existing climate action plan.  I see a role for us in terms of communicating with the public and encouraging an understanding that the national dialogue on climate action is important.  As we talk through the transition and what will be required from the State, its organs and at an individual level, the EPA sees itself has having a role in how we communicate with the public and understand the best structures for doing what I have outlined.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether we have any specific asks of the Government.  I do not think we do at the moment.  We have a well-established process for engaging with our two parent Departments in respect of both funding and staffing.  Discussions on those issues are ongoing.</p> <p>  I might ask Mr. Treacy to comment in a moment on inventories and projections and how we can take assurance from the methodologies we employ to determine whether the inventories are accurate.  In the reporting the agency does, we are the competent authority and we report at both EU and UN level.  As a result, we are required to have those methodologies reviewed and so on.  That external analysis and checking provides significant comfort throughout the agency.  In addition, the inputs that come in to the inventories come from a broad range of actors, including, for example, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and Teagasc regarding agriculture.  There is a wealth of knowledge and expertise throughout the system that the agency taps into for the preparation of these documents.</p> <p>  On oversight more generally and licensing, I do not have any specific information about waste.  Under the licensing regime, the specific conditions placed on any licenser are done with regard to the best available technology and emission limit values.  Those issues are considered when a licence is granted and it operates to the best available science to support decision-making for those involved in the decision-making process.</p> <p>  On the question about the assessment of agriculture and whether the equation is assessed correctly, I think the Deputy was referring to some of the features of Irish agricultural life that may not be evident in other countries, such as hedgerows and so on, and our capacity to account properly for the sequestration potential of Ireland's unique landscape.  The agency has invested significant time and effort to try to understand that better.  It is an area where the science is developing and where there is a considerable building up of knowledge and development of research.  Nevertheless, we recognise there is much room for improvement and it is an area of focus for us.  We would support having a land-use map for the country, for example.  We recognise that there is more work to be done in this regard.</p> <p>  I will pass over to Mr. Treacy on the question about inventories and projections.  He might mention some of the parameters relating to the considerations of how we might count hedgerows, for example.</p></speech>

It is subject to review by the UN and EU on an annual basis.  At intervals of a number of years we have country reviews whereby expert review teams from around the world come to look at our methods and assess them.  We have always been found to be compliant with the process and with the IPCC guidelines for producing inventories.  We also have reviews on an annual basis for the projections and air pollutant inventory and projections under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe process and the national emission ceilings directive.  The data and methods we use are reviewed annually by international experts to assess compliance with international best practice.</p> <p>  On the question of land use, we report emissions and sequestration on an annual basis to the UN.  To date, we have not published this information in our summary projections report because it has not been relevant to effort sharing.  We will do so in future, however, because it will be relevant to credits.  The land use, land-use change and forestry, LULUCF, regulation covers the six top-level land categories.  These are forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements and harvestable wood products.  Overall, land use is estimated to be a net source of emissions in Ireland.  This is based on application of the international methodology.  Just less than 4.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent was emitted in the past inventory year.  While we have a substantial sink from forestry, we also have a large area of grasslands on organic soils.  Overall, our grasslands cover approximately 4.3 million ha, of which 350,000 ha are on organic soils.  This is a form of peatland that has been drained.  While we have a sink of approximately 2 million tonnes from the 3.8 million ha of grass on mineral soils there is a source of approximately 8 million tonnes annually from the 350,000 ha of grassland on organic soils.  This has a huge impact.  There is also the fact that our wetlands or peatlands are a net source in that the horticultural extraction is greater than what might be taken up on managed peat areas.  We report this information but I acknowledge that there is room for improvement in the context of the information provided.</p> <p>  The Chair mentioned hedgerows.  This matter has been very much in the media recently.  The EPA has funded two projects on hedgerows and more are under way to identify the biomass in hedgerows and the extent to which it might soak up carbon.  The land where hedgerows are located is captured under grassland and cropland areas.  The whole land area is covered.  What we have to identify are the management regimes and the various types of hedgerows and various amounts of carbon they can soak up.  The second part of the research is ongoing.  This is on the various amounts of carbon taken up by various management types.  In overall terms, hedgerows are likely to sequester.  There is quite a broad element of uncertainty at present.  It is somewhere between 300,000 tonnes and 1.4 million tonnes per annum of carbon.  This is quite an uncertain range.  These research projects will narrow down the gap.</p> <p>  The question was probably also aimed at credits under the LULUCF regulation.  In this sense what is important is the impact of actions taken by people.  What matters is how much hedgerow is there now compared to what was there in the reference period.  The research we have to date suggests there is less hedgerow than there was in the reference period.  This would lead to a net emission in the regulation accounting.  This is something to be aware of.  With regard to the actions and credits available under the LULUCF regulation, it is action relative to reference periods that is important.</p></speech>

As I understand it, the EPA is awaiting the passage of the climate action Bill and the measures provided for in it, including the plans and the carbon budget, in order to be able to make the relevant projections.  It is important to state that because there has been some confusion.  The Chair asked a question on this at the outset, but the point is being missed because the term "additional measures" does not mean just the additional measures that this Government is taking now.  Quite apart from the passing of the climate action Bill and the provisions it contains, there are also all of the measures that have been put in place by the Government over the past year.  These are also not necessarily taken into account in these projections because they are based on the Climate Action Plan 2019.  Some of the measures are based on that plan but others are not.  It is important to state this so there is no confusion about it.  I certainly feel that we need to see projections based on the measures that are being implemented and that will be put in place under these new plans.</p> <p>  Ms Finnegan mentioned Ireland's reputation as a green food producer being in jeopardy.  This is a very important point.  It shows that we need to support farmers.  This plan is not about penalising farmers but supporting them.  Last week, Macra na Feirme called for support from ecologists, for instance, which shows willingness to move.  I may have missed a point with regard to some of the measures outlined, particularly on change in land use or diversification, at the very least, through the use of mixed swards and clover.  Is our land use quantified in actual square miles?  Are we speaking about converting to be able to reach targets?  Do the witnesses know this?</p> <p>  Some of the measures suggested are based on the Climate Action Plan 2019.  These include moving to 1 million EVs.  Interconnectedness was mentioned.  When the EPA looks at its emissions projections does it look at simple emissions from vehicles and convert them?  Does it look at other things associated with car culture such as sprawl?  Not everybody will purchase an EV.  A model based on a simple conversion from one to the other probably would not take into account that everybody will not convert or the potential for urban sprawl.  This can have other knock-on impacts on health and well-being.  Has the EPA examined the matter in this broader sense?</p></speech>

With regard to the distinction between existing measures and additional measures, in some ways these phrases are confusing in themselves.</p><p>Additional measures give the sense of being forward-looking or future-oriented, whereas it is just a quantification of existing Government policy, albeit out to 2030.  Nonetheless, it does not reference that greater level of ambition.  For anybody dipping their toe into the climate area, trying to understand the distinction between existing measures and additional measures is not simple but I hope we have given a good explanation of it.</p><p> The Senator said that the projections have not yet covered the ambition in the Bill.  I wish to make clear how we do our business methodologically speaking.  That will not happen until we have a suite of measures that are intended to support a reduction to that level.  At that point, they would be factored into the projection process.  It is not the setting of the ambition that triggers the work from our perspective.  It is the articulation of the measures and policies that the Government identifies as bringing us to it.  Those are two important distinctions and I thank the Senator for raising them.</p><p> The Senator had a question about diversification, whether land use is being quantified and how much is being converted to reach our targets.  She also spoke about Ireland's reputation.  I made a point in this regard in the opening statement.  It is a message that the EPA has been reiterating for some time.  I would also mention the opportunities that exist for the sector.  A more diverse and resilient sector based on some of the principles which are central to decarbonisation, such as circular economy principles and reductions in food waste, will bring positive opportunities with the transition we envisage.  The potential expansion into nature-based production systems, tillage, horticulture and organic production all offer opportunities to access new markets, create new jobs and so on.  While the outlook for the performance indicators for the environment, if I could describe them as such, is not optimistic currently, with the introduction of the new policies that are identified in the climate action plan, we expect to see that dial shifting.  Full implementation is key, however.</p><p> Mr. Treacy might be able to talk us through diversification and land use quantification.  The Senator may be talking about how much land is required to create the sink that will address the imbalance that exists.  I think that is what she was getting at.  This comes back to the point about land-use change in forestry being very complex and interconnected.  Measures such as converting a number of hectares from one use to another does not necessarily produce a right answer because of the interconnectedness of it.  Mr. Treacy may be able to expand on some of the methodological issues there.</p><p> The Senator spoke about the 1 million EVs and the issues associated with car culture and the urban sprawl.  This is a methodological question when thinking about some of the policy measures that might give a bang for our buck in terms of transport-oriented design and thinking about how the planning system interacts.  Those types of measures are more challenging to put into a system to quantify where we are likely to get to.  Mr. Treacy can talk through the methodology relating to the 1 million EVs.  It assumes that we have 1 million cars that have switched from being fossil-fuel based.  We look at the measures that have been given by Government and we work them through the model, using the types of parameters that are set out at EU level.  I ask Mr. Treacy to pick up some of those more tactical points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.411" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Treacy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021062900002#H00200"><p>Analysis off what kind of area would be needed for those measures would be done by Teagasc rather than us in devising the policies and measures.  Teagasc has modelled on the basis of the inclusion of 25% clover on beef farms and 15% on dairy farms.</p> <p>  I can give some more information on land area use.  The information is in our inventory report.  There are approximately 800,000 ha of forest, just over 700,000 ha of cropland, 4.3 million ha of grassland, about 1.1 million ha of unmanaged wetlands, in the region of 70,000 ha of managed wetlands and 125,000 ha of settlements.  That gives some sense of the land make-up.</p> <p>  Regarding land measures, the Senator is probably aware that the climate action plan contains the measure on water table management on agricultural land and organic soils.  Approximately 40,000 ha was identified there.  Teagasc is working on the more detailed elements of this and it has not reached our stage yet.</p> <p>  We produce the inventory for transport based on fuels sold.  In a sense it takes account of everything that happens.  Any measure affecting demand, usage or switching of vehicles is captured by the use of either less or more fuel.  We pick up the impacts of all those measures.  That approach means it is very difficult to identify directly from the inventory sources the impact of those individual measures.</p> <p>  That is why we rely on our suppliers, such as the SEAI and the Departments of Transport and the Environment, Climate and Communications to get an analysis of the expected delivery of measures for the future.  We then subtract that from the projection of fuel used with the current basket of measures.  That is how that process works.</p> <p>  In a sense, the inventory is very agnostic about the measures used.  If the fuel is burned, the emissions are recorded and if not, they are not.  It does not rely on a bottom-up calculation of what we think particular measures are doing.  It looks at the end of the pipe and what was actually done.  It means we need to use other modelling approaches in conjunction to understand the projected impact of these kinds of measures.</p></speech>

I want to ask about the environmental impact of the 1 million EVs beyond carbon both at home and overseas.  We are all anxious to think globally and avoid any sense of thinking of the State only.  The production of batteries in countries such as China is thought to give rise to a heavy carbon footprint.  Some say that the latter is up to 60%.  I recently read that this could be reduced if China adopted a European or an American model.  There is also the issue of sourcing electricity for these.</p> <p>  I also wish to inquire about the bigger push away from individual transport to public transport, the retrofitting of homes and the introduction of heat pumps.  Just transition is critical not just physically and financially but also psychologically for people's well-being and in the context of the sense of inclusion in the transition.  Do the witnesses see a real heart-and-soul commitment from the State to recognising these realities and ensuring the people can transition urgently?</p> <p>  I want to touch on food production.  It seems counterintuitive that while we have marketed ourselves as this clean, green food island, much of that has been achieved at the expense of the environment.</p><p>The addiction to efficiency seems to be trumping imagination and transformation.  Small family farmers are doing their best on shrinking incomes.  We really need to support these farmers because it is on their backs that we created this clean, green food island status.  I ask the witnesses to outline the way forward here.</p></speech>

I do not have a response off the top of my head, but I recall that Mr. Treacy mentioned a life-cycle analysis in respect of EVs at an event we spoke at last week.  I ask him to reference that in his response.  There is some evidence available in that regard.</p> <p>  On homes, heat pumps and inclusion in the transition, the figures that are in the climate action plan, and which are therefore included in the projections to 2030 in the context of the retrofitting of homes and installing heat pumps, are extremely ambitious.  There is no other way to describe them.  The numbers are absolutely huge.  Deputy Cronin mentioned hard times and bringing people with you.  It is really important that people are supported.  If people are interested in retrofitting their homes, it is important that they are supported to do so and are convinced of the benefits.  On retrofitting the heat source in a home, for example, we can clearly see the impact that burning from fossil fuels, and particularly certain types of fossil fuels, has on air quality, both within the home and outside it.  A public information campaign is needed to help people better understand the benefits that would be derived from the transition away from using fossil fuels to heat homes.  This is not just around that air quality piece, it is also about comfort, having a better quality of life and being more comfortable in your home.  It is a point that is well made.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Treacy, if he does not mind, to respond to question on the target of 1 million EVs and the life-cycle impact.  I will come back in on the wider point about food production.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.415" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Treacy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021062900002#J00300"><p>To address that question, in a sense, a life-cycle analysis is a complicated process.  It is almost done on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis, depending on where things are produced and used.  In a country like Ireland, where almost 40% of our electricity is already generated from renewable sources, in comparison with a country where there might be double the emissions per unit of electricity produced if coal is a major part of the fuel mix, it does seem that the analysis is already in favour of EVs in terms of lower emissions on a life-cycle basis.  It varies from vehicle to vehicle and depends on who is producing it and where it is being produced.</p> <p>  The Deputy made an important point in relation to the global environmental impact and the need for everyone in all countries to be aware of where the materials are being sourced.  In particular, issues have been raised in respect of cobalt.  As the Deputy pointed out in respect of newer battery technologies, it is a combination of trying to source cobalt sustainably but also reducing the amount of cobalt being used in batteries.  There are batteries available that do not use cobalt at all.  There are other batteries that do not use lithium.  There are numerous strands of research and development going on in the automotive industry to make batteries longer range, more efficient, more energy-dense in nature and cheaper for the manufacturers to produce.  There is huge development going on there.  The key point is that, on a global level, the environmental impact needs to be at the forefront of everyone's mind in making the transition.</p> <p>  It also important to say that in the past, the alternative - the fossil fuel extraction, production and transmission industry - has not always necessarily been good for the environment either.  There are trade-offs.  Moving from one system to another, we must not lose sight of that.</p></speech>

Avoiding car journeys in the first place is the most important aspect.  The shifting away from individual car use to public transport is optimal, but if you are going to remain in your car, the idea is that you improve the means by which you undertake your transport.  I know that the committee would have considered this when it carried its in-depth analysis of transport.  The EPA is supportive of that methodology for viewing how we shift our transport emissions.</p> <p>  On food production, the Deputy described it as an addiction to efficiency.  As I said in my opening statement, it is almost a mathematical principle that you will not drive the requisite level of savings while expansion is also happening through efficiencies.  That does not just apply to the agriculture sector.  There are issues around that, such as, for example, if demand for energy increases.  The point is relevant across a number of sectors in relation to the climate space.</p></speech>

A key message we highlight is that before any further expansion can be contemplated, it is important to ensure that those efficiencies are being fully realised and that they are quantifiable and verifiable.</p></speech>

I am very struck by Ms Finegan's point that you cannot derive the savings while you are also in an expansion phase.  There is an element of that in terms of agriculture but also, perhaps, in energy production.  We have talked about the share of energy that is renewable.  A concern is arising, however, in respect of data centres, whereby we might be looking at expanded energy demand, even as we try to transition.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' thoughts on that.</p> <p>  In terms of emissions, I note that in respect of the 2020 targets, there is talk of Ireland having to use credits and purchase annual emission allocations from other countries.  That would not be ideal in terms of the global picture, because it is effectively something that could be a pure reduction in another place being added to our reduction.  It is replacement.</p> <p>  On the 2030 targets, the EPA has stated that Ireland needs to use flexibilities to achieve the current 2030 targets.  However, those 2030 targets are approximately half of what we are likely to have in a couple of weeks' time when the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill is passed.  The EPA had projected a 20% reduction in emissions, but we will be looking for the 51% reduction.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the care that needs to be taken in the use of flexibilities.  What is an appropriate way of delimiting the use of flexibilities?  When we consider the escalation that will be needed in the context of the new targets, it will involve a jump from 20% to 51%.</p> <p>   Ms Sharon Finegan: In relation to the lifecycle impact of EVs, I will turn to Mr. Treacy on the issue.  I do not know, off the top of my head, but I heard Mr. Treacy mention a lifecycle analysis in relation to EVs at another event we attended last wee</p><p>Looking to the UN and the EU, there are new laws coming through from the EU.  Is there potential that the 51% target, as a point of ambition, is likely to rise?  In terms of what is required under the common but differentiated responsibilities from the UN level or our fair share within the EU model do the witnesses believe that is likely?  I would welcome a comment on the potential direction of travel, which makes the case for the front-loading of action in the next five years in case our ten-year target ends up rising further.</p><p> On front-loading, the witnesses have provided detailed information already but I would welcome a comment on nitrogen and methane, particularly on nitrogen in terms of fertiliser, which is one aspect on which the report focuses.  The witnesses will be aware that the nitrates directive has been a subject of discussion at this committee.  In terms of methane, as I understand it from Dr. McGovern and others, it is not a matter of the long-term,  the concern is the impact methane has in this 12-year period when we need to be doing everything we can to lower emissions.  This is our bridging period - the period within which we have to act.  I would welcome a comment on the importance of action in that period.  While the long-term impact may be lesser, the short-term impact of methane seems to be higher.  Is that part of the logic of why action needs to be front-loaded in that regard?</p></speech>

She posed some fairly technical questions which it would be helpful for my colleagues to answer.  I will ask Mr. Treacy to answer on the 2020 targets and the use of credits and flexibilities and how that is structured and Dr. McGovern to answer the question on methane and the importance of acting now.</p> <p>  On energy, energy use and energy demand, it might be helpful to give the committee a sense of the scenario which is built into the projections for our future electricity demand.  This projection is underpinned by EirGrid's analysis.  EirGrid states that as we approach 2030, 27% of all electricity on the grid will be used by data centres.  I am referring to EirGrid's All-Island Generation Capacity Statement 2020-2029.  The question of demand is a significant one in that there is a major level of demand coming from one source.  In addition, as mentioned in our responses to Deputy Cronin, the electrification of our transport system will also put demands on the system.  However, the level of demand that you can expect from the transport system, as I understand it, is easier to manage in that it is not at peak times, it can be drawn down from the grid overnight and so on.  Issues around energy demand arise at peak hours.  The grid has a contingency to deal with those issues.  These are not areas of expertise for the EPA. but that point is woven into our projections.</p> <p>  On the escalation of a need for new targets and what is happening at EU level, the current Commission, under President Ursula von der Leyen, has made clear that its target is a 55% reduction.  What that means for Ireland will come down to what percentage of the target will be from the emissions trading system, ETS, the percentage from non-ETS, how individual country targets will be determined through an effort-sharing decision in the case of non-ETS and what will be in and what will be out.  All of these have yet to work their way through.  The figures are attractive in that they are easy to understand.  The target we have is 51%, but the Commission target is 55%.  The complexity of that is such that one is not always necessarily comparing like with like.</p> <p>  Dr. McGovern may wish to comment on the ambition at UN level, which is where his expertise lies.  I will hand over to Mr. Treacy to answer the question on flexibilities.</p></speech>

Despite that, emissions from the energy industries, which is mostly power generation, will decrease by 25% by 2030.  Towards the end of the projection, in 2028, 2029 and 2030, emissions are projected to start to uptick again.  The demand increase is catching up and surpassing the measures there at the moment.  When it comes to calculating the measures needed to meet the 51%, that will be one of the areas on which there will be focus for more action.  This puts pressure on.  A combination of data centres, heat pumps and so on creates a challenge in terms of meeting that target.  This is not to suggest that it cannot be done.  It is all about numbers at the moment.  As I said, there is a 25% reduction in emissions built into EirGrid's median scenario.<br/><br/>In terms of credits and flexibilities, for the 2013-2020 compliance period, we have estimated that we will have exceeded our combined limit by around 12 million tonnes.  If one adds up the individual annual emissions allocated for each year, which is a substantial amount at about one fifth of our annual emissions or, for example, the entire emissions from the transport sector, that is a substantial overshoot.  To ensure compliance, Ireland has to have credits or annual emission allocations to meet those numbers.  In that sense, it is a combination of eligible credits that have existed previously from investments Ireland has made abroad but also bilaterally purchasing credits from other countries that are meeting their targets and have a surplus of allowances they can sell to us.  That trading is allowed for under the scheme.<br/><br/>In the context of 2030, which I think is what the Senator was referring to in regard to the flexibilities, the flexibilities available to Ireland are intended to reflect the extent to which, for example, agriculture is a big part of our emissions profile.  In that sense, in <i>per capita</i>terms, Ireland got a substantial portion of those flexibilities.  Ireland is allowed 26.8 million tonnes flexibility in regard to accounting for credits from the LULUCF sector and approximately 19 million tonnes in respect of a flexibility around the numbers being transferred from the ETS to the non-ETS, which allows for an additional 19 million tonnes of emissions in the non-ETS sector.  Those are the flexibilities available to us.  The reasoning behind those was in regard to the portion of our agriculture in our emissions primarily.  That was done post the cost-effectiveness analysis.  That is the rationale.<br/><br/>In terms of the future, I cannot comment.  There is nothing we know yet regarding what the future levels will be.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.432" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank McGovern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021062900002#K01100"><p>I would like to make a few points.  There was a lot packed into the Senator's questions, but I do not think we have time to go into all of the detail.  Internationally, the Paris Agreement has set the framework by which we are going to achieve the required ambition to protect our climate.  That is articulated as a temperature goal in the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2oC and to make efforts to limit warming to 1.5oC.  As part of that process, we are to balance greenhouse gas emissions and removals during the second half of this century.  That ambition will be expressed through the global stock take process.  As committee members will probably know, the first stock take under the Paris Agreement will take place in 2023.  It will look at the new science from the IPCC as well as the various contributions made by parties under their nationally determined contributions, NDCs.  Ireland's NDC is under the EU, and so we are part of that overall ambition in the EU package.  We also have the long-term strategies, which are really important in achieving the climate stabilisation that is necessary in order to avoid the large-scale impacts.</p><p> The various gasses and the pathways to 2030 are important.  The Senator is correct in that action in respect of 2030 is essential to ensure that we are on the right pathway to stay below those targets.  The IPCC was tasked with looking specifically at the pathways for achievement of the 1.5&deg;C warming and that special report was published in 2019.  I will try to scan the document to confirm the figures that were mentioned.  The key message that the IPCC has been giving for some time is that we need to get to net zero CO2 as soon as possible.  Emissions of CO2 that accumulate in the atmosphere will largely determine long-term global warming.  They commit us to warming for centuries and millennia, and that is a message that was clear from this assessment report.  It is also clear from the 1.5&deg;C report and the UN report provided in advance of the Paris Agreement in terms of the long-term global goal.  The IPCC will update those analyses in the sixth assessment report.  We hope that the first volume of that will be published in the first week in August this year.  Due to Covid, it has been delayed.  The subsequent volumes on impacts, adaptation and mitigation will be published in early 2022.</p><p> In terms of some specific numbers for various gases, as I said the IPCC report made it clear that getting to net zero CO2 by 2050 would be really important and we then need to have negative emissions to offset emissions of gases that we cannot bring to zero.  In terms of the other gases, methane reductions of well above 50% at a global level are required.  Nitrous oxide is slightly more complicated because some models use more fertiliser for growing bioenergy crops.  There is a lot of uncertainty around nitrous oxide levels.</p><p> In terms of methane emissions globally, approximately 50% are from fossil fuel industry releases, fracking, pipelines, etc.  Standard production also causes leaks.  They are considered the low-hanging fruit, so to speak.  Immediate action to reduce those emissions would be very significant in terms of the global picture.  For Ireland our main focus has been on methane from food production.  In terms of the figures for a reduction in methane at a global level from agriculture for 2030, they ranged from -11% to -30% relative to emissions in 2010.  For CO2, the figure is -58% 2-40% relative to the 2010 figure for 2030.  If I have missed something, I ask the Senator to remind me.  Those are the figures we are working with at a global level.</p><p> It is important that we do not suddenly say that the global figures immediately map onto every individual country.  Every individual country, under the Paris Agreement, needs to find its own pathway to climate neutrality.  I will stop there.</p></speech>

We will have a short second round.  There are others ahead of Senator Higgins.</p> <p>  I have quite a concern around the modelling piece, in particular transport but less so for agriculture.  Mr. Treacy mentioned that he leans on the likes of Teagasc for that element of the work the EPA is doing.  At a pervious meeting, we were informed that the National Transport Authority was not yet ready with its detailed model.  We did not get the sense from it that it had figured this out and how transport can change.  It seems to me that a complex approach does not underpin the one million EV target.</p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses can tell me if a zero carbon value is ascribed to an EV.  Does the modelling take into account that our energy system, by that point, will be 70% renewable but still probably 30% fossil fuel?  There is also the issue of where EVs are purchased and by whom.  Those in certain demographics will drive more than others.  If the balance of EV parts are in Dublin, for example, that will not need to a significant emissions saving as opposed to the majority of EVs being purchased in, for example, rural areas.  I am not sure the modelling captures that and I have a concern about it.  My concern is not about what the EPA has said, but rather what others have highlighted.  The witnesses might comment on that.</p> <p>  Senator O'Reilly mentioned the modelling around the national planning framework, NPF, and the induced effects of policies like sprawl.  Is that being captured in the projection analysis?  It seems to me that a carbon reduction analysis for the NPF is required, and the compact growth that goes along with that.  I am not sure that has been quantified properly.  It seems that it needs to be if we are to be serious about reducing emissions.</p> <p>  Air quality has been mentioned a few times.  The greenhouse gas reductions associated with EVs still leave significant issues relating to air quality as a result of brake dust, tyre wear and so on.  I would be interested in hearing about the EPA's monitoring regime in respect of air quality at local level.</p> <p>  I know we do not have too much time, but perhaps the witnesses could get to the crux of what is driving the deterioration of the water quality in our river system across the country.  I appreciate that I have asked a lot of questions.  I am keen to bring in Deputy Bruton, who has been waiting quite a while.  Perhaps the witnesses could address my questions as best they can in the time we have.</p></speech>

Our modelling is primarily around energy demand.  It is macroeconomic modelling.  However, we do not just leave it there, as such; we work with others who do modelling for other reasons, such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  We have also spoken to the NTA.  It is something that we expect to do much of in the future.</p> <p>  The basic question the Chair asked was about a zero value for EVs.  They do not produce any emissions in our projections for the transport sector, but the impact of their electricity demand is captured in the energy sector.  That is modelled.</p> <p>  The Chair also asked about air quality.  We model for air pollutant emissions.  We use a system of emissions modelling called COPERT that factors in on-road and off-road emissions, including tyre and brake wear, which the Chair mentioned.  That data is captured.</p> <p>  The Chair mentioned regional modelling, which is not something we do currently.  Our modelling is done on a national basis.  I do not have any real answers for him at the moment.  EVs are most efficient where internal combustion engine vehicles are least efficient, which is in urban areas.</p><p>It is not necessarily clear-cut as to exactly where the greatest benefit will be achieved.  It also depends on vehicle types and the size and weight of the vehicles that are being substituted.  We are, therefore, working on many issues with the other actors in the transport sector that have other models, and particularly the NTA, which, from our discussions with it, is modelling the elements of the NPF where it can project forward the future employment and housing locations and future journeys that will be needed.  We do engage with the other actors.  This is to inform and adjust our model, which is primarily an energy model we take from the SEAI and Economic and Social Research Institute's way to remodel.  Many of us are involved in it.  As the Chair said, it does not represent the answer to all the questions.  Other models have a better answer to some questions.</p></speech>

Nitrogen losses to water really is the key issue.  Those losses constitute the most significant concern and our estuaries are in the poorest condition overall.  Only 38% of those meet water quality targets.  The concept of nitrogen loss is where nitrogen applied to the ground seeps through the soil and into the water table.  Those losses have been increasing since 2013, which means that we are seeing an increasing negative trend in that regard.  They come mainly from agriculture, as a result of the use of chemical fertiliser and organic manures, but also, to a lesser extent, from urban wastewater.  The key areas in which we see those water issues are in the south and south east, which are the areas with the highest levels of intensive farming practices.  We can see the impact on a catchment basis.  This comes back to the point I made earlier about a catchment-based approach.  These are the areas in which we can see the biggest impact on water quality.</p></speech>

I would like to go back to some of the points relating to agriculture.  Mr. Treacy said that 350,000 ha of drained organic soil generate 8 million tonnes.  That is a little over 5% of our land area generating this very large amount.  Are there policy tools we could use in order to start to turn that negative into a positive?  That would constitute a significant element of an agricultural policy, both by paying farmers to do it and also by abatement, in this regard.  What should we be talking about doing in terms of biogenic methane consistent with a policy of reaching net zero emissions.  In New Zealand, they are talking along the lines of a reduction of between 24% and 47%.  Where do we get the offsets in Ireland to achieve that lower target?</p> <p>  In what area do the witnesses reckon we can most easily make progress as we seek to move from the climate plan of 2019, which, as they indicated, will deliver the previous target, to the target of 51% that we have now adopted?  On what areas should our committee be focusing in the context of seeking to achieve that?</p></speech>

As we pointed out, however, there is great uncertainty with regard to exactly where those 350,000 ha are and exactly what measures to re-wet that land or raise or manage the water table on it will achieve.  Research in that regard is ongoing.  It is in the Teagasc plan to re-wet approximately 40,000 ha, which it has estimated will save 4.4 million ha over the 2021-2030 period.  There is definitely substantial potential in this regard.</p> <p>  Members must also recognise that much of that land has likely been in productive agriculture for quite some time.  It may not be either socially or technologically very easy to re-wet that land.  It is not our direct area of expertise but there are unknowns there, particularly around where it is, what is currently happening on that land and the ease or otherwise with which it could be re-wet.  From a purely theoretical perspective, substantial reduced emissions could be achieved by managing the water table on that land.</p> <p>  I will address the Deputy's final question on land use and the future and perhaps Dr. McGovern will take the question on methane.  There are not that many easy options left.  The Climate Action Plan 2019 contains a lot of very challenging measures.  On land use, clearly we need to act now in terms of planting forestry, for example, if we are to use that or if that is to be a factor for removals out to 2050.  As it stands, afforestation rates are low enough that forestry is likely to become a source post 2030 as things stand.  There are actions, even though they are long-term, particularly on the land side, which need the action now to actually deliver in 20 or 30 years' time.  That is where I will leave it.</p></speech>

My understanding is that New Zealand has a separate target for biogenic methane that would involve significant reductions to 2050, which, according to the science, would more than offset any warming effect that it may have.  As I indicated, the reductions would be greater than that 3% per decade.  It would, therefore, actually be taking methane out of the atmosphere in a sense by not replenishing it like that.  I am not sure why it would be offset in the other sectors.  The other sectors would need to reach their own climate neutrality or climate net zero pathways either in combination or separately.</p></speech>

To close out and perhaps end on an optimistic note, climate neutrality in this sector presents an opportunity but it requires an integrated response that will ensure fairness for all.  It must be planned and managed both to underpin systemic change to enable low-carbon technologies and practices to flourish and behavioural change to enable individuals, communities, business and organisations to play their part.  That is across all sectors, including agriculture.</p> <p>  I thank Deputies and Senators for their thoughtful and thought-provoking questions.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.461" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021062900002#A00400"><p>I welcome our witnesses.  They are all addressing us virtually via MS Teams.  Mr. Rody O'Brien and Ms Maree Ryan-O'Brien are representing Aitheantas, Ms Susan Lohan and Ms Mari Steed are representing the Adoption Rights Alliance, Ms Suzanne Connolly, chief executive officer, and Ms Christine Hennessy, head of post-adoption services, are representing Barnardos, and Dr. Maeve O'Rourke and Ms Claire McGettrick are representing the Clann Project.  We are engaging with the witnesses in our pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the birth information and tracing Bill.  The purpose of this proposed legislation is to enshrine in law the importance of an individual knowing his or her origins.</p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I must advise them about parliamentary privilege when addressing a parliamentary committee.  As all of the witnesses are appearing before the committee virtually, I need to point out that there is uncertainty about whether parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if I direct them to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Each witness will be allocated three minutes to speak.  Given the time constraints, I must adhere to that allocation strictly.  I will call on the witnesses in the following order: Ms Ryan-O'Brien, Ms Lohan, Ms Connolly and Ms McGettrick.  I understand that others will probably contribute during the question-and-answer session, which will follow the opening statements.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Ryan-O'Brien to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

As a recognised key stakeholder group, our primary objective is that reform of the law in this area be victim-survivor led and that the concept of people before paper be at the heart of any legislation.  We welcome the Bill as a step forward and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's work to advance this matter.<br/><br/>I am an adoptee, but I feel I need to highlight that I was not born in a mother and baby home and did not come through the mother and baby home system.  As such, I was outside the remit of the commission and, like thousands of others, could not participate in its investigations due to its restrictive remit.  Many were shut out of this process and were not included in An Taoiseach's apology.  This needs to be acknowledged and addressed.  There need to be clear pathways of participation for those who were outside the remit in any process moving forward.<br/><br/>I have experienced this system and its shortcomings on a personal level, whether it was as a 29-year-old diagnosed with an autoimmune condition that I had no background medical information on and that I later discovered I was predisposed to or as a new mum being advised by our doctor to seek clarification on a potentially inherited life-threatening condition to protect myself and my children and having to liaise with agencies that simply did not care.  I have experienced the invasive and controlling nature of this system, which withheld the existence of a biological sibling from me for six years, only revealing it years later when I sought information on my biological father.  This system treats adoptees as if we are guilty of some wrongdoing, and while we very much welcome this Bill as a signal of some progress and a move away from previous legislation's &quot;much ado about doorsteps&quot; approach, it does not go far enough.<br/><br/>Most adoptees' concerns are practical ones regarding medical information and access to identity information.  While the Bill goes some way towards recognising the significance of medical information, it is unrealistic to assume that a bank of information on this will suddenly become available.  There are considerable hurdles to overcome and, as such, we would seek for enhanced medical screening for adoptees and their children and earlier entry to existing screening programmes.<br/><br/>While we welcome Mr. Gloster's apology as an acknowledgement of the appalling treatment that adoptees have been subjected to, neither Tusla nor the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, should continue to play a part in adoptees' lives or make determinations on access to information.  In 2019, the AAI refused nine applications for birth certificates.  In 2018, it refused six.  Despite that, under the Bill, this selfsame agency, which has already ruled on these applications, will again have an integral part in the process of adoptees applying for copies of their birth certificates, as set out in the general scheme of the Bill.  This begs serious questions as to the constitutionality of the process.<br/><br/>If we are to move the legislative focus from the clean break or clean slate model to clean access, it needs to be within a new agency with a new social work model.  Most importantly, as legislation on this issue has languished for so long, the Bill needs to provide for a compulsory review period in order that issues can be addressed and improved upon and we do not perpetuate the wrongs of the past.<br/><br/>I will quickly recap the main issues with the Bill.  It is a rehash of the IO'T <i>v</i>. B case.  We believe that, for the reasons set out in our submission, the Bill is an unsatisfactory attempt to legislate for adoptees' right to identity.  The Child and Family Agency and the Adoption Authority of Ireland are unfit for purpose in the context of this Bill.  We are calling for a new agency, independent of the above bodies, to be the main focus.  We do not accept the qualifications or restrictions on the release to adoptees of their birth information and birth certificates.  This is a disproportionate restriction and goes too far in recognising and placing the constitutional right to privacy of the birth parent over and above the constitutional right to identity of the adoptee.  We advocate for a suite of supports, including medical screening.  We are concerned by the lack of provision in the Bill for a review of the legislation.  This is a serious omission and one that needs to be addressed urgently.  We note the conflicting explanatory notes throughout the Bill.  For example, the general data protection regulation, GDPR, is used to prevent access to adoptees for certain information.  Elsewhere, attempts are made to exempt the application of GDPR.  We note a significant level of discretion and arbitrariness assigned to relevant bodies.  There is a necessity to make guidelines compulsory rather than optional in the various processes throughout the Bill.  The provision relating to a register of acknowledged identity and a certificate of acknowledged identity needs to be clarified.  The issue of immunity for the State and relevant bodies as set out in the Bill is noteworthy and concerning.<br/><br/>We very much appreciate the opportunity to speak before the committee today and would sincerely like to thank its members, clerk and staff for their assistance.  We welcome members' questions.</p></speech>

We are pleased to make this submission on the proposed birth information and tracing Bill 2021.  It is 20 years for me and more than 20 years for Ms Steed since we first engaged with legislators in this House on such legislation.  In my most cynical moments, even I could not have foreseen that I would still be repeating the same mantras 20 years later.  As such, I hope that the committee will take into account our comments and fears about the Bill and act accordingly.</p> <p>  Ms Steed and I have worked in the area of advocacy of adopted people's rights for several decades.  We bring to the debate our personal experiences as adopted people.  Ms Steed was trafficked to the US from the Bessborough Mother and Baby Home.  She was also a victim of illegal vaccine trials prior to her trafficking to the US.</p><p>I was adopted from a private infant hospital, which is not included in the commission of investigation&rsquo;s terms of reference of the commission and excluded from the terms of this Bill.  It seems that once again the Minister and Department have sought to divide the communities of people who may access the information set out in this Bill so once again, I find myself excluded.  Ms Steed and I and others at Adoption Rights Alliance have carried out years of research and evidence gathering.  Unfortunately, many adopted people have died during the decades of inaction on the State&rsquo;s part to recognise their rights as Irish citizens and as adopted people.  This inaction is a serious abuse of our human rights and presents ongoing discrimination, all of which has been noted by the IHREC, the ICCL and special rapporteurs at the UN.  Most importantly, it stands in conflict with Article 8 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  </p><p> While we recognise that this Bill represents a significant advancement in the view of the State on the rights of adopted people to identity and personal information, several key sections of the Bill remain problematic for us.  First, as I referenced earlier, a huge percentage of those boarded out, sent out to nurse or adopted legally or illegally who were born in State and private hospitals are not included in the information sharing set out in this Bill.  Equally, anyone who spent time in the care of a private infant hospital, which would include St. Patrick's Infant Hospital in Blackrock, County Dublin, which was run by one of the most notorious disgraced adoption agencies, St. Patrick's Guild.  We can safely say that unconditional access to information and birth certificates is not unfettered.  It is not unconditional for all.  We reject the notion that if a natural parent has registered a "no contact" preference, the adopted person, their son or daughter, would be subject to what can only be described as a labyrinthine process to access his or her information.  Access to personal information and records is also not for all.  It excludes the categories of people I mentioned earlier.  </p><p> The definitions of information are conflicting and are not rigorous.  This includes birth, early care and medical information.  In an attempt to include everything, the Bill has ended up being overly and unnecessarily prescriptive.  Anyone applying for information should be given the content of his or her files, full stop.  </p><p> The relatives of those who died in institutions were surprised and shocked to realise that they may not apply for their deceased relative&rsquo;s information.  Given the circumstances behind Ireland's forced and closed adoption system, this is deeply disturbing.  As it stands, this Bill does not even put us on parity with other Irish citizens.  At the very least, we should expect extraordinary and additional measures to go some way to redress the faults of the past.  When it comes to siblings, we were shocked to discover that an adopted person or somebody who had been boarded out will only be told that he or she has a sibling and the gender and age of that sibling.  This is all public domain information.  To suggest that somebody who might have experienced years of delay at the hands of Tusla or the Adoption Authority now has to go and research information on his or her siblings when it is publicly available is frankly unacceptable.  </p><p> We also object to the tone and language of the Bill, which is certainly not representative of a transitional justice approach.  It does not reflect the grave human rights abuse suffered by natural mothers and their children in various institutions.  I concur with the previous speaker that Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland need to have their systems radically overhauled.  In particular, those of Tusla are frankly not fit for purpose.  I have witnessed this.  Tusla managers came in to give a presentation to the collaborative forum, which is a group of individuals who offer advice to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  They have a very disturbing view on adopted people or anybody applying for personal information through their offices.  </p><p> We are very grateful to our Clann Project colleagues, who will present later on in this session.  They have produced a comprehensive list of amendments to the Bill as it stands.  We have echoed these same elements in our own submission but the details can be found within the Clann submission.  We wish to confirm that those elements and detailed amendments set out in the Clann submission are fully in alignment with the position of Adoption Rights Alliance.</p></speech>

I appreciate that language included in this legislation is very sensitive and that some mothers prefer the term "birth mothers" while others prefer the term "natural mothers".  I will use the term birth mothers as the term currently used in the legislation.</p> <p>  Barnardos has been providing post-adoption support services to birth mothers and adopted adults since 1978.  Thousands of birth mothers, adopted adults and birth family members have contacted Barnardos for individual support and counselling.   Approximately 1,200 birth mothers and adopted adults have attended our group support service.  Additionally, we deliver a specialist therapeutic support service to adults whose births were incorrectly registered as well as providing a national therapeutic service to children and teenagers adopted both domestically and internationally.</p> <p>  Barnardos welcomes the following provisions in the proposed legislation: the right of adopted adults, adults who were incorrectly registered and adults who were boarded out to access birth certificates and personal information; the entitlement of those over 16 to apply for their original birth certificate; the right of adopted adults to access personal items left on file for them by their birth mothers or birth fathers; the placing of information and tracing services and the new contact preference register on a statutory footing; the establishment of a new register of acknowledged identity allowing adults, including those incorrectly registered, to receive a certificate and correct their entry; and the provision for third party agencies to share information for tracing purposes without being in contravention of GDPR.</p> <p>  However, we would recommend the following.  We recommend increasing the notice period for birth mothers to register their contact preference option from three to a minimum of six months.  We have worked with many women who have never disclosed the existence of an adopted child to their partners or family.  Birth mothers attending Barnardos support groups have told us the three-month period is too short.  They have told us that they need time to consider their options and may need to seek personal and professional support with this.</p> <p>  We propose that the right to post-adoption counselling and support should be placed on a statutory footing for all birth mothers and adopted adults.  It should not be confined as currently proposed to birth mothers who register a "No" preference.  We recommend that statutory counselling be made available to those birth mothers who register a "Yes" preference and to those who may not able to engage with the register at all.  Many mothers we work with have told us of the positive impact of counselling and support on their lives.  We suggest that all adopted adults should be entitled to statutory counselling and therapeutic support should they wish to avail of it.  Most adopted adults tell us that they have had happy family lives.  However, some have told us they have had negative experiences of adoption, including neglect, rejection and abuse that has left them with lifelong hurt.  We also recommend that young people accessing their original birth certificate should be offered specialist adoption support should they wish to avail of it.  Our experience of working with teenagers would suggest that some may struggle to process information on their background that might emerge as a result of their application.</p><p>We also recommend that adopted adults have a right to choose whether or not to attend an information session in the event of a no-contact preference.  This must be optional.  Barnardos has worked with some adults who have found the experience of a birth parent refusing contact to be extremely painful.  Some of them have welcomed an intensive level of support to talk about the refusal and its impact on them.  Others have not needed support.  Therefore, attendance at an information session should absolutely be a matter of choice for the adopted adult.</p><p> We recommend extending the date to correct inaccurately registered births.  We suggest this because we have provided support to adults whose births were incorrectly registered past the date of 31 December 1970.</p><p> Finally, we recommend the Government would adequately resource the adoption sector in order to ensure staffing levels can meet the needs of birth mothers and adopted adults.  Lengthy waiting lists for adoption services already exist and demand is certain to increase considerably following the enactment of the Bill. </p></speech>

The Clann Project welcomes the publication of the general scheme of the birth information and tracing Bill.  We have, however, identified a number of major issues, which we outline in detail in our submission.  The following is a summary of the main issues but not all.</p> <p>  This Bill does not provide unconditional access to birth certificates.  It imposes a mandatory information session on adopted people, and adopted people only, whose natural parents have registered a no-contact preference.  Birth registrations have been public records in Ireland since 1864.  Any restrictions on access to these public documents will serve to further stigmatise and marginalise adopted people.  Simply put, it will make matters worse.</p> <p>  I want to be very clear on what the information session is about.  The information session is discriminatory and in breach of the equal rights and freedoms of adopted people.  It is envisaged that a social worker will inform the adopted person of the natural parents' privacy rights and of the importance of respecting their contact preferences.  Instead, it is more than sufficient to simply notify the adopted person of their natural parents' contact preferences, regardless of what that preference is.  Adopted people are entirely capable of respecting no-contact preferences without further explanation and it is deeply offensive to suggest otherwise.  The right to information about oneself and contact with natural family members are separate issues.  No adopted person is demanding the right to a relationship with natural family members.  As set out in our submission and amendments, notification of contact preference should be in written booklet form and provided at the same time as records are produced.  This notification should apply to all those requesting records and not just a particular group of adopted people.  An information session should be an optional service and it must be carried out by archivists, not social workers or psychologists.  The optional information session should also be framed as a service to assist affected people rather than a disciplining measure to ensure they understand the concept of privacy.</p> <p>  On access to records and information, we are extremely concerned at the extent to which GDPR rights are being restricted under this Bill.  Entire categories of mixed personal data are explicitly excluded without justification, notably the information about the care provided to a person by adoptive and natural parents and the identity of one&rsquo;s siblings.  The information rights of natural mothers and relatives are also completely ignored.  The Bill must provide all affected people, including relatives of the deceased, with a clear pathway for immediate access to their records and to administrative files.  The Bill must also recognise that mixed personal data is personal data as confirmed by the European Court of Justice.</p> <p>  This Bill runs the risk of perpetuating the culture of shame and secrecy that pervades the Irish adoption system.  For too long, the Irish State has held an erroneous presumption that adopted people and natural mothers are on opposing sides.  Natural mothers have largely remained silent but we must be careful about what we read into that silence.  The historical and continued human rights violations associated with this system are deeply embedded, and the State&rsquo;s efforts to protect itself amount to a complex gaslighting project that renders many stakeholders silenced and paralysed.  The proposed publicity campaign presents a unique opportunity to let mothers know that they no longer need to bear the burden of secrecy and shame, to let adopted people know that they are equal in the eyes of the law, and to let relatives of the deceased know that they can finally learn what became of their family members.</p> <p>  It is clear that the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, is committed to equality for all Irish citizens.  We are committed to working with him and with this committee to improve the legislation to ensure it represents a true measure of justice and a major milestone in our nation&rsquo;s efforts to address so-called historical abuses.  We will not accept anything less.  Dr. O&rsquo;Rourke and I will be glad to answer any questions and I thank the committee members for their time. </p></speech>

I appreciate all the testimonies from all of the people who come before the committee today.  I have three questions the first of which is for the Adoption Rights Alliance.  How could the language and tone of the Bill become more representative of transitional justice?  Ms Lohan has indicated that the current Bill is not representative of a transitional justice approach.</p> <p>  My second question is to the Clann Project.  The involvement of the social worker in the notification of a no-contact preference is, as the witness has said, deeply offensive since it suggests that people are incapable of respecting such a preference.  How does the Clann Project suggest that an adopted person is informed of a natural parent's privacy rights in a clear concise and appropriate manner?</p> <p>  My final question is for Barnardos.  Ms Connolly has suggested that the mandatory information session for adopted adults is made discretionary.  How long may the adopted persons take in deciding to attend such information sessions?  Is it suggested that a time limitation is put in place or that it be discretionary?</p></speech>

If any of the speakers wants to hand the question over to a colleague that is no problem and perhaps they would just indicate that.</p></speech>

There are no indicators of that in the Bill.  One would have thought, for example, that anybody who was imparting the information to an adopted person or to someone who had been boarded out would have an obligation set out in the legislation to report any findings of wrongdoing or criminality, and there is absolutely no suggestion of that in the Bill as it currently stands.  I will now hand over to Ms Mari Steed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mari Steed" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021062900002#C00800"><p>Ms Lohan has answered very admirably the transitional justice question.  Many of us in the United States were adopted to states that do not currently support open records.  It puts some people at a distinct disadvantage.  There are those of us who were adopted domestically and do have rights to the records where some do not.  There is a bit of inequality there also.  We need the fuller picture to form our own truths.  With regard to our early life records many of us were sent to the US with no documentation whatsoever.</p></speech>

Anybody, therefore, including mothers, regardless of who is applying for information, could be given the information in a booklet in the first instance but if they wish to have it in the form of a meaningful information session, that would be possible too.</p><p> We suggest in our amendments things like informing people of the national contact preference register for a start.  A person can register his or her preference and if another party has registered a preference in his or her case then it will tell that person what the preference is.  A tracing service is also available if a person would like to avail of that.</p><p> Also, if records are being handed over, what they mean should be explained, for example, if there is an abbreviation in the record or if a particular form is included; anything to help translate anything confusing from decades ago.  In other words, it should encapsulate a service for people who have been wronged by this country and not as this punitive measure to ensure that we know how to protect privacy and understand that just because a no-contact preference has been lodged, a person knows what to do.  Adopted people are no different from any other citizen in that regard.  We are well aware of what to do.  The Senator should feel free to come back if she would like more on that.</p></speech>

The question was about how long we think an adopted adult should be given to consider whether he or she would like to avail of an advisory session on being told his or her birth mother has registered a no-contact option.  I would suggest that decision is discretionary according to the needs of the adopted adult concerned.  Some adopted adults may immediately feel they do not wish to have an information session.  In that case, as we said in our submission, there should be no barrier to that adopted adult receiving his or her original birth certificate.  Some may, however, receive that information with great sadness and shock and should be given a discretionary period to think about whether they would like to get some professional support or advice to consider their response.  I would, therefore, suggest discretionary action would be the best way to proceed.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and apologise; she came to me quicker than I was expecting.</p> <p>  I wish to address the issue of the birth mothers and the balancing of rights here.  Very rightly and appropriately, this Bill is creating a hierarchy and establishing that a person's right to his or her identity, and all the information surrounding that from his or her early life, should be available to him or her.  Anything held really should be made available to that person.  That is right.  It is the most important right here, which needs to be vindicated; having a right of access does that.</p> <p>  This Bill also seeks to vindicate that right to privacy of the birth mother who has expressed a no-contact preference.  I see and read it differently from the manner in which this is expressed in the witnesses' submissions.  I note that there is an obligation on the Oireachtas to produce a law that is constitutional and in being constitutional, it must sufficiently vindicate that right.  The very minimum of that, therefore, is to say that if we are going to remove a person's right to privacy or a right that person believes he or she has, we are going to provide that person with counselling if he or she prefers to have no contact.  We will also oblige a meeting with the person who is getting that information, acknowledging very respectfully - I am very mindful of everything here - that this is someone's information and right to knowing who he or she is.  The information session, however, is to vindicate that the constitutional right to privacy has been covered and the counselling then is to ensure there is support.  That is the very minimum that would equate to being sufficient for this particular piece of legislation to be constitutional.</p> <p>  I have questions for the witnesses on how they would ensure the constitutionality of the privacy portion of this right.  Perhaps Barnardos can also assist us in with its experiences.  I have had conversations with people who have never told anyone they have had a child, except in the absolute privacy and confidentiality of their discussions with me under a presumption of anonymity.  I believe that we need to address that.  I would appreciate the witnesses' replies.</p></speech>

I first want to clarify something.  I do not think it is to be welcomed that the Bill is setting up a hierarchy.

When we hear about mothers saying no to contacts, we need to be very careful about what we read into that because it is always a complex "No".  Not everybody who is on the receiving end of that "No" - by that I mean advocates and counsellors - will know how to handle that "No".  Actually, the "No" sometimes means that they are living in shame and fear of going back to what happened to them.  It should by no means be constituted as fear of their adult children or fear of their adult children getting information about themselves.  We need to be very careful about calling this a hierarchy because as I said, we are compounding the secrecy and shame.  That is exactly what that does.</p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question about the privacy element, there is a duty to inform an adopted person that a no-contact preference has been registered.  That suffices.  What is the problem with simply informing the adopted person that a no-contact preference has been registered?  That is more than sufficient to protect someone's privacy.  An adopted person is not going to go and demand a relationship where a relationship is not wanted.  There is, therefore, no need to ram that down the adopted person's throat in the form of an information session, which at the moment is not framed in a supportive context.  It is framed as a disciplinary measure.</p></speech>

In addition to being an adopted adult from Ireland, I am also a mother of adoption loss.  I am, therefore, very keenly aware of both sides of the equation.  A right to privacy is not the same thing as a right to anonymity, which is sort of what the Senator is suggesting.  We do not have a right to be anonymous to our children.  We have a duty to be accountable to them and give them their identity, right to information and right to early-life care.  I would never do that to my daughter irrespective of whether I want a relationship with her or she wants one with me.  It is also important to point out that it is not always mothers who may not want the contact but adopted people as well.</p><p>That contact preference can cover both needs and it does so-----</p></speech>

This legislation is about ensuring people have the right to know who they are and that there should not be anonymity.  That is the whole point in having access to the information, and it is absolutely right that that should happen.  I see that I am being misinterpreted.  What I see the legislation doing is attempting to vindicate the rights of those who do not wish to have contact by providing them with counselling and saying there is going to be an information session.  That is what is being proposed at the moment as being sufficient to vindicate the right that the birth mother has, and we are here to discuss that.  However, that is a difficulty.  There is a hierarchy here.  There are people who have lived in anonymity and that is being taken away from them, rightly so and for all the right reasons, but there is a consequence that the State must try to meet while it is taking away that right of anonymity.  I am not saying the right of anonymity was correct and it certainly was not, but that is what is currently in the Bill and that is what needs to be addressed.  Is that sufficient?  Ms Steed is saying it is not sufficient and it is disrespectful to adopted people, and I hear that, but we need to explore it and discuss it.</p></speech>

As we said in our submission, we have met with more than 1,200 women who have attended those groups and this issue was recently discussed at one of our support groups.  We need to bear in mind that these are women who were strong enough to come along to a support group.  There was a very wide range of views.  Some women were very pleased to see the legislation and some women were very apprehensive and nervous as to what it was going to mean, and very apprehensive and nervous on behalf of the women who were perhaps not strong enough to come along to a Barnardos group.</p> <p>  Like Ms Connolly, I have been many years in the area and I am delighted to see legislation that is clearly coming down in favour of the rights of adopted people to information because other versions of legislation have fallen while this thorny issue was debated.  For me, it is going to be all about communicating gently, carefully and accessibly, and for a much longer period than three months, to reach out to women around the country, not just through national media, but through local media, through radio, making friendly voices available for them to speak about their concerns, and not forcing them to engage with computerised systems to express their preferences.  It is that kind of duty of careful care to encourage those frightened women to come forward in an empathetic way that is the way forward with this, and over a much longer period than three months.  We are suggesting six months minimum.  In the UK, it was two years, so three months is really not a sufficient period of time to allow that work to be done with the many nervous birth mothers around the country.</p></speech>

On the practicalities of the Bill, when we are talking about medical information, there are no fathers&rsquo; names or details.  I want to tease out the opinions on getting that information from the Bill itself.  There is a growing body of advocates for one new agency, given the trauma involved and the lack of proper rules or proper actions within the current agencies, Tusla and Adoption Ireland.  How do the witnesses feel about possibly starting afresh with a new agency?  I want to tease out people's opinions on that issue.</p></speech>

As we outlined in our opening statement, we feel that neither Tusla nor Adoption Ireland should have any active part in adoptees&rsquo; lives moving forward and, sadly, that has not always been the case.  If we could all agree, as I believe we can, on a more centralised approach, with centralisation of files, cross-referencing and accessing of information, establishing data as to how many birth mothers gave more than one child up for adoption, and making sure that these siblings were aware they actually had siblings who were adopted, that would be a massive step forward and it would also be viewed positively.</p> <p>  To touch on the other issues raised, we are looking at either a transitional justice approach or a restorative justice approach, and we can all agree that one of the basic tenets of any process is participation, which has been sadly lacking for many who are directly affected by this issue.</p> <p>  With regard to the agencies that are involved at the moment, in terms of moving forward it would become a barrier to participation for many people who simply would not want to engage with Tusla or Adoption Ireland to the same extent that they had to previously.  As we touched on in our opening statement, to have people who have been previously refused access to information then going back to the self-same agencies that have ruled on them previously, looking for access to information, is problematic.</p> <p>  I want to read some quotes from our survey on the identity rights of adoptees.  One person said: &ldquo;Not having knowledge of one's background, history or roots causes a person to be insecure, and doubting self-worth, coupled with deep-seated issues of abandonment, can cause serious issues for one's well-being.&rdquo;  Another comment was: &ldquo;There are pieces of meat in the supermarket with more rights to tracking and information of origin than me.&rdquo;  In the context of any process, be it three months, six months or two years, we need to be very mindful that we are waiting over 20 years for this legislation.  We are far behind access to information in Europe, and every day this drags on is another day of people waiting for the most basic access to information for themselves.  I believe it can be done with a balancing of rights for all parties, neither one nor the other, and we can be respectful of everybody's views moving forward.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. O'Brien to come in on the IO&rsquo;T case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.500" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rody O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021062900002#E01200"><p>I thank the Senator for the question and for bringing in the IO&rsquo;T case, with which most of us are familiar.  This was a Supreme Court case from over 23 years ago and I am quoting from that case, just in case there is any offence at the terminology used.  It found that the identity of one &ldquo;natural mother&rdquo; was an unenumerated right under the Constitution following on from the natural and special relationship between a mother and child.</p><p>As we are all well aware now, the Chief Justice stated that the exercise of that right might conflict with the mother's constitutional right to privacy, which is exactly the point Senator Seery Kearney raised in her last question.  It is important to knit it all together and bring it in.  In the Supreme Court case, Chief Justice Hamilton said that the mother did not have an absolute constitutional right to her anonymity, as we discussed earlier.  The anonymity at the time she placed her child for adoption is not guaranteed.  There are conflicting constitutional rights.  The court heavily criticised the Legislature and in the IOT case Mr. Justice Keane, who went on to become Chief Justice, stated rather robustly that the matter was one that should be regulated by the Legislature.  Twenty three years later, we are here discussing it.  Mr. Justice Keane said that the fact that the Oireachtas had failed to regulate by legislation did not justify the court in undertaking such a task for which it lacks not merely the expert guidance available to the legislative arm but also, and more crucially, the domestic mandate.   It is our contention that the need for a balancing of rights is the same as in the IO'T case.  Previous speakers have alluded to this as well.  </p><p> The issue of birth mothers' privacy appears to be taking prominence yet again with this information session.  The information can be vital to adoptees when seeking their information.  The Bill is titled the Birth Information and Tracing Bill.  It has nothing to do with mothers' privacy as a paramount issue, and while that is important the priority at this stage has to be on the adoptee getting his or her information.  The information regarding privacy can be easily set out when the information is being released.  Adoptees have been discriminated against for far too long with regard to accessing information.  </p><p> I speak with two hats here.  I am the husband of an adoptee and I have interacted with Tulsa and the Adoption Authority of Ireland for many years.  I can see this from the legal perspective too and from the point of view expressed by Senator Seery Kearney, that is, the balancing of constitutional rights, but there has to be a point where the constitutional rights of the adoptees is given preference or a higher standing.  That is not in this Bill.  One can still balance the rights without again favouring or having a veto.  There is a sense of the birth mothers or parents being almost permitted to restrict the information being given by the adoptees with regard to no contact and, therefore, information sessions.  As pointed out by other speakers, this is very problematic.  It is an element of discrimination which is offensive and it perpetuates the discrimination that has gone on for far too long with regard to the adoptees getting their information.  The Bill is welcome and the intentions of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, are honourable and he does want to try to find a solution.  We do not see the legislation as a major shift.  We see it as still an obstacle regarding birth mothers' privacy and the Bill reflecting some preference or hierarchy of rights whereby the adoptees can have the information as long as they meet the requirement of a birth mother not wanting any contact.  If the birth mother does not want any contact, there are plenty of laws in place to protect her privacy but which do not restrict the exercise of the constitutional rights of adoptees to information.  The Bill is too restrictive.</p></speech>

An important point in regard to I.O'T <i>v</i>. B is that it was not concerned with the constitutionality or otherwise of legislation, nor is it concerned with access to publicly registered birth certificates.  It is of very limited relevance.  Another important recent development is the confirmation by the Court of Appeal that there is an unenumerated constitutional right to have one's identity correctly recognised by the State, which requires one to have access to that information in the first instance and to then have it used by the State.  That is important.<br/><br/>On the question of what options are available to the Oireachtas, it is important to take into account the case of Fleming and Ireland, which as Senators will know establishes that the Oireachtas has great discretion in areas of sensitive, social policy, not to mention the case law of Tuohy <i>v.</i>Courtney where the Supreme Court essentially tells us that where you are balancing the rights of citizens against each other legislation would need to be arbitrary and to lack an objective basis to be struck down as unconstitutional.  That is the background.  It gives great discretion.  The Oireachtas needs to consider what are the options.  Is it strictly necessary and has the evidence demonstrated that social workers need to have to engage with an undefined category of adopted people.  It could anyone whose birth parents opt to have no contact.  Where is the evidence to say that it is necessary that these people be sat down with a social worker to be told solely about the parents' rights to privacy and the importance of respecting that as provided in the legislation as currently drafted?  Where is the evidence that it is not sufficient to give this information in writing?  We also have to consider all of the other measures that can be taken around that that are not punitive and are supportive.  <br/><br/>It is important to mention the elephant in the room, which is the notion in the previous Bill that adoptees could be of harm to the health and life of their parents.  We have laws on harassment.  We have criminal law.  There is no evidence that adoptees are a particular group in society that do not understand privacy unless a social worker sits them down and tells them what it means.  They pose no more risk than the Irish diaspora abroad who every day of the week are invited to search for the long last families, to come home to Ireland, to visit the National Library to search their records and try to track down their birth relatives.  Other things need to be considered, including, primarily, the Tuohy <i>v.</i>Courtney Supreme Court decision which demonstrates the latitude that the Oireachtas has here and that deference will be given to the legislation, once well thought through and the necessity has been really considered.  </p></speech>

I had not realised I had indicated to speak.  I am a new member of this committee and I have not engaged with any our guests heretofore.  I have been trying to read myself into the brief and I have found it to be almost a bottomless pit.  The more I study the more I seem to need to know.  I am grateful for the submissions given today by the witnesses, which I have studied briefly but will study in detail later.  I join this committee with an open mind.  I welcome information.  I like the language that we would use in our daily intercourse to be kind and civil.  I was very impressed by Christine Hennessy's remarks in that regard.  I think I detected some form of confrontation or division.  Some weeks ago, I listened in to an interview on related to this matter on "Newstalk" - it may have been "RTE Radio 1" - and I noted some of the women seemed to be upset that information was being demanded of them.</p><p>These were people who did not want any information to be shared with adopted children.  It weighed on my mind and I thought a lot about this aspect.  I can see that certain fears would exist in that regard.  I do not think it is perhaps right to say that people are paranoid when they have a feeling of this kind.  We are not talking about being harassed or anything like that.  However, let us be reasonable about this as well.  If there is a point of view there, then I suppose it must be expressed.  Several organisations exist to advocate on behalf of adopted people seeking information and for their rights.  I presume there is no such counter organisation, because the people involved would require anonymity, to give the point of view of those on the other side of the situation.  Is there any advocate for the other point of view or is it all one-way traffic?  I am not suggesting anything in saying that, I am just asking the question.</p><p> I listened closely to what Ms Hennessy said about giving guidance and therapy, or whatever it is.  Could we hear a little bit more about that aspect in respect of the people who are not represented by most of our speakers?  Those are all my questions.  I must admit my ignorance.  There is no point in my pretending that I know about this issue.  I do not.  I will have to study it much more closely.  I can see where there are difficulties and I like to see difficulties ironed out in a non-confrontational way.  I do not care what Government is in office, I always put my trust in it meaning well.  I state that because a lack of communication may be going on here as well.</p></speech>

There was an organisation called The Natural Parents Network of Ireland, but I do not think it exists anymore.  It is a pity that there is not a representative organisation for natural birth mothers speaking today.  All I can do is to try to represent some of the voices of women who have attended the groups over the years.  It will not be a surprise to any of the guests to hear what I have to say.</p> <p>  The experiences of birth mothers are on the spectrum.  We work with women who were raped at 15 years old and who were forced to part from their babies.  We also work with women who chose to place their babies for adoption in their late 20s because it was a decision that they felt then and that they feel now was the right decision for their lives.  We work with women who go on to marry the father of their children and the growing child becomes like an elephant in the room.  The subject is never discussed, and often the existence of that eldest son or daughter is not disclosed to the younger sisters and brothers growing up.</p> <p>  The women who come to us in Barnardos often need support in talking to their families about the existence of their sons or daughters.  We meet many women who have never told anybody.  One lady who came to me for years used to ring her daughter in Northern Ireland.  That lady has passed away now.  I was the only person who ever knew she had a daughter growing up in Northern Ireland.  She used to come into my office every couple of months and make a phone call to her daughter.  That lady was terrified that her husband and her other children would find out about the existence of her other daughter.  We meet many other women who are welcoming this legislation with open arms, really looking forward to adopted adults in Ireland having the right to their original birth certificates and who are very clear that it is the right thing to do.  However, the outcomes here are complex for all.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that we have not heard from a representative of the group today.  It fully supports the release of personal information, including mixed personal information, to all adopted people.  The organisation recognises the great injustices which the now adult children of women like themselves have endured.  The flipside of the situation is that they would like reciprocal rights.  As many committee members know, it was largely a forced adoption system which prevailed in Ireland since the formation of the State and especially since 1952 or 1953 when legal adoption was introduced and came into force.  Many of the mothers that the representatives of the NPNI have spoken to and advised in more than 25 years have had very little recollection of all the legal circumstances behind their children&rsquo;s forced adoptions.  Many of those mothers cannot recall the circumstances of their children&rsquo;s birth due to trauma endured at the time.  Those mothers would like the reciprocal right to information on their now adult children.</p> <p>  As adopted people, we certainly have no objections to that.  The more open we can be about the situations which prevailed in Ireland the better we will all be.  In more than 20 years, I have never met a natural mother who said that she wanted to extinguish the information rights of her child.  It is not a right that we afford to any other parent.  None of us taking part in this briefing who are parents have the right to hide our children&rsquo;s birth certificates from them, regardless of the circumstances behind their births.  Therefore, the notion that we would afford that right to any other cohort is, frankly, just a complete non-starter.  It is nonsense.  What is required is openness, transparency and an admission of all the human rights abuses which took place in this arena.  Everything that happened must be addressed and spoken about freely.</p></speech>

I thank everybody for coming before the committee.  I have two questions and I would like brief responses to both.  The first one is for Ms Ryan-O'Brien of Aitheantas and the representatives of the Adoption Rights Alliance and The Clann Project.  All their statements highlight how this proposed Bill does not meet the threshold of unconditional access to birth certificates and birth information for everyone.  We have time constraints, so therefore I ask the witnesses to elaborate briefly on the importance of this proposed Bill meeting this principle.  I refer in particular to Head 40 of this general scheme of the Bill which states that the general data protection regulation, GDPR, will be disapplied.  What are the implications of that?  I would like the witnesses to explain that to the committee.</p> <p>  My second question is addressed to the representatives from Barnardos and The Clann Project.  Will they explain the importance of having a clear statutory right of access to view one&rsquo;s own, or one's parent's, I am not sure how to phrase this, care or adoption files and to records concerning a family member who died in care or adoption?  I am addressing this question to the representatives of Barnardos and The Clann Project, but because Ms Hennessy spoke about working with the approximately 1,200 birth mothers, will she elaborate on the implications that may exist for some of those people in respect of not having such access?  Turning to Ms McGettrick and Dr. O'Rourke, I would like them to comment on a clear statutory right of access to records in respect of mothers, of course, and also siblings etc..</p></speech>

All the speakers from the different groups representing adoptees are making the point that there is a restriction with the imposition of an information session.</p><p>If there is a preference by the birth parent for no contact, that triggers an information session.  That session is compulsory in order to acquire the birth certificate or birth information the adoptee is looking for.  There is a restriction based on the trigger of the no-contact preference indicated by the birth parent.  This is inequitable.  There is an issue of inequality because if you or I apply for our birth certificate, there is no restriction arising out of somebody not wanting us to have that information.  We are allowed access to the information as a right.</p><p> The point is that we are not progressing in regard to giving unrestricted access to adoptees to their birth information.  There is an obstacle when the birth parent expresses a preference for no contact.  Why should that be the point at which adoptees are restricted?  It means that their recognised identity rights, as defined in the Constitution, are limited.  That is the first point that needs to be made.</p></speech>

Unconditional access means unconditional access, the same as for every other citizen.  Since the early 1990s, adopted people have been making use of the civil registration system through resources provided by us and our predecessor.  They have been accessing that information, finding their birth certificates in this way and the sun has not fallen out of the sky.  We are not aware of any harm coming to natural mothers, natural fathers or natural family members as a result.  There is, in essence, nothing to see here.  There is no harm arising from providing this additional access but, on the other hand, there would be a lot of harm done to these women by not allowing it.  It would make matters worse and add insult to injury.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.522" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Maeve O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021062900002#H00400"><p>I thank Deputy Cairns for her question.  Head 40, in our view, is hugely problematic.  Apart from the information session provision, it goes to the heart of everything that is wrong with the Bill as proposed.  It is entirely unclear how the Bill will interact with the GDPR.  The latter protects the right to access one's personal data, including mixed personal data one shares with other people, whether dead or alive.  That right is protected under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights; it could not be more protected.  Head 40 is definitely non-compliant with Article 23 of the GDPR, which sets out the requirements for any restrictions on the subject's rights under GDPR.  Head 40 provides that the rights and obligations under the GDPR are restricted to the extent necessary to enable, in essence, the effective functioning of the information and tracing scheme provided for in the Bill.  This gives, in effect or at least on paper, a carte blanche for the GDPR to be disapplied in respect of adopted people's rights to their information.</p> <p>  The Bill includes an explicit right to request access to personal data held either by Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  It is unclear whether the Bill will mean that people cannot ask anybody else for copies they hold.  For example, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is not currently defined as a relevant body but it is responding to GDPR subject access requests.  Will people still be able to make such requests to the Department or any other body that holds adoption records or copies of same?  That is not clear.</p> <p>  There are huge restrictions that are not permissible under the GDPR regarding categories of mixed personal data, to which the Deputy alluded.  The definition of care information to which people are entitled excludes everything about a parent's or adoptive parent's care review.  There is a blanket restriction that is not compatible with all the different requirements of Article 23 of the GDPR.  If you want to restrict subject rights, you need to give all the details about what you are restricting, why it is strictly necessary in a democratic society and how you will protect the essence of the right.  None of that is there.</p> <p>  The Bill also completely restricts people's access to any identifying information about their siblings, even though that is personal data.  Information on whom a person is related to is that person's information as well as being the information of his or her siblings.  There are huge issues with how this Bill is going to interact with the existing GDPR rights of adopted people.  It also looks like it will not enhance access for mothers and relatives in the context of the rights they currently have under the GDPR.  There really needs to be clarity in this regard because the GDPR does not function by magic, particularly in a historical context where there has always been a lot of secrecy.  We need to see a data protection impact assessment and the Bill needs to go back to the drawing board in terms of how the GDPR functions alongside it.</p></speech>

Many women we have spoken to over the years were not welcomed back by agencies when they sought the most basic information about their growing child.  With modern adoptions, things have changed.  Fortunately, in the case of the small number of domestic adoptions we have today, many children are placed in a semi-open or open adoption arrangements, which allows the mother to have some information about the child as he or she grows.  In the past, however, mothers were treated appallingly by agencies when they went to them looking for the most basic information.  In some cases, mothers were promised photographs of their children at various stages, but that right was never put on a statutory basis.  It was down to the adoptive parents to follow through on those promises to the mothers.  It was heartbreaking to speak to women who were let down by promises made to them by agencies and adoptive parents in terms of ongoing information about how their child was getting on.  That information simply did not materialise and it certainly added hugely to the trauma of these women that they did not know how their children were faring.</p></speech>

Other speakers touched on the need for siblings to have that access but, based on what Ms Hennessy is saying, it sounds like mothers definitely need it as well.</p></speech>

It is as simple as that.  They need to know.  The research done in the United States, in particular, on the outcomes of open adoption, where the mother becomes part of the child's life as an ongoing contact, is very promising.  I did a small amount of research in this area and found that such children were doing very well.  In general, there is nothing to fear from open exchange of information.  In fact, it is healthy for everybody and can be very good for children because there is not a sudden requirement on the child, when he or she reaches adulthood, to get to know a person who is a complete stranger.  We know the outcomes of reunion are sometimes good but, as I said earlier, they are also often complicated as two strangers, in effect, seek to get to know one another.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their contributions today.  I have been engaging on this legislation since I was first elected in 2016.  It has been a long conversation, never mind all the conversations that took place in this area in the ten, 20 and 30 years before that.  Having come to the issue with new eyes as a legislator, it seems to me that many of the conversations we are having today were already had, the decision has been made and the indication given by the Department that information will be accessible.  We are getting stuck on the issue of how the preference for no contact will be communicated.  A compulsory meeting with a social worker is an arbitrary thing that was decided on as what would best provide balance.  All the conversations we have as we go forward need to focus on how best to communicate a preference for no contact.</p><p>How do we best communicate a non-preference?  It is not about the rights that have gone past.  It is not about the hierarchy of those rights because the heads of Bill relating to this state the information will be given.  It is about ensuring the information is given in a way that is respectful and dignified and such that we are moving on instead of going back over a historical balancing of rights.</p><p> Right now what I am hearing from the submissions that have come in is the suggestion that how the information is to be given is still discriminatory and stigmatising.  There is no evidence to show that a non-contact preference given in a building or institution in the presence of a social worker will produce more effective protection of privacy than it would were it given on video or in an information booklet.  The most important thing is that the information relating to non-preference is given.  How it is given should not be a compulsory thing.  We all receive information differently.  That is the angle we need to be looking at for that argument.</p><p> My question is for Ms McGettrick or Dr. O'Rourke.  If access is to be unfettered, what we are saying is that on the request of information someone has offered, a person may want an information session.  Is that correct?  If a subject refuses, then the person is still given all the information as normal but what comes with that information is the information that the person would have got in an information session so there is no non-preference.  Then a follow-up is offered to establish whether the person needs any further clarification on what that means.  At every stage the person is choosing whether to engage further and what that means or does not mean for that person.</p><p> I wish to speak more to why that is so discriminatory.  I read the Clann project submission on this and the reference to the headlines from the UK two decades ago and how that is being replicated here.  There was also reference to the fact that we are replicating something that did not cause a major issue whenever the legislation was introduced in the UK.  How traumatising it is to see those headlines all the time.  It is as if adoptees are seen as some kind of threat.  Could we speak to why the information session further compounds that and is a re-traumatisation of forcing a situation on people that they do not want?</p><p> The other question I had relates to head 38 specifically.  It provides an exemption for the Government and the authorities and removes accountability by making statutory provision for the full immunity from damages claims unless an act was done in bad faith.  Could Dr. O'Rourke or Mr. O'Brien discuss what that means?  Are there any concerns around the provision in head 38?  Is it problematic in any sense?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.532" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Claire McGettrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021062900002#J00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of the UK headlines.  Believe it or not it was over 40 years ago.  For the benefit of those who may not be aware of it, when the Children Act 1975 was being enforced in the UK in 1976 adopted people in England and Wales were given the right to their birth certificates.  Right throughout the enactment and the debates of that legislation adopted people were painted as vindictive and potential blackmailers who would bring a threat to arrive on the doorstep.  That only intensified when the legislation was enacted.  We saw all manner of unhelpful headlines about knocks on the door etc.  In the aftermath of that legislation numerous research projects took place.  The late John Triseliotis looked at analysis of all that research and found that all these predicted calamities never actually came to pass.  Adopted people act responsibly - of course we do.  We are not somehow different or unable to act responsibly or unable to act like normal human beings.  Of course adopted people act responsibly.  In fact I would argue we are probably more aware than many other citizens given what is at stake.  As we said in our submission, adopted people often suppress unimaginable grief when it comes to things like attending a funeral incognito to spare the feelings of others or even staying away from funerals.</p> <p>  Here we are four decades later and we see the same sort of headlines appearing in the Irish media and, I daresay, in the discourse in the Oireachtas.  It is really unhelpful and stigmatising.  I am reminded of the Noble Call speech made by Panti Bliss where she referred to respectable people having a conversation about us, our rights, what we supposedly deserve and what we have been entrusted with.  So many people are sitting here talking about us it is almost as if we are not here or that we have never met a natural mother in our lives.  It is as if we do not have decades of experience in this area.  We are highly invested in this area and in getting this right.</p> <p>  The impact of the information session as envisaged is monumental.  It is so insulting to expect an adopted person to sign up to it and support it, even if it only applies to a tiny fraction of the adopted people affected.  No adopted person I know would want to have equality at the expense of an adopted person's dignity.</p> <p>  As I explained before, it is entirely possible to legislate fairly in this area.  As my colleague Dr. O'Rourke has pointed out, there are plenty of harassment laws in place.  There is no reason for the really disciplinary measure of the information session as it is currently designed.  People can opt in and out of various levels of support.  Of course various kinds of support should be made available to everyone who is receiving information, but we are a broad church.  Counselling is not for everyone.  Contact is not for everyone.

In essence it says that neither the State nor any agency responsible for giving information, i.e. Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland, will be subject to any claim for damages for failing to do what they are supposed to do unless it was done in bad faith.  In essence, subject to Article 82 of the General Data Protection Regulation, it precludes anyone taking a case in negligence, for example, or seeking damages for breach of statutory duty in the court.  People do not take those cases to win money.  They take those cases to ensure that if they have suffered a legal wrong the same treatment does not happen to other people in future.  It is an important accountability mechanism rather than a way for someone to make some cash.  It is really important to give that mechanism the respect it is due.  There is a need for accountability because it is connected to the importance of the right of access to information not only in the abstract but in the particular context of adoption and other forms of family separation in Ireland that happened in the 20th century.  As we all know, many such cases involved abuse.  Access to information is not simply the same as that of anyone else accessing data.  There is a question of actual justice and so having a remedy and ensuring accountability is important.</p> <p>  Article 82 of the GDPR usually gives a right to compensation for breaches of a subject's rights but we have a blanket restriction under head 40 of the data subject's rights to the extent necessary and proportionate to enable the scheme to operate effectively.  It is unclear whether Article 82 would really mean much.</p> <p>  In the explanatory note to head 38 the Government says it wishes to ensure that anyone acting reasonably is not going to be subjected to legal proceedings.  In negligence if a person is acting reasonably then he or she has a defence.  It does not make sense because a person has to have an arguable case to go to court.  If someone was acting reasonably in applying this legislation or any other legal obligation on a person, then there would not be a case against that person in court in the first place.</p><p>This is a hugely important and problematic head in our opinion.</p></speech>

I will be very brief because a number of meetings are clashing.  I will not use up a whole lot of time.  I just want to ask one question of Ms Steed.  I read in her witness statement that she felt there was no future role for Tusla in this regard.  We need to make informed decisions and have informed opinions.  In her opinion, is there another agency in the State at present that could take on this mantle?  Is she specifically talking about a brand new entity?</p></speech>

I believe we are now at a crucial point where we need a fresh non-governmental or quasi-governmental entity, perhaps a national system repository, that would provide the service.  The players to date are too entwined in the past horrible history of it to be effective regulators of our information.  Perhaps it will be a GDPR entity that will deal with it.  At the heart of it is a GDPR issue.  It is the right of access to information.  I could see it being a separate new body.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, this is a dedicated group of the survivors of mother and baby homes, county homes and Bethany homes and their advocates.  It advises the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on matters of interest and concern.  The performance of Tusla on that particular date still resonates with members of the collaborative forum.  Managers from Tusla spoke about having to gauge the amount of harm that an adopted person having access to their own information would cause third parties.  This, incredibly, included relatives of the natural mother who probably had no prior knowledge of the existence of a child simply by virtue of the distance in the relationship.  As far as I know, Tusla is still doing this.  It is contacting cousins of deceased natural parents to find out what their view would be on an adopted person getting personal information.  They are allowing these random people to exercise a veto over adopted people and those boarded out getting access to their own information.  The Tusla managers also expressed a very surprising view on our files.  Somebody from the collaborative forum put it to them that a new body might well be suggested to take over the supervision and dissemination of information from these files.</p></speech>

The witnesses are here today to discuss Traveller education with reference to inequality, the digital divide and the impact of reduced timetables.  Before we begin, on behalf of the committee I would like to congratulate Ms Reilly on being awarded a first class honours degree in community and youth work with Maynooth University.  This is an outstanding achievement in its own right and makes her an important role model for Traveller children and other Traveller learners.  It demonstrates that, given the opportunity, Travellers can excel in third level education.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Mr. Joyce to make an opening statement, followed by Ms Reilly and Ms Joyce.  The statements will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  Each member has a six minute slot, and that will allow the member to ask the questions and the witnesses to respond within that six minute slot.  The committee will publish the opening statement on its website following today's meeting.</p> <p>  Before we begin I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  As the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does and they have been advised of this by the clerk.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by the Chair to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Joyce to make his opening statement, followed by the other witnesses.  They have four minutes each.</p></speech>

The Irish Traveller Movement welcomes the opportunity to meet with the committee on matters relating to Traveller education with reference to inequality, the digital divide and the impact of reduced timetables.  The Irish Traveller Movement is mandated by our members to bring forward policy related to matters of national policy structures and in this context, we sit on the education working group sub-group to the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS.  This is co-ordinated under the Department of Education.  However, during 2020 the committee met only twice due to the Department&rsquo;s demands across mainstream education.</p> <p>  Impacts from cuts to Traveller education supports in 2008 have taken more than a decade to erase and there is little evidence to date of changes in terms of investment in Traveller education.  In 2019 almost 1 million pupils were enrolled nationally in primary and post-primary education in Ireland and of these more than 11,000 were Traveller pupils, which is a tiny number in comparison.  More than 3,000 of those students were in second level and it is estimated that 300 Travellers took the leaving certificate in 2020, half took the traditional exam and half took the vocational or applied certificate.</p> <p>  These numbers are important because they indicate that achieving greater ambition for Travellers in education should not be a substantial problem, or require massive investment.  What it requires is drive, ambition and the implementation of the long-awaited national Traveller education strategy across primary, post-primary and higher and further education.  It also requires dedicated staff and resources to co-ordinate it.  Full consultation with Traveller organisations is critical to ensure closer links between schools and families in any new plan.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Harris, announced ring-fenced funding of &euro;300,000, in recognition of lower than expected outcomes under targeted schemes running in the previous three years, for transfer to and progression within higher education.</p><p>While this is welcome in terms of retention in post-primary it must also be given a priority focus to defeat early school leaving.  The report of research commissioned by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth established a baseline of the experiences of Travellers and Roma in school.  It has not been published.  It should be expedited and actioned now. </p><p> In 2021, &euro;16 million was allocated in grants to schools in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme but only half of all Traveller pupils are in DEIS schools.  The capitation grant for Travellers was marginally enhanced last year, but well below the level of other named groups.  Overall, there are no ring-fenced moneys allocated to Traveller primary and post-primary education.</p><p> I want to bring up the matter of reduced timetables.  Reduced timetables for Travellers is widespread.  Department guidelines for schools were not advanced in 2020, as planned.  When they are advanced, they will require greater oversight by an independent central body with responsibility, such as Tusla or the school inspectorate.  This is not currently planned for.  We know of one southern-based school where there are approximately 60 Travellers who are on a reduced timetable.  The practice needs to be completely eradicated, with a new approach adapted towards retention and progression for Travellers.  Those schools should be held responsible for taking the easy option and for operating under a policy that shows little value to Traveller education and learning.</p><p> The specific educational disadvantages caused by Covid-19 needs immediate redress.  The impact on Traveller pupils taking their leaving certificate examinations in 2020 and 2021 are unknown.  Inequity in accessing broadband and digital supports was acknowledged by Government but Travellers were not named in supports applied to vulnerable pupils.  Without adequate data collection, the extent of problems encountered can only be anticipated, without an action plan to make up for those affected. </p><p> Addressing interculturalism and anti-racism in schools and in teacher training is critical.  The Teaching Council is due to publish a report.  However, the module should be included as mandatory to the continued professional development of all school teachers.  Expediting the anti-bullying research report commissioned by the Department of Education is important now.  Applying a mandatory requirement to current anti-bullying guidelines and recommendations should be featured in actions going forward.  Ensuring the continuation of work initiated towards curriculum inclusion of Traveller culture and history by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is critical.  However, there are no plans for it beyond its first phase.</p><p> I am happy to indicate other recommendations in respect of the matters raised here.  I thank the committee and I look forward to the further discussion.</p></speech>

I would also like to congratulate Mr. David Joyce, who is Marie Joyce&rsquo;s nephew, on finishing his master&rsquo;s degree in teaching, also with first class honours.</p> <p>  I would like to thank the committee on behalf of the Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre, which welcomes the opportunity to make a submission to the committee on Traveller education with reference to inequality, digital divide, and the impact of reduced timetables.  Pavee Point is a national, non-governmental organisation that promotes the realisation of human rights and equality for Travellers and Roma in Ireland. </p> <p>  From our start in 1985, Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre has given central importance to pursuing full and equal participation for Travellers throughout the education system.  This was, and is, based on our understanding of education&rsquo;s key importance to human dignity and rights.  Our work more recently expanded to include Roma.  Now, in the field of education, we are firmly committed to the system change that is essential.</p> <p>  The Department of Education's guidelines on Traveller education in primary schools and post-primary schools states that its central policy aim is the meaningful participation and highest attainment of the Traveller child so that, in common with the children of the nation, he or she may live a full life as a child and realise his or her full potential as a unique individual, proud of and affirmed in his or her identity as a Traveller and a citizen of Ireland.</p> <p>  The system change Pavee Point believes essential needs to be reflected as a key component of the national strategy on Traveller education, which was promised in the programme for Government.  This strategy should cover all levels and issues.  It needs to be developed in association with Traveller and Roma organisations, to have clear targets and timelines, and resources, and to continue to be monitored and implemented in partnership with Traveller organisations.</p> <p>  According to enrolment figures, Travellers transfer from primary school into the secondary school and begin dropping out in later years.  Across the first three years of the secondary cycle, about 74% of Travellers aged 12 to 15 years are enrolled.  The dramatic drop is at the point of transfer to senior cycle, in which about 30% of Travellers aged 16 to 19 years are enrolled.</p> <p>  Since 2007-08 the Higher Education Authority, HEA, has conducted an equal access survey of each cohort of new entrants, tracking enrolments from marginal populations, including Travellers.  In 2015, it published a National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021.  In the action plan for increasing Traveller participation in education from 2019 to 2021, the targeted numbers for increasing Traveller participation has had some modest success.  It has been a useful tool in the promotion of Traveller education and ambition.  Such targets and associated special measures are needed at all educational levels.</p> <p>  Further education and training participation from 2019 to 2020 included 1,527 Travellers and 431 Roma.  More than 40% were in adult literacy groups or in Youthreach.  Almost 60% were under 25 years of age.  Some 43% were men, while 57% women.  Of those enrolled, 88% partially or fully completed a course in 2019, and 60% of those who completed a certified course achieved.  Travellers comprise 0.6% to 1% of Irish society, but 0.1% of new entrants to third level institutions.  The disaggregated data are essential to track baseline information and progress in achieving targets and objectives, but it is important to understand that there are real people behind these figures.</p> <p>  I am one of the 110 students who are enrolled in universities, according to the HEA 2019-20 data.  I was an early school leaver.  I left school after primary school, due to isolation, exclusion, and marginalisation.  After a few days' absence, I was asked what the point was in me coming back, as I would never amount to anything.  I left that school crushed.  I went back to third level education as a mature student and successfully completed my degree in May of this year with a first class honours, despite the challenges and barriers that Covid-19 created and on top of the challenges and barriers that pre-existed long before Covid-19.</p> <p>  On the digital divide and reduced timetables, our previous submission to the committee discussed a number of concerns for Travellers in education.  These have been further exacerbated by the conditions created by Covid-19.  The concerns include inequalities associated with the marginalisation and discrimination that existed pre-Covid-19 for Traveller students across every level of the education system.  The reality of ongoing prejudice, racism and discrimination against Travellers, including in the education system, should not be ignored or underestimated.</p> <p>  Unconscious bias, an important issue that needs to be addressed for a variety of discriminations, needs to be understood as potentially masking real underlying racism and its effects and the indirect discrimination described in our equality legislation.  This is of particular concern for Traveller students completing examinations, including the leaving certificate.</p> <p>  Another concerning issue is the implementation of remote learning and the difficult impacts of the digital divide, which Covid-19 has exposed.  This is presenting as an issue for Travellers, in terms of access and participation in primary, post-primary and higher education.  These concerns were particularly highlighted in the national education forums that Pavee Point organised in association with the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum, NTWF, to examine the education implications of Covid-19 for Travellers and Roma.</p><p>This year&rsquo;s forum report indicates that the issues continue and can have long-term consequences.</p><p> Traveller students were left at an extreme disadvantage given the issue of access to IT facilities, high costs of broadband, lack of access to devices, resources, books, libraries and private quiet spaces to study.  As someone who has spent the last few years studying in Maynooth during the pandemic, I know that better than anyone.  Lack of broadband is a serious concern for those living on halting sites and it may have had an impact on the ability of some to register for the predicted grade process for the leaving certificate.  Online learning presents its own difficulties, including for Traveller and Roma parents, in respect of language or literacy skills.  It also holds the possibility of missing lectures due to bad Wi-Fi, inability to ask questions and difficulties with engagement.  </p></speech>

I will start by rejecting any perception that Travellers have no interest in education.  We have an interest and an ambition, especially for our children.  As a community we also have a collective experience of discriminatory and segregated education provision, which took many forms both formal and informal, and that fundamentally was underpinned by racism.  This negative legacy of segregation remains for Traveller parents and there continue to be low expectations of Traveller learners, as well as racism within the education system, which has a detrimental impact on participation in and outcomes from education for Traveller children.</p> <p>  Systemic change is required and that needs to be set out in the promised Traveller education strategy.  That strategy needs to set out a clear vision for Traveller education that is underpinned by equality.  Resources, targets and monitorable actions are also needed.</p> <p>  In the context of the current pandemic and school closures over the past two academic years, there is a real risk of deepening educational disadvantage among Travellers.  School closures and online learning were a challenging disruption for Traveller learners.  There were great expectations that everything could be moved online and that every child must have access to Wi-Fi and equipment or at the very least a phone.  Many Traveller families had limited or in most cases a complete lack of IT equipment necessary to stay connected with school and college and to submit work.  In our submission to the committee, we outline recommendations including the need for targeted resources, monitoring those resources for impact and the equitable roll-out of the national broadband strategy.</p> <p>  Reduced timetables are still a major concern for us.  This system is operating without any guidelines or monitoring.  The Department of Education has developed guidelines and plans to circulate them to schools in September 2021 as far as we are aware.  We need those guidelines to be rolled out, which should be done by way of a departmental circular.  We have continually highlighted that the guidelines must be accompanied by strict timelines and clear processes.  Supports must be put in place and rigorous monitoring will be needed to ensure that poor practice with reduced timetables is eradicated.  The inspectorate should also play a role and that monitoring.  Children have a right to an education and reduced timetables deny them that right.  The reduction of hours in school is often the wrong response to the needs of children when an increase in supports is often what is required.</p> <p>  It is important to acknowledge the achievements of Travellers who have progressed through to higher education.  There are Travellers who are working in and making contributions to education at policy level and in teaching.  That number is set to increase in coming years.  As Ms Reilly has said, the specific inclusion of Travellers in the new equity of access plan and the naming of Travellers as a target group in all access initiatives would be crucial developments.  </p> <p>  We welcome this opportunity to give input to the committee today but it is frustrating to look back at the recommendations in the 2019 reports of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, which have not been progressed as those present who sat on that committee are aware.</p> <p>  I will finish with a question for the committee members.  What will they do to ensure we are not back again in two years' time having the same discussion?</p></speech>

The presentations have clearly highlighted the enormous obstacles that Travellers face in accessing education, whether that is early years, primary, secondary or higher and further education.  The playing field is not even remotely level.  They face a huge uphill battle.  I congratulate Ms Reilly on her recent achievement and everyone who has had to climb up that hill and to achieve what they have done against an enormous prevailing wind.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Joyce.  I recall the 2008 cut, which was heavily criticised at the time as being a really cynical cut for what is a relatively small part of the budget and caused enormous harm.  Has the funding returned to the 2008 level?  Where does it need to go from here?  </p> <p>  My next question is for Ms Reilly.  What jumps out at me is that 70% of Travellers are involved in secondary education up to the age of 15 or 16, at which point there is an enormous drop-off.  What is causing that and what can we do to fix it?  I know she identified the issue of not all Travellers going to DEIS schools.  Is it a question of ensuring that all schools have access to school completion?  Is increased investment in home school community liaison required?  Do we need Traveller-specific school completion programmes?  They may already exist but I am not aware of them.  What are the causes and what are the actions we need to take?  </p> <p>  I also have a question for Ms Joyce.  Educational disadvantage for Travellers and others is built into the system and it can be seen at all tiers, including in higher and further education but it starts at a very young age.  Like other disadvantaged children, in many instances Traveller children started from behind at a very young age.  What is the level of participation of Traveller children in early years education?  Do we need to do more to make pre-primary early years education more accessible and more easily available?  Cost, obviously, has a big impact.  </p></speech>

There is the question of whether the cuts were sinister and where the investment should go now.  At a time of such need in education and during the past session, there was progress being made in terms of investment and supports, along with having liaison teachers between schools, parents and pupils.  There was some investment and approximately 40 visiting teaching services but pretty much overnight, they were gone, with no replacement, plan or strategic approach.  There have been other cuts as well.</p> <p>  That was an indictment of the treatment of the community, which had already been left behind for decades within education.  It was now at the front line of these cuts.  We have not progressed much since that time in terms of those investments.  There has not been the same investment in 2021 as there would have been at that time, despite the need and demand created by issues such as early leaving and transfers from primary to post-primary education.  People talk about third level but that is only 1% of the total Traveller population.  We are not talking about 5% or 10%.  It is nothing to take pride in and we want that to become the exception rather than the norm.  We want to get to a position where it is normalised for people to get access and opportunities to access third level.  This will absolutely not be done, given the lack of investment and budgets currently available.</p> <p>  At present, there is no budget.  We could not say what the budget would be because we do not know.  There is no dedicated budget in the Department.  We can say that if there was investment, there is a need to ramp up the supports that specifically target Traveller children.  There must be supports through initiatives.  There is a pilot initiative under way but we must ensure that right across the country, in every county, there are supports to work with schools, parents and young people in supporting them getting from primary to post-primary education.</p> <p>  Ms Reilly could probably explore this further but at present, the investment goes to the school.  In the case of a DEIS school, for example, the investment goes to the school.  We have been seeking for the investment to be in the young person, regardless of what school he or she is in.  That is whether the young person is in primary or secondary education.  We must invest in their needs and ensure they can be supported.  Currently, half of the Traveller children are not in DEIS schools and they may not be getting any support.</p> <p>  That probably answers the Deputy's question.  We are seeking ramped-up investment in the budget and a follow-the-child policy when it comes to education. </p></speech>

Special measures are needed and should be linked in with Traveller organisations.  The Deputy put a question on the 2008 cuts to Mr. Joyce and I can comment as well.  Returning to 2008 participation is not the same as the cuts being reversed when Covid-19 struck, to be honest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.570" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062900002#D00500"><p>Before coming to the specific question, I will make a brief comment on the cuts.  Since resources were cut between 2008 and 2010, they have not been restored in any way, shape or means.  Local Traveller organisations have picked up much of the support work on education and they are not resourced to do so when it comes to supporting parents and children.  That has had a knock-on impact as well.</p> <p>  One of the key points is we have seen visible rowing back on some of the progress made up to 2008 and 2010 with some of the investment that had taken place.  It was not all an example of best practice in how the investment was done but at least there were specific resources.  We want from 100% transfer rates from primary to secondary but as a result of those cuts and over the subsequent years, we know, anecdotally, that we no longer have 100% transfer rates from primary to secondary level.</p> <p>  This is a big indictment, as children are still under the age for the legal requirement to attend school.  Traveller children are slipping through the cracks and not all schools have the commitment to follow up and ensure Traveller children are transferring and that the work is being done on the ground.  It is an indictment of the lack of targeted resources going into Traveller education.</p> <p>  Resources are essential in implementation but so is a very clear vision to be set out by the Department of Education.  As long as we lack a Traveller education strategy going across all levels of Traveller education, through early years, primary, post-primary and third level, we will not see the progress we need to.</p> <p>  On the early years element, there is currently a consultation with the Department with responsibility for children and equality; I will not go into its full name as my mind will get dizzy with all the initials.  We have inputted to that.  The key points we have made are that early years processes are not delivering for all Traveller children.  There must be a fully funded public model of free early years childcare and education to ensure this can deliver.  Local Traveller organisations should have specific supports around early years education in preschools and those models must be supported, resourced and expanded.  There should be a free public model with clear engagement strategies and engagement with the Traveller community and its organisations about these spaces.</p> <p>  It is recognised that not all Traveller children who can access early years education are doing so.  There were consultations with different stakeholders who were not just Traveller organisations, and these recognised that discriminatory practices exclude some Traveller children from taking up places.  One of the fundamental points, critical to all of this, relates to engagement with early years education and childcare in the sector.</p> <p>  An emerging issue relates to the privatising of early years education and the parental needs, as opposed to the child's needs.  Children whose parents are not working or in education will have reduced free hours available to them for early years care, which is an exclusionary practice when it comes to the most marginalised and disadvantaged children.  We can put that in the context of how important is early years education to lifelong learning, so it must be got right as well.</p></speech>

Well done to Ms Reilly on her exams and receiving the degrees.  It is great altogether and such excitement.  Mr. Joyce and I met just last week where we had an engagement with Young Fine Gael, which reached out and spoke with the Irish Traveller Movement.  It was about issues affecting Traveller youth in particular and some of the concerns have been raised here again today.  It was really lovely to get that opportunity to speak with Mr Joyce and to hear his concerns.  I have also spoken with Senator Flynn on the amendments that are coming through the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018.  As the Fine Gael spokesperson for further and higher education, research, innovation and science, I am very supportive of this.</p> <p>  Mr. Joyce's submission also referred to unconscious bias, which I too have spoken about previously.  It is crucial that we all understand we have biases.  It is about how we manage and deal with it.  Over the last weeks and months, our committee has been dealing with the issue of bullying and how children can be picked out if they are seen as different.  It is very important that we have early educational measures in there from primary school time.</p> <p>  I am conscious of my time and am keeping an eye on the clock.  We are here to discuss inequality, the digital divide and reduced timetables.  Mr. Joyce referred to 1 million students and he is so right.  There are some 4,000 schools altogether, with 3,200 being primary schools and the rest being secondary schools.  Mr. Joyce said that 11,000 students are in primary school and that perhaps only 3,000 go to secondary school.  Mr. Joyce was looking at that drop-off in numbers as well, and I will open this topic up to other speakers too.  What type of measures do the witnesses believe would encourage more retention of children going into secondary schools?  It is about those transition points from primary to secondary and from junior cycle to the senior cycle.  What measures could be put in place or what role models and how could we support that more?  As we already have children who are in learning, how do we keep them?</p> <p>  I understand that sometimes there are cultural differences at different ages, and particularly with young marriage and so on in Traveller culture.  Opening this up, the witnesses have referred to further education and training, FET.  Ms Reilly spoke more on this and Mr. Joyce spoke about the drop-off in numbers.  On further and higher education, and particularly for young women and Traveller women, how does Ms Reilly believe that we could encourage women in their early 20s to come back in possibly to do apprenticeship programmes or to engage in FET?  The college of further education in Ballinasloe has nursing and healthcare courses and it is really popular.  We have had a lot of students coming through there, including students from Traveller backgrounds.  It has been very positive and popular. </p> <p>  On the digital divide, reference was made to a number of supports and funding that came through from the Minister,  Deputy Harris, of &euro;300,000.  We have also had funding for laptops at third level under the digital divide.  Some &euro;15 million has been allocated for students with disadvantage.  Access to space is also a very big issue, which was mentioned by Ms Reilly.</p> <p>  I very much appreciate what Ms Joyce said about the early years education during her last contribution with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  A lot has been done by this Government and the previous Government into looking at affordable childcare and how to support families getting affordable childcare.  In this instance, it is about how we support people getting back into education.  A number of points have been given but is there anything else we can do to encourage older people coming back into education again?  I put those questions to Mr. Joyce first then Ms Reilly and Ms Joyce.</p></speech>

It was the first time that we were ever invited into that space and it was a very welcome conversation and discussion.  There was good energy and momentum.</p> <p>  On the question of role models within second-level education, Ms Reilly is here and has done her degree, as have Ms Joyce and many others, including myself.  The fact that we are sitting here and having this conversation gives credence to the importance of education and why it is important.  On the other side, for many of us it has been a personal challenge going through the education system.  In some cases there is a legacy around education and the past.  It is a dark history in how Travellers were segregated from wider society with specialised schools and structures.  It was not progressive in any way.  Even now there are examples of this when one considers Canada and the Native Americans.  Travellers were very much treated in a similar fashion.  We were removed from the general population, put into Traveller schools and taught very much around the settled education.  When we move further forward it is important to remember this and that we do not want to revert back to that.  It is not just about role models it about the opportunities, the supports and the structures that are in place for people who want to go on to third level education, or for those who want to finish second level education.  This can be done by putting in investment and structures, and by making the environment within the schools a welcome, inclusive and supportive environment.  It is hard enough to learn but it is a lot more challenging when a person is facing bullying because of his or her identity, if the student is not learning about his or her culture and history and feels like an outsider within the school.  We want to try to reverse that and make the school a more inclusive place for every child including members of the Traveller community.  That is very important.</p> <p>  There can be other challenges with regard to gender and there is a need to make sure that young women are supported within education and to make sure that the structures are there.  People have this kind of notion around education or being in a particular position and that a person cannot have both.  One can have an identity and an education, we do not pick one or the other, and a person can have a career on top of that.  This is why it is important to have people like Senator Flynn, and others who are studying law so we are not tunnelled into a particular path, we are in the public, the private and the third sectors and that opportunities are available to all of us.</p></speech>

When it comes to role models I am hoping that Travellers will look at the likes of Senator Eileen Flynn, me and other people who have come through it.  It comes with personal challenges and perhaps you can think of it being a cultural thing, with Traveller women or men leaving school early because of marriage, for example, being in the culture.  This can be true at times but also not true.  I left school at a very young age due to isolation and marginalisation.  I was put into a special class for additional supports that I actually did not need.  I was missing out on valuable subjects.  It is about trying to empower people to put them back into education and to get them to see the value of education.  With all my ability I will do that going forward if I can.  We still cannot forget the experiences those young people have been through within the education system.  Within school I was told "What would you come back for?  It is not as if you are going to do well."  That left me with very low confidence and I never went back.  To be honest, I was never looked for to come back into school or anything like that.  All of those experiences have a cost and I am sure that many other Travellers can see themselves reflected in them too.  It is hard to get around that and to encourage them to go back into education.  There is still a lot of high hope of that, perhaps by linking through organisations that have links to the young people out on the ground.  It can happen.  It happened to me.  I was very much empowered and encouraged by courses that I did with Pavee Point, which led me onto the pathway into the National University of Ireland at Maynooth.  It is definitely possible.  We cannot forget, however, what has happened in the past.</p></speech>

I extend my congratulations to Ms Reilly on her very important achievement on securing a first class honours degree.  Mr. Joyce spoke on the national Traveller education strategy.  We all know we need one.  What would he like to see in that strategy in order that Irish Travellers can benefit fully from the Irish education system?</p></speech>

We are a long way off that.  We would like it to include investment and clear, tangible actions in terms of supports from primary to post-primary.  Some say it is from cradle to grave and that it requires a whole holistic approach in education.  Education has to be tailored towards needs as opposed to trying to fit Travellers into a system.  We do not just fit in like a parcel into a box.  At the moment, we are being asked to engage in a system that does not meet the needs in some cases.  For example, we want to see the elimination of reduced times.  We want to see investment in children.  Early education is also really important, before a child goes to school.  We know the importance of pre-education before a child goes to primary and then on to secondary.  There is a massive deficit in literacy and numeracy at present so that by the time a child gets to post-primary, they are falling way behind.  It is not about attendance but support structures.  As for outcomes, we want to see an increase in third level and finally we want to see opportunities in employment.  Some 82% of Travellers are unemployed.  We must get to the stage where there is a ramp-up in investment and supports, as well as a strategic approach and actions as Ms Reilly and Ms Joyce said, especially around interventions.  That is the only way we will get out of this and ensure that our community has the best possible opportunity into the future.</p></speech>

It must also look at critical points of transfer, which has already been spoken about.  It has to look at the points of transfer, including from early years to primary.  It is more difficult from primary to second level, and certainly, from second to third level.  So many times, we have put forward recommendations for what is needed.  The solutions are known and the overriding issue is the absolute lack of implementation.  There are a couple of members of this committee who were sitting on the Joint Committee on Education and Skills in 2019 when it looked at inequalities for Travellers in education and at reduced timetables.  We are no further on in respect of any of those issues.  None of the recommendations that committee made in two reports have been progressed any further.  That is the really challenging bit.  We are not seeing implementation and we are not seeing the focus shifting that the system has to change, not Travellers, to make the system work.</p></speech>

A lot of research has been done around the world on the impact that depriving children of education had on them.  Can I ask Ms Reilly to once again emphasise the detrimental impact that she says the restrictions and the closure of education facilities had on Traveller children?</p></speech>

There were challenges with very low literacy skills, no IT skills and nothing to support them.  They were just handed out these booklets of information on homework that needed to be done and was very challenging, and to be honest, could not be done.  I saw that on the ground and it was very challenging in halting sites, mobile homes and the back of houses, not having electricity, not having study space or having anyone to turn to for additional support.  Letters or text might have been sent out to parents who could not read them.  We could go on all day about the challenges and barriers but these existed long before Covid.  That is clear in the report we did in 2020, and the one in 2021 is to follow.  Looking at the form, it is basically repeating the same things.  There were a lot of challenges.</p></speech>

We did not get to hear everything Ms Reilly wanted to say but we will all read it and it is all taken into consideration.  A lot of the comments and criticisms are very fair.  I sit on the Joint Committee on Key Issues Affecting the Traveller Community with Senator Flynn and I am very well aware of some of the things the witnesses are highlighting but there is nothing like hearing from people themselves of all the hoops they have to jump through to get to where Ms Reilly got to.  In some ways it is great that she is able to hold herself up and for us to be able to hold her up as a model but it is also somewhat unfair on individuals to have to be that.  Everyone has unique experiences and they all need to be met at whatever level and whatever way they want to experience the world and education.</p> <p>  I am interested in the witnesses' views on something the other committee has looked at, namely, accommodation and the failure of local authorities to draw down funds.  I am from Galway where year on year, there has been a failure to draw down funding for Traveller accommodation, as well as general failures to prioritise children in halting sites that were supposed to be transient and have become permanent.</p><p>What part does all that play in educational achievement?</p><p> As Deputy O'Callaghan said, research shows that the pandemic has had an impact on all children in some ways but it has had an impact on the more marginalised more so than anyone else.  Beyond that, there is another level, as I see it, namely, the racism experienced by Travellers that is not experienced by some other the vulnerable groups in society. </p><p> Consequently, there are three levels that have to be recognised.  Targeted funding has to be part of this.  We need to consider universality when we discuss preschool education and education in general.  Targeted funding has to be part of that.  Senator Dolan referred to funding to address the digital divide.  What has to be front and centre is the fact that these cannot be one-off things; rather, there has been a failure over a long period that has to be made up for.  I am happy to hear the views of the witnesses on my comments and questions.</p></speech>

Others might come in after that.  As we see it, for many families and children accommodation was a humanitarian crisis prior to Covid-19.  Covid-19 showed up that many children and families on this island are living without basic water, sanitation and electricity.  The HSE issued guidelines on what was required in order to reduce the spread of Covid-19, for example, having warm water, which is a basic need, shower and sanitation facilities and electricity.  Many families living in overcrowded substandard accommodation do not have these facilities.  I can only imagine the situation for children.</p> <p>  The report of the Ombudsman for Children was damning and reflected the perspective of children.  I want to quote from one child, who said that they felt like garbage.  We are in 2021.  Children having to go to school without showers, water or the basic humanitarian needs that we would expect every single child on this island to have is damning and is an indictment and a shame on the society that we live in.  Absolutely no one, in any political party, Government or Department can stand over that.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  Obviously, we welcome the expert report on implementation and the work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, who is overseeing the recommendations.  The only way out of this is for the recommendations to be fully implemented in a timely manner so as to eradicate the inhumane living conditions many Traveller children and families are living in across the country.</p></speech>

Chronic overcrowded living conditions and substandard accommodation are a result of the persistent failure of local authorities over the past 20 or 30 years to deliver Traveller accommodation at local level.  That has had a direct impact on the current chronic overcrowding and substandard accommodation Travellers have to live in.  That, in turn, had a direct impact on those children who had the technology and Wi-Fi to enable them to try to study at home.  We recognise that far fewer had that available to them than should have been the case.</p> <p>  Having a space to be able to study and focus on education was a significant barrier to being able to engage in online learning.  We will have to learn to live with Covid and the different crises that will emerge.  We will be talking about these issues again in another five or ten years if the combination of the delivery of accommodation and education, as well as the lessons learned from Covid, are not addressed.</p> <p>  Travellers were one of the groups most disproportionately impacted by Covid in terms of contracting it and living in accommodation types where the spread of it occurred more easily than in other areas.  Children were trying to home school in overcrowded conditions alongside parents and siblings who had Covid.  That is the lived reality.  Learning from Covid and the disproportionate impact it has had on Travellers has to inform the lessons learned.</p> <p>  I refer to the Senator's comments on racism.  It is the fundamental barrier when it comes to access to equality of participation in and outcomes from education with regard to Travellers.  There is peer-led racism but there is also systematic racism, the racism experienced by Traveller children from teachers and bias.  Solutions have been put forward.  </p> <p>  The visibility of Travellers in the curricula is another critical factor.  Travellers are not visible in the curricula.  Teacher training is another critical issue, and Travellers need to be part of core teacher training and ongoing professional development.  The reality is that the solutions are known.  They need to be put in place.  The Department of Education and other sectors responsible for third level and early years education need to put in place the systems to ensure they are delivered, rather than focusing on the responsibility of Travellers. </p> <p>  The education system should respond to Travellers at all stages of their learning.  Marriage is not a barrier to third level education.  As a matter of fact, the predominant cohort of Traveller women who entered third level education did so through the mature student route once the opportunities were available and resource and supports were put in place for them.  That has to be recognised.  The barriers are not within the community.  Rather, they are within the education system.</p></speech>

I was not on this committee the last time around and I am learning a lot from their contributions.  It is clear to me that, as Ms Joyce stated, the system needs to look at itself.  That is the major message from today.  We need to examine the reasons why the previous strategy was not implemented, and who is responsible for that and why.  There is a new strategy despite there being an implementation deficit, which cannot be allowed to happen again.</p> <p>  I congratulate Ms Reilly on her first class honours degree and Mr. David Joyce on his first class honours master's degree.  It is a fantastic achievement.</p> <p>  I will ask a couple of questions and the witnesses can answer them.  Was one significant thing different for Ms Reilly in enabling her to reach her potential as she has done so far?  I am not sure what her plans are for the future.  Did one thing make a difference, be it a teacher or school?  What was it? </p> <p>  My area of interest is higher education, in particular.</p><p>In response to a question I asked of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, he informed me there were 48 new entrants of students to higher education who identified themselves as Travellers in the 2019-20 academic year.  That is significantly below the target of 80 new entrants set in the national access plan in 2015.  That document states the number of Travellers progressing to third level was so low they used numbers rather than percentage figures.  The target was to go from 35 to 80 over the lifetime of that plan, which has now finished.  Given the Department is in the process of forming a new national access plan, what should those targets be?  Ms Joyce might respond to that question.  Why have we fallen so short of reaching the last very modest target?  Ms Joyce, in the opening statement she provided, stated "to ensure full access to education and lifelong learning, grants should be made available to all Traveller students".  Will she elaborate on that and provide further detail on why she thinks the means-tested Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants are not working for Traveller students?  I have more questions but Ms Joyce might answer those questions first.</p></speech>

I apologise but there was some drop-out on my Wi-Fi as she was asking her questions.  I will answer them as best as I can but I may have missed some of the context.  On the question of the grants being made available, it was stated earlier that more than 80% of Travellers are unemployed.  That is a crisis and there is a need for a strategy to address that.  There are also multiple intersections of inequality and disadvantage.  Travellers are not coming to the third level education system from a intergenerational perspective.  We have had decades of inequality and disadvantage in education and when you combine that with high unemployment rates and poverty, specific targeted measures need to put in place to ensure the monetary factor will not be a barrier to Travellers engaging in and completing third level.</p></speech>

For Travellers who have survived primary and second level education and arrive at the door of a third level intuition, the worst thing facing them is being bogged down in red tape and all the procedures and hoops they have to jump through.  There are grants available for students who are coming from educational disadvantage and marginalisation.  Those procedures and hoops need to be removed from the system.  We need straightforward grants that would cover fees.  If we want more women to go into the third level education system, we need to be mindful of family commitments.  Therefore, supports and resources that would allow that to be addressed are needed, particularly for Traveller women who are lone parents and are engaging in the education system as mature students.  There are significant financial burdens on them and a system that has easily accessible resources or supports available is important.  For Travellers who are in the third level system, and it will not be for all for of them, where there is a need for support and resources on the academic side, it is important those would also be available.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked me if there was a person who helped me to get to where I am today.  I have got to where I am through doing courses such as the training of trainers in Pavee Point in which I got a merit.  Then I got an opportunity to do the community work in a changing Ireland course, which is part of a programme called ROMED and was also a Maynooth certificate course.  Twenty-four Travellers and Roma throughout Ireland participated on that course.  It was that course that put the fire in my belly and empowered me to go forward.  It gave me a taste for education that I had missed out on for so many years.  I went to Maynooth and those who helped me to stay with the course and gave me an insight and in-depth knowledge of education were the people in the department of applied social studies or social science who were over my course.  They were all very friendly and supportive and they helped me to get through it. They did not do the work for me in terms of assignments and reports.  I was left to do that myself during Covid but I got through it fine.  I am where I am today but were it not for those courses, which empowered me and put a fire in my belly, I do not think, if I am to be honest, I would be where I am today.  I suppose I will hear people saying that I do not know where I will head to  in the future or what my plans are.  Being in college opened my eyes and gave me a new understanding.  Getting experience from engagement with other minority, marginalised and disadvantaged groups made me realise that as a Traveller women sitting here today, there is no better place to be than in my own corner with my own community challenging the inequality we face and fighting for our basic human rights.  That is what I will be planning for the future.</p></speech>

Senator Flynn cannot contribute today but she has submitted questions.  I want to acknowledge the difference she has made on the committee in education.  We are continuously learning from her.  The witnesses have a great voice in her in holding people to account.  That is important and it will be important as we move forward with a new strategy and the forthcoming legislation.  My time is probably up.  I wanted to ask another question on further education.</p></speech>

Mr. Joyce might answer this question.  Are there specific recommendations on the further education provision and how it can do more?  I know from dealing with further education there is flexibility to allow local colleges of further education to meet the needs of the communities and such flexibility may not be available in higher education.  Does Mr. Joyce believe strengthening the pathways to further and higher education, as was outlined with respect to Ms Reilly, would be of benefit?  A great deal of money is being invested in the development of apprenticeships and broadening the range of them available.  Do they meet the needs of some of the Traveller community?  Are there specific changes that need to be made there?</p></speech>

I want to return to the thresholds applying to bursary applications.  The thresholds applying to the 1916 bursary for Travellers and the SUSI grant could be increased given the intergenerational and historical context of that around unemployment and economic disadvantage.  The Deputy may not be aware that for a part-time student to go back to third level education involves a financial burden and challenge.  Ms Joyce highlighted that.  Given only 1% of Travellers are in third level education, there should not be an issue in terms of investment and targeted interventions to get us to a stage where we increase the target to 20%, 25% or 30% over the next number of years.  That would be a help.  In terms of mature students participating in higher education under the new national access plan, Travellers should be named in that and supports should be targeted.  The supports that have been put in place by the Traveller sector should be complemented.</p><p>We call for resources to support that current work within the Traveller sector to enable further progression into primary, post-primary and third level education.</p></speech>

Across the board in the context of higher education and apprenticeships, it is important to set ambitious targets and put in place measures underneath them to ensure it is not just about mainstreaming.  There is a need to ensure targeted provision to get to the mainstreaming levels we need to be at.  Apprenticeships are another important route for young Travellers to access skills, trades and professions.  It is important that they be viewed from the perspective of gender and that they include Travellers in their design.  Participating bodies and businesses must be compliant with their public sector duty and there should be anti-racism training.  The State carried out some work in recent years on apprenticeships with a view to making them less gendered.  The question was how to get more women into traditional apprenticeships, which were male dominated.  When the State views anything in the context of gender, it has to view it through an equality lens to ensure that women from ethnic minorities, the most marginalised groups of women, can access these programmes-----</p></speech>

I will take this opportunity to congratulate Ms Reilly and Mr. Joyce on their educational and academic achievements.  I take my hat off to them and say "Well done".  May it bring them many other great horizons.</p> <p>  I have found the engagement interesting.  As our guests will be aware, I have been examining this issue for some time.  Ms Joyce referred to the report we produced in the previous education committee and the recommendations that came from that.  They were good recommendations, arising from much thought and interaction.  It is disappointing.  As was noted, we do not want to be sitting around the table in a further two years' time saying the recommendations that came out of this process still have not been implemented.  I completely agree on that point.  For me, the main message to emerge from this meeting is one on which I too beat the drum, namely, as Mr. Joyce stated, that the money should follow the child.  Some DEIS schools' programmes are excellent but many children in non-DEIS schools suffer from many different types of inequality and disadvantage.  On the other hand, some children who attend DEIS schools do not suffer from disadvantage.  It really annoys me when we talk about DEIS schools as the recipient of so much.  The entire model needs to be evaluated.  Moreover, I do not like the labelling of schools as either DEIS or non-DEIS.</p> <p>  During Covid and the closure of schools, a time when many children slipped behind, access to broadband was shown to be a big issue.  The digital divide, as well as the socioeconomic divide, was also a problem.  Was enough done to ensure that Traveller children had access to broadband and digital devices?</p> <p>  Our guests will know from previous engagements where I stand on restricted timetables.  It is an appalling method to have been introduced in schools and to have become almost commonplace.  I fully agree about the guidelines being implemented and monitored, which was one of our key asks, and I appreciate the impact the timetables have had on Traveller students.  At one of our previous engagements, a Traveller boy from Galway, who had done some work experience with Deputy Rabbitte before she was appointed a Minister of State, spoke to us about his experience in education.  It seemed the biggest plus for him in education was the fact that a homework club had been set up for young Traveller students.  That was the key for him and his peers.  He provided terrific leadership among his community and encouraged his siblings and friends to attend the homework club.  All he wanted to do was become a community garda because he saw the positive influence a community garda had had in his life.  I recall thinking what a difference he would make to his peers if he became a community garda and could encourage others.  Our guests might expand a little on some of those points.</p> <p>  On the inclusion of Traveller history and culture in school curricula, I understand positive recommendations were made earlier at Cabinet.  I thank the former Senator Colette Kelleher for all the work she did, which Senators Flynn and Ruane have taken up.  The post of visiting teacher for Travellers in schools was, unfortunately, withdrawn, something I had always felt was a very positive model in schools.</p> <p>  Finally, what three specific asks would help level the playing field?</p></speech>

For clarity, there has never been a Traveller education strategy.  What we did have, launched by the then Minister for Education and Science in 2006, was a report with recommendations for an education strategy but it was never followed through on.  In that context, there is now an education strategy in the programme for Government and commitments in that regard.  We know from working at a national level and engaging with local Traveller organisations that there is a significant need for a vision and education strategy, outlined with an implementation plan, to deliver what is needed.</p> <p>  I am not sure whether it was Senator O'Loughlin or Deputy Conway-Walsh who made a point about accountability.  Many of the recommendations remain unimplemented because there is no accountability or consequence for the arms of the State that are responsible for delivering equality of access to, participation in and outcomes from education for Traveller children.  That is why there has not been the progression that is needed.</p> <p>  As for whether enough was done during the Covid restrictions with regard to the digital divide, Wi-Fi and broadband, my straight-up answer is "No".  Efforts were made, and perhaps at third level it was done a bit more comprehensively than at primary and post-primary level, but we know the reality from the work that local Traveller organisations did on the ground, engaging with families and children.  One local Traveller organisation carried out a survey throughout its county that found that only one in every five Traveller families had adequate technology, which meant that four of every five children went without technology that would have allowed them to engage in remote and online learning.  Enough was not done, therefore, and now we are dealing with the consequences of that.  Already, there are deep undertones of inequality and disadvantage regarding the outcomes of education, with gaps in attendance at school of significant numbers of months, and that learning and those opportunities need to be recouped.  We need structured supports, on an ongoing basis, to address that in a vision and policy context.</p><p>All that we are asking is to have an equal opportunity for Traveller children to engage fully in an education system that will deliver equality of outcomes in order that they have the opportunities to go directly to third level from second level.  They should have a right to education from that perspective.</p><p> I agree with Senator O'Loughlin about the restricted timetables.  There was an interim report of a committee which she chaired with regard to reduced timetables and the impact that they were having on Traveller children and on children with disabilities.  We are not seeing the work that needs to be done.  We have guidelines that have still not been implemented in the schools.  There is a role for the inspectorate, when monitoring, to ensure that guidelines on reduced timetables are adhered to in order that we can eradicate a really bad practice that is impinging on the rights of and doing harm to Traveller children with regard to education outcomes.</p></speech>

All education is a connected process as well as an individual achievement.  The role of the national Traveller organisations here today and the important support of local Traveller organisations require resourcing and support.  Travellers have a right to education as themselves and as role models and many of us are determined to do the best that we can.  Our education is our right, however, and the public sector duty needs to be used to help to create jobs.</p></speech>

There is a digital void in some areas because there is no access to Wi-Fi.  Even in Dublin, some areas do not have coverage to access the Internet.  There was a question about whether there was an opportunity to ensure that people have access to it.  It is becoming easier to go into towns and cities and be able to access the Internet.  It was not just about laptops and technologies but also about access to be able to study remotely.</p> <p>  Ms Joyce highlighted that it is important that the investment and supports are in place.  In the last committee process in which I participated and which Senator O'Loughlin chaired, there were key recommendations.  How do you progress those key recommendations across the political parties here?  When people talk about accountability, they should ask how they ensure that their own parties are informed and put accountability in place as policy and in the actions in future.  We welcome working with all the parties on how they might do that and on the key recommendations from today.</p></speech>

I have three questions from Senator Flynn.  I do not normally do this but because Senator Flynn is an advocate for the Traveller community, I will ask three questions on her behalf because she is unable to be here this afternoon.</p> <p>  The Traveller community has experienced educational discrimination and segregation at every single level for decades.  Not only is it important for us to actively support the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill, it is also important to have a Traveller education strategy that is created and developed by Traveller groups and provides mandatory training for our educators.  Senator Flynn would like the witnesses to speak about the impact of discrimination towards Travellers in progression through the education system.</p> <p>  The digital divide has been raised already.  Senator Flynn noted it has been a significant concern of hers.  Although the Government introduced funding to bridge the divide, which in fairness she acknowledged, Travellers were not named for the supports offered to vulnerable students.  She would like the witnesses to speak about the importance of targeted supports for Traveller students to bridge the digital divide.</p> <p>  The third question relates to reduced timetables.  She acknowledges that it is a widespread practice and that until recently, her own nephew was on a reduced timetable.  The discrepancies in data collection for issues concerning the Traveller community mean that national data are not reflective of reality.  She would like the witnesses to speak about the discriminatory practices in our education system that hinder the participation in and access to education for Traveller students.  I ask Mr. Joyce to come in first and then I will ask the other witnesses to reply to the Senator's questions.</p></speech>

We have probably covered some of these questions.  On discrimination, we await anti-bullying measures for when Travellers experience discrimination in education based on their identity.  That issue is of great concern.  Four out of ten children experience bullying in education based on their identity.  It is a fundamental issue that needs to be addressed.  Discrimination impacts on children's participation and engagement in education.  It can also impact on relationships both inside and outside school and on retention.  In some cases, young people will clock out because of isolation and exclusion and it becomes a daunting and challenging place.  I know the committee is supportive of the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill, which is important.</p> <p>  The other question was about targeted supports.  When I referred to the strategy previously, which Ms Joyce mentioned, cuts were introduced for the visiting teacher service and other actions.  The cuts were a challenge and concern.  I mentioned targeted supports earlier for young Travellers in education, specifically children who may not be in DEIS schools.  It should go from primary to post-primary and into third level education, so it should follow the person and not the school.</p> <p>  Will the Chair remind me of the last question?</p></speech>

That is from their peers and from teachers.  As I said earlier in this session, it is fundamentally underpinned by institutional and systematic racism.  A fundamental change to the system is needed.  There is racist name-calling and the issue of even having access to the school.  For many Travellers of a certain generation in this country, segregated provision, its long legacy and its negative impact on Traveller parents is also a fundamental issue in respect of Traveller parents wanting to protect their children.</p><p>I appreciate we are talking about the experience of discrimination and racism but it is really frustrating that we have to lay bare these experiences to try to achieve the long-needed change in the system to deliver outcomes for Traveller children.  We should not have to do that continuously.  I fully appreciate where Senator Flynn is coming from, as someone who has been in the system and experienced the blatant racism that many Travellers, including the three Travellers speaking at this meeting, have experienced.  Any of us who has children in the system will have experienced blatant racism.  It is so frustrating that we must constantly lay bare those experiences to achieve basic rights in this context.</p><p> We spoke comprehensively about the digital divide.  It is crucial that the gaps created as a result be addressed for both children still in school and the Traveller children who have dropped out of the system as a result of Covid and school closures.  Furthermore, there must be learning from Covid to ensure these problems will not happen again in the context of online learning.</p><p> I will hand over to Ms Reilly because I am conscious of the time.</p></speech>

Until recently, her nephew was on a reduced timetable.  She states that until recently, discrepancies in regard to data collection and the issues concerning the Traveller community mean that national data are not reflective of the reality.  She would like the witnesses to speak to discriminatory practices within our education system that hinder Traveller students' participation in and access to education.</p></speech>

The Constitution gives every child a right to a full-time education and that applies to every child, including Traveller children.  As far as I am aware, that is the only enshrined legislation that gives such a right.  That is why the recommendations are so important.  The previous committee issued clear recommendations that sought to eliminate the use of reduced timetables, which affect both Traveller children and other groups in society.</p> <p>  On the legacy point Ms Joyce raised in the historical context of segregation, as I mentioned, not long ago there was institutionalised racism and segregation in Irish society.  The separation of Traveller children from the mainstream, settled population was a significant indictment of society.  That institutionalised racism needs to be acknowledged, both in the context of the past and to ensure that Travellers' current circumstances change rapidly.  In recognising that, there need to be positive actions on the part of the State, including through the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill, to ensure our culture and history will inform the educational curriculum and allow the vast majority of students to learn about Traveller culture and history.  It has a significant and important role not only for Travellers today but also for Irish society.</p></speech>

If children go through a system that constantly reinforces everything negative and the perception that they will not get on and achieve, what is the point in investing in and teaching them because they will just drop out of school?  Many of them drop out of school because of those low expectations and because of their negative experience of the education system.  Part of it relates to the fact that they do not see outcomes from education, such as the link to employment or other higher education opportunities.  All of this occurs in tandem, but that does not take away from the overarching responsibility of the fundamental change needed in the context of the education system.</p></speech>

In short, racism is the key issue.  The guidelines due on reduced timetables need to be promptly published.  The timetables should not be used to discriminate against Travellers and they should be monitored meticulously.  The Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill needs to be supported as a first and essential step to include all who are now part of Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.622" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062900002#L00600"><p>I have a couple of questions.  Do our guests know what percentage of Traveller children in mainstream schools have the assistance of special needs assistants, SNAs?  Ms Joyce spoke about the education strategy for Travellers, something I would very much support, but there has to be a buy-in from the Traveller community as well.  One issue I have most often come across in mainstream town and country schools where I come from in Wexford relates to the absenteeism of Traveller children.  It is not as big an issue as it was but it is an issue nonetheless.  Specifically in the transient community, where children move from place to place and may move on as soon as they have settled somewhere, it is still an issue.  What are our guests' views on that?  Does it occur to them as a current issue?</p> <p>  Ms Joyce spoke about how teachers may not have the same expectation of Traveller children.  This is about encouragement but that includes encouragement in the home.  As we all know, if children get encouragement from their parents in the home, they will make much better progress because they will have assistance and so on.  Could Traveller children get greater assistance or encouragement from the home to support their educational needs and to reach their full potential?  It is fantastic that Ms Reilly has achieved what she has in her own right.  The new phenomenon of Travellers being able to access third level education is fantastic and it is only right and proper that they are able to access second and third level education and to reach their full educational potential.  I think it was on "Nationwide" a number of months ago that I saw that someone from the Traveller community had trained to be a primary school teacher.  All of this is brilliant and a great deal of work has been done in this regard.  In my constituency, Wexford, I was involved in the organisation of homework clubs targeted primarily at Traveller children, who were brought in after school for an hour or so to do their homework and be encouraged to reach their full potential.  Should there be more homework clubs?</p> <p>  Has the issue of racism in schools improved?</p><p>My own kids go to St. Aidan&rsquo;s Parish School in Enniscorthy.  I have to say I would never hear of any racism towards Traveller children in that school, in that they are very much made part and parcel of the school community and encouraged to be part of the school community.  I know many Traveller families who attend St. Aidan&rsquo;s in Enniscorthy and, to my knowledge, there are many other schools across the country which make sure that Traveller children are very much part and parcel of the school community.  That is only right and proper.  I feel the racism is perhaps not as bad as it was.  Do the witnesses have other examples of it?  If so, they might inform the committee of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.624" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062900002#M00200"><p>On racism, people seem to think racism is the name-calling or that it is very direct but there is a subtleness in terms of how people engage with children but also with parents.  For example, when the Chairman suggests it might not be as visible, people need to check and ask where are the play dates or the interaction between a child going over to a person's home and meeting up.  We know a lot of informal relationships happen not in school but outside the school, and those relationships are bonded outside the school although they transpire within education.  What we are highlighting is the expectations of teachers with regard to these children.  We are talking not about anecdotal evidence but about a real evidence base.  Some children are going into school with this great energy and confidence from the home and they are really geared up.  Then they come out and they move from this confidence to holding their head down in shame.  That is what we are looking at.  They come out of the school with their head down in shame because they have just been isolated or it is the very first time they have been discriminated against.  The very first time you can get discriminated against can be in school.  That is where you are told you are different but you are not sure exactly what that difference is.  How do we explain to five-year-olds that they are different?  People do it in a certain way.  They are treated in such a way and they come home and they are so upset that they do not want to go back to the school or the classroom.</p> <p>  I know that, for most people in society, the one thing we have in the community is our family and we cherish them and care for them.  We want them to succeed and do well but we do not want them to go into a jungle or a hostile environment where their confidence is tarnished and brought from a high to flat on the ground and where they are nearly crawling out of the school.  That is not what we want.  Nor do we want people off their own backs to need to have drive.  People call it resilience but it nearly needs resilience to be a Traveller now in that they have to go through these challenges to retain their culture and their identity.  They do not want that.  It should be accepted, acknowledged and supported.</p> <p>  Many schools may not have things like Traveller culture and posters.  My daughter has done the leaving certificate and it is great that she has done that, so we know that people come out at the other end and they are often the first to do that.  When they talked about diversity in school, she had the confidence to go up and ask whether Travellers would be covered in that but there was a silence and a dismissiveness about it.  They wanted to talk about diversity but not talk about Travellers within that diversity.  How do we reconcile that?  There is a selectiveness in terms of looking at diversity and excluding Travellers within it, as if somehow being a Traveller is an issue.  I think that is part of the problem.  When we talk about Travellers, it is as if it becomes an issue or something we have to address.  We need to get beyond that.  We all need to check ourselves.  We need to check in order that if there are opportunities to excel in education, the supports, the structures and the environment are created to achieve that.</p> <p>  Anti-racism needs to be embedded within education in order that it is supported and there is ongoing professional training to deliver anti-racism.  Those are my points with regard to racism.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.625" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062900002#M00300"><p>There are a couple of points I want to make with regard to racism.  In some ways, it does not surprise me too much that the Chairman may not be aware of the racism in schools but Travellers and other ethnic minorities are.  It is well recognised that there are issues of racism, discrimination and anti-Traveller bias impacting on Traveller children in education, right across primary and post-primary in particular.  If people found themselves in a Traveller child's shoes even for one day in any school across this country, they would probably not go the full day without the negative experience that very many Traveller children have.</p> <p>  I am going to say this again without apology, and I know it has been said right across this session.  Unless the education system looks at itself and addresses its failures with regard to Traveller children, nothing will change and these conversations will still be happening in a number of years.  Change is required with the system, not with the Traveller child that is in it.</p> <p>  In regard to moving from one place to another, what impacts that is the need to stop evictions and improve housing and accommodation provision for Travellers, and to recognise the diversity of the school population.  A core element for Travellers is nomadic movement.  Much less of that is happening due to legislation like the trespass legislation, which has impacted in an incredibly negative way on Traveller nomadism.  If we have an education system that recognises the diversity of all students, measures like that will be put in place.  Much of the time, movement has occurred because of evictions and because of substandard accommodation or lack of accommodation.  If we address that, we will address some of those other issues.</p> <p>  Is it any wonder there are still issues of absenteeism when Traveller children have very negative experiences and are unhappy in the education system?  That is because the education system is continuing to fail them, not them failing the system.  We need to address those core issues.</p> <p>  The Chairman's first point on data is a critical one and Ms Reilly has answered it well in regard to the need for ethnic data on education and segregation in education to measure and monitor the outcomes from education, and to put in place the supports that are needed.</p></speech>

To be honest, unfortunately, on a personal level, there was no expectation for me from the teachers when I was in school.  If there was, I would not have dropped out and would have stayed in.  I was told that I was not going to get anywhere and that was basically why I dropped out of school straight away.</p> <p>  There is also the point about encouragement from Traveller parents.  I am going to be brutally honest.  My mother and father came from very similar experiences as me.  They were literally dragged out.  Within a classroom of however many pupils, they were brought down to be washed and brought back up and left in school.  They thought the very same thing was happening to me when I came back and told them what the teacher said.  Parents should know that their children are going to be respected for who they are, and I am not just talking about Travellers but about all minority groups.  There is still racism and discrimination out there today.  My nephew is only eight years old and had just started back in school and pupils aged eight were telling him them he was living in a halting site.</p><p>He was being told he lived on a smelly halting site and that was why he was not at the online classes, as his family could not afford Wi-Fi.  That was not the fact.  My sister lives on an authorised halting site, had no access to Wi-Fi and did not have the equipment for Wi-Fi.  If she did, she has low literacy skills, with no IT skills or anything like that to support or help him.  It is great that some schools do not experience any levels of racism but it is still present in 2021.</p></speech>

Today we are meeting with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, more commonly known as RACO.  I am very pleased that this meeting is taking place and in particular that we will have this engagement before the summer recess.  I am also very pleased to welcome Commandant Conor King, general secretary, Lieutenant Colonel Derek Priestley, deputy general secretary, and Commandant Luke Foley, president, of RACO.  Our objective is to discuss issues relating to the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that Commandant King will make an opening statement before going into a question and answer session with members of the committee.  As time is limited due to Covid restrictions I ask that witnesses would be conscious of the time constraints when addressing the committee.  I ask members to be concise in their questions in order to allow all members an opportunity to ask questions.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.635" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021062900002#A00300"><p>We are privileged to be afforded the opportunity to join the members of the committee and the secretariat today to give the perspective of the officers of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann on current retention issues affecting our members and the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  The Defence Forces have been in a state of slow decline for almost a decade, and it has reached the point where this decline is becoming irreversible.  Numerous reviews and commissions have touched on the root cause of this decline, without actually addressing it, which is the failure to adequately resource defence in order to retain highly qualified and experienced personnel to maintain capability.</p> <p>  RACO represents 95% of all Defence Forces commissioned officers and had the honour of addressing this committee just over two years ago in May 2019.  At that time, it was an accepted fact that the Defence Forces was in a manning-level crisis.  We were then awaiting the report of the Public Service Pay Commission, which ultimately proved to be a major disappointment.  The measures contained within the report fell well short of what was required, and many still have not been implemented two years on by senior military and civil management, who continue to refuse to engage meaningfully with the representative associations.  This has seen a scarcely believable deepening of the crisis, with the organisation's strength having fallen further still to its current low of approximately 8,580, with only around 8,200 of these deployable.  We ask ourselves whether we have reached the bottom yet.</p> <p>  Although we are dealing with an organisation in crisis, the Defence Forces still has many positive aspects.  There are few careers today that can offer the sense of identity, camaraderie, and individual and collective pride that a life in the Defence Forces can.  There is much that we do well as an organisation, from overseas deployment, maritime security and emergency aeromedical service and training and education, but we are undermined by a lack of investment, resources and contingent capability.  Our members are undervalued and overstretched and are leaving the Defence Forces at an unsustainable rate for more stable opportunities in the public service, or better paid positions in the private sector.</p> <p>  Our mission is "to champion the well-being of our members" and our key message is that the resourcing, remuneration, motivation and retention of personnel is critical to saving the Defence Forces and ensuring its viability into the future.  It is our firm belief that without adequately trained, motivated and incentivised personnel, there can be no defence capability.  The greatest challenge to the Defence Forces today is simply staffing its appointments, particularly at the middle ranking officer and NCO level.  It has been demonstrated beyond a shadow of doubt that we cannot hope to recruit our way out of this retention crisis.  The White Paper on Defence states that the most fundamental requirement and a critical factor for success is well trained, motivated, experienced and capable personnel with a wide range of skills and experience in order to successfully deliver government requirements.  However, the increased rates of voluntary departures and rapid induction in recent years mean that 24% of all operational personnel in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service have five years' service or less.  For officers, it is even more stark.  Since the commissioning of the latest extraordinarily large cadet class, 35% of all commissioned officers have fewer than five years' service.  This has severe implications for governance and supervision and increases organisational risk.  It is telling that of all the White Paper projects reportedly closed thus far, five years into the process, none have had any tangible impact on the retention of personnel.</p> <p>  The dysfunctional cycle of turnover, identified by University of Limerick, UL, researchers in 2016, has led to an ever-decreasing pool of suitably qualified and experienced personnel, and in an organisation whose stock in trade is the profession of arms and the management and execution of lethal force, this is a grave risk.  Between 2016 and 2020 the organisation inducted 3,116 personnel while losing 3,679, which was 41% of the average strength for those five years.</p><p>This rate of churn has also led to a crippling recruitment effort, delivered by our members, but no amount of water has been able to fill the leaky bucket that the organisation has sadly become.  Our members are called on by the Minister to care for and mould the countless recruit and cadet inductees who are currently inflating strength figures but are refused the specialised instructors allowance, which was taken from officers under the Haddington Road agreement and has yet to be reinstated.  Non-commissioned officer, NCO, instructors rightly continue to receive this payment.  However, officers bear the ultimate responsibility.</p><p> When we look at the cost of training an officer, the cost-benefit of retention over recruitment is self-evident.  The cost of training one officer cadet is estimated at more than &euro;100,000 per student.  At what point of dysfunction will management favour retention over the continual failing demands of recruitment?  We cannot go to market to recruit a captain or a sergeant; we have to replace them with cadets and recruits.  The cost of training a specialist officer in engineering, ordnance or communications is significantly higher.  The high rate of turnover has created significant manning level gaps in both line operation and technical units.  We aspire to be tech-enabled but we cannot train and retain sufficient technicians to maintain our current equipment.</p><p> The solution to the staffing crisis was to be the high-level implementation plan, Strengthening our Defence Forces, which has unfortunately been allowed to fail by Defence Forces' senior management, accompanied by a lack of political will to resource it and an absence of meaningful oversight.  To have seven out of 15 projects still behind schedule two years into a one-year plan would be unacceptable at any time but the fact that this is occurring in a Government plan, sponsored and monitored by the Department of the Taoiseach, in the face of the well documented Defence Forces recruitment and retention crisis, is unconscionable.  This does not bode well for future expansion to meet unmet defence and security needs that the ongoing Commission on the Defence Forces will likely identify.</p><p> Our military structures need significant adjustment.  Critical to the majority of the significant human resource issues in the Defence Forces at this time is a lack of contingency built into the establishment.  The employment control framework was imposed at a time of severe financial crisis and is no longer fit for purpose.  The reorganisation in 2012 cut what was seen as the fat of the organisation at the time, seeking a lean organisational structure.  However, in an organisation that has been structured on a lean basis, every appointment has, therefore, been deemed essential.  Thus, the removal of any personnel to fill a non-establishment vacancy, such as overseas, training courses and, most recently, the establishment of a joint task force to support the HSE, strips away an essential employee from his or her normal place of work.  Consequential staffing gaps have a direct impact on the welfare and morale of personnel exacerbating the dysfunctional cycle of turnover.  Trainees should not be part of the organisation's reported strength as this provides a misleading perspective on the strength and health of the organisation.  Indeed, the high level of inductees in training further diminishes capability as those personnel who are required to instruct are also removed from day-to-day operations.  In many instances, there are no dedicated appointments for this training. </p><p> The catch-all pay determination model that applies to the public sector fails to catch all of the public service.  The worst off in this model are the Defence Forces.  Our members willingly forgo the right to industrial action and submit themselves to abide by military law.  They are subject to mandatory selection for overseas service, are required to achieve strict annual medical and fitness standards, are subject to compulsory random drug testing, are liable to be posted away from family for extended periods of time and bear an unlimited liability in their service to the State, ultimately willingly volunteering to place themselves in harm&rsquo;s way.  Unfortunately, this loyalty and commitment to serve has attracted much praise but little else from successive governments.</p><p> The only way for the Defence Forces to become employers of choice as envisaged in this high-level plan is to compensate for the restrictions of military service by breaking relativities with other public sector bodies.  RACO welcomed the commitment in the programme for Government to a standing independent pay review body but fails to understand how such a body can recognise the unique nature of military service, while remaining within national wage structures as envisaged in the terms of reference.  Such a mechanism for pay determination must deal with the unique retention issues that the Defence Forces experience in isolation or it cannot, and will not, work.  Our members noted with dismay the appalling treatment of the Defence Forces in the recent pay negotiations despite pronouncements by relevant Ministers, verbally and in writing, that there would be parity of esteem and fair treatment.</p><p> The removal of a supplementary pension provision means 79% of post-2013 Defence Forces' officers are planning to leave the organisation well in advance of their mandatory retirement age due to inadequate provisions.  To put this in context, this cohort makes up 45% of our membership.  It is the ticking retention time bomb that will undo any other good work done by our members who have worked so tirelessly to facilitate the unprecedented induction training levels.  If this is not resolved, then all the effort put into inducting and training the recent extraordinarily large cadet classes will have been for nothing as we watch them walk out the door.  It is the very opposite of value for money and threatens future organisational viability.  It is a significant barrier to retention of our members, which is reflected in our recent exit survey finding that 30% of retiring Defence Forces' officers would not recommend a career in the organisation to their family or friends and a further 34% would do so only with significant improvements in conditions.</p><p> The working time directive's health and safety provisions set out limits on the number of continuous hours employees can work over certain periods.  It is clear that in the current environment the Defence Forces cannot meet the requirements of the directive and maintain its operational outputs.  What is equally clear is that a failure to provide adequate rest and compensatory time off for military personnel is significantly impacting their home life and, therefore, the ability of many of them to maintain a career in the Defence Forces.  For too long our management has treated members&rsquo; time as an infinite resource, without consideration of work-life balance.  The fact that our organisation has never even recorded working time, in contravention of EU law, has denied our members access to benefits, such as overtime, which are available to other public sector employees.  </p><p> The current strength of the Defence Forces is well below the established minimum.  What is not reflected, and what the implementation of the working time directive will surely reveal, is just how inadequate that minimum actually is.  RACO has attempted to seek engagement on the implementation of the directive with our management in a reasonable and collaborative manner through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Defence Forces, for many years now, without success.  This has now necessitated the commencement of legal proceedings to vindicate the rights of our members.  Enhanced capability ensures the protection, health, safety and well-being of our personnel, inspires pride in service and improves retention.  Critical enablers possessed by normal military forces, such as strategic airlift, are not only logistical and strategic assets, they also enhance the well-being of personnel by ensuring that our people can be deployed and recovered from overseas missions in a safe and timely manner.</p><p> Government spending on defence, the lowest in the EU by any identifiable metric, is dangerously inadequate.  What defence services do we not provide the citizens of this State that other EU armed forces provide and does this capability gap pose any strategic risks to Ireland, our citizens or our EU partners?  We must never apologise for the maintenance and resourcing of the State&rsquo;s insurance policy.  The Chief of Staff should be accountable for a significant operational share of the defence budget, with an emphasis on operations, capital expenditure and infrastructure.  Furthermore, we cannot continue to rely on pay savings to fund capability development.</p><p> The Army is required to maintain a contingent capability in order to be able to discharge its primary role, "to provide for the military defence of the State from armed aggression".  There are very significant capability and capacity deficiencies within the brigades.  The Defence Forces' current level of deployment on overseas operations is significantly higher than that of comparable militaries.  Our members are very proud of our record of overseas service.  However, the retention crisis has resulted in a significant impact on the frequency with which our personnel are required to travel.  According to military management, in 2020 almost 25% of deployable Army strength was deployed overseas at one point or another.</p><p> The Naval Service must be equipped and able to respond to identified threats.  However, it has nine ships but barely an establishment for six and, therefore, is set up to fail.  A lack of resilience in human resources has plagued Naval Service operations in recent times, with patrols cancelled due to the lack of suitably qualified and experienced personnel and two of our State&rsquo;s national fleet being tied up for the long term.  This has a huge effect on the ability to conduct maritime defence and security operations effectively and safely and cannot be allowed to continue.</p><p> The Air Corps has no primary radar or intercept capability.  Coupled with these deficiencies, the State&rsquo;s capacity for air mobility remains inadequate, leaving the air domain open to exploitation by any hostile actor or element.  By formulating a whole-of-State policy, assigning specialist aviation roles such as search and rescue to the Air Corps, mutual benefits can be achieved for the State, the Defence Forces, the Air Corps and, most important, the personnel who deliver these services.</p><p> Our infrastructure is in dire need of an overhaul.  The Defence Forces training centre, which is a centre of excellence for all training in the organisation, is in a dilapidated state due to lack of investment.  The 19th century structures are in urgent need of repair and, in many cases, demolition.  Our stock of accommodation is insufficient for our personnel needs throughout the country.  If the defence organisation is really serious about dignity in the workplace and the health, safety, and welfare of its people then it has much work to do.  Much of it comes down to an apparent policy of managed decline.  The failure to replace civilian tradespeople as they retire has also severely curtailed the maintenance and upkeep of our facilities.  Our people deserve to feel proud of the conditions in which they live and work.  In too many locations, this is simply not the case.</p><p> The ongoing Commission on the Defence Forces, which RACO called for in our previous appearance before this esteemed committee, is currently examining what the State wants us to do and what resources are required to execute the mission.  If we are to be serious about defence and security then major surgery and enormous investment are required in Defence Forces capabilities, structures and staffing.  We have allowed this proud organisation to deteriorate to an alarming degree through a mixture of unsuitable policy, comparatively poor pay and conditions of service and a failure to invest in our people and structures.  The commission must be bold and ambitious in its recommendations if it is to make any tangible impact on a problem that is becoming unfixable.  We note that the terms of reference state that in arriving at its findings and recommendations for arrangements for the effective defence of the country, the commission will have regard to the level of funding provided by Government for defence.  We earnestly hope that this funding will be adequate to meet the demands generated by the experts' recommendations and, more fundamentally, that these recommendations will not be constrained by the resources allocated.</p><p> Planning without resources is simply dreaming.  We have a poor track record of policy implementation in the defence sector from the White Paper on defence to the high-level implementation plan.  The commission&rsquo;s recommendations must be fully resourced and accompanied by a strong implementation oversight body to ensure that its good work is not allowed to wither on the vine.  If that occurs, there could be a bright future ahead for &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.</p><p> In conclusion, I acknowledge the phenomenal efforts of all of our members - supported by their families - who continue to put their shoulders to the wheel for the State during the pandemic response and in their normal day-to-day roles on land, afloat, in the air and overseas.  From testing, tracing, vaccination and logistical support to the HSE, they have all truly done the nation proud during the fight against Covid-19 and are owed a debt of gratitude and not just flattery.  The versatile and steadfast insurance policy that the Defence Forces provides to the State has been highlighted time and again.  We cannot allow the likes of Covid-19 and the inevitable shock to the public finances to be a reason not to invest in defence.  On the contrary, it is specifically because of "Black Swan" events such as a global pandemic that we need the robust national insurance policy that the Defence Forces provide.  We must acknowledge and reward our people&rsquo;s efforts in facilitating the organisation&rsquo;s essential contribution to national resilience notwithstanding the inadequate defence budget and argue that the insurance policy which the State demands from the Defence Forces can only be comprehensive if it is properly funded and resourced.  I sincerely thank the Chairman and committee members for their time.  We are happy to take any questions from members.</p></speech>

If a report that talks about decline becoming irreversible, how there is a refusal to engage meaningfully, appalling treatment regarding pay talks, breaches of EU law regarding the working time directive and how our Naval Service is set up to fail is not enough to set off alarm bells in any corridor, I do not know what will.</p> <p>  The submission stated that we are fast reaching the point where decline is becoming irreversible.  Could the witnesses elaborate on that point?  I know we have all of the figures here.  We have all of the statistics.  We know our Defence Forces are about 8,500.  Commandant King stated that only about 8,200 of those are deployable so we know we are 1,000 or 1,000 plus below where we are supposed to be.  On deployment, there is a figure of 300 there.  Could the witnesses address that point?  Commandant King went on to ask whether we have reached the bottom.  I think this is a very serious question that the powers that be must answer.</p> <p>  Commandant King also said there is a continued refusal to engage meaningfully with the representative bodies.  There is a further comment regarding the recent pay negotiations.  Commandant King stated that "our members noted with dismay the appalling treatment of the Defence Forces in the recent pay negotiations despite pronouncements by relevant Ministers, verbally and in writing, that there would be parity of esteem and fair treatment."  To me, it is very apparent why they feel that way but could Commandant King elaborate on that?  He said there were pronouncements by relevant Ministers both verbally and in writing.  Could he elaborate on that?  What commitments were given?  </p> <p>  He also spoke about the number of plans, including the high-level implementation plan.  He said that this plan has been allowed to fail by Defence Forces' senior management through a lack of institutional and lack of political will to resource it.  He went on to say that to have seven out of 15 projects still behind schedule two years into a one-year plan would be unacceptable at any time but the fact that this is occurring in a Government plan, sponsored and monitored by the Department of the Taoiseach, in the face of the well documented Defence Forces recruitment and retention crisis, is unconscionable.</p> <p>  Regarding the implementation plan and the seven out of 15 projects, could Commandant King elaborate on the projects that are behind schedule and on how important they are in terms of the overall situation within the Defence Forces and the fact that we are still heading towards rock bottom and the decline is quickly becoming irreversible?  How important is the implementation plan to all of that?  </p> <p>  Regarding the point about the pay negotiations and the fact Commandant King thought the treatment of the Defence Forces was appalling, what are his views regarding the failure of them?  Could he comment on the negotiations and the calls for members of the Defence Forces and representative organisations to be able to affiliate with ICTU?</p> <p>  Regarding the working time directive, this is something that is causing significant concern not just within the Defence Forces but across the board.  I am dealing with retained firefighters who are in a similar situation.</p><p>They are also engaged in legal action over the failure to implement the working time directive.  What recent engagement has RACO had on the implementation of the working time directive?  Accelerated provisions were implemented in 2019.  Where are they?  Commandant King said that this has necessitated the commencement of legal proceedings to vindicate the rights of members.  Will he give a brief update on where those legal proceedings are?</p><p> I will turn to the Naval Service.  Commandant King made a comment in the opening statement.</p></speech>

I am anxious to bring in other members.  If we can deal with the questions smartly and concisely, there will be time for a second round.  I ask Deputy Brady to proceed accordingly.</p></speech>

One relates to the Naval Service.  Commandant King said that there are nine ships but barely an establishment for six, so it is therefore set up to fail.  Will he elaborate on those comments and on the recent recruitment attempts?  I know the Minister joined one of the ships recently as part of a recruitment programme.  How does Commandant King feel those recruitment attempts might go without addressing the more substantive issues in the Naval Service and Defence Forces?</p> <p>  My last question relates to the management of facilities.  Commandant King made a point about the failure to replace civilian tradespeople as they retire and how it has severely curtailed the maintenance and upkeep of our facilities.  Will he give a broader picture?  How many tradespeople have retired without being replaced?  What impact is that having within the Defence Forces, barracks and so on across the State?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.644" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021062900002#D00500"><p>I welcome the witnesses from the Defence Forces and RACO.  As a former serving member, the presentations that we have received from both RACO and PDFORRA in recent times are utterly depressing.  I cannot understand how we have allowed such a proud organisation to be so utterly devastated in recent years.  One of my great concerns is the significant intake of young officers into the cadets.  Are we creating a problem for the future when they all reach that glass ceiling beyond which only a few will have a military career?</p><p>Commandant King mentioned success with adjudications.  Some time ago, I argued against the appointment of a HR person in the Department of Defence.  Sadly, it was not listened to.  What is it about RACO's members relationship with the Department that they find themselves going into adjudications?  Why is there not some sort of a system whereby they can agree things without having to go to a third party to adjudicate on their behalf?  I find it baffling that we have somebody on a high salary who should be able to resolve these issues but that that is not happening.</p><p>Commandant King mentioned that they have published an exit survey.  I found it rather strange that there was a need to do that.  Something clearly stimulated the RACO to carry out that survey.  The outcome of the survey is horrifying.  I was a non-commissioned officer, as the witnesseswill know.  When I was in the Defence Forces, officers joined for careers and there was significant loyalty from the State to its serving personnel, both officers and NCOs, and serving soldiers offered significant loyalty in return.  The outcome of the survey is that 30% of retired officers say that they would not recommend the Defence Forces.  If they were being honest about it, 64% of them say that they would not recommend a career in the Defence Forces, although 34% would be willing to recommend it as a career if there were improvements.  What has gone so terribly wrong in Commandant King's view that young officers are leaving and have such a dim view?  Any time that I meet retired groups, the pride about service and the camaraderie that existed has never left them.  There is sadness in the survey, with people who loved every day that they served and left because they could not have a normal family life.  We hear stories about people having to commute from all over the country for what appears to be no real benefit to the organisation.  What are Commandant King's views on that?</p><p>My colleague, Deputy Brady, mentioned the pay talks.  There was palpable anger from the Defence Forces personnel who I know that there were essentially no negotiations with RACO or PDFORRA.  They were handed a <i>fait accompli</i>and had no input whatsoever.  How do they see a pay commission changing that?  If a pay commission is stuck in, with whatever national percentages are agreed with ICTU, what function does Commandant King see it having for the Defence Forces?</p><p>Regarding specialised instructors, I was part of the trade union movement and a president of a union when financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, came in.  Many allowances were removed during that process.  We have been unwinding those FEMPI cuts over the years.  Is Commandant King telling me that commissioned officers who are involved in specialist roles are still being impacted by FEMPI and that they do not have their specialised instructor's allowance back?  If they do not, that is a serious matter.  How have they been left out when everybody else is getting theirs back?  I do not understand that.</p><p>Is there a problem with fixed promotions, especially for specialised personnel such as medical officers?  There was a problem some time ago but I am not sure if that problem still exists.  If there is a problem, will Commandant King give us some idea about it?</p><p>Regarding overseas service, Ireland regularly talks with pride about our service with the United Nations, etc.  It is my experience that if a commandant from a barracks is sent overseas, that vacancy remains open while the commandant is overseas and some other young officer has to step in and take the commandant's place.  In Commandant King's view, how many officers are operating above their pay grade?  For example, a captain might be taking the responsibility of a commandant and running a company, or a commandant might be taking responsibility for a battalion.  I am concerned about that and ask if he can address that.</p><p>Abatement probably does not impact RACO's members as much as it does other ranks.  Does RACO have a view on the issue of abatement?</p><p>This is more of a statement than a question.  The pop-up recruitment at the weekend brought recruitment to a new low.  We found ourselves with a tent beside a ship, hoping that somebody would wander in off the street to join up.  Is that how bad things have got?</p><p>I am delighted Commandant King mentioned the Air Corps and search and rescue.  I would hope to see the Air Corps used in a more productive way.  Rather than being the last port of call, it should be the first port of call for any air transfers.  I will leave it at that.  I can see that the Chair wants me to move on.</p></speech>

I share the view that it is disturbing if we have a crisis of retention in the Army.  It is a great difficulty.  The Army is one of the great institutions of our State which we are loyal to and proud of.  It has measured up to domestic crises as they have arisen down through the years and has done us proud in international service and peacekeeping.  It is not enough that we acknowledge that.  We have to deal with the practical difficulties that exist.  I presume it is officer level retention that we are discussing today.  My understanding was that a number of allowances had been restored a few years ago.  I thought that the October pay agreement had resulted in some progress in 2020.  I take the point around pay.  I hope that the commission deals with it.  Commandant King might elaborate on the pay issue and clarify if the crisis is specifically at officer level or throughout the Army.  It is disturbing if the Army is out of kilter with restorations of pay in other areas.  We need to be mindful of that.  It is an issue that the Commission on the Defence Forces would need to address.</p> <p>  I am interested in knowing the areas to which the officers who leave are going.  I am aware of the exit survey.  It is disturbing that 30% would not recommend a career in the Army.  Commandant King might elaborate on where people are going and if it is an economic pull, career options, etc., or if it is all about pay and lifestyle?  What are the factors at play in the pull away from the Army?  In terms of the Celtic tiger pull from the Army that might have existed in the past, in a post-Covid world it might take some to develop again.  That said, the commission needs to carefully analyse why people are leaving prematurely and why they are not recommending the service.  </p> <p>  It is disturbing that the working time directive is not being implemented.  One would assume that that is a reform that could readily be achieved.  There is no national economic imperative that could be argued there.  That would seem to be blatantly discriminatory.  It is an internal issue.  Commandant King might elaborate on the fault lines in that regard and what can be done.</p> <p>  On the question of time-off, surely time-off for Amy personnel should not be different from time off for other public servants.  There should no difficulty in that regard.  Efforts should be made to accommodate personnel in terms of time-off.</p> <p>  It is disturbing that Commandant King spoke about problems with regard to the quality of accommodation.  He might also elaborate on that issue.  The commandant's statement that the Naval Service is set up to fail is a real issue.  Am I correct that he said there is no replacement of civilian tradespeople when they leave, or is there a percentage replacement?  What is the issue there?  We need to restore the morale of our Army.  We need an Army in which there is a level of contentment, pride and happiness among personnel.  It is in that regard this meeting and the outcome of it will be important.</p> <p>  I am a strong supporter of our Army.  Many Army personnel live in Cootehill, Cavan town and other areas of Cavan.  They have been great members of those communities and a positive force in the social and cultural life of those communities and in every aspect of society.  The issue today is internal conditions.  I look forward to hearing Commandant King's responses.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.649" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021062900002#E00400"><p>I thank the members for their insightful questions.  I will start chronologically with Deputy Brady.  To facilitate other members, I will keep my responses brief.  The first question was on whether the decline is irreversible.  We have done much modelling, which has been submitted to the Commission on the Defence Forces.  We have proven beyond a shadow of doubt that at the current rate of turnover, even with taking in 700 recruits and cadets every year, which is not sustainable and we have not bee able to do it, we are never getting back to a strength of 9,500.  We need to get the turnover rate below 5% and to still bring in 600 people.  Our modelling shows that if that happens, we will get there in 2026.  Much work is required to ensure that we have the conditions to achieve that.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked a question in regard to deployable personnel and what "deployable" means.  For any modern armed force it means people who are not in full-time induction training, including recruits, cadets and apprentices.  In our opinion, and that of the vast majority of armed forces around the world, they are not deployable, they are not fully trained and they are not safe to be deployed with a weapon, which is our stock and trade.  The Deputy also mentioned a refusal to engage meaningfully and statements of Ministers and parity of esteem in regard to the pay negotiations.  The difficulties we and other associations experience at pay negotiations are well known among the committee.  When we have hope going into a negotiation that we are going to be treated equally - not in any special way, just equally - and we do not get that, it is very disconcerting for members.  We were happy to hear the then Minister for Defence say in the Oireachtas that the Defence Forces would have a strong hand at the negotiation table.  We received assurances in writing from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that that would occur.  Sadly, that night, officials concluded an agreement but we had been locked out of pay talks for seven days at that point.  I cannot be any clearer than that.  </p> <p>  Reference was made to seven of the 15 projects in the high-level implementation plan.  This is the real kicker for us.  This is the one that really demoralises our members.  We put so much work into and were committed to the Public Service Pay Commission.  We got a second bite at the cherry specifically for the defence sector.  Arising out of that came some measures but not enough to stop the high rate of turnover.  I may be a bit theatrical, but we, at least, got a plan in terms of the high-level implementation plan.  It is clear and states exactly what needs to be done.  It sets specific timelines for specific projects.  A programme management office was set up within the defence organisation to house and feed into this plan but it has been disbanded.  That shows the approach in play.  The Oireachtas is being told that the high-level implementation plan projects are being progressed, but we are not being let into any of them.  As the general secretary of RACO, I have to put a stop to the idea that projects are being discussed in the context of future pay negotiations.  The D&aacute;il is being told this but it is not happening.  The pay talks are done.</p><p>The high-level plan was not discussed, therefore, it was game over.</p><p> Deputy Brady asked about ICTU.  Let me say at the outset that RACO has the height of respect for ICTU.  We respect what it does for its members.  It is extremely effective in how it represents its members.  The Deputy will recognise that we spoke about the restrictions and constraints that are placed on military personnel.  We cannot take industrial action, for example.  We spoke about the unique nature of military service and how some constraints are placed on our members that are not placed on other public servants such as voluntary retirement ages, unlimited liability, etc.  If we are consistently being told that we are unique, then we feel we have a right to argue that there should be unique provisions to compensate for these restrictions or constraints.  Nobody had been able to explain to us how going into an umbrella body such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions would actually make unique provision for our distinct requirements.</p><p> What we were calling for, therefore, was an independent pay review body, not exactly like other jurisdictions but one that was completely bespoke to the Irish Defence Forces.  What we wanted from that was a standing body, which would be solely independent from the likes of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that would have the latitude and autonomy to make interventions, to consistently go around to barracks to talk to all ranks and families and to look at accommodation and allowances.  If there is a problem with ordnance or bomb disposal, for instance, look at perhaps a retention bonus for that.  If there is an issue with, for example, accommodation, try to come up with an innovative solution for that.  The thing about the review body, however,  is that if it is going to be housed within national pay negotiations, then we and our members fail to see how it can make a difference and that is a problem.  We are in a bit of a bind here.</p><p> The Deputy spoke about the working time directive and rightly referenced accelerated provision.  There were accelerated provisions on two fronts with regard to resting after a specific weekend duty.  We ended the practice of people who were up for 24 hours or who had spent 24 hours on duty going back to their place of work at half past eight the following morning, which was rife throughout the organisation.  That was welcome.</p><p> The Deputy will have been told on many occasions by our management that there is ongoing engagement.  The last meeting we had on the working time directive, despite asking every two months, was 24 July 2019.  That is nearly two years ago.  That is why we have regrettably had to resort to external avenues to vindicate the rights of our members.  Let us not forget that this is a health and safety issue.  The failure to implement the working time directive is directly leading to the burnout that is reflected in the exit survey and was also reflected, members might recall, in the University of Limerick, UL, workplace climate survey and focus group reports in 2015, 2016 and 2017.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the Naval Service.  It is nine ships but an establishment for six.  Why do we say that?  The last reorganisation cut the establishment of the Naval Service even further by 60 personnel, which is fundamentally a ship's crew.  It increased the number of ships from seven to nine, however.  It is, therefore, a simple equation.  If you add hardware and remove the ability to operate that hardware, you are set up to fail.  This is before we talk about implementing the working time directive when, as we know, our members and PDFORRA's members spent many long hours at sea in contravention of the working time directive limit.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the recruitment drive.  We would be the first to champion any innovation with regard to recruitment.  We have even tried to make submissions to review Defence Forces recruitment through the high-level implementation plan.  We have received absolutely no feedback, however.  All we got was, "Thanks for your submission".  What we would say simply is that recruitment must be underpinned by the correct conditions in terms of pay, work-life balance and service.  If and when that occurs, we will be the first to promote recruitment and induction into the Defence Forces.  We have not stopped doing that.  The ironic thing is that we have a roadmap that was agreed by our members.  I would like to bring in our president, Mr. Foley, to talk about the feeling on the ground when we signed up to this in 2019 versus the feeling on the ground now with regard to the lack of delivery.</p></speech>

We are very appreciative to have this opportunity to discuss our concerns.  My predecessor spoke of the frustrations in the form of 2019.  It is clear that we are beyond frustrations now in a much more crucial time to deal with these issues.</p> <p>  I will briefly discuss the issue for our members with regard to the young officers, YO, that is, our younger post-2013 membership.  Senator Craughwell pointed out the massive intake of YOs and whether they will reach the glass ceiling and find there are no careers for them.  Unfortunately, based on the data from our exit survey, 79% of our post-2013 recruits do not see a career in the Defence Forces.  Mainly from speaking to the members on the ground, which I have done continually, this has been echoed to me from all our post-2013 members.</p> <p>  We recently commissioned a class where 28 of those officers went to the 2 Brigade training centre where I am based.  I held a seminar for them for a week and they were already discussing their exit strategy from the organisation because to put it simply, there is no long-term plan or place for them in the organisation.  They will not be able to avail of a pension at retirement age due to the lack of a supplementary pension.  Many of these people are talking about moving to other parts of the public sector for similar job roles.  They are not looking to go to the private sector for big money.  They want to stay in the public sector but all they are looking for is job security and security in retirement, which is a fundamental right for all people who serve their State.</p> <p>  When the Senator talks about a glass ceiling, unfortunately, I do not think we are going to get there.  It is going to be a situation where people will leave over the next number of years.  Trained personnel are going to leave, personnel who we cannot replace with trained personnel from other areas of the public sector or from outside because of the unique nature of what we do.  It is, therefore, very worrying but I do not see it as being a glass ceiling for our post-2013 recruits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.652" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021062900002#F00300"><p>I thank Commandant Foley.  I believe I have dealt with Deputy Brady's questions.  I would be happy to take any further questions afterwards.  I would like to move on to Senator Craughwell's questions if that is okay.</p> <p>  The Senator asked why we go to adjudication.  We always try to conciliate first and then arbitrate second.  That is what the conciliation and arbitration scheme is.  In this regard, sometimes I have sympathy for the Department because it always has to refer to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for everything.  Having said that, however, we feel that the only success we have managed to have after a conciliation and arbitration scheme has been through the zero-sum game that is the arbitration route.  It was absolutely disenchanting that we did not even have a third-party adjudication mechanism for more than half of 2020 because they were just not replaced.  That was really soul-destroying for our current team as a conciliation and arbitration scheme.</p> <p>  We have also run into some problems recently with regard to readjudications that were initially not honoured.  Thankfully, however, we got over the line.  I speak specifically about the collection and the military service allowance.  Thankfully, that was resolved, and I thank the Department of Defence for that.</p> <p>  The Senator asked why we conduct an exit survey.  Our members asked us to do so at a conference a number of years ago because the information was not coming out about why officers were leaving the Defence Forces.  We asked management for access to information but it did not come for various reasons, perhaps due to resourcing, turnover, etc.  We, therefore, conducted our own survey.   The Senator was absolutely correct when he said the findings are quite troubling.  They would be very loyal crowd of people.  The average length of service of the 103 respondents was 19 years, so it is not as if they did not like the organisation.  I would say the sense of burnout, frustration and sadness is palpable in those pages.</p><p>We do not like to come in here and say that 30% of our members would not recommend to family members a career in the Defence Forces.  That is specifically for reasons like the removal of the supplementary pension provision and not doing anything with the mandatory retirement age.  Our members almost have a duty to inform people and that is what we do when we go in to speak to the cadets.  The hardest thing in the world for us to do is to tell cadets that they have to retire in their mid to late 50s and will be unable to survive on the income so they have a decision to make.</p><p> A question was asked about the specialised instructors allowance.  I might hand over to our deputy general secretary, Derek Priestley, to discuss that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.654" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Priestley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021062900002#G00200"><p>The specialised instructors allowance was brought in at a time when the organisation had done some reflection on incentivising and encouraging the best and brightest NCOs and officers to run the training for new inductees.  There was a trial run by what we called the implementation monitoring group.  The group reviewed the culture of the Defence Forces and identified a need to improve and standardise training, set standards and incentivise the best and brightest to come in and train.  An allowance was paid based on additional qualifications that young officers and non-commissioned officers had and it reflected the number of hours done as well.  These are residential courses that instructors had to do for an 18-month cadetship or a six-month recruit training period.  The allowance was identified as part of a review of allowances in the Defence Forces back in the days when the financial emergency measures in the public interest were a growing concern.  It was effectively removed.  It was identified as being no longer required and was removed for officers only.  At the time we had in the region of 40 to 50 officers in receipt of it across the Defence Forces.  The cuts were brought in as a saving measure.  It was only removed for officers.  The officers in receipt of it at the time had the allowance bought out.  It is important to point out that the allowance remained for NCOs and continued to be paid to them throughout all the cuts.  PDFORRA had agreed to a different way of implementing savings and the method pursued achieved the savings required.  Some of the allowances they had decided on relating to new entrant pay have now been reversed.  We have identified this allowance that was paid to a cohort of the hardest working individuals in the Defence Forces.  We sought it back under the reversal of the various cuts, but to no avail.</p> <p>  It is an allowance paid to all three services, the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Army and to the hardest working group.  We believe it should be restored as part of the unwinding of the FEMPI measures and as part of the restoration of pay and allowances across the public sector.</p> <p>  We have identified the need for this allowance.  We spoke about morale earlier.  This would be a major morale booster and a real force multiplier.  It is very much an indication that we appreciate the people who are working hardest in the Defence Forces.  Hence, we would like to see the specialised instructors allowance for officers.  I wish to emphasise the point that it was not bought out.  It was bought out for a specific group of members who at that time were there to save money.  That need or imperative has now gone.  That is as much as I would say about that.</p></speech>

When I was in the unit as a lieutenant I would have received the allowance for the long hours I put in and for the qualifications I brought to the appointment.</p> <p>  As unit commander I see our members running courses.  I oversee the most common course we run in my unit.  We have members in other training establishments but in my unit we run a six-month potential NCO course to train up corporals.  I did a survey after the last course we completed.  On average the instructors are doing between 56 and 60 hours per week when we take the six-month period into account.  In that time they are training and they also have responsibility for oversight.  They take on the risk in respect of that course.  They are training with my NCOs but they are not receiving the payment that my NCOs receive in recognition of the hard work they put in.  It is a fundamental issue for our members affected by it.</p></speech>

He specifically mentioned medical officers.  It is important to take a few seconds to understand the importance of medical officers in the Defence Forces in respect of the application of force, travelling overseas, training and the use of lethal force.  Having medical officers is not simply about medical care.  It is about trust and asking people to put themselves in danger.  These people need to be looked after.  The establishment figure for medical officers in the Defence Forces is 24 or 25.  That may sound like a lot for an organisation that is meant to have 9,500 people but not when we consider that we currently have three medical officers deployed at any one time.  Effectively we have three forming up, three overseas and three coming back.  We need a panel of nine for overseas commitments alone.  That is before we do annual medical examinations or any medical treatment that might go on within the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  We are all aware of the situation internationally and nationally with the shortage of doctors.  Back in 2012 it was decided in agreement with the association - we have the conciliation council report - to give a boost to newly recruited doctors after three years.  We would promote them from captain to commandant after three years with what we call fixed period promotion.  One might say that is a great benefit and it does not exist anywhere else in the public sector, but the reality is that all we were doing was reflecting the payscales available in the HSE or the wider private sector for doctors.  In 2012 the number one item on the risk register at the time was the availability, recruitment and retention of medical officers in the Defence Forces.  The bringing in of this provision whereby we promote doctors after three years to the rank of commandant was good work.</p> <p>  In 2015 the fixed period promotion for all special service officers in the Defence Forces was removed only for it to come back, thankfully, in 2019.  The then Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, looked at the wider problem and decided that special service officers would continue to benefit from fixed period promotion.</p> <p>  Last February, we had a doctor who had been recruited in 2018 and who thought he would had fixed period promotion after three years to commandant.  He was denied his promotion and was told it was not going to happen.  This was news to us because we had a conciliation council report providing for agreement with the Department that is should happen after three years.  This officer is in the vanguard and the four or five officers who were recruited after him are all now reconsidering their service in the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  If we have an establishment of 22, we probably have 15 on our books.  To lose four or five medical officers at this stage would be a disaster.  I cannot understand an attitude that would deny fixed period promotion when the logic was all set out in 2012 and agreed with the association.  The impact of this, as I said at the start, is that without medical officers in the Defence Forces we cannot deploy overseas or train or fire any of the larger weapons.  We cannot keep our people physically and medically fit to do the job that they are meant to do.  It is absolutely a force multiplier and it delivers capability across the Defence Forces.  The policy that is being implemented is going to have a detrimental effect.</p></speech>

I know the RACO representatives want to deal with some of the questions from Senator O'Reilly.  I am keen to bring in members who have not been in yet.  I have an indication from Deputy Brady that he has a brief and direct supplementary question.  I will give him 30 seconds and then proceed to Deputy Berry and Deputy Clarke.  Deputy Brady has a direct question from the earlier round that was omitted.</p></speech>

It relates to the failure to replace the civilian tradespeople and the impact that is having.  Can we get some numbers?  What is the situation in respect of the failure to replace those critical civilian tradespeople?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.660" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021062900002#G00800"><p>I call on Commandant King to address that and respond to Senator O'Reilly.

I will pick up on his questions after this.</p><p> I had the privilege of working in the Defence Forces training centre, DFTC, for a number of years of my career.  Nowhere else in the Defence Forces is the lack of civilian tradespeople so obvious than in the DFTC in respect of dilapidated structures and lack of maintenance.  When you dig a bit deeper and look at the establishment of civilian tradespeople - I could be wrong but I can check - the number should be approximately 300 but about 40 are employed.  If we drill down into that, we are supposed to have eight electricians, for example, among civilian tradespeople but we have one.  We are supposed to have eight plumbers but we have none.  That is the simple fact.  This happened because as these ladies and gentlemen were getting on in years and retiring, people were not being recruited to replace them.  It is just a simple fact.  As a result of the White Paper, a project was initiated, and closed, to bring in civilian tradespeople.  I am not sure how many have been brought in since.  The impact of not replacing civilian tradespeople was very evident in many of our locations throughout the country as time went on.</p><p> Senator O'Reilly had another question on pay, allowances and conditions and on whether the issue is pay or lifestyle.  It is pay at a certain point.  The issue is pay when the level of responsibility and the amount of time and hours people are working are considered.  We talk about push and pull factors.  The pull factors are talked about in relation to the economy and that has often been thrown about.  However, we have heard about the push factors from our members and retiring members.  Some of them are reasonably well paid but are not well paid for the actual conditions of service they experience.  That is the problem.  There has to be a sweet spot between pay and conditions in order to retain people.</p><p> Where will members of the Defence Forces go?  They are going more and more, would you believe, to the public sector.  I recently counted approximately ten captains who have taken up assistant principal roles in the Civil Service over the past year.  It is not just because of big wages in Google, Aldi, Ernst &amp;Young, etc.  The Exchequer is paying for these people but they are in different roles with better security of tenure and, crucially, longer retirement ages because all post-2013 employees in the public sector can now serve until the age of 70.  Members of the Defence Forces are still kicked out before reaching the age of 60.  Those are the differences.</p><p> I was asked about the working time directive and why it has not yet been implemented.  It might be said it is not as simple as clicking your fingers but, perhaps, it is.  It is just a matter of taking the exemptions for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces out of the Organisation of Working Time Act.  However, there is then a question to be answered because in order to meet the limits, not the targets, of working time in the directive, either more people or fewer roles will be needed.  It is as simple as that.  The fact that, 11 years ago, the European Court of Justice found that Ireland was in breach of the working time directive and it has still not been implemented in that time is a damning indictment of the value placed on our members and on all Defence Forces personnel.</p></speech>

It is very tough to listen to.  It is very sad that an organisation that gives so much to the State is getting so little in return.</p> <p>  I have two very brief questions because I am conscious that Deputy Clarke wants to come in.  I am sure Commandant King and his team can detect that this committee is on their side.  We are very keen to assist them.  This is a cross-party parliamentary oversight committee.  Is there anything we can do, from a political point of view, to assist?  For instance, we know the Commission on the Defence Forces will report in December.  Do the witnesses see a role for this committee in the implementation piece?  They mentioned that implementation is a major issue.  We have had lovely reports over the past five years but very little implementation.  Does the RACO team believe it would be a worthwhile endeavour for this committee to bring before it members of whatever implementation entity is created to provide some kind of forensic scrutiny of the implementation of the commission's recommendations?  Perhaps, this committee could have a standing meeting every six months with the implementation body for the Commission on the Defence Forces. </p> <p>  The issue of the dilapidation of the Curragh Camp mentioned by Commandant King has also been raised by the Chair in the past.  I see it for myself when I drive through it.  It is the most derelict town in Ireland.  Commandant King also stated that only 0.3% of Ireland's GDP, or less, goes towards defence.  The defence budget is very limited.  The ideal scenario would be an increase in that budget but, at least in the short term, what are the witnesses' thoughts on individual buildings being identified and other Departments being mobilised regarding them?  For instance, if building X in the Curragh Camp was given to the Office of Public Works, OPW, for renovation, or if the Departments of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Housing, Heritage and Local Government or Rural and Community Affairs could look after a particular building, would that be useful in mobilising further budgets beyond the defence budget to address the terrible dereliction that is currently ongoing in the Curragh Camp?</p></speech>

We often hear "crisis", "emergency" and other really drastic words being thrown about but if there is anything that will focus the minds of the public on the Defence Forces at the minute, it is the RACO exit survey.  It is absolutely stark.  One of the contributors to that survey, under the theme of further roles and impact, to my mind, hit the nail on the head and put it very well when he or she stated that: "The organisation went through a number of change processes without knowing what it wanted to be at the end."  That is key when we look back at the 2012 reorganisation that took place and the disastrous impact it has had since.</p> <p>  In that same survey, we also need to read a line that caught my eye: "While I have been frank and honest in my responses, I would like to highlight that I am very proud [to have served] in the DF [Defence Forces]".  We need to be mindful that people are leaving the Defence Forces not so much by choice but due to a series of events forcing them into taking that decision.  Some of these events are within their control but the majority are not.  We need to look at the issue of pay and retention in a specific manner.  The loyalty given by members of the Defence Forces has to be respected through ensuring that there is recognition of the roles they undertake and appropriate remuneration for them.  They work in roles that nobody else outside of the Defence Forces does and that is what makes them unique.  Uniqueness was spoken of earlier.  We need to home in on the issue of appropriate remuneration for roles carried out by members of the Defence Forces.  </p> <p>  I also note from the opening submission that: "The Chief of Defence should be made...Accounting Officer for a significant operational share".  I could not agree more with that statement.  It is absolutely key and is something that Government could do very quickly.  The impact a decision like that would have, particularly around operations, capital expenditure and infrastructure, would be felt in the short term as opposed to long term.  </p> <p>  We touched on the working time directive.  I have a very specific question.  Engagement with the Minister and Department was spoken of.  How often have members of RACO met with the Minister for Defence and how often do they engage with the Department of Defence?  </p> <p>  To move on to the high-level plan, in the opinion of the RACO representatives, who is responsible for the failure of that plan to deliver?  We know that 24% of personnel and 35% of commissioned officers have less than five years' experience.  We know that is not sustainable and is not best practice.  It opens the door to major health and safety concerns and creates layers of gaps in experience in the Defence Forces.  The phrases "managed decline" and being "set up to fail" were mentioned in the opening statement.  An ex-officer said to me quite recently that, in his opinion, he saw a planned obsolescence of the Defence Forces and that what we are seeing now is not being done in error, or by misjudgement, but deliberately.</p><p>I would like the witnesses' opinions on that.</p><p> Reference was made to primary radar.  I brought this up with the Minister last year and pointed out my serious concern that while the 2015 White Paper recognises that radar surveillance is a priority, there has never been any money put aside for it, including under the national development plan.  What is the potential impact of not giving funding on an urgent basis to put that equipment in place?</p><p> There was mention of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Is that scheme working for RACO members and, if not, what changes to it would the witnesses like to see?  What fundamental improvements can be put in place to make the scheme more effective?</p><p> When we come through this point in time and the crisis for the Defence Forces is over, what are RACO's priorities to ensure they emerge stronger and fit for purpose?  The witnesses mentioned their modelling.  There needs to be a balance struck between the recruitment and retention crises.  Where would the witnesses like to see the Government focusing and what do they see as the key areas of concern?</p></speech>

Deputy Berry spoke about oversight and the potential for the committee to be an inter-party oversight committee with a role in implementing the work of the commission on the Defence Forces.  It is absolutely fundamental that there be oversight of the plan.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating when it comes to the high-level implementation plan.  There is a full page in the document dedicated to oversight.  There is reference to a strategic HR group.  The document states:</p> <blockquote> 	All updates on the implementation Plan will be channelled through the Cabinet Committee F Senior Officials' Group which is chaired by a senior official in the Department of the Taoiseach.  As part of their role, the Chair of the Senior Officials' Group will liaise closely with the nominated coordinators in the Defence Forces and the Departments of Defence and Public Expenditure and Reform on the individual actions contained in the Plan, and monitor implementation timelines. </blockquote> <p>Two years into this one-year plan, one cannot really say other than that there has been a loss of oversight.  The eye is off the ball somewhere, whether in the Defence Forces, the Department of Defence, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, at higher levels of government or in more centralised government.  This plan, which was to save and strengthen the Defence Forces and make them an employer of choice, as referenced on nearly every page of the document, has not been faithfully adhered to.  The strength figures, which continue to decline, are proof of that.  We had some 82 discharges in the month of May and we are seeing an upward trend in discharges for the year, which is extremely worrying for our members.<br/><br/>The same goes for the commission on the Defence Forces as well.  Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.  Our members signed up to the high-level implementation plan in good faith.  We believed we were going to be treated fairly in pay talks and we went in with our heart in a hat.  Now we are fully participating in the commission on the Defence Forces.  No matter what recommendations come out of it, and we hope they will be strong, if they are not adequately overseen then it is a wasted exercise.<br/><br/>Deputy Berry spoke about the Curragh Camp, which is in his constituency, and whether we would see a benefit in different Departments taking responsibility for individual buildings there.  We certainly do see a benefit in that.  There is potential for the Military College, for example, to be accredited as a university campus.  Why not?  There is a new Department overseeing further and higher education.  Why should that facility not be leveraged?  There are many public buildings in the Curragh Camp that the Office of Public Works or the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government could look at as potential amenities.  There are houses there that are boarded up because people do not want to let them to Defence Forces personnel.  I know there was a problem with over-holders, etc. but that was due to lack of oversight.  It can be easily fixed if the Department or the Defence Forces were adequately resourced to do the oversight of military accommodation or if that area were overseen by another Department.  Leaving the buildings derelict is not good enough.<br/><br/>Deputy Clarke spoke about the exit survey and change processes.  It is very important that an organisation should know what it wants to be.  The Deputy referred to the 2012 reorganisation.  Even the most uninterested person would know that reorganisation was done on a budgetary line, not a strategic line.  The work of the commission on the Defence Forces is an example of where we need to ask ourselves what the Defence Forces are about and what the State wants us to do.<br/><br/>I have spoken about black swan events and a robust national insurance policy.  Mr. Priestley might comment briefly on the work of the Defence Forces during the pandemic, after which I will come back to the Deputy's other questions.  It is very important that we recognise and acknowledge what is being done in this area.</p></speech>

In fairness to our Defence Forces and the Department of Defence, there was a huge willingness to get involved straight away.  Initially, that was around what were termed the four Ts, that is, testing, tracing, transport and tentage.  Later, vaccinations were added to that.  When you separate out the figures a year and a bit later, you see that this effort has involved 82,582 man-days to date.  There have been 15,653 transport movements, 36 flights by the Air Corps moving vaccines around the place and 1,722 man-days in the RDS.  The willingness of the Defence Forces to get involved in the national resilience and deployment effort was very much there and their contribution was an agile one.  We continue to be involved in mandatory quarantining, vaccinations and testing.</p> <p>  The contact tracing system, something that had never existed in the history of the State, was generated over a number of weeks and it was led, managed and run by the Defence Forces.  We used cadets as the operators to such an extent that these people were so well switched on, trained and managed that they became the trainers of the trainers and led the charge for the HSE to bring on contact tracing.  While we all know there were issues, it is a remarkable achievement that our cadets were so agile and flexible as to be able to lead all of that.</p> <p>  What we have managed to do over the past year and a half has been phenomenal and we must not forget that it all came from existing resources.  Not one extra person was recruited on the back of it and no extra money came into the Defence Forces to do it.  We continued to do all our other outputs, both overseas and nationally, including security patrolling of the sea and air.  It has been a phenomenal effort and we really want to stress that this is what we all joined up to do and what people want to do.  We are concerned, however, about where we will be left when we pull back from supporting the HSE and the national resilience effort.  Our Chief of Staff, when he briefed us before St. Patrick's Day last year, said that we need to still be standing when all of this is over.  I have concerns from the HR and personnel side of things as to what we will be left looking like when this effort is over.</p></speech>

That is probably a policy matter but, certainly, our members tell us that they feel the Defence Forces would benefit from a greater say in the allocation and deployability of resources.  Where certain delays have occurred with deployment, this is seen as being an extra layer of bureaucracy that perhaps should not exist.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how often we have met with the Minister for Defence, who has been in office since July 2020.  We met with him on three occasions last year but have not had a meeting in 2021.  The last meeting with him was not very satisfactory from our perspective simply because we were talking about the pay negotiation.  There were no answers given and there has been no follow-up since on how we were treated and how that can be avoided in the future.</p><p>At that meeting, we tried to discuss the high-level implementation plan which was supposed to deliver pay talks.  We were asked to take it offline.  Seven months later, there has been no follow up.  That is very disappointing for our members.</p><p> I will not play blame games for the failure.  A number of entities are involved in the lack of delivery of the high-level plan but it must be remembered that it still exists and it could be delivered but there must be oversight.  That is where the joint committee might come in.  </p><p> Finally, on planned obsolesce, I could not believe that.  If we believed that, the three of us would not be here.  We could not believe that.  It is probably outside of my range to talk about primary radar but plenty has been said about it.  The threats are in the public domain but from a representative point of view, it is probably in the operational stakes.</p><p> What improvements would we like to see in the conciliation and arbitration scheme?  We spoke about the tendency to go to arbitration straight away.  That in itself encapsulates the dysfunctional nature of engagement.  It should not always be adversarial, polarised or win-lose.  There is a new independent chair who was supposed to play an interventionist role.  He probably needs to knock our heads together and start to come up with solutions because so far there has been very little engagement.  Were that to happen and were we to use conciliation, facilitation, mediation, rather than adjudication and arbitration, it might be a bit better for our members.  We would have no confidence in the scheme as a legitimate forum in which to conduct our business.</p></speech>

This is a matter of some concern to us as committee members.  I echo what Deputy Berry said on our role and function and our engagement with the Department of Defence.  This is a very timely meeting because it takes place against the background of the crucial engagement with the Commission on the Defence Forces.  We had the opportunity some weeks ago to engage directly with its chair.  Deputy Berry's point about implementation is important and one that we will look at in the context of our engagement and our relationship with the Department.  Of course, I agree that the recommendations of the commission must not only be resourced but that there also must be a level of oversight.  The suggestion made by Deputy Berry is one that we should look at and one that the RACO representatives might also look at.</p> <p>  I am very conscious, for example, of the major report in my time as Minister for Justice and Equality by the Commission on the Future of Policing which had in excess of 150 recommendations.  Built into the final report was a mechanism for oversight which involved regular and mandated meetings with the Department of the Taoiseach as well as the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will look at the manner in which we might best assist.  I am conscious of what Deputy Berry said that our role is in many ways separate from the Executive and the Government.  Yes, we are keen to ensure that the picture being painted to us, and for us, by the representative bodies are positive, meaningful and optimistic.  I do not think any of those words are appropriate to today's proceedings and I very much regret that as Chair of this committee.</p> <p>  I am very conscious of time but that Deputy Brady and Senator Craughwell have indicated that they have a very brief supplementary question.  I ask that they be brief because we are very much running out of time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.673" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021062900002#K00300"><p>I will not delay too long.  As a former serving member, it is absolutely heartbreaking to see for the second time a representative body before the committee with such a bleak outlook.  The RAF is protecting our sky and EU ships are protecting our seas and it is only a matter of time before G4S or some other security organisation is minding our Army barracks.  I have massive respect but respect needs to be tangible and I do not see tangible respect.  Indeed, very few of my colleagues who could be here today are here.  I constantly hear from RACO members and members of PDFORRA severe criticism of senior military management.  I do not expect our guests to respond to that but I need to put it on the record that senior military management needs to step up to the plate.  Defence Force members feel that while the representative groups are working hard on their behalf, they feel somehow let down by the very top and that something has to be done.  The HR system has to change.  I compliment the representatives here and their members.  Officers join the Defence Forces and take the President's commission to serve this country with honour.  We have debased that commission, just as we debased the serving soldiers who loyally serve this State.  I thank the representatives for their time and their efforts on behalf of their members.</p></speech>

The failure to have oversight has really impacted on implementation, particularly of the high-level implementation plan.  I was very concerned when the representatives mentioned that the programme management office had been disbanded.  That was a body that was established to provide that oversight.  When was it disbanded and what, if any, rationale was given?</p> <p>  On the working time directive, in a response to a question we were told the last meeting took place on 24 July 2019.  That failure has led to legal action being taken.  There would have been requests for meetings.  Will the representatives elaborate on that?  How regularly were those requests for meetings to follow-up on the working time directive made?  Was any rationale given for not engaging to advance or to continue some of the discussions that had been ongoing until then?</p></speech>

I thank him for outlining all the great work the Defence Forces have been doing as a result of the Covid emergency.  I am mindful that it sounds like many very expensive operations have been taking place, even paying additional staff for additional hours and the additional equipment.  The Department of Justice received many additional millions of euro to assist it in providing the State's response.  Similarly, the Department of Education received many additional millions of euro in the Supplementary Estimate while the Department of Health received many additional billions of euro in its Supplementary Estimate.  To the best knowledge of the RACO representatives, has the Department of Defence requested an additional Supplementary Estimate for the defence budget in light of the great and expensive work that the Defence Forces have been doing over the last 15 months?  Do they know if the Department of Defence applied for a Supplementary Estimate to defray some of the costs associated with Covid or any other emergency over the last number of decades?</p></speech>

It is not our nature or our intent to be pessimistic about the Defence Forces.  When we conduct things like the exit survey, we do so with a constructive mindset in order to provide constructive solutions, which we clearly provided in the exit survey.  They are simple solutions if the will exists.</p> <p>  It is exactly the same with Strengthening our Defence Forces - the high-level implementation plan.  There is a roadmap there.  We played our part and we signed up to it.  We also made about 15 fully costed submissions on a range of retention issues that have been accepted with no feedback.  We are trying to be constructive.</p> <p>  Regarding the programme management office, I will correct myself somewhat in respect of it being disbanded.  It just has not been staffed.  Covid came at that and the joint task force was set up.  There was a bit of flux where it had not been staffed.  Therefore, the projects might be progressing.</p> <p>  The question about the working time directive concerned legal action.  We spoke briefly about the working time directive and how much of a fundamental issue it is for all our members.  The key point is that if we do not record our time, how do we know how many hours we are working?  We must self record.  We have carried out many studies with our members over a four- and six-month period.  Some of the hours people are working are mind-boggling.  We are talking about 60, 70 or 80 hours in some cases.  When we look at the amount of time members of the Naval Service spend away from their families, it is nowhere near and cannot be in compliance for sea-going personnel.  We have tried to get engagement on the working time directive.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was successful in getting engagement between its management and its representative associations.  What it has in place is something called the Westmanstown working time agreement.  It is now in compliance with the working time directive and it has not resulted in a loss of operational capability.  However, we have not even been engaged with yet.</p> <p>  I am not 100% sure regarding the supplementary budget but I know it is a mechanism that is there to be used.  From a cursory glimpse at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Supplementary Estimate, I know that over time, this is something that is paid out of a Supplementary Estimate.  We cannot even begin to think about claiming overtime until we know how many hours we are recording.  The fact we cannot record our hours 11 years after the European Court of Justice found the State to be in breach with regard to the Defence Forces is not acceptable anymore.  This is why we have had to resort to legal action.  I will not comment on the ins and outs of legal proceedings in case I do something silly.</p> <p>  To sum up, I said that we do not want to be pessimistic and are all about solutions.  There are solutions here for the Defence Forces.  We can easily provide for a post-2013 supplementary pension provision or some mechanism to bridge the gap between forced early retirement and access to the State pension.  If it can be done for someone aged 65 to 66, why can it not be done for someone aged 60 to 66?  Why treat the Defence Forces differently?  If public servants can work to 70 but the Government will not allow Defence Forces personnel to work to 70, it must compensate them.  That is what the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, told us in a meeting.  He said the Government imposed the restrictions on us, so it has to compensate us.  We were advised by the Department of Defence to make a submission to the Pensions Commission, which is supposed to report tomorrow.  We are aware also that military management made a very comprehensive submission on the reinstatement of the supplementary pension provision for our members.  We really hope these submissions are taken at face value and there is some movement because certainty is something that is lacking in the Defence Forces regarding posting and the future.  It is not only for officers.  We have heard about the post-1994 contract issues.  People waiting to get to the top are going to leave before they reach it.</p></speech>

We are joined by Dr. Eoin O'Malley and Professor Deiric &Oacute; Broin from Dublin City University, DCU, Ms Dee Ryan from Limerick Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. John Moran from Liveable Limerick.  I will invite the witnesses to make their opening statements and if they could keep them to five minutes that would be helpful for the running of the committee as we are pressed for time.  Opening statements will be available on the website after the meeting.</p> <p>  I will read a note on privilege.  Members attending remotely within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit either Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present.</p> <p>  It is an exciting time for Limerick, it being the only place to agree to a directly elected mayor.  I thank the witnesses for joining us this morning as we scrutinise the heads of the Bill.  We will make suggestions to the heads of this Bill before it is drafted.  I invite Dr. O'Malley or Professor &Oacute; Broin to make the opening statement on behalf of DCU.  I would appreciate it if they could keep their opening statement to five minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.686" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eoin O'Malley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021062900002#A00300"><p>I will make the opening statement.  I am thankful for this opportunity to address the committee on the general scheme of the Bill.  Most of what is in the Bill we regard as pretty uncontroversial and I do not intend to go through it.  It is merely modelled on Electoral Acts and deals with those matters in a sensible way.</p> <p>  There are three main points we would like to make.  First, we welcome the introduction of an executive mayor for Limerick.  There are three issues we think should be addressed and we are not sure whether it is too late to address them now.  We know it is too late to address one of them but we think they should be considered.  One issue is the geographic coverage of the model of city governance that is being discussed.  That will lead to issues the committee can deal with in pre-legislative scrutiny, which is the power of the mayor.  First, there is the physical area the mayor represents.  The county system is not natural or rational and attaching a mayor to it probably makes little sense.  The interests of the people of Limerick city probably have not that much in common with people in the west of the county in places such as Abbeyfeale whereas I know, because I am from Limerick and lived within 200 m of County Clare, that most people who live in various parts of County Clare would regard themselves as being Limerick city.  The fact that it does not entail control or a say in Limerick city will make it difficult for a mayor of Limerick to do what he or she would normally want to do.</p> <p>  The second question relates to the type of system that is optimal and we question whether a directly elected system is optimal, albeit that is a decision that has been made.  There are three types of models of city governance.  One is the council-manager system Ireland currently has where the mayor has no executive powers.  There is an assumption it is a bad thing.  It certainly is not democratic.  There is not a strong link between voters' wishes and outcomes we would normally want but it is a form that is used in many places that have strong local government such as Norway and Finland where there is strong local government with a council-manager system, albeit not one with quite the power a chief executive has in Ireland.  The problem with our current system might not be how power is exercised locally but how little power is exercised locally, which could be an issue.</p> <p>  The second model is the directly elected mayor or mayor-council system.  It is used in many cities such as London, Rome and approximately half of the large US cities, including New York and Chicago.  Because our nearest neighbour and influencers have used it, we naturally assume it is something we would use.  Within that system things are not uniform.  They can be strongly mayoral or weakly mayoral.  A strong mayor might be strongly mayoral in some areas.  For instance, the London mayor has strong control of housing and transport policy, but less or no control of education, leisure and waste.  The Bill would not necessarily transfer any powers to the local authority in Limerick so it will still be a weak form of local government handed over to a mayor.  It will not necessarily make local government in Limerick stronger because local government is still going to be weak in Ireland.</p> <p>  The system of a directly elected mayor is not how we are used to doing politics in Ireland.  The Taoiseach is indirectly elected by voters in the D&aacute;il and nobody complains that is not a powerful office.  They way we elect a Taoiseach is more analogous to a third model of local government, which is the council-elected mayor.  Like the D&aacute;il chooses a Taoiseach on the basis of forming a majority in Parliament, elected councillors would appoint a executive mayor who has a majority in the council chamber.  That has advantages over direct election.  Removal from office is a political function and not a legal one.  In this Bill, we suspect, the mechanism to remove a directly elected mayor could be easily be challenged in the courts and could cause problems that may make it almost impossible to use or activate.</p><p> The system of the election of a mayor by a council encourages compromise and prevents deadlock, whereas there is the possibility under this system of a mayor from one or no party with a council majority that is not available to that mayor.  As with council elected mayors, powers can vary quite significantly.  This system is quite common and is used in many north European cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin, Stockholm and Paris.  In France, even though it is not a directly elected office, it is regarded as very strong and is sometimes likened to a kind of local monarch or barony.</p><p> The issue of power is a point that we believe the committee should consider carefully.  Under the proposed scheme there will be three potentially powerful political actors in local government.  One is the directly elected mayor in Limerick, and the others are the director general, which is the renamed chief executive or city manager, and the pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir, or first councillor, who will be like a speaker or cathaoirleach in the council chamber.</p><p> A directly elected mayor will be allowed to run for two terms of five years, although the first mayor will probably only get one and a half terms, which may be something the committee will want to consider.  The first councillor can be re-elected on an annual basis, and there does not seem to be any term limit.  The director general's term will copy that of the chief executive, that is, seven plus three years.</p></speech>

On the power relationship that a directly elected mayor has, one issue the committee should consider is how much power is being given to the directly elected mayor, how he or she will relate to the first councillor and the director general and whether enough resources will be given to a directly elected mayor to allow him or her to carry out an ambitious programme of policy that we all hope a directly elected mayor would be allowed to do.</p></speech>

I am the chief executive officer with Limerick Chamber and I am pleased to take this opportunity to participate in these proceedings and share our perspective on the unprecedented proposals for local government reform before the committee.</p> <p>  Limerick Chamber is the largest business representative body in the mid-west and the third largest chamber of commerce in the country.  We have approximately 420 member organisations supporting, pre-Covid, approximately 50,000 jobs in Clare, Tipperary and Limerick, the highest concentration of which are located in the wider Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area.</p> <p>  We are a mixed sector body and what unites our members is a shared passion for place.  The majority of our members are SMEs and we have strong support from the largest employers in the region, including institutes of learning, multinational IDA Ireland clients and scaling mid-west businesses trading internationally.  As the independent voice for business in the region, the chamber is a recognised stakeholder and on behalf of our members we engage in a wide range of activities, forums and committees focused on economic development, including the Limerick economic forum in the local authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland's gateway city grouping of Limerick's hospitality sector stakeholders, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's mid-west enterprise plan stakeholder group and the mid-west regional skills forum.  We have representatives who sit on the economic development, transport, climate change and biodiversity, housing and culture SPCs within the local authority and we lead a number of collaborative initiatives regionally such as the Limerick transport forum.</p> <p>  My team and I engage with members on a regular basis to ascertain their views on a broad variety of matters and the chamber is governed by a board of 16 local business leaders elected from within the membership to strategically direct the operations of the organisations.  We are uniquely focused on being proactive drivers of improvements in the mid-west operating environment. </p> <p>  Following consideration of the plebiscite in 2019 and the campaign delivered by Senator Maria Byrne, the chamber took a public position of being strongly in favour of meaningful local government reform, which would devolve greater decision-making powers on local issues to elected representatives, including, potentially, a directly elected mayor.  At the invitation of the then Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, I was pleased to participate in the implementation advisory group for the directly elected mayor, which set to work over ten months exploring what meaningful local government reform could and should include. </p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge the significant work done by that group, capably led by the chair, Mr. Tim O'Connor, and supported by officials from Limerick City and County Council and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I also want to acknowledge the progressive and open approach taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, when he took office last year as he and his team have navigated implementing the recommendations put forward by the group.</p> <p>  The chamber welcomes what has been approved by the Minister of State and Government, namely, the report in principle and the specific 38 recommendations included to date in the general scheme of the Bill, understanding that the Minister of State as recently as last week, when we met him to discuss progress, restated his intention to continue striving towards including more specificity as early as possible to ensure the most meaningful outcome from this historic change to local government.  In particular, we welcome head 36, which proposes to establish a new institutional structure to facilitate regular engagement between national government and the mayor at political level.  However, it would be important that the ability to convene these meetings should lie with the directly elected mayor.</p> <p>  The chamber, like the Minister of State, recognises the significant step in local government reform that this Bill takes in creating the new office of a directly elected mayor.  We support his approach of this being a starting point and that, for the office of mayor to achieve its maximum potential, the individual who is mandated by the voters of Limerick should have the power and means to deliver on his or her vision for a better Limerick.  To that end, the additionality specified in the implementation advisory group report, while no doubt challenging to introduce, is important to give the mayor the greatest opportunity to deliver on the changes that Limerick citizens expressed a desire to see. </p> <p>  To that end, the chamber welcomes the commitment of the current Minister of State to working towards the potential devolution or assignment on a statutory basis of public functions and services not currently performed by local government, that is, services provided in Limerick by central Departments or State bodies or agencies and devolve those to the direct responsibility and control of Limerick City and County Council.  We look forward to the new office of mayor being allocated ring-fenced funding to deliver on commitments in multi-annual budgets so that the changes being made will lead to a strengthening and enhancement of local government in Limerick.  </p> <p>  Finally, I draw the attention of the committee to the recent report produced by Indecon and published by Limerick Chamber, The Future Development of Limerick City, circulated to members as part of our submission to the committee.  The report was commissioned against the backdrop of Covid and was born from a sense of urgency that the business community needed to take responsibility for the protection of the future of our city centre and get independent expert advice on how to achieve sustainable vibrancy for Limerick into the future. </p> <p>  The report is a warts-and-all assessment of how Limerick city performs against other Irish cities and looks internationally for examples of best practice.  Repopulating the city centre will have a greater impact than any other policy intervention on the city and, therefore, many of the 67 recommendations in the Indecon report involve measures to enhance the liveability of the city centre, including public realm enhancement, the identification of strategic development zones, measures to address upper floor vacancies and a review of the living cities initiative.</p><p>There are also recommendations for a review of local government funding in light of the impact of the pandemic on work practices, particularly in regard to retail and remote working.  We intend that the Future Development of Limerick City report will inform the debate for candidates for the directly elected mayor and focus candidate programmes for local government on the practical roadmap for the development of a sustainable and thriving city that achieves its potential as the economic engine for the county and, indeed, for the mid-west region.</p><p> In closing, I thank the committee members for their time and attention, and for considering my statement.  It is the chamber's belief that delivery of this Bill and the further additionality recommended in the implementation advisory group report will provide improved quality of life for the citizens of Limerick, enhancing Limerick&rsquo;s reputation as a place to visit, live and invest in, and will be a key driver in unlocking potential for significant economic benefit in the region into the future.</p></speech>

It is an honour to represent the committee and supporters of Liveable Limerick, who fought hard back in 2019 to explain the concept to the people of Limerick and campaigned for the successful "Yes" vote with Senator Maria Byrne.</p> <p>  I will go through various points.  I submitted a detailed document to the committee.  I apologise for the lateness in doing so; we only knew we were appearing before the committee late last week.  There are a lot of serious issues at stake.  I also know from having appeared before a number of committees that members are anxious to get to the questioning, so I will just go through the highlights now.</p> <p>  I gauged the legislation by focusing on the following question: are the people of Limerick finally going to be trusted and given the powers and budget to guide their own destiny or are we still going to have the dead hand of centralised power in Dublin, holding back Limerick and other regional cities and counties by making sure that the reform cannot work?  I am guided, in that respect, by three principles contained in the Government paper published in March 2019.  The first is that if there is going to be a mayor, it must add value.  Second is the subsidiarity principle, whereby national governments should not take action where action can take place at the regional or local level.  Third, is the need to empower the local elected representatives as much as possible.  When the legislation is gauged in that context, I hate to say it, but as drafted at the moment, and it needs significant change, this legislation betrays the people of Limerick and other regional cities.</p> <p>  Having been there, the 2019 plebiscite was a vote for real change, local power and local budget.  In 400 pages of text that are before the Oireachtas, no new powers or new budget decision-making powers are being transferred.  Dublin is making vague promises of a better future but when the legislation is analysed, one can see a continuing micromanagement of matters in Limerick and a tying up of the local administration.  To me, it is clear that legislators and those drafting the legislation do not trust the people of Limerick to manage their own affairs, which is most disappointing.  At the plebiscite in 2019, there was so much promise for the reform local government in Ireland and a new structure to deliver to Limerick if Limerick wanted it.  As members will be aware, Limerick voted for change.  I was trying to think of an analogy as to what it feels like.  I came up with the idea that it feels like a teenager coming of age and expecting a special present for their birthday that recognises they have grown up.  Yet, when they open their present, they find a voucher for clothes or schoolbooks from their parents.</p> <p>  In a sense, the legislation kicks the can down the road.  It is time to stop doing that.  We have had enough conversation and waiting.  Limerick, similar to other regional cities, is still suffering and needs a new holistic management structure to deliver, solve the housing problems and address unemployment blackspots.  We can do that with a real transfer of power and budget.  On the other hand, if the legislation is enacted in its current form, we will essentially create a new role of the most important taxpayer-paid lobbyist in Ireland.  That is a total waste of a politician with the second most important electoral mandate the country, who will essentially become a lobbyist who turns up to his own forum.  I am not even sure who will need to be there and turn up.  As we all know, many Oireachtas Members have been lobbying hard for Limerick in this respect.  It seems that now is the time for a transfer of powers, without which this proposal is just a damp squib. </p> <p>  We need to look through the legislation and make some real decisions.  I studied law in UCD the 1980s and during my time as Secretary General at the Department of Finance, I read much legislation.  I must conclude, and give credit where it is due, that this text is a mastery of drafting.  It gives the impression of being very radical, but in truth, reforms are not really offered or come with important brakes.  We can get a sense of that by counting the pages of the text.  The important part concerns what the mayor can do.  There are no pages relating to funding, 12 pages setting out the functions on the mayor, and a whopping 222 pages that discuss the procedural issues involved in the process of running the election.  We can see where the emphasis was in drafting the legislation.  </p> <p>  There have been delays that are going to frustrate the electorate's choice because development plans are being completed as we speak and might be in place before the mayor is elected.  Essentially, Limerick voted for a transfer in concentration of power.  Once more, the Government in Dublin is not going forward with that and delivering a real transfer of power.  On that basis, we need to stop the centralisation of power that is continuing.  We need to look at the way the Government has rowed back from what Limerick was promised in the plebiscite, which was strong political power through a multi-year mayor as leader of the chamber.  It has not adopted the finely balanced proposals of the consultation group, which recommended the devolution of more power and the establishment of a much more innovative political counterbalance with the installation of the Cathaoirleach of the council chamber.  Instead, there are limits on the powers the mayor, who will have less power than the CEO has today, and all the extra brakes on the mayor's ability to do what he needs to do.  It sounds like the mayor will have to come to Dublin with a begging bowl, looking for money and power when they need to be transferred.</p> <p>  I am worried that we are going to end up with confusion and bureaucracy and more slowing down.  That is in comparison with the potential in 2019 that was extensive and exciting.  I differ in opinion from Dr. O'Malley.  I am happy to talk about that.  The "One Limerick" approach and the fact that it has that full county aspect is very positive.  More important, we are now saying that Limerick is asking the Government whether or not it really trusts Limerick to make decisions, figure out who the mayor should be and what powers they should have in the allocation of budget.  Limerick wants to be able to trust Dublin that it will deliver on the promise it made back in 2019.</p> <p>  As legislators, committee members know better than anybody else that it is hard to legislate for real reform.  Vested interests always fear they are losing control.  The conservatives fear the unknown and well-intentioned proposals, if badly drafted, can end up being more dangerous and divisive.  In my submission, I have provided a series of examples of problems with the legislation.  I worry that while it is important to acknowledge the problems of rural Limerick, the rural Limerick board is another example of mandated micromanagement and a lack of trust.  It could be argued that housing is a bigger problem in Limerick, so we should have a housing board.  We know that the mayor will not have enough powers.  There are provisions for the transfer of more powers, but we should call a spade a spade: with this legislation, the mayor will have less power than the CEO at present.  Therefore, it is a long way from what was promised in 2019.  There are difficulties because the mayor-----</p></speech>

I am asking the committee, if it can, to analyse the various provisions against the backdrop and see that there has been series of climbdowns from what was promised in 2019.  There is real need now to move forward and stop using a British model of government that was based on not trusting the Irish.  We can grow up as a country 100 years older and trust our regions to manage their own affairs.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to go over the issue.</p></speech>

Unlike any other legislation we deal with,, as Mr. Moran outlined, this comes with a democratic mandate that no other topic comes to us with, that is, the people of Limerick have decided on this issue.  In some ways our views on it need to be part of that in order that we can reflect that democratic mandate.  Many people, particularly at local government level, were engaged in their local elections during that period in 2019 and perhaps there was not the same awareness of what was happening outside of the three cities that were holding those plebiscites.  Mr. Moran's contribution in particular was important because it communicated the promises that were made and the debate that perhaps those outside of Limerick at the time were not aware of.  However, I would differ from him in one sense in that Dublin suffers from the dead hand of central government as much as any other city.  Perhaps the repeated references to Dublin were inadvertent and he meant to say "central government" in those cases.  Dublin will be impacted by this legislation as much as anywhere else because of the way in which Dublin will be governed.  We will look back to this Bill when we make a decision on a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  That is why we need to get it right.  It would not be correct for us to have multiple systems of directly elected mayors in different cities across the island.  That would lead to widespread confusion.</p> <p>  We have had a pre-legislative scrutiny session on the Bill and have asked quite detailed questions.  I might repeat some of those and then allow members to come back in as much as they can.  It is almost impossible to ask four people questions in four minutes and for all of them to have time to answer.  Dr. O'Malley and Professor &Oacute; Broin have spoken in the past about how unique this model is.  It involves an executive, directly elected political figure, which we do not have in Ireland.  In that case it brings two issues to the fore.  The removal process is the opposite of being bogged down in legal challenges.  It could be a perpetual political opportunity for those small groups in the chambers effectively to impeach constantly the mayor and then for the final decision to be made by the Minister, who ultimately will not decide to impeach the mayor.  There is, therefore, almost an incentive for small groups with less of a mandate than the mayor himself to try to constantly impeach him.  We need to watch out for that in the general scheme.</p> <p>  The second issue I have is that I am not certain about the role of the pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir.  I understand why the position has been included, but the term "deputy mayor" is well understood internationally and by our communities and I am not sure why we are inventing the term "pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir".  I understand it but it is a bit too clever for its own good and I think we should revert to the idea of a deputy mayor.</p> <p>  Finally, what if people have questions about the lack of reform of local government?  Limerick has had some reform in the merging of the two administrative areas, but if this system were to be layered on top of Dublin or another city without reforming local government, there would be problems.  The question is whether we have missed an opportunity to reform local government here as well.</p> <p>  We have very little time.  I will leave the minute and a half open for anybody who wishes to come in.</p></speech>

Building on Dr. O'Malley's point, however, what we are seeing is potentially a significant shift in political culture.  There will be a period of settling down when our political class will have to get used to a new system.  That is a challenge because we have never tried anything like this previously.  When Dr. O'Malley highlights the uniqueness of this in Irish political culture, he is not underestimating it.  This is such a significant cultural shift.  It will take a considerable time to bed down.  We have highlighted what we see as the legalistic nature of the removal process.  I am still inclined to take the view that considerable effort has been spent on thinking through the removal of a mayor in a way that we do not tend to see in other legislation.  It is quite stunning in that regard.</p></speech>

I would characterise it differently.  I would not say that what we see a series of climbdowns in the Bill; I would say it does not go far enough in implementing the report of the implementation advisory group.  Perhaps Professor &Oacute; Broin and Dr. O'Malley have had an opportunity to review it.  It has a vision for a much greater office with much greater control and power and the means by which to deliver it.  In that context it is envisaged that the elected members of the council would have a responsibility to hold the directly elected mayor fully to account.  That is why the emphasis was given on provisions around that.  We had envisaged a person who would have a real, meaningful mandate and means to deliver change for the people of Limerick.</p></speech>

I would appreciate their thoughts on a few issues.  It is important we get this right.  It is a new concept to Irish politics and is about our delivering ownership to the electorate.  I think we all agree on that.  I will ask a few questions about the role of the councillors in this.  It is important the councillor is not seen just to be rubber-stamping the mayor's programme of office.  Have Professor &Oacute; Broin and Dr. O'Malley any thoughts on the role of councillors in approving the programme of office?  What are their thoughts on the role of councillors in general in their interaction with the mayor?</p> <p>  As for the issue of who the mayor represents, Dr. O'Malley's opening statement raised concerns about the mayor representing the entire county.  In one of the heads the Minister refers to a rural Limerick board.  Have the witnesses any suggestions regarding the board and how the voices of those people living within the county boundaries would be better represented?  Do they think the Bill needs to be strengthened to ensure that these people, the electorate, have their voices heard?</p></speech>

What the legislation would do is give a single individual with a democratic mandate, the mayor, a mandate to create a policy agenda.  To some extent that would remove some powers from the council because the council would have done that, although the mayor will be a member of the council, so they are not completely separate.  A mayor would also need to work with the council in Limerick and anywhere else this would be rolled out.  I am not sure it will weaken the council that much.  What it will do is create a head that the council can look to for some sort of guidance and leadership.  Because it has a democratic mandate, I do not think that is a major problem.</p><p> On the Deputy's second question regarding rural areas, I am not sure about those voices being represented.  They can be represented by all kinds of manners and means and in various ways.  They will be represented because the mayor and the councillors will be elected by people in local areas.  My concern is about the expansion of Limerick because that expansion will go into areas such as south east and south County Claire and possibly even some parts of County Tipperary.  It will be difficult for the city to manage its growth if we do not have some sort of control over how that space is going to be used and managed.</p></speech>

Just to follow up on this concern about the scale of Limerick, we need to also remember the Southern Regional Assembly role and the regional spatial and economic strategies, RSES, document.  One of the things I was disappointed to see was what seems to be another climbdown, in that the mayor was suggested, throughout 2019, as being a member of the Southern Regional Assembly.  This would by definition involve the voice of the mayor in the discussions about how Limerick would interface with County Clare in the larger metropolitan area and indeed with County Tipperary and beyond.  I strongly recommend that becomes a natural thing because, in a sense, what Limerick voted for back in to 2019 was to allow the people to pick who would represent them and not to allow this sort of lockstep political party, if the committee will forgive me, deciding amongst itself who was going to get these roles.  The mayor is a natural person to put on the RSES.  That is most important because what I hope is that if this works well it work well in other cities.  We would then see the mayors of Cork and Waterford sitting at the right level, that is the regional assembly level, to drive forward all the interests of the broader regions.</p></speech>

I understand her concern, which was raised by other speakers, about the rural part of the constituency and the differences between rural and urban needs.  From a business community perspective, the amalgamation of the local authorities has been a success.  It has allowed us to more greatly harmonise important functions such as where industry is going to locate for the benefit of the entire county.  We certainly see ourselves as the sum of all our parts and while there are different emphases and nuances within the county and certain areas of the city, we are facing different degrees of the same challenges across the county.  Certainly we feel it has been to our benefit that we have united to address them together.  We in the chamber hear this a bit because we are privy to many of the strategic policy committees, SPCs, and we participate on them.  There is an ongoing debate, a legacy from the time when the local authority was split, of rural versus urban, which I do not feel is helpful because in order for the county to thrive the city must thrive and in order for the city to thrive we need county support so I would be much more focused on uniting around the opportunities for us all.</p></speech>

As has been acknowledged, an awful lot of work went into the plebiscite and the delivery of a directly elected mayor of Limerick.  It has been mentioned, particularly by Mr. Moran and Ms Ryan, that people were expecting much more and there must be much more.  I pay tribute to Mr. Tim O'Connor and his committee, which sat for ten months, for its input and the work it put into this.  That committee went further by suggesting functions relating to education, policing, agriculture and health should come back under the auspices of the mayor and the local authority.  I am a little disappointed there has not been a wider scope around the position of the directly elected mayor.  While it is an exciting opportunity and will be used as the template for directly elected mayors in other cities and counties, we must get it right, as previous speakers have said.  Perhaps we need to suggest having an expansion of some of the powers to do with the mayor.  I understand why the speaker is being suggested and that it should be from the councillors because obviously the mayor has to work with the councillors.</p> <p>  Returning to Dr. O'Malley's point on the city-county divide, I was elected to the council back in 2014 when it was amalgamated.  At that stage, there very much was a city-county divide but it has been overcome and the council is working more closely together.  I have always believed what is important in the city must involve in what is happening in Abbeyfeale or Kilmallock, so it is important to get that balance right.  My understanding is that this county board has been put in in case people had a fear, but it should be included as one because we are one Limerick and it is one local authority.  While we encompass a small bit of County Tipperary for general election purposes, we lost the part of County Clare two elections ago.  It is really the whole city and county.  There should be some mechanism found and I would love to hear the witnesses' views on how the city and county can be included as one or united as one.  What are their views on the expansion of policing, education and health powers?  Going back years, local authorities controlled those areas so that should be included in it.  I would like to hear their thoughts on that.</p> <p>  The last point is funding, which Mr. Moran raised.  This is going to be the equivalent of a Minister of State for Limerick.  Usually Ministers of State have their own budgets and I cannot see anything in the documentation suggesting a budget will be available.  My understanding of the legislation at the moment is that the mayor will have to go cap in hand to the different Departments.  While it states there will be regular contact with Departments, the mayor will have to go to, say, the Department of Health or Social Protection looking for funding to run particular projects.  If the mayor is given the budget to start with, he or she proposes it to the council and then the councillors, who, as has been rightly said, represent different areas, have the right to say that they need to spend X amount in such an area.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on that as well.</p></speech>

She has hit on the main points I made.  This is a reform of local government.  This is going away from a British system, which did not trust the locals, in this case the Irish, and kept control very much in Whitehall and ultimately in the central administration.  It is moving to a system whereby devolved powers and associated budgets are supposed to go, and were indeed promised to, local cities and regions across the country eventually and that needs to happen.  There are promises it will happen and there is no reason to wait.  There are enough problems to be solved.  There is a national development plan process happening.  There is good sight of what must be done in Limerick over the next 20 years through Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>Now is the time to devolve both the powers in legislation and the budget with that.  I wish to make it clear that this is not asking for more money.  This is taking the money that is essentially allocated to Limerick, and will be allocated to Limerick over the next number of years of a mayoral term, and saying the decisions about the priorities as to who spends and what the money is spent on go to the 40 or so councillors in Limerick and to the directly elected mayor.  It is not going to be done by unelected officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who might never have even travelled to Limerick, let alone understand the city as the elected politicians do.  According to the legislation, the mayor is going to be responsible for driving and delivering a programme of local government, but has no ability to do so.  It is not clear whether the mayor can ever deal with a CEO who is not able to deliver.  The Bill is silent on that power and relationship.  The mayor does not have any of the decision-making power with respect to the money and the setting of priorities.  As the Senator said, the mayor goes cap in hand around the Departments as, effectively, a glorified lobbyist, paid for by the taxpayers to try to get things to move forward.  That is neither what was promised in 2019 nor is it going to be what will work in this election.</p><p> The point in my report, and I will finish on this as it is a very important political point, is that if we have an election without deciding what the powers of the candidates are and without deciding what the budgets are for the candidates, we will have a free for all of promises that are totally unrealistic.  If we have a budget where we clearly give the right powers and an envelope of multi-year funding, then external commentators, including even the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, could assess the promises of the various candidates and help Ms Ryan and her organisation's members and the electorate of Limerick to decide what are and are not real programmes of office.  If we do not do that, we will get into a very dangerous situation from my perspective.  There will be promises such as "I will convince Dublin to do this" or "I will convince the Department of Transport to do that" and no mechanism for the electorate to decide who is telling porkies and who is being realistic.  That is a very dangerous election to have in the current environment.  I will leave it at that, but the Senator has raised some very important points.</p></speech>

I will set the timer so I am as strict with myself as I am with everybody else.  Dr. O'Malley referred to a weak form of local government handed over to a mayor.  Deputy McAuliffe also referred to the reform of local government.  Does Dr. O'Malley consider that we have a very weak form of local government and that handing this over to a mayor will not improve it?</p></speech>

It is exceptionally weak.  Mr. Moran has gone through that as well.  Essentially, what this is doing is handing over a weak form of local government to the mayor.  It will not take back to Limerick any of the power that perhaps was envisaged in the original promise that was made in the programme for Government in 2016.</p></speech>

I served as a councillor and we often heard it said that it was a weak form of local government and that councillors have no powers and all the power lies with the county manager or the chief executive.  If some of the powers that the chief executive currently has are to be handed over to the mayor, does that strengthen local government?</p></speech>

There is not a huge amount of freedom, so what we have is a system of local administration rather than a system of local government.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran said that this would not be an extra budget for Limerick, and it is not that the Government would have to give more funding to Limerick for this to work.  It would be that any of the funding that would accrue to Limerick over the next few years, as has been promised through various Departments, would be left with the mayor to manage.  Is that his suggestion on this?</p></speech>

The mayor and the council agreeing the budget every year would be an incredibly strong democratic system that, in effect, replaces the Oireachtas in making decisions for Limerick.  However, this has to be within an envelope.  The Chairman will be familiar with my previous role, whereby every year the Department of Finance gave an envelope of spending to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which allocated that, based on national priorities, among different Departments.  What happens at present is that the Departments, almost in silos, then decide how to spread the largesse across the country.</p> <p>  What I was very excited about in 2019, as I thought the proposal was and as reflected very strongly in Mr. Tim O'Connor's report, was that finally one could do a holistic management of the needs of Limerick, decide the priorities with local elected officials and drive local administration to deliver not just on roads and water pipes, but also on housing, schooling, policing and everything one would see in the successful cities across the world that have gone through the type of transformation that Limerick has to go through in the next couple of years.  Let us bear in mind that Limerick will go through a population growth of approximately 50,000 in the next decade or so.  That involves a massive infrastructure demand.  Right now, officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should be totting up what should be spent on that over the next five to ten years.  I would like the mayor to have the ability to prioritise roads, cycling infrastructure, schooling or the public realm and decide that locally, but not exceed the envelope of what was going to be spent in Limerick in the first place.  It is to make those decisions locally to suit the people who know best.</p></speech>

The vision from the IAG report for this role is that the mayor would have the ability to engage with everything that touches the citizens of Limerick to provide real value for those citizens.  For example, it would be important that the mayor would have the power and the means to tackle the unemployment blackspots and introduce measures to effect change there.  In particular, we are quite concerned in Limerick about the impact of the pandemic on youth unemployment.  That is a significant challenge that we must address.  I agree that we have not seen enough of that real devolution of power in the Bill.  I recognise that change is difficult, but what we have in front of us does not fully grasp the nettle of the decentralisation of power.  I encourage the committee to press for greater changes to deliver real value, particularly in an era in which there is a degree of lack of faith in institutions.  We are at a point where we are trying to reimagine our local authority and the benefits for citizens from local government.  To that end, we certainly require the means to back this.  Otherwise we risk having another well-paid elected representative, which will not do anything for the model for the further roll-out of local government reform around the country.  While we are discussing Limerick specifically here, everyone is conscious that it is the template for delivering greater local government reform throughout the country.  It is the measure and the bar by which this will be judged for the entire country.  In particular-----</p></speech>

I am self-employed.  I was born in Limerick and I live and work in Limerick.  I was an elected representative for the Adare-Rathkeale district for six years.</p><p>I was there for the amalgamation of Limerick city and county councils.  As other speakers have stated, Limerick has seen massive cultural change, first when the local authorities in the city and county were amalgamated and, second, when we had the vote on a mayor for Limerick city and county.  The result was that the city voted for it and the county voted against it.  It is a cultural change.  Everything going forward must be a positive change for Limerick.  The people of Limerick had a democratic vote and that should be respected, and we should move forward from there.<br/><br/>Equally, there is history within the local authorities.  If one breaks down the local authorities, at present, Kilmallock district has seven councillors, Adare-Rathkeale has six and Newcastle West has six, which gives a total of 19 councillors and there are 21 councillors in the city.  When it comes to divvying up funds, councillors from all parties and none are concerned that in the case of a council where a mayor has a large budget, the 19 councillors could be overruled, 21-19, on a city versus county basis.  First, we might equalise the number of councillors between the city and the county, which would mean they would have to come together as one and work together for the city and county, for Limerick.<br/><br/>As other speakers have said, the city must thrive.  I agree with that 100%.  When I was growing up the city was thriving, and the county supported it.  The desolation of the centre of Limerick city has been the downfall of the city because it used to bring people to the core of Limerick.  Going forward we must reinvent and regenerate the core and we need the support of the county 100%.<br/><br/>One of my concerns about a directly elected mayor is the cost.  The office and staff for the office must be paid for.  The director general must also be paid for in the same way.  I believe between office space, staff and transport it will cost approximately &euro;500,000.  The costs will be covered by the State for the first two years and then it will come from the budget of Limerick City and County Council.  If that is the way it must go, so be it, but I would like the mayor of Limerick to have a budget.  I do not want any mayor of Limerick going cap in hand to Dublin looking for funding for the regeneration of the city and the county.  If it is done right, this will be a culture change.  Limerick is the first city and county to do this and we need to get it right.  We must make sure there is a budget available.  I hope we will get a mayor that will represent all, and that we will not have to resort to removing a mayor from office, which is a concern people have.  We must embrace this, and we must accept the democratic vote on the matter.  My concerns are, first, the cost of the mayor to the local authority and, second, to make sure that whoever, male or female, becomes the mayor of Limerick city and county, he or she will look after both sides of Limerick.<br/><br/>I am disappointed as I would like to see gender balance.  Coming back to the issue of culture, I wish to raise an issue concerning the Kilmallock electoral area and Councillor Brigid Teefy.  We met with the Minister again last week.  The parties came together and made pacts on the chair of each individual district.  Councillor Teefy has given more than 30 years of service to the council, but the pacts prevented her getting even a vice chair position, which is unpaid.  Historically, pacts have been a factor for decades and we must wipe them out.  Going forward, we must promote gender balance on all councils.  I hope the new mayor of Limerick will ensure gender balance on the council in Limerick and that when the chairs are being handed out in each area, whether the member is a member of a party or not, there will be gender balance.  There should be gender balance among the chairs of the districts and the position should roll over.  If the chair of an area is male, then the vice chair must be female and <i>vice versa</i>.  That way, we can improve gender balance, which is not happening at the moment.  We will then have a council that recognises everyone, and we will all work together.  I acknowledge all that the witnesses have done and what the chamber of commerce is doing.<br/><br/>I wish to raise the Land Development Agency, LDA, partnership that was set up recently in Limerick.  I say everything in public.  The work of the agency is confined to urban areas with a population of 30,000 people or more, which implies a city.  I have been involved in the Limerick Twenty Thirty plan for delivery within the county.  If the LDA works with the Limerick Twenty Thirty group and the local authorities then everything is covered in Limerick.</p></speech>

Some of the contributions were strong and clear and they leave us in no doubt.  That is useful and helpful.</p> <p>  In terms of the report that we are doing, what specific key transfers of power should be in the Bill?  What do the witnesses recommend should be included that is missing from the Bill?  I will start with Ms Ryan and then go to Dr. O'Malley, Professor &Oacute; Broin and Mr. Moran.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.737" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021062900002#G00400"><p>I point the Deputy back to the recommendations of the implementation advisory group.  It was a broad and diverse group that reflected local authority representatives.  It had two mayors on it over its duration and officials from the local authority executive and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Members of the Public Participation Network, PPN, gave great contributions.  We had the president of the students' union in the University of Limerick, UL.  We tried to be quite broad.  I could not praise the chair, Mr. Tim O'Connor, highly enough for the amount of consultation that he did off his own bat.  He regularly asked who else we should talk to.  He was pushing the envelope the whole time to ensure that we cast the net wide enough to reflect the kind of changes that would deliver real value for the citizens of Limerick.  The intention was to be ambitious but that the plan would be deliverable and that we would not be so far off the mark that it would not be achievable.  If there was an opportunity for Mr. O'Connor to speak to the committee, he would be able to give members some valuable insights.</p> <p>  In terms of what is doable, I concur with Mr. Moran that it should be while the review of the NDP is going on and while we are at the stage of being about to produce a local development plan.  It should be possible to determine an envelope and allocate it to Limerick so that whoever the successful candidate is, he or she can deliver on his or her vision with multi-annual budgeting.  The means is very important.  We are not looking for new money.  Let us average what has come to us recently, what is expected to come to us and take a look at the measures that are being made available through the urban regeneration and development fund and the rural regeneration and development fund and give that to the people of Limerick to determine what they would like to do with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.738" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Deiric &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021062900002#G00500"><p>I was struck by some of the earlier points made on additional powers.  There is some low-hanging fruit.  I would have thought there were issues around education through the education and training boards that already have a strong local government link as well as a strong structured link to local government since 1930.</p><p>There are areas there where a directly elected mayor could have been more directly involved.  That is a straightforward matter that does not involve a massive conversation with the Department of Education because a structure that works on a local authority basis is in place.  </p><p> Unemployment blackspots were mentioned.  There is definitely an issue in that regard and such approaches tend to be delivered through national programmes, such as the social inclusion and community activation programme.  That programme is managed by the Department on a national basis but it is contracted locally.  The local contract holder for Limerick, if memory serves, is the Limerick local community development committee.  A number of millions of euro are provided annually for the programme.  A directly elected mayor could have significant input into shaping how that is spent.  He or she would not necessarily have an input on a contract because that is awarded under a national tender and procurement process, but the mayor could have an input on its operation within the city and county boundaries.  Ms Ryan is correct.  The implementation advisory group highlighted some fairly straightforward areas where this could be done quickly.  Some of these matters go back to the late 1980s, including the task force on the integration of local government and local development services.  That was more than 23 years ago and we are still having a similar conversation.  The same proposals are being put forward but it is not being done.</p><p> I am not sure if that is an answer to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's question but there are areas in which it could be delivered fairly straightforwardly.  That is something at which the committee could look.  Where is control vested locally?  The education and training board could provide access to further education and skills development, which fits into the thinking around project Limerick industrial policy.  There is definitely space for a much more integrated approach.</p></speech>

We must remember that 15,000 or 20,000 social and affordable houses are to be built in Limerick in the next ten or 15 years.  That should be done by the local authority.  No one should have to go to Dublin to try to get funding to build a swimming pool, museum, park or new school.  This is an opportunity to get things fixed and to properly run pilot schemes in cities with delegated authority across all the functions.</p> <p>  I would add the health sector to what Professor &Oacute; Broin said.  Limerick has a health structure that aligns closely with the county budget.  The report to which Ms Ryan referred gives the answer to a lot of the other questions.  The Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, is supposed to provide the money to invest in infrastructure across Ireland.  The mayor should be a key driver of how that money is spent in Limerick.  He or she should not have influence over how all of it is spent, but the mayor should have an influence over the portion that is going to be spent in Limerick.  That should include enterprise support and business support.  The plans for what should happen in Limerick will sometimes be different to what should happen in other parts of the country because local needs are different.  We saw during the pandemic that a one-size-fits-all approach does not necessarily work well.</p></speech>

We should look for whatever powers it is possible to get.  This is a way to get things done in the future.  Most members have been councillors and have ideas about where problems lie.  Measures that are introduced in this Bill might give a chance to reform local government more generally.</p></speech>

I will hand over to our guests and ask each of them to pick the top three changes they would like to see in the Bill.  I ask them also to talk about the revenue-raising powers they would like to see.  How, through this Bill, would our guests try to tackle the problem that local government in general does not have the ability to raise revenue?  I want to focus on that.  I ask them to mention three issues they would prioritise in making changes to this Bill.  What revenue-raising powers would they like to see available to a mayor of Limerick?</p></speech>

I would interested in seeing clarity in the regional planning process, particularly around economics and spatial strategy.  I would like clarity on the metropolitan area spatial plan.  There is quite a bit of work to be done in that regard.  This is what the future of Limerick looks like.  This is the long-term planning framework.  Mr. Moran highlighted the relationship between the regional assembly and the mayor.  More work can be done in that regard.</p> <p>  Another issue relates to the power of councillors.  Clarity is required on the relationship between the chair of SPCs and the mayor.  If we think of the council as the corporate policymaking system, what is the relationship there?  At the moment the chairs of the SPCs have influence, if not power, and can co-ordinate.  The mayor is a new actor in that ecosystem so clarity on the roles of the mayor and the chairs of these committees is required, not just through the corporate policy group, which appears to be designed to help hold the mayor to account, but in terms of policymaking and councillors' role in policymaking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.748" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021062900002#H01000"><p>I thank the Senator for the question.  If I were to point to one measure I would like the directly elected mayor to have the ability to control, it would be in the area of transport, which is important across the city and county.  That could make a considerable difference to the lives of citizens, encourage greater and healthier habits through the provision of cycle lanes and better walking and cycling infrastructure.  We currently have a low uptake of public transport in Limerick so it would be fantastic if the mayor had the ability to determine and make changes to routes and be agile on locally based decisions.  The caveat is that transport needs to be properly funded by central government.</p> <p>  On revenue raising, the Indecon report we published two weeks ago called for an overall review of local authority funding.  We are calling for that because a tension is becoming apparent between how local authorities are currently funded through rates and car parking revenue, to a certain extent, and the changes that need to happen in converting properties that are currently in commercial use or that were previously rated commercially and are now in disuse.  Those properties need to be converted into productive homes for people.  To do that, there must be a desire to make urban centres more liveable and take out much of the on-street parking that is an important revenue stream for local authorities.  There is greater work to be done in that regard.</p></speech>

I will add a new angle to our conversation that relates to the governance of how the mayor delivers.  Let us assume for the moment that the mayor is given more power and a bigger budget.  He then gets a programme of local government.</p></speech>

In my report, I referred to "the mayor".</p><p>The mayor gets the programme for office and there is a decision to implement it.  The public thinks it will be implemented but the mayor could be left with no human resources function.  That person has an executive function but does not control human resources or the distribution of resources within the local authority.  That person does not even control the decisions about who the director general should be or whether the person in that role stays if underperforming.  That is a gap in existing terms.  There was a shift from the 2019 promise, when the mayor would have had a particularly political function as chair of the council, to a more executive function.  That demands a rethink of the human resources governance issues from what was recommended.</p><p> On funding, I have always been an advocate of greater local property tax.  To me, this relates to taxation without representation.  We are giving Limerick more representation and the mayor and councillors should have more ability to do taxation, perhaps slightly differently to the way it is done on a national basis.</p></speech>

Currently, the mayoral function is that of an advocate for Limerick rather than somebody with the strong executive function we had intended him or her to have.</p> <p>  On the funding, the committee might make bold recommendations and try out new ideas on Limerick that it may, in future, want tried in the rest of Ireland.  For example, why not try to introduce a land value tax, although perhaps not in this Bill?  It could be introduced in Limerick to start with and we could see how it works before it could be tried out elsewhere.  It would at least give the mayor a revenue stream allowing him or her to govern in a way we anticipated.</p></speech>

I have given every party approximately seven minutes so I will have to pull back slots to five minutes if we are going to get through in time.  It is not possible to ask a question and have four people respond to it within five minutes so I ask members to be direct with questions to a particular witness.  That would be helpful.</p></speech>

This is an exciting time for Waterford and I stated at a previous committee meeting that I was disappointed that my county narrowly voted against the measure in 2019 when it came before the electorate.  I hope we will get the opportunity to revisit that.  There is no doubt the new mayor will be a voice for both city and county.  Deputy O'Donoghue raised some concerns in that regard.  I support the comments from Ms Ryan about the liveable city and it is something I am pushing in Waterford.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on the position of deputy pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir?  It is not in the legislation but if the pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir is unavailable or sick for a meeting, there is no position for a deputy and the provision is that it would be elected from the floor of the council meeting.  It would be a sensible measure to have an official deputy so what is the opinion of the witnesses on that?</p></speech>

I thank Senator Cummins for the question.  We felt it was important to have the position of pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir and not limit it to the title of deputy mayor.  Having said that, we are open to suggestions from this group as to how that might best be handled.  The responsibilities of the pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir have been imported from the report but they were to balance the envisaged powers for the mayor.  I point to that disconnect.</p></speech>

It could be very difficult for a mayor who does not necessarily have that kind of foot in the council to get things through.  The mayor and pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir could become allies; ideally, that would happen rather than checks on each other.</p> <p>  On the technical issue, I assume that is something that could be done within the council and it could ensure there would always be a chair of a council meeting.  I hope that would not be a major issue.</p></speech>

Anybody running for mayor would need a clearly articulated policy or set of policies for the city and county.  What tends to happen in local elections is that the person running for election does not run for a city or county-wide election and he or she has a local focus.  What we expect to see is candidates for directly elected mayor articulating coherent or at least a vision for Limerick city and county.  That has not been the case to date.</p></speech>

When the mayor is elected, he or she will clearly have a manifesto and mandate to deliver a particular programme for Limerick.  I had assumed the checks and balances, so to speak, with the council for that would be reflected in the annual budget that the mayor must have approved.  There is a provision that speaks about the programme for local government and it seems a little ambiguous.  In one case it seems to suggest there must be approval of the programme by the council but, in another, it suggests the mayor must listen to what the council is saying but it would not have a veto.  I was a bit worried about the approval concept at the early stage of a mayoral election and term.  As is now the case, a mayor could be elected mid-term or off-term under a very different mandate from the people of Limerick than the council's.</p> <p>  I gave an example of a national policy that the mayor wanted to follow but the local officials or council felt it should object to it.  Basically, if it could hold up things, the council could prevent the agreement on the programme and it is not clear how it would continue.  We need to give the mayor some sort of ability to drive on with the programme that should, of course, reflect his or her elected mandate, having taken due consideration of the views of the council.  When the budget comes, that is when the rubber hits the road and the council can impose its democratically elected will.</p></speech>

It is for Professor &Oacute; Broin and Dr. O'Malley.  They said in their opening statement that "The [directly-elected mayor] will have relatively few resources on which to depend".  They talked of the staff and one being appointed.  What additional resources, therefore, do Professor &Oacute; Broin and Dr. O'Malley think the office of mayor would need?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.766" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eoin O'Malley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021062900002#K00200"><p>Four of the five staff given to a mayor are going to be chosen for him or her by the director general.  That is not necessarily a good thing.  A director general who wants to weaken a mayor in some way would be able to hand over four duds, perhaps.  A fifth person is in the gift of the mayor.  Five staff does not seem like a large number if one looks at the various different roles we are asking the mayor to carry out.  It might make more sense to give the mayor's office more control over staffing rather than just depending on what the director general chooses to give him or her.</p></speech>

We must get the governance right between the director general, who we might call the Secretary General, and the mayor, who we might call the Minister, so that it is clear the political system appoints the director general and can hold him or her responsible for delivery.  We do not need to build two different silos of resources.  As would happen in any Department, the director general uses all the resources of the council to drive the same programme as the mayor.  Thus it is important there is a total alignment of interests there rather than, as Dr. O'Malley said, people working against each other.</p></speech>

On the staff allocation to the mayor, although Mr. Moran said it would be designated by the director general, should that staff be designated in some way as having planning, transport, economic or project management backgrounds, or something in that area?  I understand the mayor will need a lot of administrative staff as well but for those main advisers, should there be some stipulations on the type of adviser and not necessarily about who suggests their appointment?</p></speech>

One could probably look at the model of special advisers to Ministers and their unestablished civil servants.  An aspiration could be that they have some sort of technical or policy expertise to bring to the mayor.  I still think the issue is about the mayor having control over who they appoint.  Dr. O'Malley is right about the mayor being able to appoint all five rather than just one.  They can appoint a team of advisers who may bring different skill sets to directly advise the mayor.  That might be the way to do it.</p></speech>

Every time a power is added to the office of mayor, there must be an acknowledgement that either the mayor's office or Limerick City and County Council's staff headcount must represent the transfer of power, and ergo functions, from central government to a local environment, and be staffed accordingly.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Ryan, Mr. Moran and Professor &Oacute; Broin.  I appreciate their contributions.  I commend them on their ambitions for Limerick and for the people they are representing.  It is great.  They are articulating a real ambition.  I am a big fan of strong local government.  I agree with our guests that we do not have strong local government.  I have soldiered in the trenches for more than 15 years so I can say that with authority.  I also believe this is an important time not just for Limerick but also for local government and it is important we get this right.  The ambition our guests have articulated is balanced with the caution and concern they are expressing.  We do not have the benefit of Mr. Moran's report.  We will read it once we receive it and I thank him for submitting that, and thank others for their opening statements.</p> <p>  I have just looked up the implementation advisory group's report.  The group certainly did its work as there are 156 pages.  My first question, for Ms Ryan, is whether the Department ever came back and gave the implementation group feedback on that report?, Did the Department meet the group and feed back on it?  How did that work out?</p></speech>

There was excellent interaction between departmental officials and the group.  We did not want to be going into territory that just did not have any possibility of being delivered.  We did not want to waste everybody's time on that.  There was a lot of consideration given to making recommendations that were ambitious but deliverable.  Certainly the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, appreciated that ambition and he has a vision for delivering local government reform.  We met him in Limerick last week and he reassured us it is still his intention to try to bring forward as many of the other recommendations.  He told us that 38 in total have been brought wholly into the Bill.  A further ten are partially reflected in the Bill.  However, I believe we had 67 in total, so there is a number that have not been addressed.  I acknowledge what we are talking about is change and change is difficult, but Limerick has put its hand up and said we are up for it.  We would appreciate the support of the committee and of the officials in the various Departments that need to co-operate in making that happen for us.</p> <p>  I look forward to the people of County Waterford joining us in the future.  The mayor in Limerick would love to have a mayor in Waterford to have as a colleague and a buddy, and to reflect on all the commonalities and issues that face our city regions in trying to accommodate the population growth projections under Project Ireland 2040.  We want to get this right, not just for ourselves but for everyone.</p></speech>

However, there are two tension at play here.  There is the tension between central government and local government and then there is a geographical one between what happens in Dublin and what happens in the regions, and how to accommodate those.  People are often afraid of change, as I said in my submission.  Fundamentally, the people of Limerick were promised something and it is now up to the legislators, not the unelected officials, to take cognisance of that.  I commend Mr. Tim O'Connor's report.  It is a balanced way of looking at it.  Anything in that report that is not in the legislation should be questioned seriously.  We should ask why it is being omitted and not put through now.  It is the responsibility of the democratically-elected representatives of the Oireachtas to drive that through and not just say "No" because as the Senator said, it can then be applied as a model that is well road-tested for Waterford, Cork, Galway, Dublin and indeed probably other counties as well.</p></speech>

My fear is that if we do not get it right for Limerick, not only will that then be a failure for Limerick but also for other cities into the future and a failure by us all to strengthen local government and local democracy.

I did not give the witnesses much of an opportunity to answer on the previous occasion so I am going to make this brief to give them all a minute each if I can.  A system that was being used in the local authority was under the general municipal allocation system.  It ensured each individual district within the city and county received funding for improvements within their area.</p><p>Do the witnesses see something like that system with the new mayor of Limerick whereby the funds held such as the general municipal allocation could be dispersed into the county and city for the future-proofing of projects?  It  would mean an equal amount of funding to the city and the county.  They would all grow together and support each other going forward.  If it is okay with the chairman I would like each of the witnesses to have a minute to reply.</p></speech>

I believe that we would have to allow the mayor to prioritise projects and prioritise areas of focus within his or her programme for local government, and, consequently, within the delivery of the annual budget.  This is why it is very important that we get the additional means.  This should be seen as additional benefit for the Limerick city and county, and certainly not in any way a threat to existing funding, which is rightly allocated and appropriated by existing councils.  I would say  "No", I do not believe it should be apportioned in a blanket manner.  We must use it in a targeted way to drive the greatest impact for the whole of the county.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.783" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eoin O'Malley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021062900002#L00400"><p>I do not know enough about the general municipal allocation to comment on that.  The Deputy said that he is concerned about the balance of power between city and the county.  It is unlikely that we would have 21 city councillors ganging up against 19 county councillors.  That is probably not the way politics works.  Obviously, things do work on a geographical basis but I am not sure that they would go so strongly against party lines that the Oireachtas should be concerned that the county would not be listened to in this.  The numbers of people living in the city is somewhat greater than in the county and the council will want to look to satisfy the city voters.  I do not believe that any mayor would get elected who ignores the county voters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.784" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John A.

What I find so exciting about this opportunity is that Limerick had been starting to call itself the city and county. This now means that we can drop the &quot;city and county&quot; and just call it Limerick council.  With the mayor of Limerick, it becomes just one Limerick.  There are 75,000 voters in city and county so it would be impossible for a county candidate to ignore the city and <i>vice versa</i>. The new development plan shows the real power when it is all working together in a polycentric way with neighbourhoods collaborating with each other in doing things.  The programme for local government will set out the vision for the whole of Limerick and the mayor will have to deliver on it.  Then the local councillors, who know best what is needed in their particular areas, will be able to negotiate and explain their case to the mayor.  It then becomes no longer a negotiation with an unelected CEO but a negotiation with a person who also has constituents in those various areas that have been talked about.<br/><br/>Again, it is important to note that the scale is totally different.  If we get this right we are talking about moving a local government's spending from a couple of hundred million euro, for example &euro;200 million on water pipes, waste management and so on, into a potential spend of billions of euro over the course to 2040.  If it is done well, this has the potential to transform the way the entire county works, including the standard of amenities.</p></speech>

It is about leadership and the mayor being in position to actually drive investment on a Limerick-wide basis rather than on a municipal basis.  The advisory group made a recommendation about an annual directly elected mayor block grant.  This would be a substantial power that would definitely benefit the mayor.</p></speech>

If not, I will take the second Green Party slot because it is an area I have a particular interest in.  It is a fantastic opportunity for Limerick and I commend the people of Limerick on taking the opportunity.  As other members said, it needs to be done right.  There will perhaps be an extra-long period for a mayor because he or she will be coming in halfway through a local election cycle.  Limerick may end up with the mayor for much longer than the five years; it may be for seven years, depending on when the election would be.</p> <p>  Having listened to the commentary, and given everything that was suggested in 2019 and what was put into the Bill, it seems to be quite a disappointment.  The committee has only had engagement with the Department so far.  We have not yet had engagement with people from Limerick, or with Oireachtas Members or councillors from Limerick.  We have written to councillors looking for submissions.  With a well-funded mayor with real powers in all of the areas we have talked about beyond planning, transport and economic matters and into the areas of education, industry and business, do the witnesses believe it would be quite challenging for Oireachtas Members in that location to have a person in that mayor's position as well?

If it is done well, the Limerick-based Members of the Oireachtas will be freed up to deal with more national issues as a result, which is what our national Parliament should be doing, and look at the policies that apply across the State and have the kinds of debates we are having now, thinking not just about Limerick but about the whole country.  It moves the decisions on the allocation of budgets, the decisions about infrastructure, liveability, housing and so on down to the Limerick level.  It empowers the councillors in particular to play a much more active role with the much more significant level of power and budget that is happening locally.  Then the Oireachtas Members will become not just lobbyists on behalf of little parts of Limerick, for example looking for a swimming pool here and there, but genuinely able to engage at the proper national level of national politics and youth politics. which is so important for the State.</p></speech>

In the UK, for example, some senior politicians are choosing not to remain in the House of Commons and are choosing to run their local cities.  It will give an opportunity for new political leaders to emerge from various different places and for political leaders to exercise their power in places other than just the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and in government.</p></speech>

As a Deputy, I often find that we spend a lot of our time in the basement in Leinster House looking through important legislation on housing, marine, planning, directly elected mayors, and electoral reform.  Often we should be out and around the counties.  It is about trying to fulfil the role that one should as a national legislator.

Maybe not everybody received it and I just want to make that point.  I am not taking it as an insult; perhaps there was just a mistake made along the way.  I cannot confirm whether everybody else received a notification.</p> <p>  I thank the speakers because many positive proposals have been put forward today.  I may have answered Dr. O'Malley wrong earlier when he was speaking about counties Clare and Tipperary.</p><p>I see Limerick as the driver for the region, and that goes back to a point Mr. Moran made about the regional assembly.  While it will drive Limerick, it has to be concerned with the region.  With Shannon Airport and the port both on our doorstep, it is important that there be some inclusivity or connection with it.</p><p> Picking up on two points that were made, Senator Cummins spoke about a deputy speaker or pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir.  That is important.  As for the councillors, who are directly elected, it is important that that position be put in as a recommendation.</p><p> Another issue I picked up on while other speakers were contributing is that housing should be brought under the auspices of the directly elected mayor because local authorities did not build for a long time.  Perhaps there should be a specific housing build policy for each county.  Perhaps one of the witnesses would comment on that.</p><p> Overall, it has been an informative session.  It is an honour that I will be one of only five female mayors to have served from Limerick under the old system, but I welcome and want to embrace the new system that is coming in.</p></speech>

Again, I am not sure whether this needs to reflected in this legislation or just in the greater vision of it, but a mayor of Limerick needs to be able to consider issues such as Shannon Airport, transport to Ennis and the transport infrastructure to Nenagh.  I am not sure that is currently looked at.  Maybe it is looked at only within the Southern Regional Assembly.</p></speech>

That was to reflect that a certain number of those important State-owned assets and key drivers of the regional economy sit outside the boundaries of Limerick county.  There is a recommendation in the overall report that there be a statutory right to be consulted on changes that would impact the people of Limerick.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming along.  As I said at the closing of the previous session we had with the Department, Limerick is such an ideally placed city, being on the western economic corridor and given all the potential we will have with Moneypoint, offshore energy, rail interconnectivity to Waterford and the two deepwater ports.  Having a properly funded mayor with real powers to deal with transport, planning, housing and economic management would be such a success if we were to do it correctly.  If we do it incorrectly, it will make other cities look and say, "We are not doing that."  That would be bad for democracy in this country.  Limerick should be afforded every opportunity to get this right, and we will strongly recommend that in our report.  I will go in the order we opened up with and ask the witnesses to give a one-minute or two-minute wrap-up, beginning with Dr. O'Malley.</p></speech>

Inevitably, some things will work and some will not, but it can be trialled in Limerick and we can see what mistakes might be made along the way and where there may be misallocations of resources.  My suggestion, my advice and my hope is that the committee will be ambitious with this legislation and try to get from the Government as many more powers as it possibly can.</p></speech>

The issue is maybe less a focus on a directly elected mayor because it is there and more of a focus on the transfer of powers to Limerick or to the local government institution.  It is a matter of the devolution agenda as much as a matter of a directly elected mayor agenda, and the more we can focus on that devolution process the better.</p></speech>

That was an engaging session.  I am pleased that the four contributors are almost united in our perspective on what is in front of the committee.  I will come away from this session with the sense that the committee more than understands this and that it is matching our ambition as to what the possibilities and opportunities are for this important local government reform.  I wish the committee well in its work and point it back to the implementation advisory group recommendations, which I hope will be of support to it in the work ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-29a.802" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John A. Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021062900002#M01000"><p>I echo everything that has been said about all this.  This is the opportunity to make a huge change that would apply not just to Limerick but to the whole of the way the country works.  As I said in my statement, we kind of inherited this British system of there being no trust in the local 100 years ago and we have lived with that.  As our population grows and our regional balanced development agenda becomes a reality, it is important we revisit that.  That will not be done unless our Legislature imposes its will for it to be done, representing the fact that it needs democratic accountability.  Limerick says it is up for this.  It would be as good a test pilot as anywhere else I can think of in driving this through.  As Ms Ryan said, I wish the committee the best and happy reading of the implementation report.  Look what has happened.  With a level of detail that was missing and some indications as to what would happen, the Government and the Departments went back to Limerick and asked, "What do you want?"  Tim O'Connor led a huge consultation to get a balanced report that does an awful lot of the work.  It just seemed ludicrous to me, reading the legislation, that we would have another forum to have another year or until 2024 to wait to move the powers and the budget we need to move today.  We have had strong agreement on that.  Now it is a case of just implementing it.  We have had a wait of two and a half years.  It sounds like we will not have an election until next year.  That leaves the committee with more than enough power and, I might mention as a former Secretary General at the Department of Finance, an actual budget in October to implement any of the changes that need to be implemented such as to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, allocations or anything else.  I wish the committee the best.</p></speech>

I thank everybody for their attendance this morning.  They have been very helpful.  We will now proceed to put a report together and we will ensure that a copy of that report goes to them when the committee has agreed it.</p></speech>
