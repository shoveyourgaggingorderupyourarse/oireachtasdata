I am joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee.  He is joined by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.</p><p>The next item on the agenda are the minutes of the meeting.  I want to clear the minutes of the meetings we have had since the beginning of January, namely, the meeting of 17 January, the meeting in private session on the 22 January - those minutes are short - and the meeting of 24 January.  Could we note, agree and publish those?  Agreed.</p><p>Are there any matters arising?  We will come to all the relevant items under the correspondence.  First, I will deal with category A, briefing documents and opening statements in respect of today's meeting.  No. 1898A is dated 29 January and is from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  It provides a number of briefing documents for today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 1898A also concerns documents<b></b>from the Department of Health, dated 29 January 2019, and provides a briefing note for today's meeting.<b></b>We will note and publish that.  The opening statements from both organisations were received very late last night so hard copies are being distributed.  For the record, we will note and publish both of those opening statements and the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement as well.  The former documents came too late last night for circulation but we have them here today and they will be published this morning so people can see them.</p><p>Next, we will deal with category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to previous Committee of Public Account meetings and other items for publishing.  First is No. 1761B, which relates to legal advice in respect to NAMA.  We will deal with that in private session later today.</p><p>No. 1795B is from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 11 December 2018, and it provides a briefing note on the national broadband plan and metropolitan area networks.  We agreed to note and publish the correspondence at our meeting on 17 January 2019.  I suggest we consider the document further in the meetings we will have on broadband.  We have a special meeting coming up which many witnesses will attend.  After that we will have to have a final review with the Department when we get assistance from the other witnesses who have voluntarily agreed to come before the committee.  It is noted and published and we can consider them at the two subsequent meetings.  There is no need to hold it over for today as it will be included at the next meeting.</p><p>No. 1816B is from Mr. Martin Whelan of the National Treasury Management Agency, dated 24 December 2018, and concerns the percentage of ownership by the State of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, in a company to which reference is made.  We do not have the answer to that yet.  We will note and publish the letter and wait for the response we sought.  I hope to have it for next week.  We have concluded that matter but we look forward to receiving the answer to the question we did ask for the next meeting.</p><p>No. 1851B is from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 16 January 2019, and provides detailed follow-up information requested by the committee.  We published this very detailed, comprehensive document at our previous meeting.  We said we could hold it over if somebody wanted to discuss a particular issue.  I am sure there will be much interest in the document, even from outside the Committee of Public Accounts.  I touched on a few issues at the previous meeting but members might wish to raise other matter.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-31a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019013100002#B00500"><p>It is note 3 and it relates to the clean-up of Aughinish, which is under licence to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  I think the Comptroller and Auditor General audits the EPA.  The licences are very important.</p></speech>

The note is on page 8 of the reply.</p></speech>

There is a fairly rigorous regime to ensure that even if a company goes into liquidation or becomes bankrupt that, in theory, money is supposed to be there.  Does that feature in terms of the audit, and making sure that such measures are properly in place or is it a separate process?</p></speech>

We would be more concerned with any costs associated with it or fee income from licence applications.  I have not looked at that recently but I can come back to the Deputy on it if that is helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-31a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019013100002#B00900"><p>Yes, I think it would be helpful because there is an ongoing issue in that location.  I was on a committee in the previous D&aacute;il that addressed the issue.</p></speech>

Is that the issue?</p></speech>

Where is that captured?  Does the Environmental Protection Agency have responsibility for that?</p></speech>

The committee responsible for the environment should probably deal with that.</p></speech>

We can do that as a follow-up to this specifically.</p></speech>

I am looking at the detail on page 8 and I would like guidance on the matter.  Clearly, we do not want extra work if the matter comes under the remit of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The whole document is extraordinary in the sense of the mounted costs for the taxpayer to clean up.  That is certainly an issue for this committee.  Is that not so?  It is about the clean-up.  That is what we are picking up.  It applies to private and public lands.  When would the EPA come before the committee?</p></speech>

There was a major clean-up outside Naas.  Deputy Murphy knows all about that.</p></speech>

A building was on fire for ages and smoke was bellowing into the town.  All the costs of that fell back on the taxpayer.  It was a private entity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-31a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019013100002#C01400"><p>The great concern is that is exactly what will happen here.  We have to be careful.  Representations have been made to us about serious pollution.  One line in the document states that the EPA issues integrated pollution licences, among other documents.  One of the requirements of the licence is that sufficient money is set aside to address any difficulty that may arise.  It is something like an escrow account.  The question is whether that is adequate and who decides on that.  Experts within the EPA or whoever the agency draws in tell the agency what is adequate.  We are here today to discuss a different issue on which we see things are not adequate.  As a first shot, we should look at the EPA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-31a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019013100002#C01500"><p>Do you want to put that on our work programme?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-31a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019013100002#C01700"><p>We will start on that basis because EPA representatives appeared before the committee periodically to deal with the annual financial statements.  Those meetings dealt with governance, enforcement, costs and so on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-31a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019013100002#C01800"><p>The document we got from the Department is welcome.  It provides the information we are seeking, but it is also an education for the taxpayer.  The question of governance comes back to us in terms of Aughinish and landfill sites.  Are the procedures in place sufficient and adequate to prevent problems happening and to save the taxpayer?  That is really what it is about and that is what I would like to see from the EPA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-31a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019013100002#C01900"><p>On that basis, we will add the EPA to our work programme.  We will come to that shortly as part of our work programme.  I addressed this at the previous meeting when I hit on some of those points.  There is great information available and I advise people with an interest in it to examine the document.  I read out all the headings and topics in the letter the last day and I will not repeat them today.</p></speech>

We have dealt with that now and we will put the EPA on our work programme.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence received since the previous meeting is No. 1864 from the private secretary of the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It provides an update on ongoing work being undertaken by the Department to revise procedures regarding local authority land purchases and associated borrowings.  It is a short letter, which states the Department is preparing a circular which will be forwarded to the committee when it has been issued.  There has not been much activity in that area in recent times.</p> <p>  No. 1888 is from the Louth and Meath Education and Training Board dated 22 January 2019.  It provides an update on information requested by the committee with regard to invoice redirection fraud.  The letter states that all the board has recovered today to date is &euro;284.50.  What was the scale of this?  Can anyone remind me of the amount?</p></speech>

This is because we keep following it up.  He states a further update will be provided once the board has a final decision from its insurers regarding the losses incurred.  We will note this correspondence.  We want a reply or update within three months.  We will let the board know that we want an update by the end of April.  We will move on and note that.</p> <p>  No. 1889 is from the Secretary General of Department of Defence and includes information requested by the committee on cases taken under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  I propose we send a copy of this to Senator Craughwell, who raised the matter with the committee.  We will note and publish that and forward it to the Senator.</p> <p>  No. 1892 is from the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We asked the Secretary General to deal with the fragmented nature of funding for local authorities from different Departments.  His reply states that there is no cross-departmental review under way but the matter is being looked at in the broader review of the local property tax being led by the Department of Finance.  He says that once that matter has been concluded and the outcome announced, arrangements will be made for details to be forwarded to the committee.  We have raised the issue, which is tied in with the local property tax review.  The outcome of that process will be made public in due course.  That is all he is telling us.</p> <p>  The second item we requested related to inspections of properties under the housing assistance payment.  The Secretary General is saying that the councils' information technology systems do not adequately record all the HAP inspections carried out.  He explains that prior to HAP being introduced, some local authorities had separate inspection databases that logged inspection related activity.  That would have been for private rented properties.  As a result, local authorities need to disaggregate inspection information relating to HAP properties from their broader inspection databases to enable a single national report to be extracted.  The Department is telling us that it does not have a database on HAP inspections.  The letter goes on to say that the Department is following up the matter with a number of local authorities and will provide the committee with a report in the coming weeks.  We note that we will get a report in March.  It is a shambles.</p></speech>

It is a shambles.  Moreover, we raised the matter at this committee previously.  To my knowledge, the legislation requires that an inspection take place.  If it has not happened in the previous 12 months, it should happen within the first eight months.  The Department has utterly stood down in the implementation of that legislation and has referred to its target of 25%.  The legislation refers to 100%.</p></speech>

The local authority has a responsibility in those circumstances because it is essentially the landlord.  In contrast, when a house is procured under the housing assistance payment, it is the tenant who finds the accommodation.  A certain mindset is at play here with local authorities protecting themselves in case there is liability.  When something is set in law there is a different mindset and it is really obvious.</p> <p>  There is another point.  The Local Government Management Agency has a building on the quays called Local Government House.  It is all for county managers.  The organisation does the design for the software for systems that are rolled out so that each local authority does not have separate software and a collaborative approach each taken.  If there is a collaborative approach, I cannot understand why there is no single system from which we can extract the information that feeds into a general system.</p><p>This is very big money. </p></speech>

Some of the city and county managers will be coming before us soon, as will representatives of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We are not finished with the housing topic yet.  The Deputy is right to keep it in focus.  Furthermore, in relation to HAP we asked for data on the number of individual landlords or their agents in receipt of multiple HAP payments.  The reply states that 40,835 landlords were in receipt of HAP payments-----</p></speech>

There were 24,456 landlords who had one single property while 4,010 had more than one property.  A total of 3,402 landlords had between two and five properties, 308 landlords had between six and ten properties and 300 landlords had in excess of ten properties.  There was one landlord who had 241 properties in the HAP scheme.  We will put that into the mix and will note and publish the correspondence.  We will discuss it further as part of our forthcoming meetings on housing.  Some of the information supplied is incomplete but we acknowledge receipt of the data.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence, No. 1895B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE regarding the transfer of properties to the HSE from religious congregations under the redress scheme.  In terms of the 2002 offers, Mr. Mitchell's letter states that there are still two properties outstanding.  One belongs to the Sacred Heart order in Cappoquin and the other is also in Waterford.  There was an issue in relation to title.  In the latter half of 2008 progress was made with regard to one of the properties and the HSE expects to have the closing documents within the next few months on the other one.  Progress is being made but we will continue to monitor that.  In terms of the 2009 offers, there are two outstanding properties.  One is Bl&aacute;ith&iacute;n on the Gracepark Road.  The HSE is still waiting to hear from the owner's solicitor.  It wrote to the solicitor three months ago but has had no response to date.  We will ask the HSE to follow that up.  The National Rehabilitation Hospital is a big one which the HSE says is complicated.  It will require the establishment of a new trust.  It will be signed over to the HSE but there will be a lease-back arrangement involving a new trust.  That is taking a considerable amount of time and the HSE says that it will take another few months to complete.  We will keep an eye on this until the process is complete.  That is just the HSE element.  Separate progress reports are coming from the Department of Education and Skills intermittently.  We will keep on top of both elements.  We will note and publish the correspondence and keep the issue of those transfers on our agenda until they are all concluded.  Nobody else seems to be following it at this stage.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1897B from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer at the Office of Government Procurement, dated 25 January 2019 providing information requested by the committee regarding the role of the National Development Finance Agency and the Office of Government Procurement in the procurement arrangements for the national paediatric hospital.  We will note and publish this.  There is no substantial or significant information therein, from our point of view.  It states that not everyone has to follow the standard procurement process rules and that exceptions are set out in Circular 33/06.  Regardless of exceptions, however, the contracting body must do all of the procurement work in the proper manner.</p></speech>

It is one thing to say that there is guidance that can be followed in a particular way.  The guidance covers goods, services and works.  The whole idea of setting up an office like this was to secure the best value for money and to ensure that the process involved is fair and robust.  I am not at all clear on the role of the Office of Government Procurement or if there is an institutional gap here.</p></speech>

Mr. Quinn's letter says that a derogation, if agreed, does not approve the approach or strategy of the contracting authority but simply acknowledges that the circumstances are such to warrant a different approach to the usual, standard approach.  It goes on to say that it is a matter for the contracting and sanctioning authorities - with whom we will be meeting shortly - to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the approach with regard to compliance with procurement rules and to ensure that the project procurement is in accordance with the public spending code.  The contracting authority is still fully responsible for everything even if it has a derogation-----</p></speech>

We will write back to the NDFA and ask it to outline the circumstances in which that engagement ended and to explain why it ended.  We will also raise the matter directly with the HSE.  We will ask the executive's representatives who will be with us later today why the HSE ended its engagement with the NDFA.  We will note and publish the correspondence from Mr. Callihane.</p> <p>  The next items are in category C, comprising correspondence from and related to private individuals and other correspondence.  We will discuss these items but will not publish them.  The first is item No. 1860C, a letter of complaint from an individual dated 17 January 2019 concerning the committee's consideration of Vote 1, the President's Establishment.  The individual expresses the view that the timing was deliberate.  We have said already that we will be dealing with Vote 1 in the normal course of events at a forthcoming meeting with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  We will make sure that it is done on a routine basis every year from now on.  Previous Committees of Public Accounts had not looked at the Vote over many years and it came as shock to some when this committee decided to do so.</p><p>The correspondent makes an interesting point, with which I would take issue, which is that this individual has a greater concern now that members of the PAC will use their position to influence European and local elections.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I reject entirely the idea of anybody suggesting to us that we cannot discuss anything in connection with local authorities or involving the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Rural and Community Development, all of which fund local authorities, just because there are local elections coming up, or that we cannot discuss anything related to European affairs or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in regard to its expenditure because there are European elections coming up.  That person will try to close down the Committee of Public Accounts and will probably then say that because there will be an election some time, we should discuss no Department.</p></speech>

We will note it and publish it.  That is my response to the broader point in that I could foresee people trying to continue the debate that started last year that suggested the Committee of Public Accounts should not discuss anything because it might influence something else down the road.  We are not going there.  We will deal with the Vote in the normal course of events.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1865 from the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, in regard to information requested by the committee.  It seems to be more of a constituency query in regard to Laois.  For some reason, it came back through the Committee of Public Accounts rather than through my constituency office.  We will note that and I will deal with it.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1868 from the managing director of the regional Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland in regard to a meeting.  An invitation has issued and we have received confirmation they will attend the meeting when we are dealing with broadband.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1887 from an individual regarding wards of court.  This person has been in contact with the committee over a considerable period.  The matter remains unresolved and members are free to raise the matter.  I propose we note the item and write to the individual explaining that the decisions to be made in regard to wards of court do not fall within the remit of this committee.  The correspondent is watching our debate every week and is fully aware of that.</p> <p>  However, we will come back to the issue we raised with the State Claims Agency.  We got very interesting information that the majority of funding it pays out in regard to major injuries is paid before the award is actually granted in court.  The HSE applies for wardship of court in regard to the individual and sometimes the parents do not understand this as it happens in the final few minutes of protracted court proceedings.  The money is then handed over for the permanent care of that person to those administering the wardship, which comes under the Courts Service.  It might be a policy issue but I do not see why the State Claims Agency should be handing over hundreds of millions to another State body to invest it when the NTMA is meant to be the expert in regard to managing and investing funds.  I know there is an issue of the independence of the courts and that is beyond their remit.  However we will come to that issue of the transfer of funding when we are dealing with the State Claims Agency, which we will be coming back to as part of the medical negligence issue.  Much of this comes out as a result of medical negligence cases.</p> <p>   The next item is No. 1890 from Deputy MacSharry, dated 21 January 2019, regarding canteen services for prison officers.  The Deputy provides information and a reply he has issued to certain people.  Does Deputy MacSharry wish to comment?</p></speech>

The union had engaged in a small media campaign, which seemed to be something of a red herring along the lines that the work here was in some way trying to undermine canteen services available to prison officers.  The email which I had received was sent to the media and followed up with a radio interview with Ocean FM, the content of which was broadly similar to the email sent to me by the union.  I gave a detailed response, which I would like published for the benefit of members, who will see there is no basis to any accusation that we were pulling the figures from the sky or basing it on anything other than the information that was provided in questioning and other documentation that I had in my possession.</p></speech>

We will publish that.  The one remark I would make is that this information clearly outlines the extensive background in regard to the canteen or mess facilities, as they are called.  We asked for that on the day.  As Chairman, I am disappointed because I am satisfied that the witnesses could have provided information to the committee when we asked on the day.</p></speech>

Now, it appears the matter was dealt with by the Labour Relations Commission in 2011 and there are massive negotiations between the union and the Prison Service on the matter.  I feel all of that information was known to the witnesses who were present the last day and it was not made available to us in the public session.  It would have been helpful had they done that.  We have it now, thanks to Deputy MacSharry, and we have written to the committee for a detailed breakdown of information.  It would have been helpful had they given us the information they were aware of on the day, given they knew about it.  We will get a more detailed reply in writing in regard to the mess committee.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might respond at that stage, although he will probably wait to see the reply.  It is an issue the Comptroller and Auditor General is keen on.  We will note and publish that.  When we get the reply, we will come back to it.</p></speech>

From my perspective, it is a certainty we will be asking them all back in again to deal with a number of issues, not just that but other matters to do with governance and oversight.</p></speech>

As the correspondent recognises in his email, this is a policy issue and not within the remit of the committee.  I propose we forward the item.  Members are free to raise the matter outside of the committee if anyone wants to follow it up directly.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1909 from Deputy Alan Kelly, dated 29 January, requesting that the committee invite the acting chief executive officer, CEO, of the HSE to today&rsquo;s meeting.

There are 15 accounts and statements for review this week.  Item No. 41 is the travellers' protection fund and the travel agent and tour operator bond account.</p><p>That is a clear audit opinion.</p><p> The next items are clear audit opinions for the State Examinations Commission, the Institute of Public Administration and the Kerry Education and Training Board.  In the case of the last, there is again non-compliance with national procurement rules and concerns regarding the lack of appropriate contemporary financial and human resources management systems, as well as a potential impact on internal controls.

The charities funds are held in trust for charities or for charitable purposes.  For example, where a charity is folding, there may be surplus funds which can be held for distribution for similar charitable purposes.  The regulator provides an oversight for this.  It is a small fund and is in a wind-down situation.  In the future, the charities fund account will be empty.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a qualified opinion in respect of the costs of retirement benefits only when they become payable.  This does not comply with Financial Reporting Standard 102 which requires financial statements to recognise the full costs of retirement benefit entitlements earned in that period.</p></speech>

There is a wider extent of deviation for hospitals.  They operate a capital income and expenditure account as well as a normal recurrent income and expenditure account.

However, there may be an issue with the availability of the Accounting Officer for the Central Statistics Office due to him being abroad next week on Government business.  We may have to re-arrange that session.  The office said the deputy head could come in but I would prefer if the head came in.  We can come back to the Central Statistics Office another day.</p> <p>  On 14 February, we have a meeting with broadband providers.  On 21 February, we will meet the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board.  On 28 February, we will be back dealing with housing.  We will meet the Irish Council for Social Housing, the approved housing body interim regulatory committee and, in a separate session, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.

There was to be some engagement but there was a court action.  It was the largest company liquidation in the history of the State and a committee of oversight was being sought.  Has there been any movement on this?  I introduced legislation, for which I got into a bit of trouble, to extend the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General to have oversight of IBRC.  A court case was also taken to have oversight.  A significant amount of money is involved.  The Department of Finance has oversight, which is unusual.</p></speech>

That means switching them to aeroplane mode as merely putting them on silent can still interfere with the recording system.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.  We will start by hearing the opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  </p></speech>

Separately, the Minister for Health formally established Children's Health Ireland with effect from 1 January of this year to plan for, and ultimately to operate, the hospital services.  The agency took over this role from the Children's hospital group, which previously operated within the HSE.  It is expected that the hospital buildings will transfer from the board to Children's Health Ireland in due course.</p> <p>  To date, the board has been funded by State grants provided via the Health Service Executive.  In 2017, such funding amounted to &euro;67.2 million.  Total accumulated project costs of the board to end 2017 amounted to &euro;132 million, inclusive of VAT.  This excludes &euro;35.5 million of capital expenditure that was written off in 2013 following a Government decision to change the location of the hospital.</p> <p>  As members are aware, the budget for the development of the hospital has escalated significantly.  In 2014, the Department of Health approved a total budget of &euro;790 million for the board's work.  As of December 2018, the costs expected to be incurred under the board's remit were estimated at &euro;1.433 billion.  However, additional costs will be incurred by other agencies, including Children's Health Ireland, to fully equip and commission the hospital before it can get up and running.</p> <p>  I note that the Department of Health is engaging a firm of consultants to review the causes of the budget cost increases.  Members will be aware that all public capital projects are subject to the provisions of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's public spending code.  This sets out key principles and a framework for the appraisal, planning and management of capital projects.  It includes specification of the respective roles and responsibilities of project contracting authorities, project sponsoring authority and sanctioning authority.  </p> <p>  A core requirement for all capital projects is that they are underpinned by a suitably detailed project appraisal setting out projected capital and running costs and expected benefits and explaining the assumptions underpinning the projections.  This should be capable of being readily updated as planning proceeds and new information about costs and benefits becomes available so that ongoing decision-making is properly informed.  The code may provide a useful context and benchmark for the committee's consideration of the project cost escalation that has occurred in this case.  </p></speech>

I am here in my capacity as Secretary General of the Department of Health and Accounting Officer for the Health Vote.  I am accompanied by Tracey Conroy, assistant secretary, acute hospitals policy division.  While the invitation to me for today specified that it was to assist the committee in its examination of the 2017 financial statements of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, I am aware that the committee also recently requested the development board to provide additional information in advance of this meeting relating to the current position on the children's hospital project.  I will, therefore, also comment with regard to the project overall.</p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is established under the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (Establishment) Order 2007, SI 246 of 2007.  Under the order, the board is charged with keeping all proper and usual accounts and all special accounts as the Minister may from time to time require and to submit an annual financial statement to the Comptroller and Auditor General for an audit report to be carried out in accordance with the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  The board's annual financial statements for 2017 were submitted to the Department on 24 August 2018 following the completion of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit and were laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 25 September 2018 pursuant to section 11 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993. </p> <p>  The board has full statutory responsibility for the design, procurement, build and equipping of the new children's hospital and the outpatient and urgent care centres.  It receives its capital funding for the project from the HSE as the sanctioning body for the new children's hospital programme.  As set out in the 2017 financial statements, costs of &euro;67.2 million were incurred by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in 2017.  Following Government approval of the construction investment decision in April 2017, the main contractor, BAM Building Limited, which had been selected as the preferred bidder through a procurement process overseen by the development board, was contracted in August 2017 to build the new children's hospital and outpatient department, OPD, urgent care centres and instructed to begin phase A - substructure works.  Work began on site in October 2017.  Work was also progressed on the detailed design for phase B.  When Government approved the construction investment decision in April 2017, the capital cost for the delivery of the hospital build project following the evaluation of main construction tenders and selection of preferred contractors was &euro;983 million, of which &euro;916 million was to be met by the Exchequer.  In December 2018, following completion of the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, process, the capital cost for the delivery of the hospital build project now stands at &euro;1.433 billion.  The total of &euro;450 million requires net additional Exchequer funding of &euro;320 million, of which &euro;50 million is VAT, and an additional &euro;130 million in philanthropy funding.</p> <p>  In December 2018, when the Government approved the construction investment to allow phase B of the hospital to be instructed, the Government made very clear its serious concerns at the major escalation in the cost of the project.  Accordingly, the Government has also approved the commissioning of an independent review of the escalation in cost in determining the adjusted contract sum.  This independent review, which was commissioned by the HSE, is under way and will examine the contributory factors and associated responsibilities in order that any potential weaknesses are identified and comprehensively and speedily resolved in the interests of the successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds.  The development board is fully committed to collaborating with this review and to implementing any recommendations arising.  The HSE and the Department will equally fully support the expeditious conduct and implementation of the review.  </p> <p>  In advance of the meeting, I circulated a briefing note prepared by the Department for the Oireachtas Committee on Health earlier this week that sets out the detail of the cost escalation.  At the committee, the Minister and I put on the record our deep unhappiness with the escalation in the cost of the project from &euro;983 million to &euro;1.433 billion.</p><p>As Accounting Officer I take this situation extremely seriously and regret the very significant increase in public funds over that originally committed by the Government based on the business case submitted by the development board.  The Minister also outlined that the Government is resolved that the project should proceed to completion without delay so that, at long last, children in need of specialist paediatric care can access it in a modern and appropriate setting with all the facilities and technology that can support staff to deliver the best outcomes.  I am happy to address any queries committee members may have.</p></speech>

I am joined from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board by Mr. Tom Costello, chairman, Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director, and Mr. Jim Farragher, finance officer.</p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in August 2013 to design, build and equip a new children&rsquo;s hospital.  A planning application was lodged in August 2015 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in April 2016 for the new children&rsquo;s hospital, the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital and related developments, including the children&rsquo;s research and innovation centre and a 53-bed family accommodation unit adjacent to the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  This was a significant milestone for the project.</p> <p>  There were many other significant milestones during 2017, principal of which were as follows.  In April 2017, the definitive business case, including the full project cost, was approved by Government for &euro;983 million.  In May 2017, a foundation stone was cast for the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  In October 2017, the first sod was turned for the 5,000 sq. m. new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre on the grounds of Connolly Hospital.  This new facility will be operational in 2019 and will be followed in 2020 by a second facility at Tallaght Hospital.  In October 2017, the development board, in association with Enterprise Ireland, organised a meet-the-buyer event for the new children&rsquo;s hospital in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham for the more than 200 construction suppliers who attended the event.</p> <p>  The expenditure to date at 31 December 2017 was &euro;67.2 million, and the detail is listed in the documentation supplied to committee members.  The 2017 accounts have been audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As requested by the committee, the draft unaudited expenditure to 31 December 2018 has been provided and is summarised in the documentation provided to the committee.  It totals &euro;129.1 million.</p> <p>  The scope of the project was defined in the HSE approved outline design brief.  This set out the requirements needed to deliver a modern children&rsquo;s hospital that will care for our sick children for future generations.  The board put in place a plan, approved by stakeholders, to appoint a design team, obtain planning permission, clear the 12 acre site at the St. James's Hospital campus, and procure and appoint contractors in a two stage procurement process.  A procurement subgroup, comprising the development board, the HSE and members of the Government construction contracts committee, agreed over a number of months that the most appropriate approach was a two stage procurement process to ensure competitive tendering and cost and programme certainty ahead of any decision to proceed with the main contract works, namely, the Phase B above ground works.  This stage was reached in November 2018.</p> <p>  The costings for the project were developed at three distinct stages in the design process.  These were in February 2014 prior to any design work; in February 2017, based on receipt of tenders for the Phase A works full design and Phase B partially developed design of mid-2016, when we tendered the project; and November 2018, based on fully completed and co-ordinated design.  The February 2014 figure of circa &euro;800 million was an early stage cost estimate prior to the appointment of a design team in August 2014, and used floor areas from the outline design brief and 2013 construction rates.  It is estimated these rates will have virtually doubled by 2022 when the children's hospital will be completed, following a decade of construction tender inflation.  The February 2017 figure was &euro;983 million, which was the approved business case.  The project was tendered on a two stage basis.  The bill of quantities for the first stage was based on a partially developed design.  The second stage included involvement of contractors with designers in finalising the design and confirming the actual quantity of materials.  This included a targeted schedule of &euro;66 million value for money savings.  The November 2018 figure of &euro;1.433 billion is the cost to completion in 2022 based on a completed and fully developed design.  All risks on quantities, programme, omissions, co-ordination and ground conditions are now transferred to contractors.</p> <p>  Construction costs for the children&rsquo;s hospital are now &euro;890 million, an increase of &euro;320 million over the approved 2017 business case.  Seven key construction cost drivers have contributed to the increase of &euro;320 million in construction costs, and are included in the documentation provided to the committee.  The 2017 approved business case construction cost was &euro;570 million, which included targeted value engineering savings of &euro;66 million.  The first cost driver was a reduction in the delivery of the &euro;66 million targeted value engineering savings.  A total of &euro;20 million in savings was delivered but the overall cost was increased by &euro;46 million.  Statutory issues, specifically changes in fire regulations following the Grenfell Tower fire and the requirement of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to add additional sprinklers to the building, contributed to an additional &euro;27 million in costs.  The user engagement process had not fully completed and completing the process added a further &euro;21 million.  At this stage, the cumulative costs from the approved business case had increased from &euro;570 million to &euro;664 million.</p> <p>  The next cost driver was the finalisation of the detail design, including specification, detailing and itemising quantities of all materials in each of the 6,000 rooms.  This added &euro;94 million.  Omissions in tender documents amounted to &euro;20 million.  There was also the impact of an additional nine month construction programme to complete the project in 2022 and, separately, additional costs for preliminaries due to the increase in scope.  Additional claims from the contractors to reflect changes in scope amounted to &euro;22 million.  All of these factors amount to &euro;320 million, bringing the adjusted construction sum to &euro;890 million.</p> <p>  As well as the increase in construction cost of &euro;320 million, there are additional costs of &euro;130 million, as set out in the documentation provided to the committee.  These include costs of &euro;16 million for equipping the urgent care centres and the main children's hospital.  It also includes costs of &euro;53 million for other construction contracts, including for the outpatient centres, decanting and aspergillus, development board costs, design team fees and specialist consultants.  There is also an increase in the risk provision on the main children's hospital of &euro;11 million and VAT of &euro;50 million.  These items total &euro;130 million.  The final project cost is now &euro;1.433 billion, &euro;450 million higher than the figure of &euro;983 million approved by the Government in 2017.</p> <p>  An international benchmarking report, completed by AECOM in October 2018, concludes that the average construction cost per square metre for international hospital projects similar in scale to the national children's hospital is &euro;5,951 per square metre, with a recorded high of &euro;8,000 per square metre.  The average of &euro;5,951 is more than twice the estimated cost of construction in 2013.  Based on the award of the Phase B works, the construction cost of delivering the national children's hospital is &euro;890 million, equating to a cost of &euro;6,500 per square metre for the main hospital.  The equivalent figure for the two outpatient and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital is circa &euro;5,200 per square metre.</p><p>Cost per bed is not an appropriate metric.  It is akin to describing house prices on cost per bedroom and that is why we adopt cost per square metre.  </p><p> Once we became aware of significant additional costs emerging and presented to the board, we set in place a review of alternative options.  Contractually, we did not have to proceed with the phase B main contract works with BAM and we had the option to complete the phase A basement, stop all works and retender the phase B above ground works.  This option, and others, were considered and carefully evaluated.  The eventual outcome was a recommendation by the board, which was accepted by the HSE, the Department of Health and the Government, to proceed with the contract as it offered the best solution commercially and ensured the completion of the children&rsquo;s hospital in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p> Finally, the timeline to deliver the new children's hospital from the appointment of the board in August 2013 to project completion in 2022 is nearly ten years.  It will deliver a fit-for-purpose children&rsquo;s hospital fulfilling all the requirements of the design brief.  The final cost is in line with international benchmark costs for hospitals of a similar scale and complexity.  We are deeply disappointed that costs have increased so significantly and acknowledge the challenges these pose.  We are also mindful of the Government's concerns to ensure the project is indeed delivered now within the agreed time and within the revised budget.</p><p> Our focus now is on ensuring all parties work safely and collaboratively to deliver a hospital of outstanding quality and a project that we will all be proud of which transforms the delivery of paediatric services and provides unsurpassed care for the nation's sick children for generations to come.  We welcome the independent review of the cost escalation.  Any issues identified will be dealt with speedily and comprehensively in the interests of successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds.  I thank members for their attention.  My colleagues and I will be pleased to deal with questions.</p></speech>

Before we start with questions from members, I want to contextualise this matter.  This is an unusual meeting.  I understand the witnesses have been before the Joint Committee on Health three times in the past fortnight.  Those meetings lasted for almost 11 hours, approximately.  We are coming in after that point.  I will clarify some of the key issues.  While some Oireachtas Members, and perhaps some members of the public, will be conscious of some of the discussion at the health committee over those three meetings, many members here and many members of the public may not be aware of what has been said so far.</p> <p>  The gist of the two presentations this morning is to explain the increase in the cost from &euro;983 million up to &euro;1.433 billion.  That is an increase of &euro;450 million based on what was approved by the Cabinet.  In the briefing material the witnesses sent to us and the health committee, however, it is stated that the starting figure was &euro;637 million for the business case.  That business case was made some time before it went to Government.  The witnesses are starting today, however, with a figure of &euro;983 million and not dealing with that additional &euro;346 million.</p></speech>

We are going to ask for a note.  We will not do it now because I am sure the health committee has made requests.  We have started with the price for construction at &euro;637 million.

A sum of &euro;450 million has since been added to that amount.  Mr. Breslin has used the phrase "including .. equipping", which refers to searching out the equipment to make it fit for purpose once there is a handover.  Does that include all computers and IT?</p></speech>

In particular, the HSE is meeting the ICT and electronic health record costs.  That is because it is forming part of a national electronic health record programme.</p></speech>

From the point of view of this committee, confining the session to the construction site costs, underground, above ground and everything, and the figure of &euro;1.433 billion will not be a full discussion of what we are here to talk about.  Mr. Breslin, as Secretary General of the Department of Health, is now telling us there is another &euro;300 million out there that is going to be part of this project.  It is in respect of Children's Health Ireland, previously the Children's Hospital Group, which does the IT.</p> <p>  Has that &euro;300 million gone through the same rigour as the &euro;1.433 billion?  Are we going to be told that &euro;300 million will increase to &euro;500 million?  What other costs, not captured by Children's Health Ireland and the development board, may be needed to get this hospital fully operational?  We feel we are being given bits of information.  The &euro;1.433 billion is only for some of the costs.  We accept that.  This other organisation, however, is also involved.  This is our worry.  Different groups are involved in different aspects of this project and it falls to Mr. Breslin, as the Secretary General, to pull the whole thing together.  Will he give us the full breakdown of the &euro;1.733 billion?  I ask this question because the witnesses have been before the health committee for 11 hours of discussion.  That is good.  </p></speech>

Integration, for Children's Health Ireland to mobilise the move of the three constituent children's hospitals over to the site and to bring the project to completion through operating the projects, staff movement, change management costs and so on, is being funded from revenue and that is &euro;86 million.  For completeness, we have included the cost for the Mater campus of &euro;40 million.  There was money spent on the Mater campus at the start of this project, which is &euro;40 million.

Children's Health Ireland, which was in at the health committee, was able to provide an update on that.  The main movement on that, which we might have at hand, has been around pay increases.

The core of the operating costs will be the amalgamation of the three constituent hospitals, which are now, from 1 January, under Children's Health Ireland.

No detailed design was completed for phase B, which accounts for 90% of the job - a sum of &euro;800 million or &euro;900 million - prior to the award of that contract.  The only specific thing on which contractors could bid was the first 10% of the work, relating to underground works.  Once the contractor had its foot in on the site, it had the contract for phase B, leaving the board with no bargaining position.  It could have thrown the contractor off the site and not proceeded with the project but that would have been a Hobson's choice.  The board has left the taxpayer with a Hobson's choice between proceeding with the project at a ransom price, if the contractor was minded to charge such, or not kicking the contractor off the site and starting again.</p></speech>

I am going through this in such detail because there have been 11 hours of debate on the matter at three Oireachtas committees.

It it is not as though a rough design went out.  When it went out, phase A, which was the basement works, was complete.  In regard to phase B, there was a quantity against the rates of all elements and the quantities were finalised in the design development.  However, there was specification for every element of the job, including doors, windows, cables and so on.  The way two-stage tendering works is that the design is developed for a very complicated process such as this.  At the end of the design phase, one is in a position to progress the project.  We are in a very competitive tendering market and the rates we got in 2016 are now applied to the updated quantities.  In a way, it is a relatively simple mathematical exercise.  The contractor is bound by the rates it bid in 2016.  The opportunity referred to by the Chair does not exist.</p></speech>

I have spent weeks preparing for this meeting and I ask the Chair to note that.  I believe the other members of the committee agree with me.</p> <p>  I have asked to be provided with correspondence on several occasions and parliamentary questions have been tabled in that regard.  I have requested information at meetings over the past number of weeks.  I ask the Secretary General, as the most senior representative before us, to note that getting information has been like pulling teeth.  I sought information from Mr. Costello, Mr. Pollock and others at the health committee two weeks ago but have not been provided with that information. I want it by tomorrow.  The delay is unacceptable.  If it has been provided in the past 24 hours, that is fine.  I ask our guests to look to the transcripts.  I presume information requests are noted and the information then provided.  It has not been provided to me.  For example, I raised issues regarding figures for bed usage in the three hospitals currently and for the past three years.  I have not been provided with that information.  I asked a range of other questions and tabled several parliamentary questions.  Mr. Breslin is aware of my concerns in that regard.  I expect them to be appropriately addressed.</p> <p>  We are operating under time constraints and I want my colleagues to have the opportunity to put questions.  I wanted to get in a second time but that will not be possible.  I ask our guests to provide concise answers.  I do not mean to be curt but this is the situation we are in.</p> <p>  I understand the breakdown given by Mr. Breslin.  I ask that he provide the table to which he referred to all members.  It has been made available to me.  Is Mr. Breslin confident that the entire project including the fit-out and all associated works such as the satellite centres and so on will be completed for less than &euro;2 billion?  Can he guarantee that the project will come in for less than &euro;2 billion?</p></speech>

We have been asked by the Government to carry out a scenario sensitivity analysis on the impact of those exclusions.  That is not complete but it includes inflation of approximately 4% from July 2019.  I do not think that would result in the project cost increasing to over &euro;2 billion but we will complete analysis and advise the Government on exactly what the sensitivity will be.</p></speech>

In the light of from where we have come and given that the fit-out and other aspects of the project have increased the cost to &euro;1.73 billion, as an occasional betting man I do not think the project will come in for less than &euro;2 billion.  The sensitivity analysis is the right thing to do because I do not believe that Mr. Breslin is confident that the project will come in at the current estimate costs but, rather, thinks there will be further associated costs.  There have been so many surprises, some of which I will go through, that have take a long time to come up the line that I believe this project is highly unlikely to come in for less than &euro;2 billion.  Mr. Breslin cannot guarantee that it will.  I am glad that the exercise is being carried out.  However, as we sit here with the public watching on, it is mind-boggling to think that we cannot guarantee that it will come in for less than &euro;2 billion.  Until September last, the Department was officially telling the public that the cost would be &euro;983 million.  Four months later, we cannot guarantee the taxpayer that it will come in for less than &euro;2 billion.</p></speech>

For the public and members of the committee who are not members of the Joint Committee on Health - I am the only person present who is a member of both committees - it is new information that not only do we have a project which is at &euro;1.433 billion, but also that when it is fitted out, it will be &euro;1.7 billion and there is now a process in place to see what the final figure will be.  That is in parallel with an investigation costing half a million to find out how we got here in the first place.  Is that not all accurate. </p></speech>

This is not a traditional project where the claims come in after the contract is awarded.  It has a guaranteed maximum price.  The study we are doing is for things that would not normally be provided for under a contract.  It is an achievement to have a guarantee on the maximum price which means that the contractor cannot come back during the course of building this and say that more cement or more fittings are needed.</p></speech>

The figure will come in at well in excess of &euro;1.7 billion.  I believe that this project will go to the &euro;2 billion mark and I do not hear Mr. Breslin saying it will not.  In fairness, I do not believe he is in a position to do that.  The public has lost confidence in how we as a country administer large projects such as this.  People have given up and do not believe we can deliver such projects at the initially estimated costs.  I say that as a member of the Government that first started and signed off on this project.  There is no way that the Government of the day would have done this if we had known or it had been projected where this would go.</p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Curran.  I apologise for shocking him.  I understand that he has had to do much work over the last months to determine what will be dropped, suspended and profiled.  The word "profiled" is very important.  It means projects that were commencing or going forward where contracts had not been signed now have to move to more distant dates.  One cannot create more money and Mr. Curran has a difficult job because many things have been sucked up by the excessive costs of the children's hospital.  Is that not true?  What projects have ceased, been postponed and, most important, profiled out?  We have announcements relating to a range of strategies, including the national maternity strategy.  Announcements are one thing but where are we with regard to capital investments and projections to 2028?</p></speech>

Why was somebody from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform not involved in this?  Somebody from the Department of Finance with tendering and contract experience was on the steering group.  Given the scale of the project, why was somebody from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform not involved?

There is no way there would be discussion of four possible options like that unless there was deep concern.  I am aware of the &euro;61 million, but I am also aware that there must have been concerns about other issues which brought the figure up to &euro;200 million which Mr. Pollock was aware of in August 2018.  Those were engineering, electrical and similar issues.</p> <p>  According to the minutes of an April 2018 meeting, Mr. Pollock said that the GMP was significantly at risk.  On 25 June 2018, BAM was asked for its response about the impact of delays on the project.  On 27 August, BAM said the delay would be three months.  That is not long ago and we now know that the timelines are a lot longer, which obviously has an impact on the costs.  I am intrigued about the following.  On 22 October, the GMP process was noted as not concluded.  There must have been a nervousness at that stage as to where this was going.  Would that be fair to say?</p></speech>

It is strange that the GMP process had not been concluded.  Mr. Sullivan was so concerned that he said an additional meeting would be needed, according to the minutes, but the next meeting was not until 10 December.  This is quite confusing and I will say the following for the benefit of the pubic.  The development board, of which Mr. Costello is chair, reports into the oversight or steering committee, which was subsequently chaired by Mr. Sullivan, which then reports in to Mr. Breslin on the board at Department level, and then reports to the Minister.  Despite the fact that it is clearly stated, given the concern, that there needed to be an additional meeting, there was no meeting until 10 December.  It is barely mentioned in the minutes of that meeting that the GMP had been concluded and a recommendation gone forward.</p> <p>  What I am trying to find is that, if Mr. Sullivan needed another meeting to go through the recommendations on the GMP and to consider whether to go forward, and we know about all the options, and discussions of other potential options, why that meeting did not take place.</p></speech>

That is at odds with what the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, said in April 2016.  He said it was an all-in figure, inclusive of VAT, add-ons and contingencies.  That is a direct contradiction of what Mr. Breslin's then boss said at that time.</p><p>This was noted this week in the <i>Irish Independent</i>' editorial, in which reference was made to a hobgoblin.

It is quite amazing.  Mr. Breslin referred to table 3 in terms of the comparison of the business case versus the guaranteed maximum price.  The difference there, I think, comes in at 40%.  That is surely a misleading of this committee, or indeed any other committee, when we see that that is quite frankly not the case.</p></speech>

This is simply quite unfathomable to the rest of the public.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to talk to me about the &euro;346 million that was then added on top of the &euro;637 million.  Here we have a public procurement process, a sum of &euro;637 million and, hocus pocus, an immediate add-on of &euro;346 million, this despite the fact that, as I said, in April 2016, on the "Six One" news, the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, said it was &euro;650 million all in, including VAT.  Was the then Minister misled by people here that he was able to go out and say categorically, based on advice from people here, that the cost was &euro;650 million all in?  I ask the witnesses to explain this to me and the people listening to these proceedings.  How can a Minister be able to say that?  He bases that on the advice he gets from the professional people in this room.  Did he mislead the Irish public with the advice he got?  I ask the witnesses to explain that to me.</p></speech>

What generally then happens - and this is not just in Ireland, but also in the UK - is that there is a confrontational approach whereby the contractor does indeed set out to recover from perhaps a very competitive tender in the first instance.  Then one spends three or four years, at the end of which time one realises how much it has cost.</p> <p>  As for deciding on a procurement approach here, then, we spent at least a year looking at what is done internationally and what works best.  At the time there was in government procurement a move towards design-build.  When we took over in 2013 the intention was that the designers would be procured on the basis that the contractor would eventually be expected to do his or her own design based on an exemplar design from the designers.  In that year we spent interrogating the best way to do things, we settled on the fact that design-build in this case, because of its complexity, was not the most appropriate form.  In hindsight this has proven that there would have been no tenders if they were expected to fund the cost of a design.  Indeed, in recent times, both here and in the UK, the whole design-build process, certainly in respect of how it has delivered schools, has been shown to have issues.  In delivering a children's hospital, then, having an employer design was extremely important.  I hope the Deputy can understand this background.</p></speech>

The process of the two-stage bid finished just in November.  At that stage the design was fully complete and co-ordinated and the bill of quantities was worked up based on that completed design, and the contractors have verified certainty around that.  Furthermore, the three main contractors, namely, BAM, Jones Engineering Group and Mercury, in terms of the co-ordination of their efforts, have validated the programme.  As I said, the co-ordination of everything goes into it because it is a very complex project.  At the end of all this we have also now completed the involvement of the user engagement, which had gone on until recently, and also the statutory issue.  There is now certainty around the inputs and matters as we go forward.  As Mr. Pollock said earlier in his statement, we are really disappointed by how it has progressed from &euro;983 million to the current figure, but this is the end of a process which we set out to do five years ago to bring certainty before we started the main contract works.  There is, then, a huge amount of cost to be expended on this project, yet relative to what is spent.  We are in a position that, as we set out on the journey of spending that, we have certainty on the cost and programme.</p><p>On the Deputy's question, a number of projects come to mind.  In the pharmaceutical industry, which is in the private sector, a project in Cruiserath, north Dublin some years ago set out to be &euro;400 million but, at the end of the day, the cost was close to &euro;1 billion.  Recently I was looking at this in terms of what occurred at Battersea Power Station, which is high profile and also in the private sector.  With regard to the refurbishment of that power station, those concerned set out to spend &euro;800 million and now it is targeted at &euro;1.2 billion.</p></speech>

People here have admitted concern and worry.  A review that was initiated will cost a significant amount but officials are explaining everything away by reference to complexity, as if we were not complex creatures and as if the project were not complex.  We are asked to accept the complexity so we can move on but that does not tally.  That is what people find confusing.  In Mr. Costello's previous life with Sisk, would he or the company have accepted a situation where things were spectacularly wrong to the point of going from the business case figure of &euro;637 million, or even &euro;983 million, to nearly &euro;1 billion over that cost?</p></speech>

I will tell the Deputy about an initiative taken by me and the company I worked with in relation to Aviva Stadium.  The bid was on a traditional basis.  There was not a guaranteed maximum price.  This story shows the power of collaborative working.  We had a fantastic relationship and, at the end of the day, the quality of the relationship delivered a high-quality job and the cost was set against a guaranteed maximum price.  A year into the job, however, the FAI and IRFU advised that they were concerned because the costs were growing.  I put in place an initiative with the client that meant we would set a cap and, within three or four months, a guaranteed maximum price.

There was a reference to me making political charges.  There may be a basis in terms of why statements are being made and in terms of what the members of committees and, indeed, the D&aacute;il had been told.  I refer to the fact that our colleague, Deputy Barry Cowen, asked in the D&aacute;il the Minister for Health on 18 September last the budgeted cost of the children's hospital and the costs incurred to date and whether everything was going to be on budget.  He was told it would be.  On 18 September, he specifically asked whether everything was on target.  The Minister answered him.

I am concerned that Mr. Curran is now saying that this project is one of many which are under review.

The Minister may approve something, but a contractual commitment involves the HSE and the supplier entering into a contract.  The first priority is those projects to which we are committed contractually, then we will look at the priorities.  The Minister will be able to tell the HSE what those priorities are and to make sure that the top priorities are delivered.  Even with the &euro;50 million increase for the children's hospital, there is a significant increase in the HSE's capital budget this year.  There is a total increase of &euro;130 million.  We will be looking at all of the priorities-----</p></speech>

All Oireachtas Members representing the south east got a clear commitment on this issue from the Minister for Health.  As Mr. Breslin will be aware, a large demonstration regarding this issue was held on the streets of Waterford as well.  People will be outraged that, when a Minister is telling us that we have the money, Mr. Breslin is telling us that there is still a process to go through before that money is signed off.  It seems to be sleight of hand by somebody.</p></speech>

My point is that we should have been told that.  Mr. Breslin is missing the point.  It is not just this project, but all the others.  We should have been told that was the case, but we were not.  We were told by the Minister for Health that there was no problem and that the money had been signed off.  It seems the money has not been signed off because there is still a process under way.  Had there been a caveat put on the statement that a process was under way and that it had not yet been decided which projects would be cut, delayed or put back, it would at least have been an answer about which we could have had a quarrel.  That is not the information communicated to Oireachtas Members in Waterford and the south east.</p></speech>

I will return to this issue during Leaders' Questions with the T&aacute;naiste because this is a matter for Government to sort out.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-31a.477" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019013100002#R02700"><p>That context was necessary, however long it took.  I am again unhappy with the way in which these figures were presented, and I will explain why.  The February 2017 figure of &euro;983 million includes the &euro;637 million going to the contractors and separate moneys for the other areas which were not covered by the contractors.  This means that the overall cost was &euro;983 million.  Underneath this the figure of &euro;1.433 billion is given, but this is not the total cost.  The total cost is &euro;1.7 billion, which is what should have been presented to us.  The breakdown is now clear to me because we were walked through the difference in the &euro;1.4 billion earlier.  I will not go over that again.</p> <p>  There are two issues.  This is now dependent on &euro;115 million coming from external sources.  Mr. Pollock tells us that he has a strategy regarding philanthropists.  That may or may not work.  If it does not, I imagine the taxpayer will have to foot the bill.  The second issue is how much of the &euro;1.7 billion is going to BAM.  That is a straight question.  I do not need context.  I just need to know how much of the &euro;1.7 billion is going to BAM, because its original bid was for &euro;637 million.</p></speech>

Our 2017 business case was for &euro;983 million.  This was for the elements of the projects for which we are responsible - designing, building, and equipping the hospital.  When we reported on the costs, it was a like-for-like comparison.  When comparing the &euro;983 million with the &euro;1.43 billion, we were reporting on the costs for which we are responsible.</p> <p>  With regard to the tender, there were three tenders in 2016.  These were the main contractor, which was BAM, the mechanical contractor, and the electrical contractor, which will install all of the systems.</p></speech>

As the Cathaoirleach also noted, when looking at the figures, it should be a like-for-like comparison.  The &euro;983 million was the overall cost but the &euro;1.4 billion underneath is not.  The overall cost is closer to &euro;1.7 billion.  I asked a straight question.  Mr. Pollock has answered the question about how he presented the figures.  How much of the &euro;1.7 billion is BAM getting?</p></speech>

Within that are the amounts seen in table 3 of Mr. Breslin's submission to the Oireachtas joint committee.  These figures show that the mechanical contractors, Jones Engineering Group, are being paid &euro;177 million, and the electrical contractor is being paid &euro;157 million.  In addition, there is approximately &euro;6 million for lifts.  If one was to exclude the specialist contractors, my figures suggest that &euro;550 million worth of works remain.  There is a figure of &euro;556 million mentioned, which includes the lifts.  It is actually on the list without me having to do the mathematics.</p></speech>

BAM gave a figure in its tender because this was a bidding process.  The bidding process involved a number of tenderers.  I understand BAM's tender came in well under the other tenders.  I believe it was &euro;130 million lower.  In terms of bottom-line figures and percentages, BAM's tender was for &euro;637 million.  How much more than this will it get in percentage terms?</p></speech>

I accept that the figures are close but they are totally unrelated.  There is a very clear procedure in place, from dealing with the tender at stage one, the rates that were bid in 2016, and reaching a determined figure at the end.  There were rates bid for every element of the contract.  There were rates bid for management costs, in terms of what we call preliminaries.  Those are applied by our independent quantity surveyors, and as always there will be some disagreements and disputes.  Given how the contract was set up, we appointed an independent expert who came in and arbitrated on those issues.  There is actually a very clear process for going from stage one to stage two.</p></speech>

The figure then increased to &euro;650 million and then to &euro;983 million.  The net figure was &euro;916 million in Exchequer funding from that.  Listening to how this has played out, it seems that the detail was only completed last November.  This was not an estimate, but rather a guesstimate; not everything was counted.  Is that how the Department operates its budget on other capital projects?  It did not have the correct numbers and could not put a reliable figure in the budget from the beginning.  It did not have the final figure until last November, when the detail was finalised.</p></speech>

We looked at a number of options, including the option we have chosen.  We considered not instructing the contractor for phase B and re-tendering, and looked at de-scoping the project.  On balance, the Government made the decision to instruct, in order to get the benefits of this children's hospital as quickly as possible and to deliver it in its entirety.</p></speech>

In order to do that, the hospital would have to be redesigned, planning permission would have to be re-applied for, and procurement would have to be sought again.  It would add three years to the life of the project.  Inflation over that period would probably be 40%.  We would, three years later, have to decide whether to award a contract for an inferior hospital at an excess on the cost we currently have.</p></speech>

Motorways, for example, routinely come in on time and on budget.  That happens because they get it right at the beginning in terms of design, the management of the project and the addition of penalties.  There has been a huge amount of learning.  We know that lead authorities, for example, should be those that have experience.  It seems to me that in this case there is a degree of learning on the job.  The estimates were not nailed down at the beginning; we only reached a final figure in November 2018.  Things have been left out.  For instance, An Bord Plean&aacute;la had to insist on a sprinkler system.  I would have thought that a facility with 450 inpatients, vulnerable people, would have insisted on the highest specifications to ensure their safety.</p><p>I am surprised that the board had to insist on that.  The Grenfell fire happened and things were learned from that.  However there were changes in the specifications for hand basins and theatre lights.  It looks as though there was a rough idea of what was to be completed when the guesstimate was arrived at, then things were changed and there were administration errors such as the failure to include VAT on one aspect.  Projects overrun because they are not properly planned or executed and there are failures.</p><p> The Department of Health has a limited budget and there will be knock-on consequences.  What are the institutional gaps?  If the Department was to commence this project again, what could be done to ensure that some accountability or lessons come out of this?</p></speech>

There were sprinklers in the patient areas in the hospital design, that is all the inpatient, day-case wards and so on.  The change related to the outer concourse.  I think that decision was made by the fire officer rather than An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Deputy's point is at the heart of the lessons we must learn on this.  We must use the PwC process to identify precisely where the slippage took place.  From the work done by the development board and the external reviews there are already areas that we can identify.  This includes the control of costs and the quantification of items, the linkage particularly in the mechanical and electrical side and quantity surveying and the development board, and how volumes and omissions are being identified through the design process.  Another aspect is how an early warning system did not pick up that it would have an over all cost impact as quickly as it should.  There are aspects around the approval processes and using some external review of that, such as using milestone reviews on projects.  We are committed to examine every weakness in this process, identify where responsibility lies and also ensure that we put things right, both for this project and for any other project of a similar scale.</p></speech>

Talk about an understatement.  This is very expensive learning-on-the-job exercise.  We need to know where the institutional gaps exist.  We must establish what institutional mechanisms we need to put in place for capital projects, even unique projects such as this, so that it is not a case of someone coming in and learning on the next project such as the national maternity hospital, or another project in health or in a different area.</p></speech>

We did think about that.  We considered that this project was of such as scale that it would challenge the HSE or any existing body because they would not have had experience of delivering a project of this scale and they would find it hard to deliver alongside the rest of the capital programme.  The Government decided to set up the development board to recruit professionals into the development board that had major project experience and to put in place a competency board to oversee it.  Were we facing this situation having used the normal approach to capital projects I have no doubt that we would be saying that we had got it wrong because we did not use people who had experience of major construction and that should have been done.  However in this situation we went out to achieve that.</p></speech>

I am looking back at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 8 October 2015, when Deputy John McGuinness was the Chairman.  Mr. Costello and Mr. Pollock feature prominently at the meeting.  The background was the debacle overseen by the previous board.  Mr. Costello and Mr. Pollock were representing the new board taking over from a transition board.  A board was in place from 2007 to 2013, then there was a transition board and then the current board.  Mr. Costello and Mr. Pollock were asked questions by Deputy Joe Costello about what the new board had learned and what it would do.  The two men here should read the Official Report.  If they did they might provide a different opening statement.  Mr. Pollock provided an opening statement to this meeting today, and Mr. Costello provided one to the Joint Committee on Health.  Mr. Pollock said:</p><blockquote>It was to produce our business case.  Prior to getting approval to appoint the design team in August 2014, we had to have the business case updated to show that we were still operating within the figure of &euro;650 million.</blockquote> <p>Mr. Pollock said that &euro;650 million was the figure in 2015 and he continued saying that &quot;A company, BDO, was appointed to carry out that work.&quot;  On several occasions, the</p><p>witnesses were asked what they had learned.  Mr. Costello said:</p><blockquote>Unfortunately, we cannot rewrite history, but we have to learn and make sure that in every step we take along the way, in respect of any perceived weakness in the decision-making processes during the five years, we ensure this will not happen.  </blockquote> <p>He was clearly aware that he was taking over what I would not call a poisoned chalice but what was a very difficult situation.  He was fully aware that &euro;35 million had been written-off from the previous debacle in relation to the Mater Hospital and some miserable amount like &euro;6 million was saved and carried over.  He was fully aware of all that and was alert to it.  The previous Committee of Public Accounts teased all this out.  Mr. Costello told it that the board would appoint a design team, undertake a stress test and so on.  As well as stress tests and business cases, something must be learned.  The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned a project review at the time.  A project review is usually done when a project is completed but in this case the Committee of Public Accounts agreed that there should be a review of the failure.  Was that carried out?</p></speech>

That was in addition to all the debate on the hospital itself.  There was the McKinsey report, the Dolphin report, and we have had reviews on the move from the Mater Hospital to St. James.  It was red flagged over and over.  Now Mr. Costello and Mr. Pollock are sitting before the committee.  I have looked through their statements to see what they have learned and what they have identified as failures, which is all I am interested in, and to know what happened and how can we prevent it from happening in future.  I have no confidence that they have learned anything.  I do not want to be personal and am doing my best, but it is difficult to read all this material.  We are not experts but our job is to look at governance and accountability.  The cost given to the Committee of Public Accounts in 2015 was &euro;650 million including VAT.  I quote from the Official Report: </p><blockquote>The &euro;650 million is the all-in cost.  It includes VAT, inflation, contingency sums and the project cost.  There are equipping costs and design fees.  There are a whole load of other costs.  </blockquote> <p>We know that there are a whole load of other costs but the figure of &euro;650 million included VAT and contingency.  Now, today, the figure is at &euro;2 billion.  Actually, we will not exaggerate, it is at &euro;1.4-something billion, then &euro;1.7 billion but there is no definitive answer as to whether it will go up to the &euro;2 billion figure.</p></speech>

When our board was appointed and did its first budget in early 2014, we identified that the &euro;650 million would fund the core children's hospital and the two urgent care centres.  Excluded from that, and this was clearly identified, was additional funding which would be required for the third level academic facilities, the school that is part of the children's hospital, the equipping of the hospital - whether it would be procured through capital or through operational expenditure, opex-managed equipment services, the retail and commercial facilities-----</p></speech>

A report in relation to the GMP process will be submitted to DS [Mr. Sullivan] as chair of the CHP and P steering group in advance of the next board meeting which was to be 16 November 2018 but did not take place until 10 December according to the minutes.  It was agreed that an additional meeting of the board steering group will be required to review the report and inform the board.  It was noted there was likely to be a delay in submitting the report from the development board to the chair.  The actions agreed were: the board to advise Mr. Sullivan of any delay in submitting the GMP report and an additional meeting to be arranged of the steering group in advance of the board meeting.</blockquote> <p>You said earlier that that did not happen because time did not allow.

They were priced at &euro;637 million in the tender and have gone to &euro;890 million.  In my opening statement I said there was an additional &euro;130 million of other costs above and beyond the &euro;320 million in construction costs.  There are construction costs of &euro;320 million linked to the BAM contract under way at St. James's Hospital.  There have been a further &euro;130 million in increased costs since the &euro;983 million figure in the business case.  Those costs are set out in my statement and they were late too.

They are set out in the footnote.  One is a change in scope, so if the development board or indeed any of us decided this is a different hospital, we want to make it bigger, that would involve more money.  Another is excess national construction inflation beyond July 2019 and beyond 4%.  If inflation in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 goes above 4%, then the contractor can come back and look for that based on a defined index.  Another is changes in legislation; if the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform increased VAT rates, the overall VAT rate would go up.</p></speech>

I just want to get the information so I can go straight into what I would have thought were the more awkward questions when we come back after the break.  There were a number of sub-committees set up under the development board, such as the internal audit and financial control committees.  Could Mr. Pollock talk me through the process?  We know from the briefing note that in September 2017, the development board identified an additional &euro;61 million.  In late August 2018, the development board briefed the HSE and the Department on developments in the GMP process, that it was taking longer than had been planned, that the costs were trending very significantly over the original costs and the main contractor had just submitted very substantial additional cost claims.  That is when the development board became aware of it.  Would the subcommittees have been aware of it before that?</p></speech>

That could be to the finance committee or the audit and risk committee.  The minutes of those meetings and recommendations of the groups are then brought to the board on a monthly basis.  The board would have been informed in September 2017 of the sprinkler issue.  In June 2018, the board was apprised that packages were starting to be returned with design team assessments.</p></speech>

It had increased by a further &euro;40 million so could go up to &euro;100 million.

I am none the wiser as a result.  It is absolutely shocking that the witnesses did not have the figures to hand.  It seems obvious that we would ask for a breakdown between construction and other costs.  Mr. Breslin was in this room with me yesterday at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  It seemed very clear that the board was put in place based on competency.  Mr. Breslin may correct me if I am wrong.  I do not want to misquote him but I think he said earlier that the development board was set up because the expertise did not exist within the HSE to do this.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting the HSE should know how to do big projects.  I am just saying that is what was decided.  However, we now see that there was absolutely no point in having this board because it did not seem to have delivered on the competency in terms of keeping control of costs or watching how things were being done.  It just seems shocking that a board would be in a position whereby inflation of this magnitude would not be highlighted to the Secretary General at an earlier stage.  Mr. Breslin spoke earlier about where the increases are, why they occurred and why they were not flagged.  PwC is going to find out.  We have talked about early warning systems.  I would argue that the whole point of the board was to avoid this situation arising in the first place.  We have a document listing all of the auditors.</p><p>It listed Mazars, Deloitte and Linesight.  It would be very useful to the committee, in order that we would not have to ask for it continually, if an additional column could be inserted indicating the fees for all these experts and auditing processes.  Despite having all these experts, we have still ended up with a project that will be almost twice the price quoted when it started.</p><p> Is it true to say the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, will be maximum price unless the parties involved say they want to construct an additional building or a new lift, for example?  Is that what we are dealing with?  Can we guarantee today that the price is the price and there shall be no increase unless we ask for something new to be built?</p></speech>

Can the witness guarantee I will not be back here next year having the same conversation about why the price has increased to &euro;3 billion?  Is the GMP really the maximum price?

The first was mentioned by the Deputy, the value engineering.  We did not achieve the &euro;66 million figure but rather &euro;20 million in savings.  The cost therefore went up by &euro;46 million.  There were statutory issues and I come back to the Deputy's comment on the sprinklers.  We were very aware of the need to provide the very best facilities for children in the hospital.  In our fire certificate application to Dublin City Council we exceeded the building regulations.  We put sprinklers on the three floors of the inpatient wards, additional fire escape stairs and wet risers.  We exceeded all the building standards by a considerable margin.  No hospital in Ireland would have sprinklers throughout the hospital.  Equally, when the condition came back to put the system on the remaining four floors - by far the biggest area in the building - we said we would appeal the condition to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The independent inspector was appointed and he adjudicated that we were already in excess of the building regulations and that sprinklers were not a requirement.  It was brought to the board of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which adjudicated by a four to three majority that the additional sprinklers would be a prudent measure.  We had to accept that decision but we had already exceeded the building regulations.  There was the issue of having to put sprinklers into the building and we also saw the tragic loss of life at Grenfell in London, which also had an impact on building standards, specifically insulation and non-combustible materials.</p></speech>

We had to engage about the 6,000 rooms in the building, so we had detailed user engagement around 120 rooms that were typically representative.  One must go through those 6,000 rooms to identify information and communications technology points, for example.  That means we must go through every piece of equipment going into those rooms, including every electrical socket.</p></speech>

The Deputy questioned whether we were changing wash-hand basins, but that was not the case.</p><p>We would have had provisional sums for pendants in the operating theatres and sanitary wear, for example.  They all need to be signed off on from the point of view of infection control.  When we tendered for them, the figures were higher than the provisional sums included in the budget.  That would have contributed to the &euro;20 million in increased costs in respect of user engagement.</p></speech>

I make the observation that I find it hard to believe we have witnesses who have been project managers for this scheme from day one and when we ask them a question, they have to go back to using a pen and paper to make up numbers.  That is unbelievable for professionals in front of the committee.  They knew that they were going to be asked about the spending of taxpayers' money and how it was spent and they are there with pens and paper making up numbers as they go along.

We were given a brief almost six years ago and went through a very structured process for months.  We procured a design team and analysed the best way to procure the contractors.  We were mindful of the fact that, at the end of the day, before we committed to a major spend just one month ago, there should be cost and programme certainty.  We have got to that stage.  I appreciate that the current figure is much higher than we had expected it to be, but we have got to the stage we set out to reach, that there would be cost and programme certainty.</p></speech>

Where is the professionalism if the board only learned about this as the project moved along?  Would they not have been part of the original plan before the board ever sat down to build the hospital?  Would it not have looked at what was involved and what the costs would be, instead of telling us that it only learned about it as the project moved along and in going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  The issue of VAT is simple.  I know that costs increase that and the board could not have predicted all of it before it started, but this is frustrating to say the least.</p></speech>

Members pressed me to give something I could not give.  I cannot give a definitive guarantee because there is an exclusion from the contract which states that if the Minister for Finance increases the rate of VAT, the contractors will be entitled to receive more money.  I cannot give a guarantee in that regard, as I do not make the decisions on whether VAT rates should stay the same or go up or down.  Instead, we make a sensitivity analysis of the impact it would have if the rates were to change.</p></speech>

I know that the witnesses say they have been asked different questions in different ways.  They have attended three meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and are here today.  I would have thought, given that the cost of the project from the Department of Health's point of view is &euro;1.7 billion, of which &euro;1.4 billion is within the Department, with the other &euro;300 million within the other group, that the opening statement made at the first committee meeting the witnesses attended would have included a breakdown, rather than going back over the history of the project.  The figure of &euro;1.7 billion should have been announced at the time and the board should have explained how it was made up and answered questions about it.  I would have thought that would be the most basic piece of information to give the committee and we want to receive it by 2.30 p.m.  I am quite sure somebody could just press a button and get a breakdown of the figure of &euro;1.433 billion.</p></speech>

They are children and vulnerable.  I know about the rooms, wards and floors where the inpatients were located, but there are four other floors through which the children could have to move to get out.  The board appealed the decision to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which quoted the inspector's decision which backed the board's position, but in one appeal there was only a majority decision.  It sounds as if the board did everything in its power to have a full sprinkler system provided in the hospital.  That is the message I got from it.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la told it to provide it, but it is an extra cost.  Did the board fight it all the way to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on financial grounds or because it was thought the sprinklers were a silly idea?</p></speech>

I can understand there are building regulations for offices, hospitals and other buildings, but there is no paediatric hospital in the country to which to compare it.

In hospitals in the United Kingdom the practice is that sprinklers are not provided in hospitals.  Therefore, we had discussions with Dublin City Council's fire department and agreed that we would put in sprinklers in the most vulnerable inpatient wards and that we would have sprinklers on three floors.  We included additional escape stairs.  Therefore, we went beyond what was included in the regulations.  We did not just accept them and say we would do no more.</p></speech>

We are joined by officials from the Department of Health.  Before the suspension, we asked for a breakdown of the &euro;1.7 billion expected cost, as of today, of completing the project.  That is the cost as of today and it will be another issue if further costs arise later.  As of today, the cost is &euro;1.7 billion.  I will read for the record now the breakdown of those costs.  The first item is &euro;14.5 million in decanting costs in relation to the site.  The second item is aspergillus, which is about infection control in the hospital during the course of construction.  That is &euro;5.8 million.  The cost of the main contractor, BAM, is &euro;550 million.  The Jones Group gets &euro;177 million.  Mercury, another contractor, gets &euro;157 million.  There is an extra contractor providing lifts.  Those four items add up to &euro;890 million and represent the main construction costs.  The outpatient and urgent care centres in Tallaght and Connolly hospitals add up to &euro;53.4 million.  That comes to &euro;963.7 million and VAT is &euro;130.1 million.  That gives gross construction costs on the project of &euro;1,093,800,000.</p> <p>  Non-construction costs are as follows.  Equipping the hospital with MRI machines, furniture, scanners, etc., comes to &euro;87.9 million.  Planning and development fees and development levies payable to various local authorities come to &euro;13.6 million.  The design team fees are &euro;71.3 million.  There is a contingency of &euro;51.3 million.  The cost of running the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board Company during the project and its legal and professional fees come to &euro;66.04 million.  These costs add up to &euro;290.1 million.  The gross total, including VAT of &euro;49 million, is &euro;339.1 million.  Added to construction costs of &euro;1,093,800,000, that gives the building cost of &euro;1.433 billion.</p> <p>  We then move to other costs outside of that which are being handled by Children's Health Ireland.  There is a figure of &euro;18 million for the children's research and innovation centre.  Information and communication technology in relation to computers is &euro;97 million.  The children's hospital integration programme is &euro;86 million.  That involves the integration of the children's hospitals in Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght hospitals.  Electronic healthcare records will cost &euro;52 million for the entire project and there is a write-off already paid of approximately &euro;40 million in relation to the Mater Hospital site, which was the original first option but which has not proceeded.  Those costs come to &euro;293 million, giving a grand total as of today of &euro;1.7 billion.</p> <p>  We will endeavour to circulate that list as a matter of urgency.  That was for the record so that people watching can get a breakdown of the figures for now.  Can we agree to note and publish those figures?  Agreed.  Before the break, Deputy Aylward had commenced.  He has a ten minute slot.  We will then move back to the other members in the sequence in which they spoke this morning.</p></speech>

An important context is to understand the nature of paediatric medicine which, above all else, seeks to avoid inappropriate admissions, to keep children at home or to deal with them on a day-case basis.  The child-centred philosophy ensures that a child does not have to stay overnight if that is not necessary.  At the heart of this model of paediatric care that goes into the design of this hospital, as well as its relationship with other paediatric units, is about minimising the number of children who have to go to the hospital and stay overnight.</p></speech>

As evidence of the ambulatory nature of keeping people from being admitted, there would be two urgent care outpatient centres, one in Blanchardstown and another in Tallaght.  The further facilities in the hospital, such as those relating to diagnostics and day cases, will see, for example, a 47% increase in outpatients in the hospital once constructed over the three children&rsquo;s hospitals.  There will be a 26% increase in day cases.  The philosophy is to use the facilities not to have large numbers of children in beds if they do not need to be in them.  Obviously, very sick children have to be admitted.  We have a complement of beds for that.  We have a significant increase of going up to 60 ICU beds.  We have much more specialist intensive beds in the hospital.  We have very much an ambulatory approach to the delivery of care.</p></speech>

First, were we to have closed the three Dublin children&rsquo;s hospitals and have a single children&rsquo;s hospital, we would have an emergency department with 134,000 attendances a year.  Looking around the world, the largest hospital with annual attendances is Cincinnati children's hospital with 92,000 attendances a year.  Attendances of 134,000 would have meant concentrating all of our emergency and urgent care attendances in one single department with an absolutely significant annual attendance.  It would also mean that everybody would have to come to the same place.  The reason for putting the urgent care centres in south-west and north-west Dublin is that these are populations with particularly high percentages of children and young people.  We are bringing services to them.  In the emergency department, 85% plus of children and young people who attend will be discharged home.  Most people who attend urgent care and emergency centres are discharged.  The urgent care centres are designed to see people with suitable conditions who have a local service.  For example, they might have a sprained ankle but they are concerned that it is a break.  They might have a fever, a rash or a tummy pain.  They can be seen in a local centre to them and discharged home.</p> <p>  One of the philosophies behind avoiding admission is trying to deliver services close to people.  As well as the urgent care centre which is supporting the emergency department in the main hospital, we will have outpatient services.  There will be fracture clinics four days a week to support the urgent care centres.</p></speech>

Where else are we going to get it?  My concern is, for example, that primary care centres in Kilkenny will not get funding.  In June, the Minister promised a MRI facility for St. Luke&rsquo;s General Hospital in Kilkenny and that it would be in the 2019 plan.  The same concerns have been raised about the 24-7 cardiac unit in Waterford.  Will all these smaller projects be affected?  Will they be put on the back-burner and not see the light of day for six years because of the children&rsquo;s hospital costs?  Some of these have already applied for planning and are in the pipeline for grant aid.</p></speech>

We will have significant discretionary moneys to move forward, not just on the children&rsquo;s hospital but a range of other projects.  As was explained before the break, the process of concluding that, particularly regarding the 2019 capital plan, is not yet concluded.  Even if I have a great deal of certainty about a project but one that is not contractually committed to, I do not want to go into one by one statements on them because that could turn into a tour of Ireland of all of the projects.  I have to respect the process which has not yet concluded.  There are significant capital resources to move ahead, not just with the children&rsquo;s hospital but a range of other health care infrastructure projects.</p></speech>

Good projects which stand up to scrutiny and have a good rationale will still have an ability to move ahead.  As we do in any year, we look at the cash flows and sometimes things move a little slower than originally planned.  That means other projects can move ahead.</p><p>This will be continually reviewed as we go along. </p></speech>

I think the point that is being made here is that their business is commissioning consultancy work but it is a normal part of their business, as opposed to this kind of change management function that would arise on others.</p></speech>

I will not go back over the individual capital projects because Mr. Breslin has given the rationale why he does not want to do the tour of Ireland, as he described it.  Obviously for some projects to be delivered on time, the design work will have to be done.  Without getting into specific projects, can the hospital groups and local hospitals still press ahead with designs, plans and all of that work, subject to the overall funding for construction being approved or not?</p></speech>

One is, often the design is contractually committed.  Whereas the overall spending on the project might not be a contractual commitment, one would have entered into an arrangement with the design team.  So in that situation one is continuing.</p> <p>  In any event, the design team costs or the design costs, as a percentage of the overall project, can be quite modest.  In that situation one can allow projects to move ahead through that stage without a big impact on capital spending. </p></speech>

I mean that while we are waiting to sign off on the capital funding for all of these projects, one can work ahead and press ahead with the design work and everything that can be done.  Does Mr. Breslin understand what I am saying?</p></speech>

While I think we have arrived at this point with a clear view of what are the costs, it would have been better had we got the breakdown at the very start.  I do not understand why it could not have been provided to us.  I do not want to be unfair but maybe it was a tactic to not provide it to us so we would spend almost all of the morning trying to get figures, which really the Department would have had.  It took us some time to get to a point where we now have the breakdown and can see the difference between the &euro;1.433 billion and the &euro;1.7 billion, as opposed to the &euro;983 million and the &euro;1.26 billion.  Does Mr. Breslin appreciate that the figures would have been much more helpful to us earlier and we would have avoided wasting an awful lot of time, to be quite frank, in asking our questions to get to this point?</p></speech>

I think seeing the increase of &euro;450 million and where that came from, which is what we provided the committee with, is very helpful in understanding what factors have pushed up the cost of the project.</p></speech>

One lesson is that economic appraisals, comparisons and due diligence are important.  At the very start of this process, the Department and the board would have had to consider the design, model, co-location and sites.  Various options were available to the State at different times.  Given that it will now cost &euro;1.7 billion at a minimum, if Mr. Breslin had known five or ten years ago or at the time the decision on the site was being made that the project would cost &euro;1.7 billion, would that have altered the decision-making process?</p></speech>

In my estimation, a key explanatory factor for that was the gap between the preliminary design and the final design.  I would like PwC to interrogate that to determine whether, even though it was a preliminary design and approximate, elements were missed that should have been caught then and how that was flagged.  Should people have expected there to be a difference between stages A and B?  As the difference emerged, what was the early warning system?  It is in that area that the most beneficial examination will lie.  PwC will be able to tell us about the learning to be achieved and any weakness in the project that has been identified.</p></speech>

Everyone wants the national children's hospital.  There have been disputes, but none has been about whether there is a need for it.  There was a complete understanding and acceptance that we would pay for it collectively through taxation, but people hate being taken for fools, and that is exactly how they feel.  They expected the hospital to be delivered within a timeframe and within, or near enough to, budget, and that if it was not delivered within budget, there would be a rational explanation for whatever extras were being costed in, for example.</p> <p>  We have raised a number of issues.  For instance, there was a two-phase tendering process.  While I accept the point made about 2016 and costing, when it came to considering whether to retender for the second phase, which was an option, the committee was told before lunch that doing so could have added two years to the delivery time.  We all understand that it needs to be delivered yesterday, so was that option really considered when the two-phased approach to delivering the hospital in a timely way was adopted?  The option was there in theory, but it was not there in practice if it was going to add two years to the timeline.  Actually, I would like to see where that figure comes from.</p> <p>  There were points of no return.</p><p>One was obviously the point of no return once the decision was made to go with the site.  It then got driven to a point where we were told it was a point of no return.  In the autumn we were at a point of no return in regard to the timeline for delivering it.  Is that two-stage process really a two-stage process, when we are trying to deliver a project within time?  It does not strike me that it is.</p></speech>

One of the things the two-stage process does give is the ability to mobilise onto the site, decant and do the groundworks while still elucidating the final design brief for the above ground works.  There is a time saving in that.  It is also using one call to the market in terms of the tender process, and there is a time saving in that.  Therefore, there are time savings in the two-stage process.  The Deputy is asking the question with the hindsight we have, which is that, in this case, the two-stage process opened up such a gap between the estimates when stage A was conducted and when we now have the final costings that it placed the Government in a position that it had to consider other options because it was so significant.  One of those option was retendering, which would have added to it.  If the two-stage process had worked seamlessly and we had gone from the &euro;893 million and stayed in or around that mark, then it would have saved time and it would have been on budget.</p></speech>

In terms of learning, it strikes me that once this is over, that expertise will be lost and there will be no institutional memory in terms of other projects, not necessarily in the health area but capital projects where we have a big national development plan.  It is essential that not only does the PwC report show where the failings are with this, but also the institutional gaps that need to be identified for other capital projects.</p></speech>

The scale of the country is an issue.  For example, in Canada there is a public sector construction body that constructs major mega-projects.  In this case, Ireland has mega-projects that do not arrive every year.  Somebody works on them over the course of their career but they only work on one.  While it may not be a structural solution, it is a question of designing a solution that sees the learning from major projects moved from that project onto other projects, not just in health, because there are so few of them, but nationally.</p></speech>

We possibly need to have a beefing up of the public sector side in this regard.</p> <p>  I will move on as time is tight.  The witnesses talked about penalty clauses on the contracting side.  Are there penalty clauses on the side of the contractor or contractors?  If so, what are they and how many are there?</p></speech>

I would have said the &euro;6 million was possibly a sum that would be deducted from the costs, if it is something that can be brought forward, rather than adding it to the cost.  Why am I picking that up wrong?</p></speech>

This money was spent and, therefore, it is proper to recognise that it was spent.  The writing off is an accounting exercise where, in capitalising the value and bringing the value forward onto the balance sheet, one is discounting something that actually delivered no benefit, so one leaves that out of it.  Then, the value of the assets that are put in place is brought onto the balance sheet.  That is a summary.</p></speech>

I do not want to take that as a given.  I want to see what it was compared with.  We are hearing it is going to be the second-most expensive hospital in the world.  I want to know what it was benchmarked against.  If the witnesses do not have that information now, will they come back to us with a note so we can see exactly what we are comparing, rather than just accepting that as a given?</p> <p>  There is something I have never understood, although it was described very well in regard to the urgent care centres.  I do not dispute the value of those urgent care centres and the methodology and thinking behind them.  I remember visiting Tallaght University Hospital just before it opened, and it is not a very old hospital.  There was a very good, very well-thought-out section for children in that hospital.  Why was there a need for an extra or new unit there when there was already a purpose-built and designed set of wards for children?  Was it not large enough?  What was the thinking?</p></speech>

In addition, the predicted activity for the emergency department in Tallaght was much less than it is in reality.  When Tallaght opened, it would have been a quieter emergency department than it is now, given it sees some 32,000 to 33,000 children a year, which is virtually the same as the number seen in the emergency department in Crumlin.  Therefore, the emergency department in Tallaght would not accommodate the way we want to deliver the service now or the way it will be delivered in the main hospital and in the Connolly urgent care centre.</p> <p>  The other piece is that part of the children's hospital in Tallaght is the beds, which, of course, are integrated into the main hospital.  What we are delivering with the new build at Tallaght is an urgent care centre that is built and developed the way a modern urgent care centre should be, and similar to the quality and standard in Connolly and the main hospital, as well as an outpatient department that has the right kind of support.</p><p>For example, there will be a large orthopaedic service in the urgent care centre at Tallaght, with a physiotherapy and occupational therapy gym beside it for children who are recovering from injury fractures, but that is currently in the physiotherapy department of the adult hospital in Tallaght.  It is a new project that brings the three children's hospitals together.  Integrating the urgent care and outpatient centre at Tallaght into the adult hospital would have meant that it would not have joined up as part of Children's Health Ireland.</p></speech>

I asked about the rent and I quoted the wrong figure, about which the Comptroller and Auditor General rightly corrected me.  The report makes reference to an office fit-out.  The prices are colossal.  In 2016, the office fit-out was estimated at approximately &euro;594,000.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The building we took over was a shell and core building that had planning permission for a different use.  It comprised only four walls and a ceiling.  We had to fit it out as a normal office and, therefore, we tendered the works and appointed a contractor to carry out the works.</p></speech>

There have been references to the new model of care, where fewer children will be going to hospital.  The damning reality is that fewer children will be going to hospital in other places because there will not be hospitals and projects will be stopped.  I consider that in this context and I always consider it in terms of rent.  Various organisations have appeared before the committee on the issue.  Rent and the fit-out of an office were estimated at more than &euro;500,000 in one year and, the following year, another &euro;100,000 was estimated.  Was there an alternative where money could have been saved rather than spending more than &euro;500,000 on the fit-out of an office?</p></speech>

Having the development board off site of the St. James's campus would have been a problem.  As it is on the fringes of the St. James's site, it has been able to develop linkages with the community and involve it in the project.</p></speech>

PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm, is examining the matter, at a cost of &euro;450,000.

What I have learned from Mr. Costello and Mr. Pollock is that the details of the tender were a bit on the lean side, that they should have been clearer about that and the checks and balances.  That is all I have heard from them on this matter.  I have read the transcript of the proceedings at the heath committee and know all of the questions that were asked.  I have read the 2015 script in which the witnesses were alerted to this difficulty.  I feel sorry for the Department, except that it is the oversight body.

That is the message form all of this.  The public service decided that it was not able for this project, that it was too complex and should be given to the experts.  It set up a board and set itself the job of monitoring the project under the public spending code, with which the board is supposed to comply .  All of the details are set out.  I do not have the time to question the witnesses about all of these issues.  They should be telling us which parts of the public spending code they did not comply with, why they did not do so and what they have learned.  Instead, they are telling us that this is a marvellous project and so on, which is a waste of our time because we already know that.  We all want a new children's hospital, but we want to know how the overrun occurred?  The Department has been left to pick up the pieces.  As I said, this is the private sector working for the public sector.  Do the witnesses disagree with anything I have said?</p></speech>

At the outset, when we were asked to join the board in 2013, the scope of the project was defined through the work about which we talked in the case of the Mater hospital.  In overall terms, we were to build a hospital 125,000 sq. m in size.</p></speech>

In essence, we were asked to deliver a hospital that would be of the order of 125,000 sq. m in size; therefore, what we were to deliver was pretty much defined.  We had to design it in detail but, in essence, at a high level, the clinical needs, bedrooms, etc. had all been defined.  Our job was to put a plan in place.</p></speech>

What changed?  The members of the board were appointed as experts.  They have repeatedly told us and the Joint Committee on Health about their backgrounds and how they are the experts.  They were employed and I gather their money went up during this period.  The money for Mr. Costello or Mr. Pollock went up.  Is that right?</p></speech>

That shows that we are working within the code in place.</p> <p>  I will go back to the past six months when this became obvious in the beginning.  There has been huge and intense work from the board and the executive to interrogate every euro of this.  We put in place a number of reviews.  First of all, the aim was to check where we identified the additional spending, especially for mechanical and electrical spending.  The idea was to ensure that what we had designed was fit for purpose and to ensure that we were not over-designed.  That is relevant for one of the reports and we can talk about it in a while.  We set out to ensure that we got competitive rates in 2016 and to ensure they were applied to the updated quantities and, at the end of the day, to ensure we were paying for what we are getting.  At the end of the day, the quantities have increased, but right now we are paying for what we are getting and we have the benefit of the competitive rates we got in 2016.</p></speech>

The roof of the wards block is curved.  There is a plant room in behind that.  When the quantity surveyor was taking off the quantities - he is a mechanical and electrical surveyor - he understood there was a roof over that.  In fact, it is an external plant.  Given that fact, he did not include the aluminium cladding that is required to wrap duct work that is external.  Given the scale of the job, that was nearly &euro;4 million of an omission.  We have gone through, line by line, every issue like that to understand how this happened.  I am saying this so that the committee understands it.

There have been groups and committees.  We have worked with every specialty area.  They have received drawings and plans.  We have been back to talk to people.  They have been into meetings.  Clinicians were involved in terms of the detailed design.  There has not always been agreement.  Not everything that people asked for was granted.  For example, a certain service may have wanted something in particular, but to have provided that would have compromised another service.  The planning design of the hospital has to take into account how the whole hospital works.  Something that might work for a particular service might in fact compromise future flexibility or adaptability.  We have consulted closely with people.  We have listened to people and met people, but there will be people who will be disappointed that things they wanted and asked for are not in the final design.  That is all I can say about that, but there has been really extensive engagement.</p></speech>

They were not brought to the attention of the Department of Health or the HSE until late August 2018.  However, the head of procurement in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was sitting on the board aware of these escalating costs.  He is on the board to protect the public interest but there was a two month delay from when the board first became aware of escalating costs to when the information was relayed to the Department of Health.  Mr. Quinn is not here to answer but I have a presumption as to why the board made a decision to delay for two months before bringing the information to the knowledge of the Department and the HSE.  The conspiracy theorist in me would ask whether it had anything to do with the reappointment of the board in July 2018.  It became aware in June of escalating costs but it was not brought to anyone's attention until August and they were all reappointed in July.  It is a fair question to ask.</p></speech>

The Deputy has to understand the workings of the organisation in terms of a finance subcommittee and the board itself, the reporting structure upwards and being able to interrogate information before repeating it.  The Deputy will appreciate that as soon as information is received from the professionals or the executive team we do not immediately rush off and state we have a problem.  It is very important to remember that, at the same time, we were progressing with the contractors the definition of the determination of a guaranteed maximum price.  The last thing in the world we wanted to do was to spread information that it was at a particular cost but we were not too sure where it was going and that it might go to a particular figure.  There was a risk of that information becoming broadly known.  It was a very sensitive time-----</p></speech>

It speaks about relevant information being brought in an appropriate timely manner, and I will get to that in a couple of seconds.</p> <p>  In terms of the governance structure, a number of subcommittees were established by the executive board.  There was the finance committee, the procurement subcommittee, the construction subcommittee and the finance subcommittee.  I presume they had a very hands-on approach to procurement, financial controls and the management of the construction project.  With regard to the reporting structure, if the executive board became aware in June 2018, is Mr. Costello stating that none of the subcommittees were aware prior to that?  Was it the executive board that brought information to the attention of the subcommittees or did the subcommittees get the information first and bring it to the attention of the board?</p></speech>

That is in the halfpenny place compared to what we are dealing with now.  When would Mr. Pollock have first become aware of the significant escalation of costs - the difference between the 2017 and 2018 figures - or that there was an issue relating to it?</p></speech>

The design team reports to say that it has now determined the final price for the doors and ceilings so trending is coming through.

What we were seeking was an assurance that everything was tied down in the process and that nothing had got into the process that should not have got in.  The report from PwC will be a more in-depth exercise that examines what weaknesses within the process, if any, existed; how it happened; whether there was any means by which it could have been prevented; and whether there is any learning for the future.  Both reports go over the same ground but one is quite distinct in its focus.  One is trying to quality assure and confirm the outcome of the GMP process while the other is standing back and examining whether anything could have been done differently.</p></speech>

My focus would be on functions, committees and whether those committees worked.  The kind of things one would look for would be situations in which a committee was supposed to operate but did not operate or did not get some information it should have got and did not seek it.  It could also be a case of determining, if an early mistake was made, the point at which the controls that were in place picked up on it.  These are the kind of things one would look for.  I expect that the work PwC has been commissioned to carry out, as reported here, will address some of those points.</p></speech>

I find it very disturbing that the head of procurement, who was on the board, knew about this.  Although Mr. Breslin expects that communication would have been carried out through the normal governance structures, let us call a spade a spade, we know that is not how it works.  He would have been talking to people.  He works in the Department.  He must have mentioned it.  I do not buy the idea that information did not get out.  I am serious concerned if the head of procurement knew about this and the Minister was not informed until August.</p></speech>

I just expressed my concern that the head of procurement in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform knew about this and neither the Minister or Mr. Breslin, who is in charge of writing the cheques, did.  It is really concerning.  He was also chair of the finance sub-committee that reported.  I am going backward to where I intended to go.  Mr. Breslin is the Accounting Officer.  He said that he does not absolve himself and that he takes responsibility.  This is the fourth or fifth time I have been at committee proceedings on this issue with Mr. Breslin.  He never says anything which there is nothing behind.  I understand that he is the Accounting Officer but it seems very clear that he does not think the board was fit for purpose.  Looking at its make-up and the way in which members were supposed to be appointed, it seems highly unusual that it would not include a specialist nurse who works in intensive care or, perhaps, somebody who had worked in Crumlin and seen the horrific conditions there or somebody who had worked in one of the other high-tech hospitals across the world about which we have spoken.  I understand the Minister appointed the board, but its make-up seems to have been a recipe for disaster.  I am very suspicious in respect of the gap between the escalation in costs becoming known and the board being reappointed in July.</p></speech>

Obviously in formulating a board one has to come to a decision as to what the necessary competencies are.  The framing of this board, which goes back to 2013, was based on the skills required to deliver the biggest construction project to be undertaken in the public sector, in light of the experience of the Mater site which did not get through the planning process.  As Dr. Curtis has explained, detailed engagement processes were put in place with the client, the children's hospital group, but the expertise identified for the board were those required to deliver a major construction project - to get it through the planning process properly and to get it designed, procured and so on.</p></speech>

I am getting concerned about these mechanical and electrical subcontractors.  Who is going to fall on this?  We have been guaranteed that the price will not go up unless we bring in a different VAT measure or change the scope, or if inflation in construction exceeds 4%, but if BAM goes bust with this project half-way out of the ground where will we go then?

Perhaps Mr. Costello does not understand.  He says that he is testing to ensure that none of the companies is going to go bust so that we are not left with a half a hospital out of the ground.  I asked when he last tested that and he told me that it was a year ago.  I would argue that liquidity can change very quickly.  We just need to look back to ten years ago in this country to see that.  Mr. Costello obviously used certain ways to test the robustness of the companies.  Two of them went into liquidation early on in the project.  Are the same mechanisms being used to test the liquidity of the company that is now in charge?  I do not think that is a difficult question.</p></speech>

The word "equip" comes up in the list of costs, with a figure of &euro;87.9 million.  Is that to buy or lease equipment?  Who decides that?  A lot of corporations, even in retail and certainly in the HSE, do not own their equipment because the price of having the manpower, or womanpower, to service the equipment is an issue.  They lease the photocopier or the MRI scanner and the contractor services it.  Is that the model or are we buying stuff?  I spent time on the health committee some years ago and I understood that the lease option was preferred from the point of view of long-term costs.  With a lease a company gets a new product when the first is out of date.  Is there another surprise coming down the tracks in relation to this?</p></speech>

Everybody has been fixated on the escalation of the costs but they are only part of the story.  The overall costs are the bigger story.  From the meetings of the health committee to today's meeting, bits have been added on.  There are many excuses for why this happened but, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am more concerned about how we get from where we are today to the completion of the project.  I think this might be looked at to some extent in the review to which I referred.  I would prefer, however, if PricewaterhouseCoopers had been commissioned to examine the &euro;1.7 billion, rather than what has happened in the past four years.  How valid is the figure of &euro;1.7 billion?  The Department has said it cannot confirm that the figure will not go over &euro;2 billion and I know that nobody can answer that.  The real concern of most people, however, is how high this could go.  I would be more concerned to get assurances about what happens between now and the hospital being handed over as this is more relevant.  Mistakes were made and learned from, such as missing things in the preliminary design, but it is more important to know how reliable is the estimate of &euro;1.7 billion.  Can Mr. Breslin comment on that?  The Department should have commissioned a report on that.</p></speech>

With such a critical project, one would almost expect that there should have been a hotline if there was going to be a problem.  It was the biggest project in the Department of Health and the flow seemed to be very slow.  There was a reference to a response to a parliamentary question that the Department prepared and the Minister put on the record.  The Department was not over-budget but it knew there was a problem.  Perhaps there was not complete candour.  The Department knew well there was a problem but was not saying there was a problem, and its reason for not acknowledging it was that it did not know its extent.  There should have been a better flow of communication.</p></speech>

The Department almost indicated that because it did not know the extent of the problem overall, it decided not to mention it until it could give a figure.  There should have been some indication that there was a potential problem, however.  It would have been relevant given that the Oireachtas was discussing the budget on 14 October or 15 October and the Estimates for the coming year.</p></speech>

The last thing people want is these spanking new facilities not up and running.  That has been the history of extensions to hospitals over the years.  For the public record, what will be the cost of running the operation per year by comparison with that of running the existing children's hospital?  What will the increase be?  Given that everything is to be combined on one campus, and given all the new technology, equipment, heating systems and insulation, some are saying to me there should be a reduction in cost.</p></speech>

I have mentioned some of the increases in capacity for day patients and outpatients.  In total, there will be an increased budget.  It will not all happen in 2022 when we open because are going to scale up, with new centres in Blanchardstown and Tallaght.  Also, within the constituent hospitals, we will see a gradual move towards that higher figure.  I would be happy to supply the Chairman with the current budgets of the three constituent hospitals and also the development budget for this year that we put aside for the Connolly satellite.</p></speech>

I refer to headline figures, a bit like the &euro;1.7 billion, just to give us an understanding.  To my knowledge, the NDFA has a role in advising on all major capital infrastructure projects.  We were involved with it regarding the Mater Hospital site.  It seems to have disappeared.  Why did the delegates not continue to engage it?  What role could it possibly have played?  It is meant to have a role.  What happened?  Why did it disappear off the pitch?</p></speech>

On capital projects like this, there is not a financial advisory role other than for specific cases.  Where there is private finance, like there is with the PPP projects, obviously, the NDFA has a role in managing and being a financial adviser on an ongoing basis.  In this case, there are specific issues on which we needed financial advice, such as the robustness of the tenderers, the design team and the contractors, and also in regard to preparing a business case.</p></speech>

The underestimation associated with the preliminary design seems to be a core issue.  There is an argument not that costs escalated to the extent they did but that, to begin with, the figures given at an earlier stage were incorrect.</p><p>The comment has been made at the Committee of Public Accounts over the decades.  There is often a tendency for public sector projects to go into the system with a low cost to get them approved and they eventually come to the point where they cannot be stopped and the costs escalate.  We can think of many projects.  It is almost the way the system works in a lot of cases.  Does Mr. Breslin understand the criticism?</p></speech>

In the public sector, there is another method of deciding which is the most economically advantageous price.  It means if things go up like the PC sums or extra quantities come into play, a contractor might give the lowest price to do the basic work but when the extra items are factored in, it might not be the most economically advantageous.  Now that the design is completed, if the Department was to rerun the tenders it got, based on the best economically advantageous contract, would the same contractor have got the contract?  Does Mr. Costello understand my question?</p></speech>

Who decided that was the best way to go?  The board could have taken a bit longer and tied it down before it started.  Did the board feel rushed to get on site?  Who made the decision to allow the contractor on site before the detailed design in respect of the overwhelming majority of the contract was completed?  It was an enormous risk and it proved costly.</p></speech>

In NEC contracts in the UK and internationally, two-stage tendering contracts are very similar to what we have done here.  When we talk about changes here and engaging with the Government contracts committee, it was with regard to changes to the standard procurement rules that were in place at the time for public sector projects.  In terms of a model for doing large complex projects internationally, what we are doing here very much aligns with it.  At the time, if we had gone with the traditional model of design build, we would not have got anyone to tender for the job.  We engaged-----</p></speech>

The witnesses have appeared before the Joint Committee on Health.  Perhaps it was looking at the escalation of costs but we were looking at the status of the project and the issue of completion.  I did not get to follow the detailed conversation.  If some of it has been unnecessarily repetitive, I apologise to the witnesses but everyone has a slightly different perspective.  I hope it will bring a bit of clarity.  </p><p> Our main concern at the Committee of Public Accounts is that this major project has gone financially off the rails.  The Government is talking about light rail and broadband plans, which are all in the billions.  If this is the level of governance in the system for capital projects we will be back here despite being told it was a once-off, unique project that could not happen anywhere else.  They could be saying the same about the broadband plan in a few more years.  I worry about the management of capital projects.  This may not be the only one we need to be worried about.</p></speech>

It is supposed to be here for a century.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or some other Government Department will be doing other projects with equivalent expenditure.  That is why I get concerned.  Where is the whole-of-Government learning?  It is no good the Department learning if the guy doing the next project with another Department-----</p></speech>

It is really important.  I also agree with the point made about it being across Government.  Attention is being paid across Government to the delivery of capital projects.  We are very much informed by the work the Comptroller and Auditor General has done.  This has particular features.  Many capital projects within the public sector, as was said earlier, are delivered on time and on budget.  We need to learn from all projects where risks were not managed and apply the learning across the public sector.</p></speech>

I thank those present in the Public Gallery for watching, learning and feeding back into the Committee of Public Accounts.  If they feel we have something to contribute to the process or if they want to come back through the Committee of Public Accounts with an observation, we would be happy to address it down the road.</p> <p>  I thank all our witnesses from the national paediatric hospital development board, the Department of Health and the HSE and the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for their attendance.  This is the witnesses' fourth appearance at an Oireachtas committee in a fortnight.  I thank them for their forbearance.  I am sure they are quite exhausted from coming into the committee rooms but it is such a big project, it was inevitable this was going to happen.  That is all I will say.</p> <p>  Our next meeting will be on Thursday, 7 February 2019 when we will deal with the Appropriation Accounts 2017, Vote 1 - President's Establishment and Vote 2 - Department of the Taoiseach.  The following session will deal with Vote 3 - Office of the Attorney General, Vote 5 - Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and Vote 6 - Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</p></speech>
